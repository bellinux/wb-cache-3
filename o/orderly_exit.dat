25|$|Lufthansa resumed {{flights to}} Berlin on 28 October 1990, {{initially}} operating twelve daily pairs of flights {{on a limited}} number of routes, including Tegel–Cologne, Tegel–Frankfurt and Tegel–London Gatwick. To facilitate the German flag carrier's resumption of services from/to Berlin, it purchased Pan Am's Internal German Services (IGS) division for US$150 million. This included Pan Am's internal German traffic rights as well as its gates and slots at Tegel. This agreement, under which Lufthansa contracted up to seven of Pan Am's Tegel-based Boeing 727-200s operated by that airline's flightdeck and cabin crews to ply its scheduled routes to Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart until mid-1991, also facilitated Pan Am's <b>orderly</b> <b>exit</b> from the internal German air transport market after 40 years' uninterrupted service as European Union (EU) legislation prevented it from participating in the internal air transport market of the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) as a non-EU/EEA headquartered carrier. However, Pan Am continued operating its daily non-stop Tegel–JFK service until Delta Air Lines assumed most of Pan Am's transatlantic scheduled services during 1991. Pan Am Express, which was not included in Pan Am's IGS sale to Lufthansa, continued operating all of its domestic and international regional scheduled routes from Tegel as an independent legal entity until its acquisition by TWA in 1991. Following TWA's takeover of Pan Am Express, the former Pan Am Express Berlin operations were closed. Until December 1994, Lufthansa also contracted Euroberlin to operate some of its internal German flights from its new Tegel base, making use of that airline's gates and slots at Tegel as well.|$|E

40|$|We {{make the}} first attempt in the {{literature}} to empirically investigate the role of financial development {{in the choice of}} exchange rate regimes. Using a binary choice model, we first show that financially less developed countries are more likely to adopt a fixed exchange rate. To further examine the impact of financial development on the conditional probability of exiting from an existing pegged system to a flexible one, we then employ hazard-based duration analysis. We find strong evidence that countries with higher levels of financial development are more likely to exit a pegged system, and, interestingly, financial development only matters to <b>orderly</b> <b>exits</b> but not disorderly exits.

40|$|Using countries'' {{de facto}} {{exchange}} rate regimes during 1985 - 2002, this paper analyzes {{the determinants of}} exits from pegged regimes, where exits involve shifts to more or less flexible regimes, or adjustments within the existing regime. Distinguishing episodes characterized by "exchange market pressure" from <b>orderly</b> <b>exits,</b> the estimated probabilities of alternative exit episodes indicate that crises are preceded by a deterioration of economic conditions. In contrast, <b>orderly</b> <b>exits</b> to less flexible regimes are preceded by long regime duration, a decline in financial liabilities of the banking system, {{and an increase in}} official reserves. Exits to more flexible regimes are associated with both emerging market and other developing countries, and an increase in trade openness and government borrowing from banks. The results are robust to alternative sensitivity analyses and have reasonable predictive performance, confirming that economic and financial conditions and regime duration play important roles in determining the future course of exchange rate regimes.

40|$|This paper {{improves}} {{upon the}} recently developed literature on exits from {{fixed exchange rate}} regimes in three ways: (1) It allows for two indicators for post-exit macroeconomic conditions, {{the change in the}} exchange rate and the change in the output gap; (2) it tests whether the distinction between <b>orderly</b> and disorderly <b>exit</b> is statistically justified, and concludes that it is not; (3) it deals with the sample selection problem. The results, subject to extensive sensitivity analysis, suggest that post-exits are better when depegging occurs in good macroeconomic conditions - an unnatural move for most policymakers - when world interest rates decline and in the presence of capital controls. Importantly, 'good' macroeconomic policies do not seem to help with post-exit performance. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{examines the}} trade and exchange reforms that paved way {{for the implementation of}} the current flexible, market-based exchange rate regime in Ghana. Using descriptive method, the paper argues that Ghana has succeeded in unifying its exchange rates without the inflationary consequences, as Pinto (1988, 1990) predicts, partly because of the strategy used. The strategy involved a gradual, rather than overnight, exit from the rigidly fixed exchange rate regime. It therefore enabled the development of a relatively more liquid and deeper foreign exchange market as well as the development of monetary authorities’ capacity to monitor and supervise the operations of the market. In addition, the IMF/World Bank’s support with foreign exchange (loans and aid) enabled an <b>orderly</b> and gradual <b>exit</b> to a flexible regime in Ghana. The paper then examines the macroeconomic response to the reforms by analysing the trends in some major economic aggregates during the reform process. One major policy lesson from the Ghanaian exchange rate reforms is that unless there is a reliable source of foreign exchange, liberalising trade could cause policy reversals by causing substantial and sudden exchange rate depreciations that are politically risky. ...|$|R

With policy rates close to the zero bound and the economies still on the downslide, major advanced country central banks have had to rely on unconventional measures to stabilize financial conditions and support aggregate demand. The measures have differed considerably in their scope, and have inter alia included broad liquidity provision to financial institutions, purchases of long-term government bonds, and intervention in key credit markets. Taken collectively, they have contributed to the reduction of tail risks following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and to a broad-based improvement in financial conditions.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at the {{identification}} of the factors that influence the conditions of exit from a fixed or intermediate exchange rate regime, to a more flexible arrangement. More specifically, we try to identify the economic variables that exercise a significant influence on the probability of an <b>orderly</b> <b>exit.</b> In order to do this, we employ a binary probit estimation procedure, applied to a large number of developed and emerging economies who have exited from fixed and intermediate exchange rate arrangements since 1980. We find that the significant variables are those representing the growth rate, the evolution of domestic credit, the interest rate, the duration of the initial exchange rate regime and the incidence of exits over the years preceding and following the year during which the exit episode under consideration takes place. These results point strongly towards possible contagion and duration-dependence effects, but also to a strong influence of certain economic fundamentals...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four chapters. The first chapter developed a new warning system for international currency crises. The existing crisis indicators in the literature are essentially static. We {{examine the relationship between}} the foreign reserves dynamics and currency crises. It is shown that rapid reserve depletion is a prominent feature before the collapse of the exchange rate system. Our model provides clear warning signals for policy makers to take actions before the reserves has reached a critical value that heralds the arrival of a full-blown crisis. The second chapter employed a competing risk model to investigate the crisis-driven exit and <b>orderly</b> <b>exit</b> from fixed exchange rate regime for the period 1972 - 2001. It is found that the time spent within a regime is itself a significant determinant of the probability of an exit. Different types of exits exhibit different patterns of duration dependence. Crisis-driven exits have a positive duration dependence pattern while orderly exits show a negative duration dependence pattern, even after controlling for country specific characteristics and unobserved heterogeneity. The Competing Risk model yields several interesting results. It is found that the more open the economy, the lower the likelihood of leaving an exchange rate peg, and that the higher the trade concentration, the lower the probability of an <b>orderly</b> <b>exit.</b> Further, financial openness increases the probability of having an <b>orderly</b> <b>exit.</b> There is also strong evidence that a lower reserve growth rate and the incidence of bank crisis are associated with a higher likelihood of crisis driven exits. The third chapter examines whether the gains from incentive realignment have driven corporations out of the public security market. It is shown that going private transactions are due to the reduction in the diversification gains from the public market. For firms whose managers own most equity and are highly leveraged, they have low incentive gains prior to the public-to-private transaction. Such firms go private because of financial distress and dwindling profitability. These kinds of going-private activities are counter-cyclical. On the other hand, a financially healthy firm with a low managerial ownership has high anticipated incentive gains. The gain from incentive realignment is the dominant factor for these going-private transactions. Such firms go private because of an increase in profitability or an improvement in financial distress. We show that these going-private activities are pro-cyclical. The fourth chapter investigates the sources of economy fluctuations in China since its economic reform in 1978. Under the framework of a standard neoclassical open economy model with time-varying frictions (wedge), we study the relative importance of efficiency, labor, investment and foreign debt wedges on recent business cycles phenomena in China. The business accounting procedure suggests that productivity best explains the behavior of aggregate economic variables in China throughout the 1978 - 2006 periods. Labor wedge {{plays a major role in}} explaining the movement of labor enforcement. Foreign debt wedge and investment wedge primarily affect the composition of output between consumption, investment and trade balance, and have a modest role in explaining the fluctuation of output. Our results imply that the reform on inefficiency factor utilization and labor market rigidity should be a focus of future government policies. He, Qing. Adviser: Tai Leung Chong.

40|$|The {{days when}} secrecy and opacity were the bywords of central banking are gone. The advent of {{inflation}} targeting {{in the early}} 1990 s acted as the catalyst for enhanced transparency and communications {{in the conduct of}} monetary policy. In the wake of the 2007 - 09 global financial crisis, this trend accelerated, resulting in further striking advances in monetary policy and financial stability communications, including markedly the emergence of extraordinary forward guidance as a distinct policy tool under unconventional monetary policies. Drawing on the record to-date at major central banks, as well as on a growing body of related academic literature, this paper reviews the history and effectiveness of central bank communications before and especially since the crisis. It also highlights some of the challenges facing central banks, particularly those that have engaged heavily in unconventional monetary policies to support their economies since the crisis. Steering deftly a course back to normality will depend crucially on their ability to communicate effectively a credible strategy for an <b>orderly</b> <b>exit</b> from such policies.

40|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Bretton-Woods {{increasing}} number of countries has been opting for flexible exchange rate regimes. Exiting from fixed regimes however is not without costs. Regime transitions have often been occurred {{in the midst of a}} crisis which has considerable economic costs in terms of output contraction and exchange rate depreciation. Given the big number of countries having still fixed regimes and financial markets that are fairly close and expected to be liberalized sooner or later, issue of exiting a peg without incurring crisis is a real challenge confronting these countries. The aim of this paper is to determine the conditions under which <b>orderly</b> <b>exit</b> is possible. The paper employs Binary Recursive Tree and standard regression frameworks. Analysis shows that countries with higher output gap and overvalued real exchange rate, among others, are doomed to exit in a disorderly way. Following their exit output collapses and exchange rate depreciates considerably. The ill-managed financial liberalization and macroeconomic stabilization programs seem to lay the seeds of instability. An interesting finding is that the conventional strengths of parametric regression analysis can be dramatically improved by utilizing findings of non-parametric BRT technology.

40|$|In {{responding}} to the global crisis, central banks in several advanced economies ventured beyond traditional monetary policy. A variety of unorthodox measures, including purchases {{of public and private}} assets, have significantly enlarged their balance sheets. As recoveries take hold, focus will increasingly shift from countering the Great Recession to orchestrating an exit and returning to a more normal monetary framework. Five years ago, as its economy recovered from a severe financial crisis, Japan attempted just such an exit. This note revisits the Bank of Japan’s experience and draws potential lessons for managing an <b>orderly</b> <b>exit</b> today, with a focus on technical aspects, practicalities, and communication strategies. While the nature of the assets acquired during the present crisis could pose additional complications, parts of Japan’s arsenalâ€”communication, flexibility, a sufficient set of policy tools and a strategy for using them, safeguards against potential losses, the revival of risk appetite through decisive restructuring of balance sheets, and refinements to the monetary framework upon exitâ€”also could be important this time around.

40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} network of orderly mitotic exit to re-establish a functional interphase nucleus is critical because disordered mitotic exit inevitably leads to genomic instability. In {{contrast to the}} mechanisms of the entrance to mitosis, however, {{little is known about}} what controls the <b>orderly</b> <b>exit</b> from mitosis, particularly in mammalian cells. The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which is composed of Aurora B, INCENP, Borealin and Survivin, {{is one of the most}} widely studied and highly conserved hetero-tetrameric complexes. The CPC orchestrates proper chromosome segregation with cytokinesis by targeting to specific locations at different stages of mitosis. Recent studies reveal that controlling CPC localization and Aurora B kinase activity also serves as a key surveillance mechanism for the orderly mitotic exit. This ensures the reformation of a functional interphase nucleus from condensed mitotic chromosomes by delaying mitotic exit and cytokinetic processes in response to defects in chromosome segregation. In this review, we will summarize the latest insight into {{the molecular}} mechanisms that regulate CPC localization during mitotic exit and discuss how targeting Aurora B activity to different locations at different times impacts executing multiple mitotic exit events in order and recently proposed surveillance mechanisms.

Communication is finally described as a policy option in terms of minimising risk in the context of exit from unconventional monetary policies and of the signalling channel which refers to what the public learns from announcements of unconventional monetary policy operations such as Quantitative Easing.
