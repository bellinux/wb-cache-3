5|$|During the {{big three}} era, Wade has seen his overall {{offensive}} production decrease, a result of sharing the offense with LeBron James and Chris Bosh, but has succeeded at overall shooting a greater percentage despite taking fewer shots and playing more <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
5|$|His career {{features}} {{many examples}} of indiscipline, including on-pitch scuffles with other players. which at times threatened to overshadow his achievements. Jack O'Connor, Kerry's manager in the 2005 All-Ireland final, suggested in his autobiography that Canavan tackled Colm Cooper <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> preventing him getting into a goal-scoring position, a claim backed up by Sunday Tribune journalist, Kieran Shannon.|$|E
5|$|O'Gara {{received}} his first Lions call-up {{for the tour}} to Australia in 2001. He played in four tour games, against Western Australia, NSW Waratahs, NSW Country Districts and ACT Brumbies, scoring 26 points overall. O'Gara was a substitute in the test side that played Australia A. In the game against NSW Waratahs, O'Gara was involved in an <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> incident with Duncan McRae, which resulted in O'Gara needing eight stitches around his eye and McRae being sent off and later banned for seven weeks. After the game, then Lions coach Graham Henry called the match ‘a bad day for rugby’.|$|E
2500|$|The first ODI at {{the ground}} was played between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In the first over of the match, Sri Lankan Chaminda Vaas took 4 wickets, {{including}} a hat-trick with <b>the</b> first three <b>balls</b> of <b>the</b> match, {{the first time this}} had occurred in international cricket. Vaas' wickets were Hannan Sarkar bowled <b>off</b> <b>the</b> first <b>ball,</b> Mohammed Ashraful caught and bowled <b>off</b> <b>the</b> second <b>ball,</b> Ehsanul Haque was caught by Mahela Jayawardene at slip <b>off</b> <b>the</b> third <b>ball,</b> and Sanwar Hossain <b>off</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>ball,</b> making <b>the</b> score 5/4 from 1 over.

5|$|United again {{competed for}} honours in the 1965–66 season, {{finishing}} second to Liverpool {{in the league}} and reaching the semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. It was the club's first season in European competition, and they beat Italian side Torino, East German club SC Leipzig, Spanish club Valencia and Hungarian outfit Újpest, before they were beaten 3–1 by Spanish side Real Zaragoza at Elland Road in a tiebreaker game following a 2–2 aggregate draw. Charlton caused controversy against Valencia after he and defender Vidagany began fighting after Vidagany kicked Charlton in an <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> incident – Charlton never actually struck the Spaniard, who hid behind his teammates.|$|E
5|$|Football {{games last}} {{for a total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by a short break. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E
5|$|In {{gridiron}} football, {{the safety}} (American football) or safety touch (Canadian football) is a scoring play {{that results in}} two points (or, in rare cases, one point) being awarded to the scoring team. Safeties can be scored {{in a number of}} ways, such as when a ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by the offense in their own end zone. After a safety is scored in American football, the ball is kicked off to the team that scored the safety from the 20-yard line; in Canadian football, the scoring team also has the options of taking control of the ball at their own 35-yard line or kicking <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> also at their own 35-yard line. The ability of the scoring team to receive the ball through a kickoff differs from the touchdown and field goal, which require the scoring team to kick the ball off to the scored upon team. Despite being of relatively low point value, safeties can {{have a significant impact on}} the result of games, and Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals, despite being worth a point less, due to the field position and reclaimed possession gained off the safety kick.|$|E

50|$|In polo, a goal is scored if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> passes {{completely}} {{between the}} goal posts, {{regardless of how}} far <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> must be between the goal posts or the imaginary lines extending above the inside edges of <b>the</b> posts.

25|$|Before shooting, teams may dunk <b>the</b> ping pong <b>balls</b> into cups {{of water}} in order to wash <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls.</b> However, {{research}} has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as E. coli. To avoid any illness, many players put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from. In doing so, it removes the possibility of getting sick or drinking any dirt that may transfer from <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into <b>the</b> cup.|$|R
5|$|During the {{following}} possession, Harp changed Jayhawks' defense to a mantoman. The change in defense caused the Tar Heels {{to become more}} active on offense with several screens and movement on offense. The possession resulted in an <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free throw line where he made both shots. Kansas pushed the ball up the court quickly with King, who took an eight-foot shot and Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half court as Kansas shifted back into a 23 zone. The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until the Jayhawks broke from their zone and went into a mantoman again. Kearns made a close quarters shot in the paint. Kansas stepped up their defense {{at the behest of}} coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes. During the period, Kansas made four free throws to cut their deficit to two points, with the score being 1917. The Tar Heels continued to slow the pace and work the ball around to get the open shot, while the Jayhawks would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor shot. This resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas' three before the final two minutes began. In the closing two minutes, the two teams would both score two free throws to bring the score to 2922 in favor of North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|As Jairzinho accelerated, {{the ever}} {{dangerous}} striker Tostão began a sprint up the middle, drawing his defender with him, diverting the Italian defence and making {{more room for}} Jairzinho. Younger players should note the movement <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> by Brazil. Increasingly squeezed inside, Jairzinho's run nevertheless drew the defence {{to him and he}} eased the ball to Pelé in the centre. Always dangerous, Pelé paused and shaped to make a dribble.|$|E
25|$|Moving into {{free space}} {{is one of}} the most {{critical}} skills that football players must develop. Attacking players must move <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into space to give an advance the maximum chance of success. Passes to space are feasible when there is intelligent movement of players to receive the ball and do something constructive with it. Skilled players are able to find seams between defenders, positioning themselves to receive a pass.|$|E
25|$|Another {{main reason}} for the {{difference}} in pace is that in baseball the ball reaches the batter on the full, whereas in cricket the ball is usually bounced off the pitch before reaching the batsman- which does take pace <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> especially on drier dustier pitches. A delivery in cricket that reaches the batsman without bouncing, known as a full toss, is legal {{so long as it}} is below waist high. However, this is usually considered a poor delivery as it is often quite easy to score runs from.|$|E

For 1st and 10 on the Miami 11, Krenzel completed a 6-yard pass to Jenkins which brought up 2nd and 4 on the Miami 5-yard line.

25|$|Bryant {{was leading}} the league in scoring {{through much of the}} first 42 games. With a disappointing 17–25 start to the season, D'Antoni had Bryant became the primary {{facilitator}} on offense and Nash was moved <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and became more of a spot-up shooter. In the next three games, Bryant had at least 10 assists in three wins with a three-game total of 39 assists, the most in his career. He missed a triple double in each game with nine rebounds twice and eight in the other. In two crucial wins in March, he scored at least 40 points and had at least 10 assists in back-to-back games, becoming the first Laker to accomplish the feat since West in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Though NBA.com lists George's height as 6ft 9 in (2.06 m), a December 15, 2011 {{report from}} The Indianapolis Star said that George was 6ft 10 in (2.08 m). He entered the league as a {{shooting}} guard but was later {{moved to the}} small forward position, {{with the emergence of}} Pacers shooting guard Lance Stephenson. Stephenson's improvement as a facilitator and distributor in the backcourt allowed George to play <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> more often during games. Early in his career, he was unable to create shots for himself and lacked a great deal of ball handle, something he worked on with trainer Jerry Powell during the 2012 off-season. With All-Star swingman Danny Granger injured during the 2012–13 season, George took on a larger offensive responsibility, which resulted in the NBA Most Improved Player Award.|$|E

25|$|If an {{offensive}} player, {{such as the}} centre forward, has possession of the ball {{in front of the}} goal, the defensive player tries to steal the ball or to keep the centre from shooting or passing. If the defender cannot achieve these aims, he may commit a foul intentionally. The hole set then is given a free throw but must pass <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to another offensive player, rather than making a direct shot at the goal. Defensive perimeter players may also intentionally cause a minor foul and then move toward the goal, away from their attacker, who must take a free throw. This technique, called sloughing, allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the hole set and possibly steal the inbound pass. The referee may refrain from declaring a foul, if in his judgment this would give the advantage to the offender's team. This is known as the Advantage Rule.|$|E
25|$|A {{versatile}} forward, Sheringham {{was capable}} of playing as a striker and also as a supporting forward, courtesy of his ability both to score and create goals. Due to his vision, his ability to read the game, and his short passing ability, Sheringham {{was capable of}} playing off another striker, in a deeper, creative role, where he served as an assist provider, in particular in later years, as he lost pace and stamina. He also possessed good technical ability and upper body strength, which allowed him to retain possession in the box when playing {{with his back to}} goal, and lay <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for his teammates. As a centre-forward in his prime, he was also very effective and extremely prolific, due to his accurate finishing, opportunism in the area, intelligence, and his ability in the air, which enabled him to be {{regarded as one of the}} top Premier League forwards of his generation.|$|E
25|$|Compared to the 2011–12 {{team that}} {{finished}} 41–25, the Lakers offense had improved in points per 100 possessions (108.3 vs. 106.0), but their defense underperformed. The team was lacking continuity with the projected starting lineup {{at the beginning}} of the season having played just 117 minutes together, primarily due to injuries. Howard returned the following game as the Lakers won their first game of 2013, stopping their losing streak at six with a 113-93 win over the lowly Cleveland Cavaliers (9–30). In a move to improve the team's defense, D'Antoni began having Bryant guard the opponent's best perimeter player; Bryant was the primary defender on the Cavaliers' Kyrie Irving, who was held to 15 points. Bryant acknowledged he was a more focused defender when he had a challenging defensive assignment as opposed to when he played <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> against weaker players. His defense disrupted opponents and freed Nash from unfavorable matchups. In addition to his leg injury, World Peace also suffered an injury to his right arm that made it difficult to bend. Things got so bad, D'Antoni moved him off the perimeter on defense and had him guard power forwards instead.|$|E
