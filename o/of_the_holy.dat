5|$|Christian baptisteries and shrines were domed in the 4th century, {{such as the}} Lateran Baptistery and {{the likely}} wooden dome over the Church <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Sepulchre.

The first domed basilica may have been built in the 5th century, with a church in southern Turkey being the earliest proposed example, but the 6th century architecture of Justinian made domed church architecture standard throughout the Roman east. His Hagia Sophia and Church <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Apostles inspired copies in later centuries.|$|E

5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff {{felt the need to}} keep going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of Genealogy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have been}} simpler to create a completely original title if they had known how big the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> War had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E

5|$|In 1059 {{the same}} papal bull that {{restricted}} suffrage to the cardinals also recognised the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Emperor (at the time Henry IV), {{but only as}} a concession made by the pope, declaring that the Holy Roman Emperor had no authority to intervene in elections except where permitted {{to do so by}} papal agreements. Pope Gregory VII (in office 1073-1085) was the last Pope to submit to the interference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Emperors. The breach between him and the Holy Roman Empire caused by the Investiture Controversy led to the abolition of the Emperor's role.
