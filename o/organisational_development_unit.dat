40|$|Provides {{an update}} of the Australian Defence Force Academy 2 ̆ 7 s {{progress}} {{in implementing the}} recommendations from the Review into the Treatment of Woman at ADFA. Introduction: The ADF Audit began {{at the end of}} August 2013, one year from the tabling of the ADF Review’s Report, in accordance with the Terms of Reference. While the ADF Review’s Report was broad in scope, the approach of the ADF Audit was necessarily more specific. Accordingly, the team conducting the Audit sought to gather evidence of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the ADF Review – both in terms of the overarching principles it established, as well as its more detailed recommendations. This Report is structured so as to outline each overarching principle described by the ADF Review and then to provide information concerning the extent to which each Service has implemented the recommendations that flowed from them. Each section provides the Audit’s findings in respect of this implementation and concludes with a reflection {{on the extent to which}} Defence has met the wider intent of the relevant overarching principle. The Audit conducted quantitative and qualitative primary research and sought evidence from a number of sources: 	Consultations with senior leadership; as well as with strategically significant personnel, such as the ADF’s <b>Organisational</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Unit</b> (ODU), Directors General Personnel, Career Management Agencies and the Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response Office (SeMPRO) 	Documentary evidence relevant to each recommendation 	Individual interviews and focus groups with personnel from each Service, varied ranks and genders 	Quantitative data including Defence’s Unacceptable Behaviour Survey and workforce data...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{whether the}} political competition for President of the European Commission has prompted an <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> in the europarties towards becoming transnational parties at the EU-level. This is investigated by examining two competing expectations. The first expectation’s {{point of departure}} is rational choice theory. It expects that political competition between the europarties will lead to <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> within all of the europarties. The second expectation builds on Stephen Day’s concepts transnationalization and containment strategy and expects that <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> will not happen in all europarties. This {{is based on the}} assumption that the europarties’ sentiment towards EU integration will determine whether they will utilise the political competition and go through an <b>organisational</b> <b>development.</b> The study examines the two expectations by using Peter Hall’s systematic process analysis to test which of the two is the most accurate. This dissertation examines three EU positive europarties: EDP, EPP, and EGP, and the EU sceptic europarty AECR. On the basis of our analysis, it is concluded, that the second expectation offers the best explanation of the europarties’ <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> in the period 2009 to 2014...|$|R

40|$|<b>Organisational</b> <b>Development</b> {{is said to}} be {{reaching}} an age of maturity. Articles in recent years have welcomed its growth as a discipline and advocated the direction its own further development should take. (Friedlander 1976, Burke 1976). The most insistent belief expressed in these writings seems to be that maturity will be gained through increasing quantities of ever more sophisticated research. Certainly the last decade has seen a proliferation of work in a more obviously scholarly vein than {{was the case in the}} earlier and more impassioned years of <b>Organisational</b> <b>Development’s</b> emergence. The question is whether the direction of these developments is, from that earlier standpoint, truly an advance, or whether it represents a decline of <b>Organisational</b> <b>Development</b> as a radical influence within organisations. The argument of this article is, in summary, that: (1) The original charter of <b>Organisational</b> <b>Development</b> was based on a programme of radical change in the quality of human relationships at work and in the distribution of power in decision making...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{government}} organizations to become competitive is growing {{with the huge}} instability in the economy. In parallel, Knowledge Management (KM) has been rapidly growing {{in the past decade}} as a source of influence on <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> practices. Furthermore, the past decade research approaches largely failed to show the importance of KM initiatives in creating synergy with other initiatives to an extent that would lead towards organizational competitiveness. This study address whether KM holistically influences the different <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> practices, specifically {{in the context of the}} government sector. To ascertain the relationships between KM and four prevalent <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> practices identified in the literature and increasingly used in practice, a quantitative survey approach was undertaken using a series of researcher-developed scales. Based on the literature review, Organisational Excellence (OE), Organisational Learning (OL), Organisational Innovation (OI) and Organisational Competitiveness (OC) were identified to be the most repeated relations with KM. A conceptual framework was designed to test the concept of the holistic influence of KM on the four identified <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> practices. A total of 625 valid responses were collected from top and middle management from 54 government organizations in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The model was statistically tested according to the research hypotheses by regression analysis then Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results reveal strong and significant correlations amongst the five prevalent <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> practices. Even though the holistic influence of the model could not be confirmed, findings show positive KM influence on the remaining <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> practices, thus KM is an essential factor for government organisations...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{design and}} develop an {{instrument}} to assess the degree of <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> achieved in primary medical care organisations. DESIGN: An iterative development, feasibility and validation study of an organisational assessment instrument. SETTING: Primary medical care organisations. PARTICIPANTS: Primary care teams and external facilitators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Responses to an evaluation questionnaire, qualitative process feedback, hypothesis testing, and quantitative psychometric analysis (face and construct validity) {{of the results of}} a Maturity Matrix assessment in 55 primary medical care organisations. RESULTS: Evaluations by 390 participants revealed high face validity with respect to its usefulness as a review and planning tool at the practice level. Feedback from facilitators suggests that it helped practices to prioritise their <b>organisational</b> <b>development.</b> With respect to construct validity, there was some support for the hypothesis that training and non-training status affected the degree and pattern of <b>organisational</b> <b>development.</b> The size of the organisation did not {{have a significant impact on}} the degree of <b>organisational</b> <b>development.</b> CONCLUSION: This practice based facilitated group evaluation method was found to be both useful and enjoyable by the participating organisations. Psychometric validation revealed high face validity. Further developments are in place to ensure acceptability for summative work (benchmarking) and formative feedback processes (quality improvement) ...|$|R

40|$|Organisational {{change is}} {{associated}} with two major research traditions: sociotechnical systems analysis and design {{on one hand and}} <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> on the other. While sociotechnical analysis and design has collected a huge body of knowledge for designing tasks and procedures of work systems that are both efficient and socially compatible, <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> has concentrated on organising reflexive collective learning processes for achieving change. Both traditions have their blind spots: the sociotechnical approach neglects the process perspective and the <b>organisational</b> <b>development</b> approach lacks the knowledge-based design perspective. Considering the double-faced nature of organisations, i. e. having structures and procedures to be appropriately designed and being a social system that can only change through collective learning, both perspectives must be integrated. During a three years action research project, four medium-sized companies have undergone a process of substantial change almost completely renewing their organisations for improved competitiveness. While applying the sociotechnical design knowledge for implementing product and service oriented work systems, these activities were linked with collective learning in a participatory approach. The paper reflects on necessary conditions for accomplishing such an integrated change process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> {{and change}} {{management}} is {{about dealing with}} the effectiveness and efficiency of organisations. <b>Organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management practitioners use systematic strategies and approaches to improve the productivity of organisations and the well-being of individuals. In order to do this, the <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management practitioner {{must be able to}} manage customers, competition, change, relationships and processes. There is a need to understand the impacts of successful <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management implementations as they influence the success of an organisation. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore practitioners’ knowledge and experiences of <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management implementation. The objectives included explorations of practitioners’ experiences working on <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management implementations. The study is qualitative, exploratory research. Data was collected by means of face-to-face interviews guided by a semi structured interview schedule. Participants’ were practitioners working in the field of <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management. The study used non-probability (non-random) purposive, snowball sampling. The data was analysed using thematic content analysis to identify themes and sub themes in the data. The findings indicate what <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management involves, what the benefits are and the successes and challenges practitioners have encountered during implementation. The macroeconomic environment in which organisations operate is ever changing and in order to keep up, organisations need to call on experienced practitioners to assist in managing the change. The implications of the results will assist the industry as well as organisations to understand the value <b>organisational</b> design, <b>development</b> and change management implementations in enabling business strategies and driving organizations to achieve its business objective thus promoting and growing the discipline and practice. These insights will also contribute to the discipline and the availability of such data will assist future practitioners to be more effective in their roles...|$|R
