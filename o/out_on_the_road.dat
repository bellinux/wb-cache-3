After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her to go back <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of {{photographs}} by Stipe).|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{was able}} to recover a number of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the Catholic/Latin crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact set <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to Antioch but had been persuaded to turn back by Stephen of Blois, who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and {{which would have been}} too difficult to re-create on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E

5|$|After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies {{also lost}} their final regular season game to Xavier, which left {{the two teams}} in a tie for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it. The two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those two teams were also in a tie. So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte had to win their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie {{remained}} and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would head back <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> against the Bonnies.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June, Pembroke left Gaveston at {{the rectory}} at Deddington in Oxfordshire, while he himself left {{to visit his}} wife. When Warwick found out about Gaveston's whereabouts, he {{immediately}} rode out to capture him. The next morning he appeared at the rectory, where he took Gaveston captive and {{brought him back to}} his castle at Warwick. Pembroke, whose honour had been affronted, appealed for justice both to Gaveston's brother-in-law Gloucester and to the University of Oxford, but to no avail. At Warwick, Gaveston was condemned to death for violating the terms of the Ordinances, before an assembly of barons, including Warwick, Lancaster, Hereford and Arundel. On 19 June, he was taken <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> towards Kenilworth as far as Blacklow Hill, which was on the Earl of Lancaster's land. Here, two Welshmen ran him through with a sword and beheaded him.|$|E

Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete (Dan Aykroyd), who wakes {{up the next day}} to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have enough money between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit with the crowd. They make enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.|$|E

5|$|With massive {{radio and}} video play, Blink-182 played to larger crowds {{when they began}} touring in support of Enema of the State. The Loserkids Tour {{commenced}} {{in the autumn of}} 1999 and was the band's first arena tour. The band was forced to postpone remaining dates of a spring European tour in 2000 when both DeLonge and Barker came down with strep throat. The band played to sold-out audiences and performed worldwide during the summer of 2000 on The Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour. The tour was staged as a drive-in movie, with a giant retro billboard suspended from the ceiling, and films were projected on the screen behind the band– including vintage gay porn as a joke. The tour {{was one of the most}} anticipated rock tours of the season and the band headed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with Bad Religion and Fenix TX. Barker broke one of his fingers during an altercation with two men who kept flirting with his girlfriend in Ohio, and Damon Delapaz, guitarist of Fenix TX, stepped in on drums for Barker. Hoppus recalled an overwhelming emotional feeling when the band sold out the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|The N8 was {{improved}} {{at various}} times during the 1970s through to {{the early years of}} the 21st century.

The first major improvement work carried out on the N8, post designation, involved the construction of a 4km single carriageway bypass south-west of Cahir in County Tipperary. This opened to traffic in 1991, and remained the N8 until the M8 motorway was completed through South Tipperary on 25 July 2008.|$|E

After withdrawing from the area of the fight, Dagwell and his small group headed for Fairfax Court House, picking up another 11th New York cavalryman and a few prisoners whom he had been left to guard.

25|$|Musō Gonnosuke Katsuyoshi {{was born}} into a samurai family, and like many other famous samurai and martial art founders, claimed to trace their lineage to a family of the {{classical}} period of samurai. His family is supposedly descendant from Kiso Kanja No Taiyu Kakumei , a retainer of the famous samurai general Minamoto Yoshinaka. Gonnosukes original family name {{is said to have been}} Hirano and that he used his given name of Gonbei in his early days. Unlike his future counterpart, Miyamoto Musashi, Gonnosuke was not a ronin (masterless samurai) through a defeat in battle such as is claimed with Musashi in the battle of Sekigahara, but had gone <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> on a warrior pilgrimage to improve his skills in duels and by learning from different martial arts schools on the road. This was a common tradition called musha shugyō and many samurai wishing to develop their martial abilities undertook such travels frequently. Musashi had probably been a part of the losing side in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and had since been a ronin and undertaking his own musha shugyō.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are so excited to finally get <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been lucky enough to have some amazing support shows... but to be able to go out and play songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E
25|$|The 23rd Division {{was held}} up {{for a short time}} by a German strong point in Dumbarton Wood, which had been missed by the barrage and caused many casualties. Despite the delay and the {{difficulty}} of navigating through clouds of dust and smoke caused by the barrage and the marshy ground north of Dumbarton Lake, the first objective was reached a few minutes after the barrage and consolidated along the source of the Bassevillebeek. The 69th Brigade on the left managed to get through Inverness Copse but German troops emerged from cover and fired on the troops behind as they moved up to attack the second objective, causing severe losses, before they were killed or captured. The troops, who had been severely reduced in numbers following on through the Copse, were still able to capture a line of German fortifications along Menin Road, north of the hamlet of Kantinje Cabaret. Of four tanks attached for the attack along Menin Road, one bogged early and the infantry advance was too swift for the other three tanks to keep up. A tank was knocked <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and the other two carried ammunition and equipment to the troops at the final objective.|$|E

The album debuted at number one in the U.S., Canada, Germany and Japan. Bon Jovi headed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> once again on February 19, 2010, embarking on The Circle Tour. Bon Jovi kicked off the stadium leg of the Circle Tour by making history. They played the first ever show at the brand new New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The three sold out shows on May 26, 27 and 29, 2010 were a huge success. Bon Jovi's 12 night run at London's O2 Arena grossed $18,178,036 and seen them play to 187,696 fans. The Circle Tour was the highest-grossing concert tour of 2010 according to Billboard's annual Top 25 concert tours.

Bon Jovi was also ranked second on Forbes magazine's list of the world's highest paid musicians, earning an approximate $125 million income that year.|$|E
