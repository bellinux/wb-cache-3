5|$|Many users <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in the {{expanding}} circle {{use it to}} communicate with other people from {{the expanding}} circle, so that interaction with native speakers <b>of</b> <b>English</b> plays no part in their decision to use English. Non-native varieties <b>of</b> <b>English</b> are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties. Very often today a conversation in English {{anywhere in the world}} may include no native speakers <b>of</b> <b>English</b> at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.|$|E
5|$|Those {{countries}} have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole {{to a more}} standard version <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> They have many more speakers <b>of</b> <b>English</b> who acquire English {{in the process of}} growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties <b>of</b> <b>English</b> learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties <b>of</b> <b>English</b> include words little used by native speakers <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in the inner-circle countries, and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in the outer-circle countries.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its status}} an {{international}} language, English is expeditious {{when it comes}} adopting foreign words, and borrows vocabulary from {{a large number of}} other sources. Early studies <b>of</b> <b>English</b> vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora, collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published {{before the end of the}} 20th century about the growth <b>of</b> <b>English</b> vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources <b>of</b> <b>English</b> vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.|$|E

5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence <b>of</b> <b>English</b> comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role <b>of</b> <b>English</b> as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use <b>of</b> <b>English</b> leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source <b>of</b> <b>English</b> influence on languages in Europe.|$|E
