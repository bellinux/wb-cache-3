500|$|The press heard rumours about Lennon's {{wife and}} child {{at the end of}} 1963—after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe—and descended on her mother's house in Hoylake (where mother and son were staying), in November and December. Friends and {{neighbours}} protected their anonymity, but she was often approached by journalists. In November she had her son christened at the Hoylake parish church, but didn't tell Lennon (who was on tour at the time), because she feared a media circus. She told him two days after, and he was angry as he hadn't wanted his son to be christened, even though Epstein had asked to be Julian's godfather. Not long after the christening, every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon's secret wife and baby boy. Epstein told the other Beatles {{to make the best of}} the situation, and hoped newspapers would not say Cynthia was pregnant before marrying him. [...] After living at Lennon's aunt's house for some months, the couple [...] moved to London and found a three-bedroomed flat at 13 Emperor's Gate, off Cromwell Road. The top floor flat was the third of three, which were each built over two floors. This meant climbing six flights of stairs, as the building had no lift. Cynthia firstly had to carry Julian up to the flat, and then go back down to collect shopping bags. The Beatles' fans soon found out where they were living, and she would find them camping <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> and have to push through them when leaving or arriving.|$|E
2500|$|On June 21, 1920, Wanderer and {{his wife}} were {{returning}} home from the Pershing Theater in Lincoln Square when shots rang <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> of the Johnson apartment. Ruth's mother heard the shots and rushed to the scene, finding Wanderer pummeling the body of a man in ragged clothing with his gun. Ruth lay dying with several shots in her chest, and reportedly said [...] "My baby is dead" [...] before dying. According to Wanderer's account, the man had been tailing them and followed them into the vestibule of their apartment, presumably to rob them, and Wanderer drew his military service pistol—a Colt M1911—and exchanged fire with the intruder. Wanderer killed the assailant, but his wife was killed by the shooter, who was not immediately identified.|$|E

5000|$|Maggie gets food {{down the}} front of her shirt and retreats to the kitchen to clean it off (only after being photographed eating in an unflattering manner). From the kitchen she can see Casey and her boyfriend making <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{adjacent}} <b>hallway</b> before her friend Louis (Fabian C. Moreno) greets her. It is clear that Louis has a thing for Maggie and vice versa. Louis leaves and Casey appears {{at the same time as}} Tara (Kimberly Matula) the sweet Queen Bee at school to wipe food off her shirt as well. Tara asks if Maggie is as klutzy as she is which Maggie confirms that she is, saying [...] "No, my blouse was just hungry." ...|$|R

Then {{graduation}} day comes and the final dispute happens after the ceremony - Nikki and Tiffany derisively read the chat between Vanessa and Stacey, which Stacey had sent to Nikki, who printed it <b>out,</b> aloud <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowded <b>hallway.</b> Vanessa confronts Stacey <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> whole class, bringing everything down on her and sees right through her lies. Humiliated, Stacey flees <b>the</b> school <b>in</b> tears and her two [...] "henchwomen," [...] Nikki and Tiffany, are left powerless without a leader. The class applauds Vanessa as she hugs Emily, her only true friend. Barbara, who witnessed the whole exchange, watches with pride as the two friends leave for an after-party, permanently disbanding the bullying clique.|$|R

5000|$|The {{judge ruled}} that if Ballew had been shot by federal agent Seals, {{that would be an}} assault and battery, a {{criminal}} act not a negligent act, and the tort act was not the appropriate statute to pursue redress. Since Ballew was actually shot by Ciamillo, a county policeman, the shooting was not an act of a federal officer so the federal government could not be held negligent. The government rejected the defense claim that ATFD agent Seals was responsible for the responses of Hibbs and Ciamillo by yelling to the county officers [...] "He's got a gun" [...] and opening fire while they were <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b>|$|E

I never had a cross word with him. People say I’m protective of Redd Foxx in my book (Second Banana, Wilson’s memoir of the Sanford years). I had no animosity toward Foxx for (quitting the show in 1977) because I had a million dollar contract at CBS to do Baby I’m Back. My hurt was that he didn’t come to me about throwing the towel in - I found <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> at NBC from a newscaster.
