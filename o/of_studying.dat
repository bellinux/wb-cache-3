40|$|Based on {{available}} {{studies on}} business and management fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> as upwardly-mobile university field <b>of</b> <b>study</b> choices as a basis, this study seeks {{to test this}} hypothesis of upward mobility. In doing so, it endeavours to identify correlations between field <b>of</b> <b>study</b> choice and educational background and between field <b>of</b> <b>study</b> choice and gender. The base data is taken from a survey of all domestic first-time students at Austrian universities in the 2011 / 12 winter semester (N= 27, 575). This data was subjected to a correspondence analysis, which allowed us to visualise and interpret the relations between the positions of these fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> in the university space. The results indicate a clearly structured (stratified) university space. Our supplementary regression analysis shows that the upwardly-mobile higher education choice hypothesis can be confirmed for the fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> studied. Our analyses also confirm the feminisation hypothesis for the business and management fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> studied: women significantly more frequently select fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> which lead to a career in a pedagogic (business education), social (social economy) or language (international business and management) context. In the group <b>of</b> fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> explored, business education fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> had both the highest share of first-time students and the highest level of feminisation.

Beebe had far more field experience than either of the two others accompanying him on the expedition, G. Inness Hartler and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor. During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree, and pioneered the method <b>of</b> <b>studying</b> a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.|$|E

Prus' stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among English-language writers, to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. His fiction would also be influenced by French writers Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and Émile Zola.|$|E

5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on {{the characterization of}} the discipline, they even dispute its name.

Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods <b>of</b> <b>studying</b> folk astronomies.

5|$|The oldest method <b>of</b> <b>studying</b> {{the brain}} is anatomical, and {{until the middle of}} the 20th century, much of the {{progress}} in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} way <b>of</b> <b>studying</b> rings {{is through}} their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way <b>of</b> <b>studying</b> the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book embedding. For every planar graph, it is always possible to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E
