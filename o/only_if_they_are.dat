50|$|In Mobile v. Bolden, the Court cited Washington {{in holding}} that the Fifteenth Amendment {{prohibited}} racially discriminatory voting laws <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> adopted with a racially discriminatory purpose. That principle was affirmed again in McClesky v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987), which held that criminal statutes are invalid under the Equal Protection Clause <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> adopted with a discriminatory purpose.|$|R

25|$|Two smooth {{surfaces}} are diffeomorphic if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> homeomorphic. (The analogous result {{does not hold}} for higher-dimensional manifolds.) Thus closed {{surfaces are}} classified up to diffeomorphism by their Euler characteristic and orientability.|$|E
25|$|The {{above is}} {{particularly}} useful {{when talking about}} subgroups of G. The subgroups can thus be divided into conjugacy classes, with two subgroups belonging to the same class if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> conjugate.|$|E
25|$|Two smooth {{surfaces}} are diffeomorphic if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> homeomorphic. (The analogous result {{does not hold}} for manifolds of dimension greater than three.) It follows that closed {{surfaces are}} classified up to diffeomorphism by their Euler characteristic and orientability.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the basic}} talents that was {{originally}} available in the game allowed players of different genders to protect each other <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> playing together, and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> each playing a hero of their own previously-specified gender.|$|R

50|$|In the era {{before the}} {{widespread}} use of radar and the techniques needed to guide fighters to their targets with radar, night bombing would render the bombers vulnerable <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> picked up by searchlights, a relatively rare occurrence.|$|R
25|$|NBCSN will {{occasionally}} feature Canadian teams {{during the}} regular season, but primarily only the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs, and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> playing a U.S.-based team.

25|$|Piers Steel {{indicated}} in 2010 that anxiety {{is just as}} likely to get people to start working early as late, and that the focus of studies on procrastination should be impulsiveness. That is, anxiety will cause people to delay <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> impulsive.|$|E
25|$|He told General Jones that Iranian {{internal}} turmoil {{presented an}} opportunity to weaken the regime—which he encouraged—but he also urged that this be done covertly, stressing that public statements {{in support of the}} reformers were counterproductive. The King assessed that sanctions could help weaken the government, but <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> strong and sustained.|$|E
50|$|Men predominated as {{teachers}} {{until the early}} 19th century, but by the mid-19th century most teachers were women. Women could <b>be</b> teachers <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unmarried; {{as soon as they}} married, another teacher was hired. Women were paid half the salaries as men.|$|R
50|$|Two {{companies}} ”Limak„ and ”Turk-mol„ {{expressed interest}} in the investment.

50|$|The American Revolution {{resulted}} in a government based on popular sovereignty, the first large-scale establishment of this concept (although it had been discussed and experimented in European contexts). The early Americans supported the contention that governments <b>were</b> legitimate <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> based on popular sovereignty.|$|R
25|$|While optional, the {{programs}} {{may be used}} to fulfill certain requirements of the Cub Scout Bear and Webelos ranks, the Venturing Religious Life Bronze Award and the Venturing TRUST Award.

25|$|Compare {{this with}} other securities, {{in which there}} is a primary market when an issuer issues the security, and a {{secondary}} market where the security is later traded independently of the issuer. Legally, the security represents an obligation of the issuer rather than the buyer and seller; even if the issuer buys back some securities, they still exist. <b>Only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> legally cancelled can they disappear.|$|E
25|$|BeeSafe {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with the city of Piešťany in November 2015 to increase the security of its citizen by connecting the mobile app with the police platform.

25|$|High CCT {{lighting}} generally requires higher light levels. At dimmer illumination levels, {{the human}} eye perceives lower color temperatures as more pleasant, as related through the Kruithof curve. So, a dim 2700 K incandescent lamp appears comfortable and a bright 5000 K lamp also appears natural, but a dim 5000 K fluorescent lamp appears too pale. Daylight-type fluorescents look natural <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very bright.|$|E
25|$|Entry {{authorisation}} {{and penalties}} cannot {{be issued to}} non-UK numberplates, and detection cameras may also be unable to read them, although cars with foreign plates may only {{be used in the}} UK for up to six months before being considered to have been officially imported and thenceforth required to have UK plates, and even then <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> bona fide visitors and not residents.|$|E
25|$|Elliptic curves {{carry the}} {{structure}} of an abelian group with the distinguished point as {{the identity of the}} group law. In a plane cubic model three points sum to zero in the group if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> collinear. For an elliptic curve defined over the complex numbers the group is isomorphic to the additive group of the complex plane modulo the period lattice of the corresponding elliptic functions.|$|E
25|$|As an {{immediate}} {{consequence of the}} Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases {{to keep them out}} of the public eye.|$|R
50|$|Independent journalism did {{not exist}} in the Soviet Union until Mikhail Gorbachev became its leader; all {{reporting}} was directed by the Communist Party.
