40|$|In {{this paper}} the joint density of waveheight and {{half-wavelength}} is considered for waves observed {{at a fixed}} time point and encountering waves that are <b>overtaking</b> a <b>ship</b> from behind. The densities for these two cases are related by a Doppler shift, {{expressed in terms of}} the relative velocity of the waves and the ship. Based on this observation, an approximation of the encountered density is proposed. This approximation is then investigated for a Gaussian sea having a Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum.

40|$|Encountering waves <b>overtaking</b> a <b>ship</b> sailing on {{the ocean}} may cause instability. Therefore it is of great {{importance}} to study the properties of such waves, for example slope, wavelength and amplitude.

Thus the velocity of the individual waves {{plays an important role}} and in this paper we describe how it comes into play when computing distibutions for certain wave characteristics. The distributions are evaluated for a Gaussian sea having a Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum...|$|R

50|$|At the battle, Revenge was {{situated}} {{far to the}} rear of Collingwood's division, but due to her recent construction she was a very fast and agile ship and thus was able to <b>overtake</b> two <b>ships</b> in front of her, aiming at the Spanish flagship Principe de Asturias but missing her and becoming embroiled in a duel with the smaller San Ildefonso which drifted off damaged. The Revenge next engaged the Achille and dismasted her leaving her vulnerable to attack from following ships who later sank her. The French Aigle was next, Revenge ramming her and damaging her so she too drifted off from action. Finally reaching the Principe de Asturias, the Revenge was dwarfed by her enormous opponent, and was significantly damaged by the broadsides from the bigger ship, splinters from which badly wounded Moorsom and killed or wounded over 70 of his crew. Asturias was later driven off by the aid of HMS Dreadnought and HMS Thunderer, who rescued the badly holed and slowly sinking Revenge.|$|R
50|$|After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British colonial {{government}} (British Raj) replaced {{the governance of}} the East India Company. When the British withdrew in 1947, after creating the independent states of India and Pakistan, Sitakunda {{became a part of}} East Pakistan. The potential for a ship breaking industry first appeared in 1964 when Chittagong Steel House started scrapping MD Alpince, a 20000 MT Greek ship that had been accidentally beached near Fouzdarhat by a tidal bore four years earlier. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Sitakunda was part of Sector 1, led by Ziaur Rahman and Major Rafiqul Islam of the Mukti Bahini, the forces fighting for the independence of Bangladesh. The ship breaking industry began in earnest in 1974 when Karnafully Metal Works started scrapping Al Abbas, a Pakistani ship damaged in 1971, and flourished in the 1980s.

50|$|What {{happened}} {{next in the}} ensuing months was politically complex and controversial. The Continental Congress and individual state governors through their legislatures allowed privately owned ships {{to help in the}} battle against Britain by issuing letters of marque. There were virtually thousands of these <b>ships,</b> which <b>overtook</b> British <b>ships,</b> helping the war effort at sea. These privateer ships were allowed to claim any items found on the British ships they conquered as their own. They therefore were able to pay their seamen and officers nearly twice the amount that the Continental Navy could pay their crews, since the items captured by Continental ships went {{for the good of the}} colonies. Even after the Congress built and outfitted several more ships for Commodore Hopkins to use, he could not find adequate personnel to man the ships. John Adams, Sam Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Richard Henry Lee, Robert Treat Paine and John Paul Jones came to the defense of Hopkins.|$|R
50|$|There is {{no clear}} {{testimony}} in ancient literature to identify the athletes or heroes depicted by the bronzes. It seems that the two nudes originally formed part of a votive group in a large sanctuary. It is conjectured that the bronze sculptures may represent Tydeus and Amphiaraus respectively, two warriors from the Seven Against Thebes monumental group in the polis of Argos, as Pausanias noted. However, {{they may also be}} Athenian warriors from Delphi, part of the monument to the Battle of Marathon, or they may come from Olympia. Argos, Delphi and Olympia were three prominent Greek sites for dedicated sculpture of the highest quality, and all three were vulnerable to official plundering following the Roman occupation. Perhaps the bronzes were being transported to Rome as booty when a storm <b>overtook</b> their <b>ship,</b> although no evidence of a wreck has been found. Salvatore Settis and Vinzenz Brinkmann identify the warriors as Erechtheus, son of Athena, and Eumolpos, son of Poseidon.|$|R

50|$|Discovery Hut was {{designed}} by Professor Gregory, (appointed {{as leader of the}} scientific staff, he resigned before the Discovery headed south) and prefabricated by James Moore of Sydney (cost: £870.14.5d) before being brought south by ship. It is essentially square, with verandas on three sides. The pyramidal roof is supported by a central post. Insulation was provided by felt placed between the inner and outer wood plank walls. This was found to be insufficient, and the hut was difficult to keep warm. The Discovery hut was a large strong building, but was so draughty and cold in comparison with the ship, which was moored one hundred yards away, that it was, during the first year, never used for living quarters. Its sole use was as a storehouse, and a large supply of rough stores, such as flour, cocoa, coffee, biscuit, and tinned meat, was left there in the event of its being used as a place of retreat should any disaster <b>overtake</b> the <b>ship.</b> During the second year occasional parties camped inside the hut, but no bunks or permanent sleeping quarters were ever erected.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method is}} used to predict the sinkage and trim of two moving ships as they pass each other, either from opposite directions, or as one <b>ship</b> <b>overtaking</b> the other. The description is simplified to open water of shallow constant depth. The method is based on linear superposition of slender-body shallow-water flow solutions. It is shown that even for head-on encounters, oscillatory heave and pitch effects are small, and sinkage and trim can be calculated using hydrostatic balancing. Results are compared to available experimental results, and applied to an example situation of a containership and bulk carrier in a head-on or overtaking encounter. Using dimensional analysis, simple approximate formulae are then developed for estimating the maximum sinkage of two similar vessels in a passing encounter. 1...|$|R

50|$|Darrow and Mustang seek an {{alliance}} with the Moon Lords of Jupiter, who are led by the self-declared Sovereign of the Outer Rim, Romulus au Raa. Darrow's former friend Roque au Fabii is also there, in his position as the Imperator of Octavia au Lune's Sword Armada, to negotiate a truce with the Moon Lords. Darrow secures their support against Octavia when he manipulates Roque into confirming that she possesses planet-destroying atomic weapons to use against them if necessary. Darrow's forces are joined by those of the Moon Lords against Roque's Sword Armada and the fleet of Victra's brutal sister, Antonia au Severus-Julii. Using a tactical ruse, Darrow along with Sefi's Obsidians board the Roque's flagship. They <b>overtake</b> the <b>ship,</b> and the proud Roque, refusing to surrender, commits suicide. Antonia flees, but is soon captured by Victra. After the battle, Sefi and her Obsidians instigate a riot among the Sons of Ares to execute their Gold prisoners, having been enraged by the savagery of the Jackal. Sevro proves their hypocrisy in dramatic fashion by first hanging Cassius for killing Fitchner, and then hanging himself for his own multiple murders. Astonished, Sefi cuts them both down before they die, and Sevro makes peace with the Obsidians. Sevro and Victra are married in the week thereafter.|$|R
