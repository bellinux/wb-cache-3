Like a great ring of pure and endless light. ” Henry Vaughan “Heavenly lightning’s passed and repassed {{in the depths}} of his being, and {{it seemed to him that}} he walked on air” Heinrich Suso The best mystic moments are mostly lost. Mystics lose the date of their big moment; they forget when the great turning-point of their life arrived. After all, it does appear as “timele ” when it happens. We here seek for the moments of mystical {{illumination}} for which dates can be ascertained. And how do we recognise such a moment? It has to be in some way transcendent and to have involved an experience of unity. The experience of mystical illumination is not the same as having a vision, a near-death experience, an <b>out-of-the-body</b> <b>experience,</b> a religious conversion, even a joyful moment, or an experience of realisation, although it can involve any of these. It differs from scientific enlightenment in that the individual is part of that unity. Using the dated mystic moments here found, we endeavour to test certain theories of celestial influence; is there a celestial pattern that predisposes people to such an experience? I found seventeen such moments. (1) Here they are. 1. Blaise Pascal experienced a mystic illumination, on 23 November 1654, 10 : 30 pm to midnight. He kept an amulet with the memory of this inscribed upon it, which was discovered after his death as tucked into the fabric of his coat. On it was written...|$|E

2500|$|Writers {{within the}} fields of parapsychology and occultism have written that OBEs are not {{psychological}} and that a soul, spirit or subtle body can detach itself out {{of the body and}} visit distant locations. <b>Out-of-the-body</b> <b>experiences</b> were known during the Victorian period in spiritualist literature as [...] "travelling clairvoyance". The psychical researcher Frederic Myers referred to the OBE as a [...] "psychical excursion". An early study which described alleged cases of OBEs was the two volume Phantasms of the Living, published in 1886 by the psychical researchers Edmund Gurney, Myers and Frank Podmore. The book was largely criticized by the scientific community as the anecdotal reports lacked evidential substantiation in nearly every case.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Body change illusions {{have been}} of great {{interest}} in recent years for the {{understanding of how the}} brain represents the body. Appropriate multisensory stimulation can induce an illusion of ownership over a rubber or virtual arm, simple types of <b>out-of-the-body</b> <b>experiences,</b> and even ownership with respect to an alternate whole body. Here we use immersive virtual reality to investigate whether the illusion of a dramatic increase in belly size can be induced in males through (a) first person perspective position (b) synchronous visual-motor correlation between real and virtual arm movements, and (c) self-induced synchronous visual-tactile stimulation in the stomach area. METHODOLOGY: Twenty two participants entered into a virtual reality (VR) delivered through a stereo head-tracked wide field-of-view head-mounted display. They saw from a first person perspective a virtual body substituting their own that had an inflated belly. For four minutes they repeatedly prodded their real belly with a rod that had a virtual counterpart that they saw in the VR. There was a synchronous condition where their prodding movements were synchronous with what they felt and saw and an asynchronous condition where this was not the case. The experiment was repeated twice for each participant in counter-balanced order. Responses were measured by questionnaire, and also a comparison of before and after self-estimates of belly size produced by direct visual manipulation of the virtual body seen from the first person perspective. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that first person perspective of a virtual body that substitutes for the own body in virtual reality, together with synchronous multisensory stimulation can temporarily produce changes in body representation towards the larger belly size. This was demonstrated by (a) questionnaire results, (b) the difference between the self-estimated belly size, judged from a first person perspective, after and before the experimental manipulation, and (c) significant positive correlations between these two measures. We discuss this result in the general context of body ownership illusions, and suggest applications including treatment for body size distortion illnesses...|$|R
