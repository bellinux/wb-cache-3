5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E
500|$|In the 2011 {{video game}} , when the Joker's {{interview}} tapes are found, Joker retells his origin from The Killing Joke. In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say? I like to keep things interesting. A wise man <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that if {{you have to have an}} origin story, you're better off making it multiple choice".|$|E
500|$|The {{audience}} became angrier still when in {{the following}} episode, [...] "Eye For An Eye", MacLeod made love to Immortal Annie Devlin. Abramowitz explained the creative decision of his staff by saying that [...] "...someone <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that death was an aphrodisiac. It's a thing that pushes you to life and the greatest thing in life, that's 'seize life', is sex." [...] Lineberger wrote in his review of [...] "Eye For An Eye", [...] "This one caused an uproar— one I feel is justified. [...] gave a defense (in my opinion a weak one) (...) I have a high tolerance for insensitive guy stuff, but this got to me. When Duncan rolled into Annie's arms, part of me smirked in appreciation of Duncan's magnetic charm. But the rest of me found his actions cruel to the viewers." [...] Abramowitz confirmed that [...] "...the fans hated it. And the women wanted to string me up. I was a 'cad' and a 'card'..." [...] Paul also reported an angry reaction from the audience after the seventh episode, [...] "The Return of Amanda", in which MacLeod sleeps with Amanda.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am rather," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "In fact, {{a jeweler}} I <b>once</b> knew <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I had a natural gift in that direction. And so, of course, Sir Thomas was pretty {{grateful}} to your father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{brother has}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> many curious things," [...] said Peter, when {{alone with the}} missionary, and {{speaking}} now {{in the language of}} the Ojebways--"many very curious things. I like to listen to them. <b>Once</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how the pale-face young men take their squaws." ...|$|R
2500|$|Film critic Betsey Sharkey agrees, {{adding that}} [...] "he was a maestro {{of one or}} two takes years before Clint Eastwood would turn it into a {{respected}} specialty." [...] Sharkey recalls, [...] " [...] Dunaway <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that Lumet worked so fast {{it was as if he}} were on roller skates. A racing pulse generated by a big heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Someone dubbed him {{the man who}} bowled like a millionaire, and {{how true}} it was! Arthur's {{objective}} was to take wickets, and the spending of runs in the process bothered him little. For a relatively small man Arthur had abnormally large hands, soft as silk to the touch, and he <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he didn't {{know what it was}} to have tired or sore fingers". Don Bradman ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in the July 1986 issue of Playboy magazine, {{when asked if he}} had had a bisexual experience, Clarke stated [...] "Of course. Who hasn't?" [...] In his obituary, Clarke's friend Kerry O'Quinn wrote: [...] "Yes, Arthur was gay... As Isaac Asimov <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> 'I think he simply found he preferred men.' Arthur didn't publicize his sexuality—that wasn't the focus of his life—but if asked, he was open and honest." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Are they? You {{will see}} {{them more than}} <b>once.</b> She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> she could not live without you," [...] {{answered}} Almayer, speaking without the faintest spark of expression in his face, [...] "so it behoves {{you to go to}} her quick, for fear you may find her dead." ...|$|R

2500|$|Salman Ahmed {{while talking}} about his latest project at Asia Talk on BBC said, [...] "For almost a decade, Junaid has always asked me not to bring guitar or {{to ask him to}} sing. When you are friends with {{somebody}} you always have to transcend differences and I respect Junaid's views. Junaid <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that his biggest regret was not {{to be a part of}} Jazba Junoon's recording. So when we came up with 'Naya Pakistan', I asked him that this is the chance that's not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all."

2500|$|Lucile {{designed}} the costumes for Elsie in The Merry Widow (including the plumed hats that became an extraordinary fad) and thereafter used Elsie to promote her fashions, designing her personal clothes and costumes for {{several of her}} other shows. Lucile wrote, [...] "That season was a very brilliant one, perhaps the most brilliant of the series which brought the social life of pre-war London to its peak. And just when it was at its zenith a new play was launched with a new actress, who set the whole town raving over her beauty...." [...] Elsie's image was in great demand by advertisers and on postcards, and she received unsolicited gifts of great value from many male admirers (and even bequests). [...] Lucile commented, [...] "She was absolutely indifferent to most [...] for she <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> she disliked the male character and considered that men only behaved tolerably {{to a woman who}} treated them coldly". [...] Nevertheless, Elsie {{became one of the most}} frequently photographed beauties of the Edwardian era. According to the Atlanta Constitution newspaper in America, writing in 1915: ...|$|E

He is ready to help in anything for the poor people. <b>Once</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he never wished to look beyond Bayford for happiness or occupation; but I {{did not like to}} draw him out, because of his father's plans. Why, what have you drawn? The alms-houses?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why--er--I can't say as to that. He didn't {{say much}} about himself, that I can remember. <b>Once</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about that child, but--but it's hazy--I can't think! Oh, it drives me crazy when I try to think! The roar of the sea gets in my ears, and {{the light from the}} {{lighthouse}} fires my brain!" [...] And the old tar began to pace the floor in a rolling gait.|$|R
6000|$|... "About a {{mile and}} a half farther out, sir. If you want horses I should think that you had better go on at <b>once,</b> for he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he had sold sixty yesterday, but that very few of them were {{anything}} like as good horses as these." ...|$|R

"They {{had thought}} of staying {{a long time in}} the country, perhaps till after Thanksgiving, for they had become {{attached}} to their place; but now they suddenly agreed to go back to New York at <b>once.</b> She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that as soon as they agreed she felt a tremendous longing to be gone that instant, as if she must go to escape from something, some calamity, and she felt, looking back, that there was a prophetic quality in her eagerness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I do {{not know}} at all why I cannot speak. I asked mother <b>once</b> and she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was a {{judgment}} on her for a great sin she had committed, and she looked so strangely that I was frightened, and I never spoke of it to her or anyone else again." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'd find {{it harder}} to do without breakfast and supper, which is what may happen very soon," [...] Blake rejoined. [...] "One can eat the tripe de roche which grows upon the stones, but I don't {{know where to look}} for it, and a North-West Police trooper who <b>once</b> tried it <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that it made him very ill." ...|$|R
500|$|Nevertheless, [...] {{with the}} {{primitive}} facilities {{available at the}} time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations {{that led to a}} satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as [...] "a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At <b>once</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!" ...|$|R

"I did it, oh She," [...] she answered, drawing {{herself up}} to the full of her stately height, and {{throwing}} back the panther skin from her head, [...] "because my love is stronger than the grave.

60|$|Thus his Highness had {{the most}} easy, and yet the most undiscoverable, access to me imaginable, and he seldom failed to come two or three nights in a week, and {{sometimes}} stayed two or three nights together. <b>Once</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he was resolved I should be weary of his company, {{and that he would}} learn to know what {{it was to be a}} prisoner; so he gave out among his servants that he was gone to ----, where he often went a-hunting, and that he should not return under a fortnight; and that fortnight he stayed wholly with me, and never went out of my doors.|$|R
