With this, Bolt became the first man in history to defend both the 100 m and 200 m Olympic sprint titles. He was dramatic in victory: in the final metres of the 200 m race, Bolt placed his fingers <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> gesturing to silence his critics, and after crossing the line he completed five push-ups – one for each of his Olympic gold medals.|$|E

25|$|Tristan relapses and {{recalls that}} the {{shepherd}}'s mournful tune {{is the same}} as was played when he was told of the deaths of his father and mother ("Muss ich dich so versteh'n, du alte, ernst Weise"). He rails once again against his desires and against the fateful love potion ("verflucht sei, furchtbarer Trank!") until, exhausted, he collapses in delirium. After his collapse, the shepherd is heard piping the arrival of Isolde's ship, and, as Kurwenal rushes to meet her, Tristan tears the bandages from his wounds in his excitement ("Hahei! Mein Blut, lustig nun fliesse!"). As Isolde arrives at his side, Tristan dies with her name <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E

25|$|The trumpet is a {{notoriously}} hard instrument on the lips, and Armstrong suffered from lip damage {{over much of}} his life due to his aggressive style of playing and preference for narrow mouthpieces that would stay in place easier, but which tended to dig into the soft flesh of his inner lip. During his 1930s European tour, he suffered an ulceration so severe that he had to stop playing entirely for a year. Eventually he took to using salves and creams <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> and also cutting off scar tissue with a razor blade. By the 1950s, he was an official spokesman for Ansatz-Creme Lip Salve.|$|E

As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves, Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> Both are clad in loose-fitting gray suits, which gives Madonna an androgynous look. They stroll away playfully in the sunrise, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan in The Kid with the old boss pursuing them and shouting [...] "Come back, come back, we still need you" [...] in Italian. The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B. Dirks. Only when she disappears from the carousel and reappears to run away from her patriarchal boss with the young boy, then the music and visuals become comparable.|$|E

500|$|A {{pamphlet}} titled [...] "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick", produced c.1884 {{to accompany}} his exhibition, {{states that he}} started to display symptoms at approximately five years of age, with [...] "thick lumpy skin ... like that of an elephant, and almost the same colour". According to a 1930 article in the Illustrated Leicester Chronicle, he began to develop swellings <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{at the age of}} 21months, followed by a bony lump on his forehead and a loosening and roughening of the skin. As he grew, a noticeable difference between the size of his left and right arms appeared and both his feet became significantly enlarged. The Merrick family explained his symptoms as the result of Mary's being knocked over and frightened by a fairground elephant while she was pregnant with Joseph. The concept of maternal impression—that the emotional experiences of pregnant women could have lasting physical effect on their unborn children—was still common in 19th century Britain. Merrick held this belief about the cause of his affliction for his entire life.|$|E

But he is overpowered when he attempts to use the gun and despite Lucy's effort seems doomed to die. José, the guilty halfbreed, dying {{at the bottom of}} the precipice, calls for help. His cries are heard by Lucy, who responds and finds José expiring and repentant. He wishes to clear his conscious before facing his Maker and tells Lucy that he shot Will's assistant. He puts his confession in writing and, relieved, passes peacefully away. In the meantime the lumbermen have completed the preparations that will make an innocent man pay the penalty of another man's crime. Already the noose is about Will's neck and a death prayer <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> and then, in the nick of time, Lucy arrives with the precious confession, and Will gathers his faithful sweetheart to him in the tenderest scene that has ever closed a thrilling picture." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite American successes, the {{mismanagement}} of the Army {{during the war}} distressed Calhoun, and he resolved to strengthen and centralize the War Department. The militia had proven itself quite unreliable {{during the war and}} Calhoun saw the need for a permanent and professional military force. In 1816 he called for building an effective navy, including steam frigates, as well as a standing army of adequate size. The British blockade of the coast had underscored the necessity of rapid means of internal transportation; Calhoun proposed a system of [...] "great permanent roads". [...] The blockade had cut off the import of manufactured items, so he emphasized the need to encourage more domestic manufacture, fully realizing that industry was based in the Northeast. The dependence of the old financial system on import duties was devastated when the blockade cut off imports. Calhoun called for a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war-time shrinkage of maritime trade, as the tariffs had done. The expiration of the charter of the First Bank of the United States had also distressed the Treasury, so to reinvigorate and modernize the economy Calhoun called for a new national bank. A new bank was chartered as the Second Bank of the United States by Congress and approved by President James Madison in 1816. Through his proposals, Calhoun emphasized a national footing and downplayed sectionalism and states rights. Historian Ulrich B. Phillips says that at this stage of Calhoun's career, [...] "The word nation was often <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and his conviction was to enhance national unity which he identified with national power." ...|$|E

60|$|It was, perhaps, the {{recollection}} {{of his own}} filial ingratitude that made the King pause as he uttered the last reflection, and which converted the sneer that trembled <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> into something resembling an expression of contrition.

At {{the end of all}} these arguments, Jesus silently steps forward and kisses the old man <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> The Grand Inquisitor, stunned and moved, tells Him he must never come there again, and lets Him out. Alyosha, after hearing this story, goes to Ivan and kisses him softly, with an unexplainable emotion, on the lips. Ivan shouts with delight, because Alyosha's gesture is taken {{directly}} from his poem. The brothers then part.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1843, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol was published, {{during the}} mid Victorian {{revival of the}} holiday. The word Merry was then {{beginning}} to take on its current meaning of [...] "jovial, cheerful, jolly and outgoing". [...] "Merry Christmas" [...] in this new context figured prominently in A Christmas Carol. The cynical Ebenezer Scrooge rudely deflects the friendly greeting: [...] "If I could work my will … every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> should be boiled with his own pudding." [...] After the visit from the Ghosts of Christmas affects his transformation, Scrooge exclaims; [...] "I am as merry as a school-boy. A merry Christmas to everybody!" [...] and heartily exchanges the wish to all he meets. The instant popularity of A Christmas Carol, the Victorian era Christmas traditions it typifies, and the term's new meaning appearing in the book popularized the phrase [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 128 is {{comparable}} to the sonnet in Romeo and Juliet in which Romeo pleads for a first kiss. Like that pilgrim/saint tête-à-tête, this sonnet is set in a public musical celebration. Shakespeare watches his dark lady play the keyboard virginal (or Bassano built clavichord), captivated by her back swaying with the melody. Like Romeo, he longs for a kiss, but in this sonnet he envies the jacks (wooden keys) that the lady's playing fingers [...] "tickle" [...] while trilling the notes. Perhaps he also envies the other men (Jacks) standing around the lady. Surely, this is an amusing scene to Shakespeare because he secretly is having an affair with the dark lady. He decides not to envy those keys—although he would like to be tickled as they are—but hopes instead to receive a kiss <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> Fred Blick points out that this plea for a [...] "kiss", leaving the fingers to the jacks, is a compromise, just as the tuning of the virginal or other keyboard instrument is, in musical temperament, a compromise.|$|E
2500|$|Abe's appearance, {{resembling}} {{that of a}} grey alien, includes large bulbous eyes, large forehead, {{a skinny}} frame, and a bald head with a tuft of hair. His depiction is humorous. Despite his unusual appearance, which is unlike the [...] "typically cute" [...] platform characters, Abe appeals {{to a wide range}} of video game players. His design was meant to look downtrodden, but optimistic. Unlike other Mudokons, Abe has blue or purplish-green skin, bloodshot eyes, and a high ponytail. The stitches <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> were given to him because he cried excessively after birth and they were a measure to keep him quiet, though he keeps them now because they were given to him at such a young age before he was [...] "awake enough, conscious enough as a person to really understand why he had these, but it's something that he feels is a part of him, so he doesn't want to snip loose". His skin has three mystical tattoos that grow over his body gradually: one on the back of each hand and one on his chest. Mudokon spirits have given him invisibility for short periods; he is sometimes able to incarnate the Mudokon god Shrykull; and background Mudokons assist him with other powers.|$|E
2500|$|In the video, Lee plays Little Red Riding Hood while actor Oliver Goodwill {{plays the}} Big Bad Wolf, {{who tries to}} seduce her. The clip begins with Lee at a vanity wearing a red satin cape, lip-syncing to the lyrics while sitting at {{opposite}} ends of a dining table with her lover played by Goodwill. She is then shown {{standing in front of a}} mirror while her lover comes behind her; he starts caressing her shoulders and prepares to kiss her, but Lee refuses, saying that he is [...] "too late". Shots of the band playing the song together and Lee sitting among wolves are interspersed among other scenes of the video. During the song's bridge, Lee appears descending a staircase, backed by four back-up dancers dressed in black clothing; upon reaching the bottom, both Lee and the dancers start levitating in the air. At the end of the song, Lee is seen walking atop the length of the dining table, while chairs and tabletop items are flung aside as she passes. She reaches her lover at the other end of the table, places her finger <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and sings [...] "I've made up your mind", indicating that he should start packing his things and leave. The video ends with Lee giggling behind the piano.|$|E
