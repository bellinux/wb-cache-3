5|$|Chinese society {{during the}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{was marked by}} {{political}} and legal reforms, a philosophical revival of Confucianism, {{and the development of}} cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade, industry, and maritime commerce. The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes. Conversely, shopkeepers, artisans, city guards, entertainers, laborers, and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the Chinese gentry—a small, elite community <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> scholars and scholar-officials.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to judicial affairs, Chesney worked to ensure {{good relations with}} his cathedral chapter, and allowed them exemptions from episcopal jurisdiction. He also permitted the clergy of his diocese to remit the payment of chrism money and forwent the traditional annual payment from the archdeacons of the diocese to the bishop. He suppressed unlicensed schools in Huntingdon and employed a number <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> clerks; his acta almost always include one witness entitled magister, and often as many as six.|$|E

5|$|In the Christian world {{prior to}} Galileo's {{conflict}} with the Church, the majority <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the earth {{was the center of}} the universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth, or the Tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism. Nevertheless, following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose a new class <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy {{could no longer afford}} to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} federal and state funding compensates for the excess cost <b>of</b> <b>educating</b> students under Public Law 94 - 142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. The literature is supports of the contention that the high costs <b>of</b> <b>educating</b> a handicapped child were well known prior to passage of P. L. 94 - 142, which mandated an "individualized educati "n program" (IEP) for each covered child as well as varous special education services. Requirements of the Law that all needed special education and related services be included in the IEP even when such services cannot be provided by the local education agency are discussed. The Oklahoma weighting formula which partially recompenses local districts for excess costs <b>of</b> <b>educating</b> handicapped children is cited. The opinion of school superintendents across the state that the weights are generally too low is also noted. Actual costs <b>of</b> <b>educating</b> each category <b>of</b> handicapped student in Oklahoma City were compared with costs <b>of</b> <b>educating</b> the average nonhandicapped student and these costs were then compared with total revenues received per student. The results of the study are seen to provide a rationale as well as a quantitative basis for assigning more appropriate weight...|$|R

Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states. Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture has contributed greatly to the declining number of smaller family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges facing rural towns.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{spent over}} fifty years giving speeches, {{propagating}} the realisation {{that everyone is}} an equal citizen and the differences on basis of caste and creeds were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant as underdogs in the society. Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more mundane mass, scores <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> people were also swayed. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning, with respect to subjects of social interest, in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in Tamil society were {{considered by many to}} be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.|$|E
5|$|Scientists will {{probably}} never be certain {{of the largest and}} smallest dinosaurs to have ever existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> guesswork.|$|E

5|$|The Khmer Rouge leadership, {{with much}} of its {{political}} and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in Thailand, where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the Khmer Rouge and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected the Khmer Rouge at Khao Larn camp in Trat Province. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country’s economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered by the lack <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> and qualified personnel, as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime during the previous four years. By {{the end of the}} year, the new regime’s attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{bishops of}} Olinda and Belém (in {{the provinces of}} Pernambuco and Pará, respectively) {{were two of the}} new {{generation}} <b>of</b> <b>educated,</b> zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the Ultramontanism which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872 they ordered Freemasons expelled from lay brotherhoods. While European Masonry often tended towards atheism and anti-clericalism, things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common—although PedroII himself was not a Freemason. The government headed by the Viscount of Rio Branco tried on two separate occasions to persuade the bishops to repeal, but they refused. This led to their trial and conviction by the Superior Court of Justice. In 1874 they were sentenced four years at hard labor, although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.|$|E

The linking of Mangalore in 1907 to the Southern Railway, and the subsequent proliferation of motor vehicles in India, further increased trade and communication between the city and the rest of the country.

He again borrowed from his friends. From mid-1886, Lie's publishing house (which he had moved to Batavia) was credited as the newspaper's printer. While busy with the press, he wrote or contributed to four books. Two were pieces of nonfiction, one a collection of Chinese prophecies and the last outlined lease laws. The third was a partial translation of the One Thousand and One Nights, a collection already popular with Malay audiences. The last was his first novel, Tjhit Liap Seng. Following a group <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> persons in mainland China, Tjhit Liap Seng is credited as the first Chinese Malay novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} had promulgated the Powers of Nomad Shiekhs Ordinance in 1922, and had recognized and reinforced the judicial powers of over 300 tribal leaders by 1923. They had ignored the aspirations <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> Sudanese in government employment {{to take a}} greater role in administration. The principle of indirect rule had also given the Sayyids, including Abd al-Rahman, more power to prevent changes demanded by the secular opposition. In a shift of policy, the Graduates' General Congress was launched in 1938 as a forum for the intelligentsia of Sudan to express their opinions and as an alternative voice to that of the tribal leaders, who had become discredited.|$|E
5|$|After {{the medieval}} period, the word elf tended to become less common {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French {{into all the}} Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued {{to be associated with}} causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.|$|E
