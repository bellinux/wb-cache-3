5|$|By 1942 Pane {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} playwrights in Java, together with El Hakim (pseud. Aboe Hanifah) and Usmar Ismail. Their works often dealt with politics, a sense of nationalism, and the influence of one's environment—particularly tradition, ethics, and religion. As with Kami, Perempuan, these works were oriented around everyday events and featured average people, as opposed to the earlier stories based in mythology and telling <b>of</b> <b>gods</b> and goddesses.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology is {{explicitly}} embodied {{in a large}} collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as ancient vase-paintings and votive gifts. Greek myth attempts to explain {{the origins of the}} world, and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>gods,</b> goddesses, heroes, heroines and mythological creatures. These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition; today the Greek myths are known primarily from ancient Greek literature.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to elucidate Calvin's high {{view of the}} function of Scripture in the mediation of the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> Two conclusions emerge:- The first is that the statement 'Scripture is the Word of God' Is not a premise with which Calvin's theological exposition begins, but a position to which the Reformer comes {{as a corollary of}} his understanding of the grace <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> - The second Is that Calvin's contention that the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> is mediated In Scripture rests upon his view that the nature <b>of</b> <b>God</b> is such that its most adequate form of self-expression is as Word. There are three parts to the thesis. - Part I Is an examination of The Actuality of the Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> In the Word <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> This section is concerned with the actual content of the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> as it is mediated by the Word <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> The mediation <b>of</b> the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> In Scripture is set {{in the context of the}} mediation of the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> by the Eternal Word <b>of</b> <b>God</b> and the mediation of the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> by the Incarnate Word <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> - Parts II and III explore The Possibility of the Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> in the Word <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> Part II asks how it is possible for the Word <b>of</b> <b>God</b> to be spoken, and answers the question In terms of Calvin's use of the principle of Accommodation. Part III considers how It Is possible for the Word <b>of</b> <b>God</b> to be heard, and answers the question in terms of Calvin's consistent correlation of Word and Spirit. In both cases the mediation of the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> in Scripture is again set in the context of the mediation of the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> by the Eternal Word <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> and the mediation of the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>God</b> by the Incarnate Word <b>of</b> <b>God...</b>|$|R

5|$|Palmyra's gods were {{primarily}} {{part of the}} northwestern Semitic pantheon, with the addition <b>of</b> <b>gods</b> from the Mesopotamian and Arab pantheons. The city's chief pre-Hellenistic deity was called Bol, an abbreviation of Baal (a northwestern Semitic honorific). The Babylonian cult of Bel-Marduk influenced the Palmyrene religion and by 217 BC the chief deity's name was changed to Bel. This did not indicate the replacing of the northwestern Semitic Bol with a Mesopotamian deity, but was a mere change in the name.|$|E

5|$|A {{centre of}} Buddhist {{learning}} and culture, Gangtok's most notable Buddhist institutions are the Enchey monastery, the Do-drul Chorten stupa complex and the Rumtek Monastery. The Enchey monastery is the city's oldest monastery {{and is the}} seat of the Nyingma order. The two-hundred-year-old baroque monastery houses images <b>of</b> <b>gods,</b> goddesses, and other religious artifacts. In the month of January, the Chaam, or masked dance, is performed with great fanfare. The Dro-dul Chorten is a stupa which was constructed in 1945 by Trulshik Rimpoché, head of the Nyingma order of Tibetan Buddhism. Inside this stupa are complete set of relics, holy books, and mantras. Surrounding the edifice are 108 Mani Lhakor, or prayer wheels. The complex also houses a religious school.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} before Leo's paper, the first small papyrus {{fragment}} was found, and {{the first half of}} the twentieth century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of the Catalogue. Among these finds were important passages, the Catalogue of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's overall structure. The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list <b>of</b> <b>gods</b> found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some to believe that the Catalogue was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions <b>of</b> <b>gods</b> and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity. Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the corpus of papyrus witnesses to the fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to the Catalogue. The new papyri proved once and for all that the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the Bibliotheca, and that the poet's use of the ē' hoiē-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an overall structure.|$|E

5|$|From the 11th century, {{architectural}} articulation included icons between pilasters, miniature towers {{supported by}} pilasters in {{the recesses of}} walls, and, on occasion, the use of wall pillars to support these towers. These miniature towers were of the southern dravida and northern bhumija and sekhari types and were mostly used to elaborate dravida types of articulation. The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral lintel on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction <b>of</b> <b>gods.</b> These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri. These miniatures became common in the 12th century, {{and the influence of}} this northern articulation is seen in the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi and in the nearby Nannesvara Temple.|$|E

5|$|The Viking {{invasions of}} the 8th and 9th centuries reintroduced paganism to North-East England, leading {{in turn to}} another wave of conversion. Indigenous Scandinavian beliefs were very similar to other Germanic groups, with a pantheon <b>of</b> <b>gods</b> {{including}} Odin, Thor and Ullr, combined with a belief in a final, apocalyptic battle called Ragnarok. The Norse settlers in England were converted relatively quickly, assimilating their beliefs into Christianity in the decades following the occupation of York, which the Archbishop had survived. The process was largely complete by the early 10th century and enabled England's leading Churchmen {{to negotiate with the}} warlords. As the Norse in mainland Scandinavia started to convert, many mainland rulers recruited missionaries from England to assist in the process.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the Mycenaean civilization by the German amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in the nineteenth century, and the {{discovery of}} the Minoan civilization in Crete by the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans in the twentieth century, helped to explain many existing questions about Homer's epics and provided archaeological evidence for many of the mythological details about gods and heroes. Unfortunately, the evidence about myths and rituals at Mycenaean and Minoan sites is entirely monumental, as the Linear B script (an ancient form of Greek found in both Crete and mainland Greece) was used mainly to record inventories, although certain names <b>of</b> <b>gods</b> and heroes have been tentatively identified.|$|E
5|$|The earlier {{inhabitants}} of the Balkan Peninsula were an agricultural people who, using Animism, assigned a spirit to every aspect of nature. Eventually, these vague spirits assumed human forms and entered the local mythology as gods. When tribes from {{the north of the}} Balkan Peninsula invaded, they brought with them a new pantheon <b>of</b> <b>gods,</b> based on conquest, force, prowess in battle, and violent heroism.
