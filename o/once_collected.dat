Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. <b>Once</b> <b>collected,</b> they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps like Buchenwald.3 Probably 3,081,000 died during the Sino-Japanese War; likely another 1,131,000 during the Civil War--4,212,000 dead in total.

25|$|Oocytes can be {{collected}} from most mammalian species. Conventional oocyte collection is when ovaries {{are removed from}} a donor animal; this is done posthumously in slaughter facilities. The ovaries are kept warm as they are brought back to a laboratory for oocyte collection. Keeping the ovaries warm helps increase the success rate of fertilization. <b>Once</b> <b>collected</b> the oocytes are assessed and categorized into small, medium, and large, and then matured for 20–23 hours. This simple, inexpensive technique can lead to about 24 oocytes collected from a bovine. Conventional oocyte collection is especially useful for females who unexpectedly die or who are incapable of being bred due to injury. A second option for oocyte collection is to utilize the transvaginal ultrasound guided oocyte collection method otherwise known as TUGA. Collection technique varies slightly by species, but the general methods for collection are the same; a needle is inserted into each ovarian follicle and pulled out via vacuum. The major benefit of using this method {{is the ability to}} expand the lifetime reproductive productivity, or the number of productive days an animal is in her estrous cycle. Pregnant cows and mares continue to develop new follicles until the middle of pregnancy. Thus, TUGA can be used to substantially increase the fitness of an individual because the female then has the potential produce more than one offspring per gestation.|$|E

6000|$|IV. DISTRIBUTION.--And now, lastly, {{we come to}} {{the fourth}} great head of our inquiry, the {{question}} of the wise distribution of the art we have gathered and preserved. It must be evident to us, at a moment's thought, that the way in which works of art are on the whole most useful to the nation to which they belong, must be by their collection in public galleries, supposing those galleries properly managed. But there is one disadvantage attached necessarily to gallery exhibition, namely, the extent of mischief which may be done by one foolish curator. As long as the pictures which form the national wealth are disposed in private collections, the chance is always that the people who buy them will be just the people who are fond of them; and that the sense of exchangeable value in the commodity they possess, will induce them, even if they do not esteem it themselves, to take such care of it as will preserve its value undiminished. At all events, so long as works of art are scattered through the nation, no universal destruction of them is possible; a certain average only are lost by accidents from time to time. But when they are <b>once</b> <b>collected</b> in a large public gallery, if the appointment of curator becomes in any way a matter of formality, or the post is so lucrative as to be disputed by place-hunters, let but one foolish or careless person get possession of it, and perhaps you may have all your fine pictures repainted, and the national property destroyed, in a month. That is actually the case at this moment, in several great foreign galleries. They are the places of execution of pictures: over their doors you only want the Dantesque inscription, [...] "Lasciate ogni speranza, voi che entrate." ...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{effectiveness}} of the proposed TTR MAC, we conduct the TTR MAC in MATLAB and compare the simulation results with the two ubiquitous MAC protocols. One protocol is the IEEE 802.15. 6, where the hub assigns fixed allocation slot number for each sensor node without considering the heterogenous data arrival rates. Nodes will contend for the channel in CSMA/CA if the allocated slots are insufficient to transmit their data. The other protocol represents a kind of protocol which is based on one-round reservation to adapt the diverse data arrival rates, named OR MAC here. In the OR MAC, the hub first assigns a fixed slot for each node to inform its data volume. <b>Once</b> <b>collecting</b> all information about buffered data from all nodes, the hub assigns allocation slots for each node based on the collected information.|$|R
