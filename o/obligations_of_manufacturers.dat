40|$|The storms {{buffeting}} the tort system {{over the}} past two decades have come in three distinct waves. In the late 1960 s, steep increases in the insurance costs incurred by health care providers protecting against negligence claims by patients triggered what came to be known as the 2 ̆ 2 medical malpractice crisis. 2 ̆ 2 In the mid- 1970 s, manufacturers whose liability insurance premiums suddenly soared raised obstreperous complaints that called public attention to the existence of a 2 ̆ 2 product liability crisis. 2 ̆ 2 Finally, other groups whose activities created risks exposing them to lawsuits found that their liability insurance rates had also risen precipitously. A full-blown 2 ̆ 2 torts crisis 2 ̆ 2 was at hand. The common law of torts attracted a major share of the blame for each of the three 2 ̆ 2 crises. 2 ̆ 2 Observers blamed the medical malpractice crisis on judicial decisions that expanded the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur by permitting juries to infer negligence from the mere occurrence of an untoward result following medical treatment, and that recognized a duty of due care by physicians to disclose the risk of treatment to patients. Members of Congress, among others, blamed the product liability crisis on state-by-state variations in rules governing the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and sellers. Working groups formed to study the issue found the across-the-board torts crisis attributable to the erosion of fault as the basis for liability and the adoption of rules and practices that were allegedly responsible for 2 ̆ 2 undue 2 ̆ 2 increases in compensatory as well as punitive damage awards. As a consequence, those adversely affected by rising insurance costs demanded, and often achieved, what they called 2 ̆ 2 tort reform. 2 ̆ 2 Responding to pressure, states enacted pro-defendant legislative adjustments to common law rules of medical malpractice, products liability, and general tort law. By equating tort reform with unidirectional statutory modification of the common law, its advocates succeeded in investing the term with a politically useful, if skewed, meaning. Until the dawn of the present age of tort-related 2 ̆ 2 crises, 2 ̆ 2 the notion of tort reform was likely to evoke images of a movement to change pro-defendant common law rules so that injured plaintiffs could more easily win judgments or recover full damages. Indeed, through the first half of the twentieth century, the tort system tended to protect the interests of defendants in general as well as particular categories of defendants. What might be called the 2 ̆ 2 old tort reform 2 ̆ 2 was partly an effort to rectify these imbalances...|$|E
40|$|In the {{clinical}} laboratory setting, interferences {{can be a}} significant source of laboratory errors with potential to cause serious harm for the patient. After hemolysis, lipemia is the most frequent endogenous interference that can influence results of various laboratory methods by several mechanisms. The most common preanalytical cause of lipemic samples is inadequate time of blood sampling after the meal or parenteral administration of synthetic lipid emulsions. Although the best way of detecting the degree of lipemia is measuring lipemic index on analytical platforms, laboratory experts should be aware of its problems, like false positive results and lack <b>of</b> standardization between <b>manufacturers.</b> Unlike for other interferences, lipemia can be removed and measurement can be done in a clear sample. However, a protocol for removing lipids from the sample has to be chosen carefully, since it is dependent on the analytes that have to be determined. Investigation of lipemia interference is an <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturers</b> <b>of</b> laboratory reagents; however, several literature findings report lack of verification of the declared data. Moreover, the acceptance criteria currently used by the most manufacturers are not based on biological variation and need to be revised.

The effective ways to ensure reliability signals of the product is by offering better warranty terms and period associated with sale of the product. In fact, warranty is a legal <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>manufacturer</b> or dealer in connection with the sale of the product that defines the liability <b>of</b> the <b>manufacturer</b> or dealer in the event of the premature failure or defects of the product. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a method for reliability analysis of the warranty data and to validate the warranty policy. In order to applied neuro-fuzzy approach by optimizing warranty cost and period, modelling the reliability of the product must be beneficial.

40|$|The {{paper is}} aiming to {{implement}} the general principles of risk prevention at employer’s level, with respect to occupational risks evaluation, the elimination of risk and accident factors, and information of workers which are using the machinery in the forestry sector. For the use of machinery in the forestry sector {{in terms of economic}} performance and a level of maximum safety, it is necessary to ensure the user guides set by the <b>manufacturer</b> in terms <b>of</b> commissioning, use and to provide appropriate safe working operations and interventions and to guarantee the technical and environmental requirements, including appropriate measures and means of protection against accidents and occupational disease. The impact of occupational risks for machinery used in this sector can be reduced through the application of modern principles in conformity assessment and certification and, where appropriate, through technical diagnostics and inspection, taking into account the provisions of the new Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 / EC which is imposing the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer</b> to implement conformity assessment procedures in accordance with the methods of assessment and verification of safety at the certification bodies, notified at the European Commission. The paper aims to develop modern technical tools for conformity assessment and verification of this category of machines used in the forestry sector that would provide prerequisite for increasing competitiveness of employers in the market economy. Applying these tools of modern technology for <b>manufacturers</b> and users <b>of</b> this category of machinery provides the necessary conditions for placing on the market of safe products with a appropriate safety level, in the intended using conditions, in order to guarantee the essential requirements for safety and health, technical and environmental conditions, including measures and means of protection. The result of this research is to develop technical tools needed to assess compliance on effective occupational risk management for professional machinery used in the forestry sector...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain. Following on from these remarks I will adumbrate an alternative account of the relation which grounds (enforceable) <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice...|$|R
40|$|Notions of {{cosmopolitan}} {{and environmental}} citizenship {{have emerged in}} response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But {{even if there are}} <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global or environmental citizenship. Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R

40|$|In Just Health, Norman Daniels makes {{a strong}} {{argument}} for <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance {{to fulfill the}} right to health {{at the national level}} and challenges readers to develop arguments supporting <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance at the global level. In this paper, we argue that there is global responsibility for global health and that there are <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice (beyond charity) to help fulfill (not merely respect or even protect) the right to health in other countries; these we call <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice. We show how international human rights law affirms <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice - beyond national obligations and beyond <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> charity - and assert that the human rights approach provides guidance on delineating the relationship between national and global responsibility for fulfilling the core obligations that arise from socioeconomic human rights and addressing global health inequities. We further argue that new ways of providing international assistance, originating from the global HIV/AIDS response, demonstrate the feasibility of improving health outcomes through exogenous efforts and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice thus carry much weight: the weight of lives not saved. The global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic has led to {{the emergence of a new}} international health assistance paradigm, and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is, we suggest, an embryonic form of this new paradigm. We conclude that agreements on several common parameters delineating global and national responsibility for global health can advance the movement towards a global institution for the distribution of health-related goods...|$|R
