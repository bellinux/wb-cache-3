Skinner admits to Mulder that he saw the woman during his experience in Vietnam, but passed it off as being due to drugs. It is revealed that The Smoking Man is observing their conversation through the <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror</b> of the interrogation room.|$|E
25|$|One-way windows {{can be made}} to {{work with}} {{polarized}} light in the laboratory without violating the second law. This is an apparent paradox that stumped some great physicists, although it does not allow a practical <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror</b> for use in the real world. Optical isolators are one-way devices that are commonly used with lasers.|$|E
25|$|In London in 1988, Bowery met {{the noted}} painter Lucian Freud in his club, Taboo. They were {{introduced}} {{by a friend}} they had in common, the artist Cerith Wyn Evans. Freud had seen Bowery perform at Anthony d'Offay Gallery, in London.

25|$|Harlow's first {{experiments}} involved isolating {{a monkey}} {{in a cage}} surrounded by steel walls with a small <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror,</b> so the experimenters could look in, but the monkey could not look out. The only connection the monkey had with the world was when the experimenters' hands changed his bedding or delivered fresh water and food. Baby monkeys were placed in these boxes soon after birth; four were left for 30 days, four for six months, and four for a year.|$|E

Beauty and Tristan copulate as Nicholas watches behind a <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror.</b> Suddenly, Arab soldiers raid the village and several naked slaves, including Beauty, Tristan and Laurent, are kidnapped. The book closes as they are sent across the sea to serve in the palace of the Sultan.|$|E
500|$|The 'Strange Situation' is a {{laboratory}} procedure {{used to assess}} infants' pattern of attachment to their caregiver by introducing an unexpected threat, two brief separations from the mother followed by reunion. In the procedure, the mother and infant are placed in an unfamiliar playroom equipped with toys while a researcher films the procedure through a <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror.</b> The procedure consists of eight sequential episodes in which the infant experiences both separation from and reunion with the mother {{as well as the}} presence of an unfamiliar person (the Stranger).

50|$|Before the {{miniaturization}} and transistorization {{of electronic}} camera viewing systems, laboratory schools often included elaborate direct-view observation systems with special observation decks above classrooms or observation rooms alongside the classrooms. <b>One-way</b> <b>mirrors</b> and speaker/intercom systems allowed a professor to silently observe the classroom, but {{without being seen}} by the students or the student-teacher.|$|R

500|$|As {{development}} {{neared the}} production stage, Q*bert underwent location tests in local arcades under its preliminary title , before being widely distributed. According to Jeff Lee, his oldest written record attesting {{to the game}} being playable as [...] in a public location, a Brunswick bowling alley, dates back to September 11, 1982. Gottlieb also conducted focus groups, in which the designers observed players through a <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror.</b> The control scheme received a mixed reaction during play testing; some players adapted quickly while others found it frustrating. Initially, Davis was worried players would not adjust to the different controls; some players would unintentionally jump off the pyramid several times, reaching a game over in about tenseconds. Players, however, became accustomed to the controls after playing several rounds of the game. The different responses to the controls prompted Davis to reduce the game's level of difficulty—a decision that he would later regret.|$|E
500|$|The {{creative}} {{team had}} a number of opportunities to try different music to enhance an episode's storyline. Pyken and Wade-Reed chose and coordinated music on the show when Snow and Febre's scores were not used. In season three's [...] "Slumber", producer Ken Horton wondered if they could get a band to provide music for the entire episode. During a breakfast meeting with the music department of Warner Bros. R.E.M. was suggested, and Pyken and Wade-Reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect the episode's featured band with its story (which revolved around REM sleep). That season, Al Gough wanted to use Johnny Cash's cover of the Nine Inch Nails song [...] "Hurt" [...] for the final scene of [...] "Shattered" [...] (when Lionel Luthor looks at Lex through a <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror</b> at Belle Reve sanitarium) as soon as he read the episode's script. Cash died while Wade-Reed was trying to obtain the rights for the song and his heirs, believing that the song's use in the episode would honor his memory, gave Smallville the rights.|$|E
500|$|In August 1968 {{the unit}} created a [...] "Total Encounter Capsule", {{which was a}} windowless, soundproofed room, [...] wide and [...] long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat {{on the floor and}} a ceiling {{containing}} a <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror.</b> It was empty apart from a sink and lavatory. In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy, television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls. Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built into the door. The Capsule's purpose, Barker writes, was to provide [...] "a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions." [...] Though participation in the STU programme was required, entering the Capsule was voluntary, and each patient could choose how many days he spent inside. Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days. Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed, the inmates entered the Capsule naked. To further encourage communication, they were administered with LSD-25. The room was lit at all times, making day indistinguishable from night. While members of the programme were inside the Capsule, other patients operated the room and watched over those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature.|$|E

5000|$|The {{dining room}} was located in what was {{previously}} the lobby of a bank. The restaurant retained {{some aspects of the}} bank's decor with a high celling and a marble bar.

2500|$|One-way mirrors [...] (also called two-way mirrors) work by {{overwhelming}} dim {{transmitted light}} with bright reflected light. A true <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror</b> that actually allows light to be transmitted {{in one direction}} only without requiring external energy is not possible as it violates the second law of thermodynamics: if one placed a cold object on the transmitting side and a hot one on the blocked side, radiant energy would be transferred from the cold to the hot object. Thus, though a <b>one-way</b> <b>mirror</b> {{can be made to}} appear to work in only one direction at a time, it is actually reflective from either side.|$|E

50|$|Mirrored {{sunglasses}} are sunglasses with {{a reflective}} optical coating (called a mirror coating or flash coating) {{on the outside}} of the lenses to make them appear like small mirrors. The lenses typically give the wearer's vision a brown or grey tint. The mirror coating decreases the amount of light passing through the tinted lens by a further 10-60%, making it especially useful for conditions of sand, water, snow, and higher altitudes. <b>Mirrored</b> sunglasses are <b>one-way</b> <b>mirrors.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{treatment}} includes daily play picnic, {{which is}} usually lasts one hour. Children spend time in a room where food is attractively portioned/positioned and usually served on the floor. Using a psychoanalytically based play therapy, children may choose to examine, touch or taste the available food. According to the program, children must become self-motivated and no encouragement or distraction is received from parents. Parents’ interactions are monitored by video and <b>one-way</b> <b>mirrors</b> with positively-framed feedback given after each session. During {{the rest of the}} time, food is freely available to the child with no offering or encouragement.Since its development, the method has been modified so that children can attend on an outpatient basis, or treated remotely by a Netcoaching program.|$|R
