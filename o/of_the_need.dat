40|$|The paper, {{which is}} a summary of a longer study, {{presents}} the most important conceptual and methodological approaches to <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> for adult education. The conceptual approaches are related to <b>the</b> theoretical treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs,</b> such as <b>the</b> behaviourist and development-humanist theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> applied in psychology, <b>the</b> class-strata <b>needs</b> theory developed by sociologists, {{and an understanding of}} the needs characteristic of marketing. A special chapter considers <b>the</b> applicability <b>of</b> individual conceptual approaches to identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> for adult education within higher education. A consequence of multiplicity of conceptual approaches to <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> is a methodological pluralism which becomes evident in empirical work. In the subsequent chapter the author outlines the already established methods for identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> and "a case study" carried out by <b>the</b> researchers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Centre for <b>the</b> Development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University. In the conclusion the author makes a few proposals for improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> for adult education in <b>the</b> sphere <b>of</b> Slovenian higher education...|$|R

The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire.

His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of On the Origin of Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E

Construction of fortresses along the border by both the French and Germans in the mid-1880s worried the Belgian government that their country might be used as an invasion route. In 1887, a program of fortification construction began along the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Designed by the leading military architect Henri Alexis Brialmont, nine forts were built at Namur to guard against an offensive from France, while twelve were built around Liège, near the German border. Completed in 1892, they supplemented the existing National Redoubt at Antwerp, which was later modernized and extended. The fortifications would {{play a major role in}} the opening stages of the First World War.|$|E

Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she {{was not prepared to}} risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she wrote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} primates, {{one of the}} {{principal}} threats to both ruffed lemur species is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining. Both species appear to be very sensitive to logging, and are thought to be the most vulnerable of rainforest lemurs. The hardwoods that are favored for construction materials and selectively logged are also preferred by ruffed lemurs for their fruits and potentially affect their travel routes through the canopy. Deforestation, on the other hand, is a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to provide firewood and to support subsistence agriculture and cash crops. For red ruffed lemurs, Slash-and-burn agriculture, known locally as tavy, is practiced seasonally on the Masoala peninsula between October and December, and its practice is expanding. Additionally, cattle are sometimes allowed to free-range over these former agricultural clearings, preventing forest re-growth.|$|E
