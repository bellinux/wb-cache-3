25|$|After {{his parents}} moved to Augusta, Kentucky, Clooney {{attended}} Augusta High School. He {{has stated that}} he earned all As and a B in school, and was an enthusiastic baseball and basketball player. He tried <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> professional baseball with the Cincinnati Reds in 1977, {{but he did not}} pass the first round of player cuts and was not offered a contract. He attended Northern Kentucky University from 1979 to 1981, majoring in broadcast journalism, and very briefly attended the University of Cincinnati, but did not graduate from either. He made money selling women's shoes, insurance door-to-door, stocking shelves, working construction, and cutting tobacco.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} season saw Stoke consolidating their Premier League status {{rather than}} facing relegation, and also saw them reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup with victories over York City, Arsenal and Manchester City before losing to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Stoke finished 11th in the Premier League with 47 points, a place higher and two points more than last season. Pulis made his 300th appearance as Stoke manager with a 3–0 win over Blackburn Rovers on 6 February 2010. The result was Stoke's largest top-flight win for nearly 24 {{years after a}} 4–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1984. Following criticism from Fulham player Danny Murphy over the way Pulis sets his team <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> Pulis decided to release a six-minute statement defending the management staff and club as well as questioning Murphy's agenda.|$|E
25|$|He was {{recalled}} to the England {{team for}} the final Test of the 1993 Ashes series. With Australia already 4–0 up it was a dead rubber, but he produced his first substantial innings for England by scoring 64 to help the team grab a consolation victory. This booked him {{a place on the}} subsequent tour of the West Indies. However, another string of low scores meant he was dropped and out of the selectors' plans. Ramprakash was not selected in the touring party for the 1994–95 Ashes series, but was chosen as vice-captain for the England A tour to India. However, an injury to Graeme Hick meant that he was flown <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the final Ashes Test scoring a useful 72. He {{was in and out of}} the England team over the next few years, never assured of selection but still scoring very heavily for Middlesex.|$|E
25|$|In the Mavericks' debut game, {{taking place}} in the brand-new Reunion Arena, the Mavericks {{defeated}} the Spurs, 103–92. But the Mavs started the season with a 6–40 record on their way to finishing 15–67. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a very important role {{in the early years of}} their franchise. Journeyman 6ft 3 in guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there was absolutely no reason to expect that Davis would be any better than the expansion-level talent the Mavs had. But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a profitable debut season, with an average of 7,789 spectators.|$|E

25|$|Janković, {{struggling}} with injuries, {{played in the}} 2010 Wimbledon Championships and eventually retired against eventual finalist Vera Zvonareva in the fourth round. Regardless, her ranking increased to world no. 2. Janković lost in the early rounds at both the 2010 Western & Southern Financial Group Women's Open and 2010 Rogers Cup, despite being the top seed in each (and defending champion in Cincinnati). Janković then traveled to New York {{to play in the}} 2010 US Open, where she was seeded fourth. She was defeated by Kaia Kanepi in the third round. In the 2010 China Open she fell in the third round against fellow Serbian player Bojana Jovanovski. Janković's final event of the year was the 2010 WTA Tour Championships, where she qualified for the fourth consecutive year, as the sixth seed. After losing her opening match to Zvonareva, Janković reportedly collapsed in the locker room, yet still came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Clijsters the next day and lost. She lost her third and final group match to Azerenka, bringing an end to her 2010 season.|$|E

While her sister was on trial, Maureen—eight months pregnant—was attacked in the lift of the building in which she and David lived. Their home was vandalised, and hate mail was regularly posted through their letterbox. Maureen feared for her children: [...] "I couldn't let my children out of my sight when they were little. They were too young to tell them why they had to stay in, to explain why they couldn't go <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> like all the other children." ...|$|E

500|$|Téa Leoni, who portrayed a fictionalized {{version of}} herself portraying Scully in the production, {{was married to}} David Duchovny when this episode was filmed, a {{decision}} casting director Rick Millikan considered [...] "clever." [...] Duchovny also cast his friend and fellow actor Garry Shandling as a fictionalized version of himself portraying Mulder. Shandling had originally been sought <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the part of Morris Fletcher in the sixth season episode [...] "Dreamland." [...] The joke about Garry Shandling having a crush on Mulder came from a recurring joke from the TV show The Larry Sanders Show, starring Shandling. In the recurring joke, David Duchovny has a homosexual interest in Shandling's character.|$|E
500|$|Mills {{sets his}} teams <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a passing game, and affirmed this when stating: [...] "My {{philosophy}} {{is to play}} football with {{the ball on the}} deck, to play attacking football, to be disciplined with and without the ball". He prefers to employ a 4–3–3 formation, explaining it allows his teams to play entertaining football and makes them hard to beat, and it brought him success when at Tamworth and York. He has stuck with this formation despite charges from some of being tactically stubborn, saying: [...] "I'm not going to change the way my teams play, the systems. I've not even had a thought about that".|$|E
500|$|Regarding the record, Smith said: [...] "I {{thought my}} head would be chopped off {{immediately}} {{when it came}} out because {{at the time it was}} so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed , unfortunately." [...] Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: [...] "The idea of playing [...] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest—Mudhoney and Nirvana—and going <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off." ...|$|E

500|$|Darren McGavin {{makes an}} {{appearance}} as Arthur Dales in the episode, his second after being introduced in [...] "Travelers".

McGavin was later sought <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the role of Mulder's dad. In the end, McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show playing Arthur Dales, the agent who founded the X-Files. McGavin was originally supposed to also appear in the Duchovny-penned episode [...] "The Unnatural", but two days after filming began, he suffered a stroke, forcing the producers to remove his scenes from the episode and replace them with another [...] "Arthur Dales", played by M. Emmet Walsh.|$|E
500|$|Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly labeled [...] "Lucky Strike" [...] {{together}} with [...] "Payphone" [...] best tracks on Overexposed {{and described the}} former as [...] "a funk-spiked strut".

Digital Spy's Robert Copsey named the track {{together with}} [...] "One More Night" [...] and [...] "Ladykiller" [...] as a worthy for digital download. Chris Payne of Billboard wrote that on the song [...] "Maroon 5's guitars finally come <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the opening bars here. Though not a rock song per se, it still packs {{the energy of the}} band's earlier, more band-based material." [...] Cameron Adams of Herald Sun described [...] "Lucky Strike" [...] as [...] "uncharacteristically clubby".|$|E
500|$|House of Pain spent 10 days {{working on}} [...] "Gangstas iz Genocide". Alba {{digitally}} photographed images of buildings near the Marcy Houses in Brooklyn, New York.

The artists also improvised {{the use of a}} hand grenade. When Lee saw how violent the sequence was, he improvised the line [...] "Kill Dat Nigga!" [...] as a subtitle. The entire sequence was rendered <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> onscreen in full frame. The original running time of the animated sequence was 60 seconds. Lee cut it to 30 seconds, feeling that a shorter length would make more of an impact. Upon Inside Mans theatrical release, he regretted the video game sequence in the film, saying, [...] "The sad thing is somebody is probably gonna make a game out of it and take that as inspiration." ...|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King {{received}} a generally favorable response. IGN, reviewing the Japanese {{version of the}} game after its launch, {{was impressed with the}} quality and expansiveness of the game, saying that it was a [...] "good start" [...] to Nintendo's WiiWare download service. In a later review of the North American release they cited disappointment at not being able to undertake quests, calling it [...] "a Final Fantasy game where you stay at home and send other people <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Final Fantasy", and felt that elements of the game were repetitive. However, they praised the presentation and felt the game could be [...] "engaging if [...] put enough time into it". 1UP.com compared the game to Animal Crossing but with a distinct RPG feel, and praised the game for its depth. Other reviewers felt it had a [...] "plodding" [...] pace, but had a soundtrack that is [...] "quite good". Some wished the game ran in progressive scan mode, a deficit rectified in a later update.|$|E
500|$|In Saint-Briac, {{during the}} summer, Kirill played golf {{and he and}} Victoria joined in picnics and excursions.

[...] During the winter Victoria and her husband enjoyed visiting nearby Dinard and invited friends home for parties and games. [...] However, it was rumored in town that Kirill went to Paris [...] "for the occasional fling". Victoria, who had devoted her life to Kirill, was devastated when she discovered in 1933 that her husband had been unfaithful to her, according to correspondence of her sister Marie of Romania. She kept up a façade for the sake of her children, including her teenage son Vladimir, but was unable to forgive Kirill's betrayal. Victoria suffered a stroke soon after attending the christening of her fifth grandchild, Mechtilde of Leiningen, in February 1936. Family and friends arrived, but nothing could be done. When her closest sister reached her bedside Victoria was asked if she was glad Marie had come, to which Victoria haltingly replied, [...] "It makes all the difference." [...] However, she [...] "shuddered away from Kirill's touch," [...] wrote Marie. She died on 1 March 1936. Queen Marie eulogized her sister in a letter after her death: [...] "The whole thing was tragic beyond imagination, a tragic end to a tragic life. She carried tragedy within her – she had tragic eyes – always – even as a little girl – but we loved her enormously, there was something mighty about her – she was our Conscience." ...|$|E
