5|$|At {{the start}} of the year, Robson had reached the top 50 {{for the first time in}} her career. She {{followed}} this with her first victory at the Australian <b>Open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> convincing straight sets victory over Melanie Oudin. In the second round she played former Wimbledon champion, and fellow left-hander, Petra Kvitová. Robson came back after losing the first set to beat Kvitová in a three-hour match, to set up a third-round meeting with Sloane Stephens. After stopping for several shoulder treatments, Robson was eventually beaten in two sets. After the Australian Open, Robson played six matches in Fed Cup competition that saw Great Britain earn a World Group II Play-off spot against Argentina. Following this success she went on to lose two successive matches, losing to Daniela Hantuchová in Doha and to wildcard Yulia Putintseva in Dubai.|$|E

He returned to his regular racquet {{for the second half}} of the season. After Wimbledon, Federer continued to be upset early in tournaments in Hamburg and Gstaad because of a serious back injury through October, when he announced that he was parting ways with Paul Annacone, his coach for the last three years. Federer made the final in Basel, succumbing to Juan Martín del Potro in three sets, and indicated it was a mistake to have played certain tournaments while suffering from a back injury.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{stated that}} he {{conceived}} the Star Wars saga's story {{in the form of}} a plot outline in 1973. However, he later clarified that, at the time of the saga's conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points. He began working on Episode III even before the previous film, , was released, proposing to concept artists that the film would <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> montage of seven battles on seven planets. Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin's fall to the dark side and radically re-organized the plot. For instance, instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin, ending the film's first act with his killing of Count Dooku, an action that signals his descent to the dark side.|$|E
5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players take turns bidding {{on how many}} moves it will take them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bid of 15turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident {{in his ability to}} escape in 13rounds than in his ability to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the other player wins. Another workaround is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} the Millennium Monument was {{the starting point of}} the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, it is said to not compare to the once “commanding presence” that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15% to accommodate a wheel-chair ramp for the disabled in a tight space. It also includes a “classical” take on the original, incorporating a fountain {{at the base of the}} limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as the central focus to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape. Wrigley Square is unique for its fountain that, unlike Buckingham Fountain, which is fenced off, remains <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> circular ledge to allow park-goers the freedom to sit next to the open water to enjoy the atmosphere.|$|E
