25|$|The starry {{ceiling is}} astronomically {{inaccurate}} {{in a complicated}} way. While the stars within some constellations appear correctly as they would from earth, other constellations are reversed left-to-right, as is the overall arrangement of the constellations on the ceiling. For example, Orion is correctly rendered, but the adjacent constellations Taurus and Gemini are , with Taurus near Orion's raised arm where Gemini should be. One {{possible explanation is that}} the <b>overall</b> <b>ceiling</b> design might have been based on the medieval custom of depicting the sky as it would appear to God looking in at the celestial sphere from outside, but that would have reversed Orion as well. A more likely explanation is partially mistaken transcription of the sketch supplied by Columbia Astronomy professor Harold Jacoby. Though the astronomical inconsistencies were noticed promptly by a commuter in 1913, they have not been corrected in any of the subsequent renovations of the ceiling.|$|E

40|$|Top-down {{budgeting}} {{emerged in}} the 1990 s {{as a response to}} fiscal crisis. Previously, the traditional bottom-up approach to budget formulation had conferred centralised authority for resource allocation on the finance ministry. Then, in an attempt to control the growing fiscal deficits in the 1990 s, the finance ministry only set the <b>overall</b> expenditure <b>ceiling</b> and subceilings, and delegated detailed resource allocation decisions to line ministries. However, the level of delegation and the method of determining the expenditure ceilings vary across countries. This article describes country experiences with top-down budgeting and makes policy suggestions for its use as a tool for central resource management. The article also explores the relative advantages, disadvantages, and complementarities of the two approaches. ...|$|R

As the Rent Registration Service was staffed by civil servants it had to play its full part in helping to keep Scottish Office staff complement within the <b>overall</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Accordingly, no scope was seen for an amendment to the rent registration procedure which would result in increasing the workload by a third, particularly as the registration procedure in Scotland was not being streamlined as was taking place south of the border to enable Rent Officers there to cope with the increased workload.|$|E

40|$|Private {{investors have}} an {{important}} role toplay in the ongoing process of reform in Eastern Europe. So external creditworthiness is crucial to a successful transition. Large government borrowing crowds out the formation of private contracts between international investors and domestic entrepreneurs and firms. Given the <b>overall</b> credit <b>ceiling</b> in international lending, the public sector needs to curtail its external borrowing to leave room for the private sector. This also implies that public debt reduction may be especially desirable in the highly indebted countries of Eastern Europe. Rather than flood the public sector with new loans, international organizations should attempt to improve domestic creditworthiness by supporting debt reduction and borrowing restraints during the transition period. Debt for equity swaps represent an attractive vehicle for debt reduction in the highly indebted countries of Eastern Europe. Such schemes, when tied to the privatization effort, are not inflationary. They simply represent a swap of public liabilities, and they create value to the extent that foreign private investment leads to positive externalities. The challenge will be to create swap mechanisms that will allow the Eastern European countries to retain a large share of those gains.

40|$|Japanese food {{processors}} have been faced with {{internal and external}} squeezes in recent years. Internally, the industry is faced with an <b>overall</b> demand <b>ceiling</b> due to Engel's law and a rapidly changing demand structure due to the "westernisation" of the Japanese consumers' taste. Externally, the industry is faced with increased import competition {{as a result of}} the liberalisation of the Japanese import market for agricultural and processed food products. Under these pressures, performance of the Japanese {{food processors}} in terms of productivity and profitability, is found to be below average, compared with Japanese manufacturing as a whole. Associated with the deteriorating productivity and profitability performance, Japanese food processors have stepped up their foreign direct investment (FDI) activities in the Asia-Pacific region. This development provides both challenge and opportunities for Australian producers and food processors. As most of the Japanese FDIs are either domestic market or export oriented, they are likely to pose serious competition for Australian firms. At the same time, through joint ventures with Japanese firms, the Australian food processors may acquire the inside knowledge of the Asian market which would enable them to capitalise on the enormous opportunities in the Asian food market.

30|$|The present {{structure}} of the Hungarian leave system has been shaped through changes influenced by very different approaches during successive governmental cycles. Probably {{due to the lack}} of overall consensus about the function of childcare leave (whether to promote childbirth, children’s development, women’s labor market participation, women’s equality, etc.), there is now one strand (GYES) that is available universally for those who have not had the necessary number of insured days (work) before giving birth, and another one (GYED) for those who had been insured. GYES is paid at a flat rate, equal to the amount of the minimum old age pension. Payment for GYED is at 70 % of earnings up to a specified <b>ceiling.</b> <b>Overall,</b> the prevalence of financial support for families has not changed. None of the governments developed ECEC services for children (especially nurseries and family day care) as much as they could have.|$|R
40|$|On November 4, 1980, Massachusetts voters {{approved}} Proposition 2. This measure limited local property taxes to 2. 5 percent of assessed value and restricted property tax revenue growth {{to no more}} than 2. 5 percent a year. Local voters can vote to override the 2. 5 percent increase, but not if it would result in exceeding the 2. 5 percent <b>overall</b> <b>ceiling.</b> An override results in a permanent increase in the city or town‟s levy limit. The most common rationales for such action would be a need for public services or facilities that property tax revenues were insufficient to fund under the limit, or in response to stagnation or loss of revenue due to insufficient property tax base growth and/or a reduction in state aid. The current economic conditions are a perfect case in point. The recent downturn has resulted in difficult times for local governments which are faced with reducing expenditures (e. g. teacher layoffs) or passing overrides to increase revenues. We look at the role that Proposition 2 has played in the fiscal conditions of towns in Massachusetts. To do so, we develop a model of Proposition 2 override decisions and local fiscal conditions. We estimate the model using data on Proposition 2 overrides since the mid- 1980 ‟s as well as other town-level socioeconomic and fiscal information...|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional {{study of}} {{patients}} with whiplash-associated disorders investigating the internal consistency, factor structure, response rates, and presence of floor and ceiling effects of the Whiplash Disability Questionnaire (WDQ). OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to confirm the appropriateness of the proposed WDQ items. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Whiplash injuries are a common cause of pain and disability after motor vehicle accidents. Neck disability questionnaires are often used in whiplash studies to assess neck pain but lack content validity for patients with whiplash-associated disorders. The newly developed WDQ measures functional limitations associated with whiplash injury and was designed after interviews with 83 patients with whiplash in a previous study. METHODS: Researchers sought expert opinion on items of the WDQ, and items were then tested on a clinical whiplash population. Data were inspected to determine floor and ceiling effects, response rates, factor structure, and internal consistency. Packages of questionnaires were distributed to 55 clinicians, whose patients with whiplash completed and returned 101 questionnaires to researchers. RESULTS: No substantial floor or ceiling effects were identified on inspection of data. The overall floor effect was 12 %, and the <b>overall</b> <b>ceiling</b> effect was 4 %. Principal component analysis identified one broad factor that accounted for 65 % of the variance in responses. Internal consistency was high; Cronbach's alpha = 0. 96. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study supported the retention of the 13 proposed items in a whiplash-specific disability questionnaire. Dependent on the results of further psychometric testing, the WDQ is likely to be an appropriate outcome measure for patients with whiplas...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the overall}} {{internship}} opportunity this semester was to learn and practice the elements of engineering design through direct exposure to real engineering problems. The primary exposure was to design and manufacture an airbrake device for use with small-medium scale rocket applications. The idea {{was to take the}} presented concept of a solution and transform said concept into a reliable fully-functioning and reusable mechanism. The mechanism was to be designed as an insurance feature so that the overall altitude of a rocket with relatively undetermined engine capabilities does not unexpectedly exceed the imposed 10, 000 foot ceiling, per range requirements. The airbrake concept was introduced to the Prototype Development Lab as a rotation-driven four tiered offset track pin mechanism, i. e. the airbrake was deployed by rotating a central shaft attached directly to the bottom plate. The individual airbrake fins were subsequently deployed using multiple plates with tracks of offset curvature. The fins were created with guide pins to follow the tracks in each of the offset plates, thus allowing the simultaneous rotational deployment of all fins by only rotating one plate. The concept of this solution was great; though it did not function in application. The rotating plates alone brought up problems like the entire back half of the rocket rotating according to the motion of the aforementioned base plate. Subsequently, the solution currently under development became a static linear actuator-driven spring-loaded fin release system. This solution is almost instantaneously triggered electronically when the avionics detect that the rocket has reached the calculated altitude of deceleration. This altitude will allow enough time remaining to the <b>overall</b> <b>ceiling</b> to adequately decelerate the rocket prior to reaching the ceiling...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between the perceived glass ceiling, perceptions of promotion fairness, and attitudinal outcomes for a sample of Hispanic lawyers. The results showed that gender and perceptions of ethnic discrimination were positively related to percep-tions of a glass ceiling, whereas the proportion of Hispanic law associates in the organization was negatively related to a perceived glass ceiling. The perceived glass ceiling was negatively related to perceptions of promotion fairness, which in turn were positively related to perceived career prospects and negatively related to intentions to leave. <b>Overall,</b> perceived glass <b>ceiling</b> had a substantial impact on turnover intentions.

40|$|This {{document}} {{concerns the}} award of blanket contracts for {{the supply of}} the three following categories of equipment for the period 2001 - 2004 : a) desktop PCs (complete PC systems but without display monitors), b) display monitors (conventional CRTs or flat screen LCDs) and c) portable PCs (also called notebooks or laptops). Following a market survey carried out among 41 firms in fourteen Member States, an invitation to tender (IT- 2692 /IT) was sent on 19 May 2000 to 12 firms and three consortia, each consisting of two firms, in five Member States. By the closing date, CERN had received seven tenders, all from the Swiss subsidiaries of the firms and consortia. The Finance Committee is invited {{to agree to the}} negotiation of - blanket contracts with VOBIS (CH), ELONEX (CH) and FUJITSU-SIEMENS (CH), the three lowest bidders complying with the specification, for the supply of Desktop PCs; - blanket contracts with VOBIS (CH), SYNOPTIC (CH) and ELONEX (CH), the three lowest bidders offering display monitors manufactured in the Member States, for the supply of Display Monitors; - blanket contracts with PORTABLE SHOP (CH), DAREST & SUNSET (CH), FUJITSU-SIEMENS (CH) and MEDASYS-HEWLETT PACKARD (CH), the four lowest bidders complying with the specification, for the supply of Portable PCs. The above-mentioned blanket contracts will replace the existing contracts with VOBIS, ELONEX and HEWLETT-PACKARD. In the interest of flexibility and of maintaining competition in a rapidly evolving market, it is proposed to have the possibility of placing orders with any of the approved suppliers for each category while remaining within an <b>overall</b> annual <b>ceiling</b> of 7 000 000 Swiss francs.

40|$|Firms make optimal {{decisions}} {{on the level of}} various marketing-mix variables to maximize profits. Some of these marketing-mix variables are unobserved by researchers, yet they are important to understand when they are endogenous in that a firm has incentives to increase or decrease them depending on how they change its profit. This thesis is focused on understanding a firm's incentive in two unobservable, endogenous decisions: workforce diversity and service effort. This thesis further builds theoretical frameworks around these two concepts, validates/estimates the model using public and proprietary data, and draws implications in market competition and policy experiment. The literature in business, psychology, and sociology shows that there is a trade-off in hiring diverse workforce: diversity brings creative ideas that help solving problems, but it also creates friction among members. Under competition, the decision on the level of diversity of workforce is an important strategic decision that gives firms a competitive edge. We build a theoretical model with symmetric firms and find that the better a firm can deal with a diverse workforce or the more competition there is in the market, the more diverse workforce the firm will hire. We also find that a firm's profit decreases with the intensity of market competition as expected, but increases with the firm's inability to deal with diverse workforce as the inability deters competition between firms. Finally, we extend the model to firms with asymmetric private marginal costs and empirically validate the positive relationship between the diversity of workforce and the intensity of competition (industry concentration ratio, in particular) using two datasets from 1997 : National Organizations Survey and Economics Census. Service effort, often referred to as customer service, is also another important unobservable, endogenous decision that firms must make. Empirically quantifying or measuring the service effort is difficult because it is often unobservable. This paper proposes an empirical framework of the role of service effort in demand, along with other traditional marketing mix instruments. This model allows us to measure the unobserved effort level without data on effort, which is hardly available in most empirical settings. The paper also presents an application to a unique data set obtained from a franchise operating in the car radiator market. This framework can be useful in examining various aspects of service-intensive industries. In particular, this study investigates a much-debated public policy question regarding resale price ceiling in franchising. A policy evaluation shows that resale price ceiling lowers franchisees' profits and weakens their incentive to exert effort, which reduces consumer welfare. However, I find that, <b>overall,</b> resale price <b>ceiling</b> enhance consumer welfare in the car radiator market due to the lower price generated by the price ceiling...|$|R
