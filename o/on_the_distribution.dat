5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} tansy beetle {{occupancy}} amongst 1305 patches (stems separated by {{no more than}} 50cm) of the tansy plant {{on the banks of the}} River Ouse (York, UK) intended to establish data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> of tansy plants and relate this to existing tansy beetle populations in order to contribute to the conservation effort of the species. The results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that the tansy patches should be managed towards volumes of 3m and that these patches should be targeted within 200m of existing beetle subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help the beetle population disperse and survive.|$|E

5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford's law <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E

In the fifth chapter he sets out his theory as a unified explanation for the findings of the previous chapters, overcoming the difficulties of treating the various kinds of reef as separate and the problem of reliance on the improbable assumption that underwater mountains just happened to be at the exact depth below sea level, by showing how barrier reefs and then atolls form as the land subsides, and fringing reefs are found along with evidence that the land is being elevated. This chapter ends with a summary of his theory illustrated with two woodcuts each showing two different stages of reef formation in relation to sea level.|$|E

40|$|A large {{literature}} has {{been concerned with}} the impacts of recent welfare reforms on income, earnings, transfers, and labor-force attachment. While one strand of this literature relies on observational studies conducted with large survey-sample data sets, a second makes use of data generated by experimental evaluations of changes to means-tested programs. Much of the overall {{literature has}} focused on mean impacts. In this paper, we use random-assignment experimental data from Canada 9 ̆ 2 s Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP) to look at impacts of this unique reform <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>distributions</b> of income, earnings, and transfers. SSP offered members of the treatment group a generous subsidy for working full time. Quantile treatment effect (QTE) estimates show there was considerable heterogeneity in the impacts of SSP <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>distributions</b> of earnings, transfers, and total income; heterogeneity that would be missed by looking only at average treatment effects. Moreover, these heterogeneous impacts {{are consistent with the}} predictions of labor supply theory. During the period when the subsidy is available, <b>the</b> SSP impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earnings <b>distribution</b> is zero for the bottom half of <b>the</b> <b>distribution.</b> <b>The</b> SSP earnings <b>distribution</b> is higher for much of the upper third of <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> except at <b>the</b> very top, where <b>the</b> earnings <b>distribution</b> is <b>the</b> same under either program or possibly lower under SSP. Further, during the period when SSP receipt was possible, <b>the</b> impacts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>distributions</b> of transfer payments (IA plus the subsidy) and total income (earnings plus transfers) are also different at different points of <b>the</b> <b>distribution.</b> In particular, positive impacts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transfer <b>distribution</b> are concentrated {{at the lower end of}} <b>the</b> transfer <b>distribution</b> while positive impacts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> income <b>distribution</b> are concentrated in the upper end of <b>the</b> income <b>distribution.</b> Impacts of SSP on these distributions were essentially zero after the subsidy was no longer availabl...|$|R

Turunen responded through an open letter on her website and through some interviews in which she explained her view. She was upset that after nine years of working together, Holopainen announced the separation via an open letter. Because of the continuing media interest, Marcelo Cabuli posted a message addressing the situation on the website in February 2006. He asked that anyone who had questions should email him. In June 2006, Cabuli posted a lengthy reply to many of the questions he had received. He answered questions related to the greed accusation by explaining that the band had agreed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> of earnings in a contract at the formation of Nightwish. Based on that contract, every band member got a fixed share of 20% of the band's income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.|$|E

The worm then decides, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it will take. The directions are relative to the worm's point of view.

If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E
5|$|Honduras was a {{relatively}} poor province and did not attract the most distinguished conquistadors. Most conquistadors and colonists who ventured to Honduras desired to return quickly to Spain with newly acquired wealth and improved social status, and were therefore looking for immediate enrichment. The progress of conquest was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>distribution</b> of encomienda rights and land concessions. Encomienda gave the encomendero (holder of the encomienda) the right to receive tribute and labour from the indigenous inhabitants of a defined area. Up {{until the middle of}} the 16th century, the encomendero could assign his own level of tribute and labour to be provided by the natives within his encomienda, which gave rise to much abuse. The encomiendas established in Honduras were small, and did not generate rapid income. Social advancement was gained by overlordship of natives within the encomienda system. In Honduras, the conquistadors gained immediate income by selling natives into slavery on the Caribbean islands and in Panama, and by mining activities. This in turn resulted in a reduction of indigenous population levels in Honduras, with a rapid drop in economic production {{during the first half of}} the 16th century. On the whole, the Spanish colonists were unwilling to invest time and resources into the long-term development of the agricultural production of their encomiendas in Honduras.|$|E
