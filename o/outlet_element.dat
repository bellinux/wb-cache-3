40|$|Integration of side inlet and/or {{side outlet}} {{expansion}} chambers {{into the rest}} of the muffler system for prediction of overall transmission loss (TL) or insertion loss requires knowledge of the four-pole parameters of these elements for propagation of plane waves in a moving medium. In this paper, transfer matrices have been derived for side inlet and side <b>outlet</b> <b>elements</b> for typically small mean flow Mach numbers. These are validated against the 3 -D model existing in the literature for a stationary medium and for acoustically long chambers. The effect of mean flow on TL of the side inlet/outlet chambers has been demonstrated. Incidentally, {{it has been shown that}} side inlets and side outlets behave more or less like extended inlets and extended outlets, respectivel...|$|R
40|$|I {{have written}} {{previously}} of the commonly held belief by writers that reading {{is the foundation}} of good writing. That’s all reading of course, the good, the mediocre, the bad and the truly awful with no boundaries placed on where the written word appears or how or why it was created. I draw an analogy with this and the teaching of photography as a visual language and I’d now like to extend that analogy to the logical <b>outlet</b> for connective <b>elements</b> of language - the narrative...|$|R
5000|$|Screened porches can be {{built in}} a manner similar to that of pole barns, with the screens added after the {{structure}} of the walls and the roof is completed. While screen porches are often attached to houses, they are sometimes built separately in order to simplify the construction process. In order to ensure that the porch be impervious to insects and other intrusions, a screen door is typically added to facilitate entry. Because screens can reduce the amount of light that enters the porch's interior, some screened porches are built so that the screens can be removed at times when insects and sunlight are less of a problem to the resident. [...] Some homeowners fill their porches with furniture and amenities typically found indoors, such as tables, chairs, and couches, ceiling fans, imitation hardwood floors, electrical <b>outlets,</b> painted <b>elements,</b> and even built-in furniture and plumbing.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuous}} HCl in-air indicator {{was developed}} {{which consists of}} a tube-like element with an inlet end through which a continuous stream of air containing HCl enters. The air flows downstream from the inlet end and exits the <b>element's</b> <b>outlet</b> end. Positioned between the <b>element's</b> inlet and <b>outlet</b> ends are first and second spaced apart photoelectric units, which are preferably positioned adjacent the inlet and outlet ends, respectively. Ammonia gas is injected into the air, flowing through the element, at a position between the two photoelectric units. The ammonia gas reacts with the HCl {{in the air to}} form ammonium chloride particles. The difference between the outputs of the two photoelectric units is an indication of the amount of HCl in the air stream...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel {{continuous}} electrodeless separation structure based on dielectrophoresis (DEP). The non-uniform electric field {{is generated by}} applying voltage over a circular channel. Driven by the electro-osmotic flow, the particles with different dielectric properties move continuously to the different location across the channel as they flow due to the different DEP force, thus continuously separated into the different <b>outlets.</b> The finite <b>element</b> modelling and simulation results show it can separate particles of different dielectric properties in both spatial and time domain. Compared with the previously reported dieletrophoretic separation using electrode arrays [1 - 10], this structure is more easily fabricated, mechanically robust and chemically inert. And compared with the previously reported electrodeless dielectrophoretic separation methods [11 - 14], this structure achieves higher throughput and continuous separation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The low gravity {{liquid level}} sensor rake {{measures}} the liquid surface height of propellant in a propellant tank used in launch and spacecraft vehicles. The device reduces the tendency of the liquid propellant {{to adhere to the}} sensor elements after the bulk liquid level has dropped below a given sensor element thereby reducing the probability of a false liquid level measurement. The {{liquid level sensor}} rake has a mast attached internal to a propellant tank with an end attached adjacent the tank <b>outlet.</b> Multiple sensor <b>elements</b> that have an arm and a sensor attached at a free end thereof are attached to the mast at locations selected for sensing {{the presence or absence of}} the liquid. The sensor elements when attached to the mast have a generally horizontal arm and a generally vertical sensor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In Hungary, the prevalently used “B 11 ” type gas {{appliances}} equipped with atmospheric burner {{and they have}} a draught hood beyond the outlet of the appliance. For the appropriate adjustment of the gas boiler to the conditions of the building, computer-generated calculation results have to be obtained which can help the positioning of the appliance and the air supply outlets in the room in which the appliance is installed. Chimneys of natural draught are very sensitive to the changes in the amount of combustion air due to inside or outside ambient phenomena or forced effects. For the purposes of modelling, a numerical simulation (CFD method) can be used. The aim of numeric modelling is to investigate velocity and temperature conditions around the flue gas outlet and in the room and, subsequently, to define design approaches and the requirements for different conditions. The conclusion of our investigations is that the air supply of the room can be accomplished with correctly sized air <b>outlets</b> and inlet <b>elements...</b>|$|R
40|$|Starting {{with basic}} {{equations}} of mass continuity and momentum balance, incorporating viscous damping, the finite radial impedances {{of the cable}} {{as well as the}} hose, and the convective effect of mean flow, coupled wave equations have been derived for waves inside the cable and also in the annulus of a cable-hose system. These have been solved together as an eigenvalue problem, and thence a 4 × 4 transfer matrix has been derived. Applying appropriate boundary conditions, the desired 2 × 2 transfer matrices have then been derived for the extended inlet and extended <b>outlet</b> type of <b>elements.</b> Then, axial transmission loss has been calculated for a typical cable-hose configuration and has been compared with that computed by the classical equivalent sound-speed model in vogue, which has been shown here (as well as earlier for hoses) to be a special case where the tube wall is assumed to be elastic but massless. Finally, the effect of breakout noise on the design of cable-hose systems is discussed...|$|R
2500|$|The Princess and the Frog was {{originally}} announced as The Frog Princess in July 2006, and early concepts and songs {{were presented to}} the public at the Walt Disney Company's annual shareholders' meeting in March 2007. These announcements drew criticism from African-American media <b>outlets,</b> due to <b>elements</b> of the Frog Princess story, characters, and settings considered distasteful. African-American critics disapproved of the original name for the heroine, [...] "Maddy", due to its similarity to the derogatory term [...] "mammy". Also protested were Maddy's original career as a chambermaid, the choice to have the black heroine's love interest be a non-black prince, which upset opponents of on-screen interracial romance, and the use of a black male voodoo witchdoctor as the film's villain. The Frog Princess title was also thought by critics to be a slur on French people. Also questioned was the film's setting of New Orleans, which had been heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, resulting in the expulsion {{of a large number of}} mostly black residents. Critics claimed the choice of New Orleans as the setting for a Disney film with a black heroine was an affront to the Katrina victims' plight.|$|R
50|$|Planning {{for further}} {{improvement}} in treatment and supply facility was undertaken in 2004. This was to ensure removal of potential contaminants from the Lower Stone Canyon Reservoir water. This was proposed {{to conform to}} the safe drinking water standards through a microfiltration plant that would treat the surface water through membrane filtration along with chemical disinfection before it entered the distribution system. This new plant also provided for fully automated remote operation. This plant was located in a valley on the left abutment of Lower Stone Canyon Dam near the existing reservoir <b>outlet.</b> All visible <b>elements</b> were Architectural aesthetics ensured adoption of existing trees with its precincts and acoustics of operation ensuring an ambient noise level of not more than 30 decibels. The project titled “The Stone Canyon Water Quality Improvement Project” was undertaken by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power with allocation of $75 million. The project construction was started in 2004 and completed by the end of 2007. Along with this project, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also undertook an upgrade of the security and safety of the city’s water system at a cost of $132 million spent over a five-year period. This security initiative was an outcome of the terrorist attacks of 9/11.|$|R
40|$|Wetlands fed by rivers {{can be a}} sink for {{elements}} {{depending on}} elemental concentrations, wetland hydrology, geochemistry, vegetation and climate. In {{the case of the}} Okavango Delta, northern Botswana, the outflow discharge is a small fraction (2 – 5 %) of the inflow. This has strong potential consequences for the Delta, as it strongly affects element cycling and storage within the Delta. We estimated the inputs, behaviour and distribution of multiple elements along a longitudinal transect within the Okavango Delta, to show potential effects of retention mechanisms of different elements. High annual element input is rather attributed to discharge than to the concentration within the water, which is generally extremely low. We observed minimal enrichment of the elements within the water pathway along the transect from inflow to <b>outlets,</b> implying that <b>element</b> output is negligible. For most elements, we observed a high correlation between storage and sediment organic matter content. The organic matter content within the sediments was higher in the vegetated sediments than in non-vegetated sediments (factor ∼ 10), and a similar trend was found for most elements. In conclusion, organic matter dominated in sediments from vegetated plots and thus {{plays an important role in}} retaining the elements within the sediments of the Delta. This finding has major implications for e. g. planning constructed wetlands for water purification or element retention especially in areas with high evapotranspiration...|$|R
40|$|The {{warehouse}} {{will be seen}} as an <b>outlet</b> of décor <b>elements</b> {{and designer}} furniture as well as of South African and international décor shops and designs. A showroom of designer furniture (of well-known designers like Rietveld, Graves, Gehry, etc.) for the public and interested and affected parties will be provided. All the different functions must be integrated and the interaction between various designers and different décor elements will form an important aspect of the warehouse. DiD Warehouse must facilitate innovation and welcome new talents among collaborators along with the "design consumer", an informed and sensitive buyer who, by setting in motion a buying project of his own, is transforming distribution. Even retailers will have to change their attitude, and get rid of the "museum store" concept, that is, a space where the objects on display cannot be touched. The warehouse should be seen as an event place, which has a give-and-take relationship with the life and culture of the city and which attracts the visitor, plying him with emotions and services over and above a simple exchange of merchandise and money over a counter. Growth of any kind brings with it an ability to keep changing, doing away with moldy prejudices {{to make room for the}} new. Transformation, movement and lightness are, in the end, the words that best sum up the character of what the designer warehouse must be in the future. Time, scale and functional differences must be solved through the design and planning of spaces. The building {{will be seen as}} a "container". South African and international influences, as well as space perceptions of the Post-Modernist era, must be incorporated to set a precedent for the warehouse. A true South African influence and modern style will be reflected through the architecture. The furniture and décor elements will form part of the building and architecture, and must complement each other. DiD Warehouse will house historical and current designer furniture and décor elements, to ensure prospects, possibilities and opportunities for designers of the future. Local designers will get exposure to the international design industry, and a standard for each design and designer will be set. Differences versus similarities must positively reflect the diversity of South African and international design. Import and export of designer furniture and décor are going to be very important aspects in the administration and economical management of the warehouse. The architecture and interior design of the warehouse will complement each other and create the same feeling, that of inspiration, creativity, modern design, imagination, reality and exclusivity. a designer masterpiece as well. Every well-known architect has designed a piece of furniture in his/her life The building will reflect its function and the activities within the façade and architecture, and will aim to be time and the relationship between architecture and designer furniture is very important and dynamic. One of the most important functions of the building will be to launch careers and test ideas. The exterior (architecture and façade) will set a standard for what is inside the building and the warehouse will aim to set a precedent for future furniture development in South Africa. The building will strive to be a very important catalyst in generating designer décor and furniture. There is a demand for steady retail, which will revive the industrial and export sector. South Africa remains the powerhouse of the continent and medium to long-term prospects are good. This means that deals that can be successful today will become that much more attractive in the future. The warehouse must encourage other designers to make conscious use of design as a factor in the competitive process. Precedents will be the platform of the final product. The building must be adaptable and flexible to accommodate continuous changes in technology, fashion and the changing environment and way of living of each person. It must be flexible in terms of more possibilities, greater prospects and better investments. Young entrepreneurs must have the opportunity to show their designs. The warehouse will be educational in a theoretical, practical and visual way. Furniture design courses will be held from time to time as well as exhibitions held by entrepreneurs and "young-up-and-coming" designers. That will create contrasts in price and experience. The aim of the thesis is to design a modern designer furniture and décor warehouse (situated in a security business park) to fulfill the needs of the community and industry; to investigate well-known architects and furniture designers theoretical approaches and philosophy towards design; to ensure that DiD Warehouse will be one of its kind in South Africa; to set a market for our local talent and to reflect diversity in today's modern designer furniture and décor; to showcase local and international design for the public and to give everyone easy access to and from the building; and finally, to create a place (warehouse) from another century, not of the past but of the future - based on human relationships, master intelligence, respect and loyalty; which will hold the key to our future in design - the rediscovery of compassion.
