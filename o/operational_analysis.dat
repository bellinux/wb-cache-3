He was {{the chief of the}} <b>Operational</b> <b>Analysis</b> Section of the Eighth Air Force in England. He won the Legion of Merit from the United States, and the Croix de guerre from both France and Belgium. In 1946 Harlan returned to private law practice representing Du Pont family members against a federal antitrust lawsuit. In 1951, however, he returned to public service, serving as Chief Counsel to the New York State Crime Commission, where he investigated the relationship between organized crime and the state government as well as illegal gambling activities in New York and other areas. During this period Harlan also served as a committee chairman of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and to which he was later elected vice president. Harlan's main specialization at that time was corporate and anti-trust law.|$|E
5|$|Radar {{was also}} {{employed}} {{to determine the}} size of the hurricane's eye, stated to be roughly 13mi (20km) in diameter, following a 6-mile (10km) decrease due to the strengthening. Light wind shear surrounding the hurricane allowed further strengthening to take place. Late on August2, the system attained winds of 135mph (215km/h), making it a Category4 storm. During the afternoon of August3, Guillermo nearly attained Category5 intensity as it reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) along with a barometric pressure estimated at 925mbar (hPa; 27.32inHg). A brief period of weakening took place later that day before further strengthening ensued. Late on August4, Guillermo intensified into a Category5 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h). <b>Operational</b> <b>analysis</b> of satellite information indicated a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg); however, post-storm studies stated that the pressure was more likely around 919mbar (hPa; 27.14inHg).|$|E

25|$|The {{board was}} created by a letter from General Herbert B.

Its eventual membership consisted of 240 military personnel and 53 civilians, not counting those assigned to troop tests, <b>operational</b> <b>analysis,</b> and war gaming. The Board consisted of a governing board, a review committee, an advisory panel, and a secretariat. An additional steering committee was formed from the board president (Howze), the review committee, and the secretariat. All {{but one of the}} men mentioned in McNamara's original memo were included on the board, either on the review committee or the secretariat.

500|$|Intensification {{took place}} through 22March as {{convection}} deepened around Kathy's centre and a well-defined eye formed. The system {{reached its peak}} strength as a Category5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale with ten-minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph). <b>Operational</b> <b>analysis</b> of the storm indicated a minimum pressure of 920hPa (mbar; 27.17inHg); however, a reassessment in 2009 concluded that Kathy's pressure had been slightly lower, bottoming out at 916hPa (mbar; 27.05inHg). Additionally, the JTWC assessed the system to have been slightly stronger, estimating peak one-minute sustained winds at 250km/h (155mph).

500|$|Early on September21, it was {{estimated}} that the center of the hurricane made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana with winds of 115mph (185km/h). A pressure of 952mbar (hPa; 28.11inHg) was recorded around this time, the lowest in relation to the storm. <b>Operational</b> <b>analysis</b> of the storm indicated that it attained the equivalent intensity of a Category4 hurricane as it made landfall. The storm's lowest pressure was also operationally listed as 931mbar (hPa; 27.49inHg). This pressure was based on operational estimates in relation to the system's storm surge and was not directly measured. However, later research of the storm determined that its winds had not exceeded 120mph (185km/h). At this time, the hurricane's radius of maximum wind was roughly [...] and the overall size of the storm {{was estimated}} to be [...] wide. Once overland, the system quickly weakened, losing hurricane status within 12hours and later to a tropical depression over southern Missouri. The remnants of the system were last noted on September22 as it merged with a trough over the Midwestern United States.|$|E
50|$|Bayesian <b>Operational</b> Modal <b>Analysis</b> (BAYOMA) {{adopts a}} Bayesian system {{identification}} approach for <b>Operational</b> Modal <b>Analysis</b> (OMA). <b>Operational</b> Modal <b>Analysis</b> (OMA) aims at identifying the modal properties (natural frequencies, damping ratios, mode shapes, etc.) of a constructed structure using only its (output) vibration response (e.g., velocity, acceleration) measured under operating conditions. The (input) excitations {{to the structure}} are not measured but {{are assumed to be}} 'ambient' ('broadband random'). In a Bayesian context, the set of modal parameters are viewed as uncertain parameters or random variables whose probability distribution is updated from the prior distribution (before data) to the posterior distribution (after data). The peak(s) of the posterior distribution represents the most probable value(s) (MPV) suggested by the data, while the spread of the distribution around the MPV reflects the remaining uncertainty of the parameters.|$|R
