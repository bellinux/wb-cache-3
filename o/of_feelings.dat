5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common.

5|$|The {{documents}} {{most often}} cited to justifying {{the elimination of}} Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and {{context of the use}} of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> unsure as viewed from the humanbecoming school of thought. From the humanbecoming perspective feeling unsure is a universal lived experience of health and quality of life. The purposes of this study were to understand the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> unsure from the humanbecoming perspective, to enhance understanding of the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> unsure as an essence of health and quality of life, to discover the structure of the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> unsure, to add to the body of knowledge on the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> unsure, and to contribute to expand the theory of humanbecoming. The Parse research methodology was used to guide this study and answer the question: Whqt is the structure of the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> unsure? Ten persons living in community accepted to participate in this study. The processes of dialogical engagement, extraction-synthesis, and heuristic interpretation were used for data gathering and analysis. The central finding of this study is Feeling unsure is wavering irresolutely with discerning ponderings arising in venturing with trepidations, while revering alliances. The findings of this study emerged as new knowledge that extend the theory of humanbecoming and enhance the understanding of the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> unsure...|$|R
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media {{only in terms of}} the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports teams should be eliminated. Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects. The accumulation of research on the harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{experience}} <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> fat {{has been}} implicated as a maintenance factor in Anorexia Nervosa (AN); however, {{little research has}} been conducted into the experience. The present study aimed to explore the experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> fat for women with an AN diagnosis. It was hoped that this would provide an insight into the experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> fat and the ways it could be addressed within therapeutic interventions for AN. Methodology: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven women with an AN diagnosis. All participants were receiving therapy {{at the time of their}} interview. The verbatim transcripts from these interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) in order to explore the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> fat for women with an AN diagnosis. Results: Four superordinate themes emerged from the analysis, these were: negative sense <b>of</b> self; <b>feeling</b> out <b>of</b> control; coping with feeling fat and the complex notion <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> fat. These superordinate themes and corresponding subordinate themes are discussed. Implications: Feeling fat was found to be a significant experience for the adult women who participated within this study. This research highlights the importance of addressing the experience <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> fat within therapeutic interventions for adult women with an AN diagnosis. The clinical relevance of these findings are explored...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{psychotherapy}} researchers are studying in-session events that signify therapeutic change, process or progress. Similarly, a number of psychotherapy theorists have suggested that client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> is related to therapeutic change, process and progress. The {{purpose of the present}} research was to: (a) examine the relationship between client change events and client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling,</b> (b) identify what particular levels of client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> are related to given categories of client change events, and (c) examine the effects that type of therapy may have in the relationship between client change events and client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling.</b> Judges assessed the occurrence of categories of client change events and the level of client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> in 982 statements in 10 sessions of client-centered, rational-emotive and experiential therapies. The findings indicated that: (a) there is an overall positive significant relationship between client change events and client strength of feeling; (b) given categories of client change events are significantly related to particular levels of client strength of feeling; and (c) type of therapy is a significant variable in the relationship between client change events and client strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling.</b> These findings have implications for psychotherapeutic practice and also for clinical theory, with especial relevance for the role and meaning of level <b>of</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>feeling,</b> in-session client change, and a practitioner relevant matrix of conducting sessions of therapy {{on the basis of the}} research variables.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to examine the {{relationships}} among the degree <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> at ease to the person who eases one’s mind, the assessments about time spent alone or with others,and adult attachment styles. The participants were 156 undergraduates. They were asked to respond to each item of questionnaire. The main results were as follows: 1) “Anxiety” predicted the degree <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> at ease to time spent with mother for male and females, 2) Both “Loneliness/Anxiety” and “Avoidance” predicted the degree <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> at ease to time spent alone for male, whereas for females only the latter did. 3) “Avoidance” predicted the degree <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> at ease to time spent with current friend for males, whereas for females “Anxiety” did. These results were interpreted as showing that the assessments about time spent alone or with others and adult attachment style determined the degree <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> at ease to the person who eases one’s mind. Further tasks to be examined were discussed in terms of Ibasho (person who eases one’s mind) ...|$|R

25|$|An Archive <b>of</b> <b>Feelings</b> focuses {{specifically}} on lesbian and queer trauma. Cvetkovich explores works on butch and femme sexualities {{in relation to}} trauma and touch, {{as well as the}} complex relationship between incest, lesbianism, and queerness; here, she analyzes performances by Tribe 8 at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival and works by Margaret Randall and Dorothy Allison. Another section of Cvetkovich's book discusses trauma and queer diaspora in Frances Negrón-Muntaner's film, Brincando el charco; Pratibha Parmar's film, Khush; and Shani Mootoo's novel, Cereus Blooms at Night. Furthermore, An Archive <b>of</b> <b>Feelings</b> contains substantial discussion on AIDS activism, particularly in relation to the organization ACT UP. Drawing upon oral interviews with lesbians who participated in ACT UP – as well as memoirs about caretaking during the AIDS crisis – Cvetkovich seeks to place lesbians back into the history of ACT UP during a time when the organization was “in danger of being remembered as a group of privileged gay white men without a strong political sensibility.” In their testimony, these interviews and memoirs form an archive <b>of</b> <b>feelings,</b> producing a lesbian public culture where affective life and political life coalesce.|$|E
