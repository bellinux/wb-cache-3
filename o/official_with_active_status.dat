40|$|OBJECTIVE: A high {{prevalence}} of obesity has been observed among former World Trade Center (WTC) workers and volunteers. We hypothesized that unemployment and disability status would predict obesity. METHODS: We surveyed 220 subjects at the [INST] WTC Clinical Center to assess their obesity and current employment and disability status, WTC occupational exposure level, medical comorbidities, dietary and exercise habits. Bivariate and logistic regression multivariate analyses were used to explore associated risk factors. RESULTS: Obesity was associated <b>with</b> <b>active</b> employment <b>status.</b> Other significant covariates included Non-Latino African American race, having {{a high number of}} comorbid chronic diseases, low exercise frequency, and not drinking any glass of juice daily. CONCLUSIONS: The association of obesity <b>with</b> <b>active</b> employment suggests that interventions that favor healthy habits among actively employed individuals are warranted...|$|R

40|$|Background: Candidates may {{be active}} or {{temporarily}} inactive (status 7) on the kidney transplant waiting list. One reason candidates may be inactive {{is for a}} “weight currently inappropriate for transplantation”. We hypothesized {{that many of these}} candidates would not achieve <b>active</b> <b>status.</b> Methods: Using OPTN/UNOS data from 2006 - 2012, we used competing risks methods to determine the cumulative incidence of conversion to <b>active</b> <b>status</b> (activation), death, and delisting before conversion among 1679 obese adult kidney candidates designated as status 7 due to a weight inappropriate for transplantation. Fine and Gray competing risks regression was performed to characterize factors associated <b>with</b> conversion to <b>active</b> <b>status</b> in the overall study population and of eventual transplantation among a subgroup of activated candidates. Results: At six years, the cumulative incidence of activation was 49 %, of death before conversion was 15 %, and of delisting was 21 %. Higher body mass index (BMI) was strongly associated with a decreased subhazard of activation (BMI ≥ 45 vs. 30 - 34. 9, sHR: 0. 22; 95 % CI: 0. 16 - 0. 33). Female gender, diabetic end-stage renal disease, history of a previous transplant, panel reactive antibodies < 80 %, dialysis-dependence at listing, and UNOS region 5 were negatively associated with activation. Among activated candidates, the cumulative incidence of transplantation at six years after initial waitlisting was 61 %. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that half of obese status 7 candidates with a weight inappropriate for transplantation will not achieve <b>active</b> waitlist <b>status.</b> BMI at listing had a strong association <b>with</b> conversion to <b>active</b> status; however, co-morbid factors and regional variation also impact activation...|$|R

40|$|A {{pathogenic}} {{hallmark of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is persistent activation of self-reactive CD 4 + T cells. The {{cause of this}} aberrant activity remains elusive. We report here detection of autoantibodies against B 7 -H 1, a recently described member of the B 7 family, in 29 % of patients with RA versus 4 % of healthy donors. High-level expression of cell surface B 7 -H 1 are found on activated human CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 45 RO+ T cells. Immobilized autoantibodies to B 7 -H 1 are capable of costimulating the proliferation of CD 4 + T cells in vitro, {{and the presence of}} these autoantibodies correlates <b>with</b> <b>active</b> disease <b>status.</b> Using immobilized B 7 -H 1 mAb’s and programmed death 1 Ig, we demonstrate that engagement of B 7 -H 1 on CD 4 + T cells costimulates proliferation and secretion of IL- 10, and subsequently leads to programmed cell death, accompanied with upregulated expression of TNF-related apoptosis–inducing ligand and activation of caspase- 3. Taken together with our previous findings, these data indicate a bidirectional signaling role of B 7 -H 1 in T cell costimulation and apoptosis and implicate B 7 -H 1 autoantibodies as contributing to the progression of RA by inducing aberrant T cell responses...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} cadmium (Cd) on the yield of ajmalicine, a secondary metabolite derived from tryptophan, in the suspension cultures of a fully habituated cell line of Catharanthus roseus. The treatment with Cd concentration ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 4 mM and the duration of 24 to 48 h increased ajmalicine production and excretion into culture medium, particularly for cells at the mid-exponential growth phase. For early stationary phase cells and stationary phase cells transferred from the culturing medium to the production medium, we detected less enhancement. Cd treatment in cells at the mid-exponential phase, early stationary phase, and cells transferred from the growth medium to production medium increased the cellular content of tryptophan and tryptamine, the precursors for ajmalicine. The tryptamine level was a major limiting factor for ajmalicine production for cells at the mid-exponential phase. The tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) converting tryptophan to tryptamine was also affected by Cd. We demonstrated that Cd treatment increased the level of TDC transcript, the cellular tryptamine concentration, and ajmalicine excretion, all contributed to the higher yield of ajmalicine. The increase was more significant in cells <b>with</b> <b>active</b> metabolic <b>status</b> and the cellular tryptamine concentration was the major limiting factor for ajmalicine biosynthesis.

40|$|Parasitic {{diseases}} are of considerable public health significance in Canada, particularly in rural and remote areas. Food- and waterborne parasites {{contribute significantly to}} {{the overall number of}} parasitic infections reported in Canada. While data on the incidence of some of these {{diseases are}} available, knowledge of the true burden of infection by the causative agents in Canadians is somewhat limited. A number of centers of expertise in Canada study various aspects of parasitology, but few formal societies or networks of parasitologists currently exist in Canada, and previously none focused specifically on food or environmental transmission. The recently established Food and Environmental Parasitology Network (FEPN) brings together Canadian researchers, regulators and public health <b>officials</b> <b>with</b> an <b>active</b> involvement in issues related to these increasingly important fields. The major objectives of the Network include identifying research gaps, facilitating discussion and collaborative research, developing standardized methods, generating data for risk assessments, policies, and guidelines, and providing expert advice and testing in support of outbreak investigations and surveillance studies. Issues considered by the FEPN include contaminated foods and infected food animals, potable and non-potable water, Northern and Aboriginal issues, zoonotic transmission, and epidemiolog...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a germin-like protein (GLP) in legumes against the serious soil-borne pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lentis, an Oryza sativa root-expressed GLP (OsRGLP 1) was expressed in the model legume Medicago truncatula using the recombinant vector pCOsRGLP 1. The transgene was highly expressed in M. truncatula transformed lines as assessed by RT-qPCR. Consistent <b>with</b> the <b>active</b> <b>status</b> of the transgene there was an elevated accumulation of H₂O₂ in transformed progeny. Enzymatic characterization of T 1 transgenic progeny showed increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The additional SOD activity in transgenic lines was insensitive to potassium cyanide and sensitive to H₂O₂ indicating its resemblance to FeSOD. The effectiveness of the OsRGLP 1 gene was tested by monitoring the root disease after infection of wild-type and transgenic lines. Wild-type plants were greatly affected by the pathogen infection showing a percent disease index value of 50 compared to 10 – 18 for the transgenic lines. The tolerance of the transgenic lines leads to recovery in fresh weight and pod production to an almost normal level. Analysis of defense-related genes downstream of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in transgenic plants showed induction of salicylic acid and jasmonate signaling pathways and increased expression of some pathogenesis-related- 1 (PR- 1) genes and a plant defensin gene. Overall, the findings suggest that OsRGLP 1 provides protection against the fungal pathogen F. oxysporum that may involve the direct influence of H₂O₂ on signaling pathways leading to the activation of defense-related genes...|$|R
