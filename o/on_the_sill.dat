25|$|The doors, {{most often}} {{credited}} as a Lamborghini trademark, were a remarkable design feature for the Countach. They {{first appeared on}} the Alfa Romeo 33 'Carabo' concept car in 1968, an earlier design accomplishment, also by the talented Gandini. The doors {{have come to be}} known as scissor doors: hinged at the front with horizontal hinges, so that they lifted up and tilted forwards. The main reason is the car's tubular spaceframe chassis results in very high and wide door sills. It was also partly for style, and partly because the width of the car made conventional doors impossible to use in even slightly confined space. Care needed to be taken, though, in opening the doors with a low roof overhead. The car's poor rear visibility and wide sills led to drivers adopting a method of reversing the car for parking by opening the door, sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sill,</b> and reversing while looking over the back of the car from outside.|$|E
