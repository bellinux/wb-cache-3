Here, the <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> are used as wind power consumers and additional heat sources, while the thermal inertia of the pipelines and the buildings is analyzed using a detailed model to reflect the thermal inertia of the building structure, indoor air, and pipelines {{as well as the}} delay of water flow. In addition, the thermal comfort of end users in different time sections of the day is also considered {{to take advantage of the}} fluctuation of wind power and enhance the flexibility of CHP units.|$|R

50|$|Traditional, fuel-heated boilers {{generally}} require multiple {{different parts}} to operate successfully. In contrast, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> are relatively simple devices. Additionally, because <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> {{do not use}} complicated forms of heat exchange, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> do not contain many of the potential hazards that a commonly present in a fuel-heated <b>boiler.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> are also generally easier to maintain {{because they do not}} need tube replacement that fuel-heated boilers often require, due to soot and fuel residue, or any of the fire maintenance required for a fuel-heated <b>boiler.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> have smaller carbon footprints than their traditional cousins: fuel-heated steam boilers, and require less space overall making them a good choice for a smaller operations that are in need of a boiler.|$|R
30|$|To {{integrate}} additional {{wind power}} into the grid, an effective {{method is to}} introduce additional heat suppliers into the heating system to decouple the power from the heat supply. References [11] and [12] proposed a system using <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> with heat storage tanks and demonstrated that this system could {{make a contribution to}} consume additional wind electricity. The <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> could increase the wind electricity consumption and enhance the flexibility of CHP units by replacing part of the heat produced by CHP units. Reference [13] developed a dispatch model to optimize the heat and power production from multiple sources, including CHP units, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers,</b> wind power and conventional units. This study demonstrated that <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> with heat storage tanks were effective at reducing wind curtailment and primary energy consumption. Reference [14] also introduced <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and developed a stochastic partial equilibrium model of the power system. The results showed that the <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> could replace part of the heat production of oil-fired heat boilers and CHP plants and were beneficial for the integration of wind power and fuel saving. Furthermore, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and heat pumps have also been reported [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] to promote wind power integration. Reference [23] described a combination of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and wind generators that exhibited satisfactory performance in integrating wind power.|$|R
50|$|Some {{experts that}} work with boilers {{on a day-to-day basis}} feel that <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> are {{actually}} superior to fuel heated boilers in a few ways. Those experts say that using <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> may actually be cheaper than using a fuel heated boiler, while also possibly being much more environmentally friendly. The <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> also require less equipment to be installed than a traditional boiler helping to reduce the high installation costs that will come with a fuel heated <b>boiler.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>Boilers</b> can fit into smaller areas due to the way they are constructed and the lack of required parts that a fuel heated boiler requires to operate.|$|R

50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> are {{sometimes}} {{looked down upon}} by some experts for multiple factors. These factors stem {{from the fact that}} the electricity that is used to power <b>electric</b> steam <b>boilers</b> has to be generated somewhere. As well as the use of electricity it is not free especially considering that most <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> require a good deal of electricity to run at efficient and full capacity, which add on top of the problems of using it to boil water. Generating the power required to run an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> can create just as many if not more pollution/emissions than burning fuel in the traditional boiler. Electricity is expensive, and with expected rises in the price of electricity the use of it in <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> will come with a large price. Also one other possibility is in the event of a power outage, or a brownout, the boiler would become unusable, whereas gas boilers do not necessarily need an external power source to run.|$|R

30|$|By {{introducing}} <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> {{into the}} regional heating system, wind curtailment and coal consumption are reduced simultaneously (relative to the reference case). <b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> can consume {{a proportion of}} the extra wind power directly.

30|$|Even {{though the}} <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> {{appear to be}} more {{effective}} than thermal inertia at reducing wind curtailment according to Fig.Â  11, the latter method has a higher potential for reducing coal consumption. The wind curtailment is reduced by 283 MWh and 164 MWh in Cases 2 and 3, respectively, relative to Case 1. Consequently, 0.14 metric tons of coal can be saved when integrating 1 MWh of wind power for considering <b>electric</b> <b>boilers,</b> and introducing the thermal inertia of a heating network can reduce 0.61 t of coal by integrating 1 MWh of wind power. The difference between the two solutions at reducing coal consumption emphasizes the low heating efficiency of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Interactions between multipolar nuclear {{transitions}} and {{gravitational waves}} (GWs) are theoretically investigated and two nonclassical scenarios of GW detection are suggested. We shall demonstrate {{in this report}} that the long-lived Mossbauer nuclides of multipolar transitions are suitable transducers to detect impinging GWs. Shape deformation and spin flip of nucleus are derived from the Hamiltonian with graviton in interaction. GWs generate nuclear quadrupole deformation in analogy with the Stark effect, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>electric</b> field generates the dipole deformation of electron orbits. Likewise in analogy with the NMR that the rotating rf field flips the nuclear spin, GWs flip the nuclear spin by the resonant helicity-rotation-gravity coupling. The high energy states of the quadrupole deformation in heavy nuclides can dramatically speed up the multipolar transitions, which may be important for GW detections particularly in the low frequency band...|$|R

40|$|Wind power {{generation}} reduces our reliance {{on fossil fuels}} and can thus reduce environmental pollution. However, rapid wind power development has caused various issues related to power grid restructuring. A high proportion of the generating capacity of northeast China is based on {{combined heat and power}} (CHP), whose inflexible response to the peak regulation of power grids hinders the ability to accommodate wind power; thus, wind power curtailment is prevalent. <b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> can directly consume the excess wind power to supply heat during low load periods and thus mitigate the heat supply stress of CHP units. Therefore, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> improve the power gridâs ability to accommodate additional wind power. From a regional power grid perspective, this paper discussed the feasibility of such a strategy for increasing the ability to accommodate wind power during the heat supply season. This paper analysed the optimum <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> capacity configuration of a regional power grid based on various constraint conditions, such as the heat-power balance, with the objective of maximising the associated social benefits. Using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei power grid as an example, the optimum <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> capacity of the studied power grid is approximately 1100 MW...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>electric</b> steam <b>boiler</b> is {{intended}} to produce steam for process industry or other uses, such as drying, heat treating, and others. These are generally permanently installed systems with connections to a water supply and piping to transport product steam {{to the point of}} use. In places where electric power is relatively low cost compared to fossil fuels, it may be economically practical to use an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> for steam central heating. For example, in Winnipeg, Canada, during the Second World War, large central <b>electric</b> steam <b>boilers</b> were used for a district heating system, using surplus hydroelectric power. The intent was to conserve coal fuel for more critical wartime needs. [...] <b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> may rely on immersion heater resistance heating elements to heat water, or may use electric current passing directly through the water as an electrode boiler.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} steam with an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> is fairly simple. Electricity is run through a heating element {{that acts as a}} resistor to create heat through resistance. Water from the system or holding tank is then run over or near this hot element in a pipe or tank, heating the water to a suitable temperature, then making the water hot enough to boil and become saturated steam, at which point the saturated steam is transported to wherever it is needed via the steam pipes that exit the body of the <b>electric</b> <b>boiler.</b> <b>Electric</b> steam <b>boilers</b> work in a very similar way to fire heated boilers with the exception of what heats the water.|$|R
30|$|When {{introducing}} <b>electric</b> <b>boilers,</b> {{the wind}} power curtailment {{is reduced by}} 282 MWh, and the wind curtailment ratio is 7.5 %.

This finding indicates the high effectiveness of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> in reducing wind curtailment relative to thermal inertia, the reason for which is that a proportion of wind power is used for heating in Case 2, consuming curtailed wind power directly.|$|R
