5|$|Eichmann did {{not make}} policy, but acted in an <b>operational</b> <b>capacity.</b> Specific {{deportation}} orders came from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Eichmann's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in each area, organising the seizure of their property, and arranging for and scheduling trains. His department was in constant contact with the Foreign Office, as Jews of conquered nations such as France could not as easily be stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths. Eichmann held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with his department members {{working in the field}} and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos. His wife, who disliked Berlin, resided in Prague with the children. Eichmann initially visited them weekly, but as time went on, his visits tapered off to once a month.|$|E

25|$|By September 1900, the British were {{nominally}} {{in control}} of both Republics, {{with the exception of}} the northern part of Transvaal. However, they soon discovered that they only controlled the territory their columns physically occupied. Despite the loss of their two capital cities and half of their army, the Boer commanders adopted guerrilla warfare tactics, primarily conducting raids against railways, resource and supply targets, all aimed at disrupting the <b>operational</b> <b>capacity</b> of the British Army.

25|$|The {{regiment}} was mobilised for war {{service and}} deployed to the Northern Territory {{to bolster the}} garrison there. It was eventually gazetted as an AIF unit in 1943, meaning that it could serve in an <b>operational</b> <b>capacity</b> outside of Australian territory if required, but was eventually deemed surplus to requirements as the Australian Army was partially demobilised in the later war years, and was disbanded in March 1944 at Watsonia, Victoria. In the post war period, the regiment was re-raised as an amalgamated unit, designated the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles, which remained in existence until 199192.|$|E
25|$|Although Japan possessed {{significant}} mobile <b>operational</b> <b>capacity,</b> it did {{not possess}} capability for maintaining a long sustained war. At {{the beginning of the}} war, the Imperial Japanese Army comprised 17 divisions, each composed of approximately 22,000 men, 5,800 horses, 9,500 rifles and submachine guns, 600 heavy machine guns of assorted types, 108 artillery pieces, and 600 plus of light armor two-men tanks. Special forces were also available. The Imperial Japanese Navy displaced a total of 1,900,000 tonnes, ranking third in the world, and possessed 2,700 aircraft at the time. Each Japanese division was the equivalent in fighting strength of four Chinese regular divisions (at the beginning of the Battle of Shanghai).|$|E
25|$|In an <b>operational</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{limitations}} in weapons technology and quick British reactions were {{making it more}} difficult to achieve strategic effect. Attacking ports, shipping and imports as well as disrupting rail traffic in the surrounding areas, especially the distribution of coal, an important fuel in all industrial economies of the Second World War, would net a positive result. However, the use of delayed-action bombs, while initially very effective, gradually had less impact, partly because they failed to detonate. The British had anticipated the change in strategy and dispersed its production facilities, making them less vulnerable to a concentrated attack. Regional commissioners were given plenipotentiary powers to restore communications and organise the distribution of supplies to keep the war economy moving.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mexican government, {{the attacks}} of that day {{were one of the}} most brazen moves by {{organized}} crime against Mexican security forces in the ongoing Mexican Drug War (2006–present). The attack was also unique in the sense that a relatively new criminal group in Mexico like that CJNG was willing to confront the government head-on. Though organized crime groups in Mexico had used rocket launchers against security forces in the past, {{it was the first time}} in history that they had shot down a military aircraft. That attacks of that day showed the government that the CJNG had the manpower and <b>operational</b> <b>capacity</b> to respond against the crackdowns and efforts of the Mexican government. The CJNG's influence in Mexico's criminal landscape grew significantly since 2009–2010. The group was formed as a splinter organization of the Milenio Cartel and Sinaloa Cartel after several of its leaders were arrested or killed. Their international drug trafficking operations, specifically for heroin and methamphetamine, increased the group's financial power and capacity. Their market share growth in Mexican territory was also correlated to the arrest and deaths of their rival criminal group leaders like the Knights Templar Cartel and Los Zetas. The CJNG's stronghold, Jalisco, gave the group a strategic advantage from its competitors since Jalisco ranked high in industrial output and gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E
500|$|The {{base was}} also the {{location}} of an experimental system of steam pipes in 1957, to test the viability of using steam to melt the snow on the runways. Pipes were spaced at different intervals in the experiment. That same year, the first KC-135 Stratotanker, christened the [...] "Aroostook Queen", arrived at Loring. By December, all of the KC-97s had left, and by April 1958, 20 KC-135s had arrived, allowing the 42nd Air Refueling Squadron to reach full <b>operational</b> <b>capacity</b> in May. [...] Later that year, an alert force was created at Loring, consisting of six B-52's. The following year, {{in response to a}} conflict in Lebanon, the entire wing was placed on alert.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan {{proposed}} {{creating a}} 600-ship navy {{as part of}} the overall defense department build-up to counter the threat of the armed forces of the Soviet Union; both the Soviet Army and Navy had grown {{in the aftermath of the}} unification of Vietnam in 1975 and the loss of faith that Americans had in their armed services. As part of this, all four Iowa-class battleships were modernized and reactivated. However, when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the 600-ship navy was seen as too costly to maintain, and so the navy made plans to return to its traditional 313-ship fleet. This led to the deactivation of many ships in the navy's fleet, including the four reactivated battleships; all were removed from service between 1990 and 1992. Originally, the navy had struck all four ships and made plans to donate them, however Congress intervened in this plan with the passing of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996. Section 1011 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the Iowa-class battleships that had been struck by the navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy Reserve Fleets. The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corps' amphibious operations. Both battleships were to be maintained with the reserve fleet until such a time as the navy could certify that it had within its fleet the <b>operational</b> <b>capacity</b> to meet or exceed the gunfire support that both battleships could provide. To comply with this requirement, the navy selected the battleships [...] and [...] for reinstatement to the Naval Vessel Register.|$|E
