5|$|Feminist economists {{often make}} a {{critical}} distinction that masculine bias in economics {{is primarily a}} result of gender, not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack <b>of</b> <b>emotion,</b> {{but not on the}} gender of authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the {{sociology}} <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> or anthropology <b>of</b> <b>emotions,</b> the history <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> {{is based on}} the assumption that not only the expression of feelings, but also the feelings themselves are learned.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} two questions. One {{concerns the}} metaphysics <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> and asks what kinds <b>of</b> mental states <b>emotions</b> are. The other asks how the metaphysics <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> bears on first and third-personal knowledge <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> There are two prevailing {{views on the}} nature <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> They are the perception and cognitive views. The perception view argues that emotions are bodily feelings. The cognitive view, by contrast, contends that emotions are some sorts of evaluative judgments. I show that both views provide inadequate accounts of the nature <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> The perception view fails {{to do justice to}} the fact that emotions may not involve any bodily feeling. The cognitive view, by contrast, cannot account for the fact that emotions are states that adult humans have in common with infants and animals. On the basis of these criticisms, I put forward an alternative account <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> This involves five main arguments. The first is that emotions are enduring non-episodic dispositions {{that may or may not}} manifest themselves in experiential episodes such as emotional feelings and behaviour episodes such as expressions. The second argument is that emotional feelings are perceptions of specific bodily changes brought about by emotions. These feelings serve as clues as to what kinds <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> the subject has. The third argument is that expressions are observable manifestations <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> in virtue <b>of</b> which <b>emotions</b> can be perceived and subsequently known, directly and non-inferentially, by other people. The fourth argument is that when someone has an emotion without feeling it, she can still come to know it by believing true ascriptions that other people make about the emotion they perceive in her expression. The fifth argument is that full knowledge <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> requires knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>emotion</b> objects. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

PhDr. MUDr. Mgr. Radvan Bahbouh, Ph. D. Abstract: The theses is {{dedicated}} to facial expressions <b>of</b> <b>emotions,</b> {{it begins with a}} brief introduction to the topic <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> as one <b>of</b> the cognitive functions, there is a definition of the term, classification <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> and their psychopathology, it briefly summarizes the various theories <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> The greater part of the theoretical section is devoted to basic emotions and their manifestation in the face, as well as the ability to recognize and imitate them. The theoretical part is closed by the topic of emotional intelligence as a unifying element that highlights the importance of this issue. Empirical part is primarily focused on two abilities related to facial expressions <b>of</b> <b>emotions,</b> specifically the recognition and the production of them, then links these capabilities with additional characteristics as the gender, the education and their self-estimation. The main finding of this theses {{is that there is a}} statistical significant relationship (ρ= 0. 35, α= 0. 05) between the emotion recognition and production.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} role and {{significance}} of the emotional factor in the system of components of organizational culture.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the provision <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> for artificial agents with the ultimate aim of enhancing their autonomy, i. e. making them more flexible, robust and self-sufficient. In recent years, the importance <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> and their assistance to cognition has been increasingly acknowledged. Emotions are no longer considered undesirable or simply useless. Their role in various aspects of human and animal cognition like perception, attention, memory, decision-making and social interaction has been recognised as essential. The importance <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> is much more evident in social interaction and therefore much <b>of</b> the <b>emotions</b> research done in artificial systems focuses on the expression and recognition <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> However, recent neurophysiological research suggests that emotions also play a crucial part in cognition itself...|$|R

5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> in the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as Van Gogh was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster.|$|E

Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him.

5|$|The Actor's Children was {{released}} with enthusiasm and positive reviews in trade publications. The Moving Picture World reviews would be favorable and without much criticism, even calling the acting convincing. A more honest review in The New York Dramatic Mirror {{was written by}} a reviewer who {{was pleased with the}} production, but offered criticism about the production's weaker aspects. The reviewer found there to be too much emphasis on the unimportant parts and a lack <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> from the actors, and the child actors performance was faulted by repeatedly looking at the camera. Critical reception of the film may not have been entirely neutral for a number of reasons. Edwin Thanhouser was a well-liked gentleman who had many friends in the Patents Company that likely wanted him to succeed. Furthermore, writers in the magazines hoped that Independents would succeed and challenge the Patents Company's stranglehold on the industry. Also, film critics and reviewers of the era would balance the negativity of even the worst films with some favorable aspects. Even without any ulterior motives, the film may have been worthy of a favorable review.|$|E
