5|$|According to Sharon, {{there is}} no mention of Deir Ghassaneh or Beit Rima in early Arabic sources, {{although}} it is known that Deir Ghassaneh was inhabited during the Mamluk period due to the many houses there that have preserved elements of Mamluk architecture. Specific examples include the use of the ablaq technique of alternating stones <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors,</b> particularly red and white, that decorate the facades and gates of some houses.|$|E

Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (lattice defects), green (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion (ability to disperse light <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} the fortress' territory along the longitudinal axis. It belongs to the domed basilica type of churches, where the bearings join with the side-chapels of the apse. Two pairs of arches divided the longitudinal stretched prayer hall into three naves, the central one of which (with double side-chapels) on the eastern side ends with low staged, half-rounded apse and the side-chapels end with sacristies. They are characterized with stylish iconography, richness of theme and variety <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> (where blue is dominant). The vertical axis of the building was crowned by a massive dome. The pointed dome with the cylindrical drum has not survived. It was damaged during Tamerlane's invasion and completely demolished in 1784 when the Avar Omar Khan invaded the Transcaucasus from Dagestan. In the 19th century, Viceroy of the Caucasus, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov built a semi-spherical wooden dome covered with iron sheets in place of the original dome. The dome was renovated during Soviet years.|$|E

25|$|Stars are {{categorized}} by spectral class, with brown dwarfs designated as types M, L, T, and Y.

25|$|Tooth decay, {{also known}} as dental caries or cavities, is a {{breakdown}} of teeth due to acids made by bacteria.

25|$|When {{judging the}} {{relative}} luminance (brightness) <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> in well-lit situations, humans tend to perceive light within the green {{parts of the}} spectrum as brighter than red or blue light of equal power.

25|$|The city hall, {{located on}} the Place de la Liberté {{in the heart of}} the city centre, was inaugurated in 1894.

25|$|The newest {{additions}} to the RAPTOR system are the RAPTOR-K and RAPTOR-T telescopes which began operation in 2008. The RAPTOR-K telescope contains 16 lenses and is capable of viewing most of the useful sky every 5 minutes. RAPTOR-T (T stands for technicolor) carries four co-aligned 0.4-meter telescopes with four different color filters. The purpose of RAPTOR-T is to detect changes in the intensity <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> emitted during a gamma-ray burst. Information about {{the distance to the}} burst and about the burst's environment and dynamics can be obtained from such color information.|$|E
25|$|In 1666, Isaac Newton {{argued that}} the faults of the refracting {{telescope}} were fundamental because the lens refracted light <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> differently. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could {{be made in the}} refracting telescope. However, he was able to demonstrate that the angle of reflection remained the same for all colors, so he decided to build a reflecting telescope. It was completed in 1668 and is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope.|$|E
25|$|YAG {{hardness}} (8.25) {{and lack}} of brittleness were great improvements over strontium titanate, and although its RI (1.83) and dispersion (0.028) were fairly low, they were enough to give brilliant-cut YAGs perceptible fire and good brilliance (although still much lower than diamond). A number <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> were also produced {{with the addition of}} dopants, including yellow, red, and a vivid green, which was used to imitate emerald. Major producers included Shelby Gem Factory of Michigan, Litton Systems, Allied Chemical, Raytheon, and Union Carbide; annual global production peaked at 40 million carats (8000nbsp&kg) in 1972, but fell sharply thereafter. Commercial names for YAG included Diamonair, Diamonique, Gemonair, Replique, and Triamond.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s once {{electromagnetism}} {{was better}} understood, interest turned {{again to the}} problem of aberration. By this time flaws were known to both Fresnel's and Stokes' theories. Fresnel's theory required that the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for light <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors,</b> and it was shown that the boundary conditions Stokes had assumed in his theory were inconsistent with his assumption of irrotational flow. At the same time, the modern theories of electromagnetic aether could not account for aberration at all. Many scientists such as Maxwell, Heaviside and Hertz unsuccessfully attempted to solve these problems by incorporating either Fresnel or Stokes' theories into Maxwell's new electromagnetic laws.|$|E
25|$|Feather work {{is still}} done in Tlalpujahua and Morelia. This art has its origins and {{reached its peak}} during the late pre Hispanic period and into the very early colonial period, with {{feathers}} used to decorate shields, standards, headdresses, mosaic images, caps and more for the ruling classes. There are efforts to revive it. Tlalpujahua has workshops that create feather images of religious icons, landscapes, animals and more using feathers <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> and sizes, mostly sold in Tlalpujahua and in Morelia. Local artisans Gabriel Olay Olay and Luis Guillermos Olay Barrientos have won national awards for their work. Gabriel Olay’s work has been gifted by Mexican presidents to various dignitaries in the world.|$|E
25|$|Surprisingly few artists {{used the}} spray gun {{technique}} to create large expanses and fields of color sprayed across their canvases during the 1960s and 1970s. Some painters who effectively used spray painting techniques include Jules Olitski, {{who was a}} pioneer in his spray technique that covered his large paintings with layer after layer <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>colors,</b> often gradually changing hue and value in subtle progression. Another important innovation was Dan Christensen's use of a spray technique to great effect in loops and ribbons of bright color; sprayed in clear, calligraphic marks across his large-scale paintings. William Pettet, Richard Saba, and Albert Stadler, used the technique to create large-scale fields of multi-colors; while Kenneth Showell sprayed over crumpled canvases and created an illusion of abstract still-life interiors. Most of the spray painters were active especially during the late 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
