40|$|This work {{introduces}} an <b>indirect</b> <b>Boundary</b> Element Method (BEM) {{within a}} NURBS-based isogeometric framework for solving three-dimensional acoustic {{problems in the}} frequency domain. Developments of isogeometric boundary elements so far {{have focused on the}} direct BEM. Yet, a multitude of common problems in acoustics involves open-boundary surfaces, which require a more involved, <b>indirect,</b> <b>boundary</b> element formulation. The current work presents an indirect variational BEM which makes use of NURBS shape functions. Additionally, a novel technique for coupling (strongly) non-conforming patches is introduced to allow the analysis of more complex geometries. The proposed isogeometric <b>indirect</b> <b>boundary</b> element method is verified against analytical solutions and benchmarked against the conventional polynomial-based indirect BEM. Also two open-boundary problems are studied, including analyses over wider frequency ranges, and one industrial-type, complex geometry containing multiple non-conforming patches. The proposed method is found to be not only significantly more efficient than its polynomial-based counterpart, but also very robust against strong non-conformities in the NURBS descriptions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A semi-analytic method {{based on}} the {{propagation}} matrix formulation of <b>indirect</b> <b>boundary</b> element method to compute response of elastic (and acoustic) waves in multi-layered media with irregular interfaces is presented. The method works recursively starting from the top-most free surface at which a stress-free boundary condition is applied, and the displacement-stress boundary conditions are then subsequently applied at each interface. The basic idea behind this method is the matrix formulation of the propagation matrix (PM) or more recently the reflectivity method as wide used in the geophysics community for the computation of synthetic seismograms in stratified media. The reflected and transmitted wave fields between arbitrary shapes of layers can be computed using the <b>indirect</b> <b>boundary</b> element (BEM) method. Like any standard BEM methods, the primary task of the BEM-based propagation matrix method (thereafter called PM–BEM) is the evaluation of element boundary integral of the Green's function, for which there are standard method that can be adapted. In addition, effective absorbing boundary conditions as used in the finite difference numerical method is adapted in our implementation to suppress the spurious arrivals from the artificial boundaries due to limited model space. To our knowledge, such implementation has not appeared in the literature. Several examples are {{presented in this paper}} to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed PM–BEM method for modeling elastic waves in media with complex structure. ...|$|R
