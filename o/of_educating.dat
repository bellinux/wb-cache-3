5|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of the task <b>of</b> <b>educating</b> his brother while earning a living, Jacques-Joseph decided to send his younger brother to the well-regarded school of the Abbé Dussert in November 1802, where Champollion would stay until the summer of 1804. During this period, his gift for languages first became evident: he started out learning Latin and Greek, but quickly progressed to Hebrew and other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Syriac and Chaldean. It was while a student here that he took up interest in Ancient Egypt, likely encouraged in this direction by Dussert and his brother, both orientalists.|$|E

She became a NUDAW-sponsored parliamentary candidate, and in 1923, while still a CPGB member, sought nomination as the Labour Party's parliamentary candidate for the Gorton constituency. She was unsuccessful, but in November 1923 the Gorton ward elected her to Manchester City Council; Hannah Mitchell, her co-worker in prewar suffrage campaigns, was a fellow councillor. In her short council career—she served only until 1926—Wilkinson's main areas of concern were unemployment, housing, child welfare and education.|$|E
5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's September 1962 speech, {{in which}} he {{described}} his goal of accomplishing a manned space flight to the moon {{by the end of}} the decade, the space program grew in importance and scope in Central Florida because of its proximity to Cape Canaveral. Prominent residents and local leaders began lobbying the Florida State Legislature to increase access to higher education on the Space Coast. With the help of former State Senate President William A. Shands and Senator Beth Johnson, the legislature passed and Governor Farris Bryant signed into law Senate Bill No. 125 on June 10, 1963, which authorized the Florida Board of Regents to create a new state university in East Central Florida. The university was founded as a non-segregated and coeducational university, with the mission <b>of</b> <b>educating</b> students for promising space-age careers in engineering and other technological professions.|$|E

Konkani plays, {{especially}} religious ones, were written and staged in Mangalore in the 20th century by prominent playwrights such as Pedru John D'Souza, Pascal Sequeira and Bonaventure Tauro. The Ghumat was a popular musical instrument played especially during weddings. The instrument has {{the form of an}} earthen pot but is open at both sides. One end is covered with the skin of some wild animal, and the other is left open. The traditional theatre form is called Gumat, and is performed {{on the eve of the}} marriage or in connection with the marriage celebrations in the decorated pandal (stage). The play is conducted by males belonging to both the brides' and bridegrooms' parties, and usually takes place for two or three nights. The plays performed are usually those of Biblical stories, and their morals are presented with the purpose <b>of</b> <b>educating</b> the bride and bridegroom. This tradition has almost completely died out among the present generation.|$|E

30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the economy considered by Owen and Weil is that it might exhibit multiplicity of equilibria. Due to the assumed complementarity <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> and uneducated workers, an economy {{with high levels of}} human capital will have high relative wages for uneducated workers so that it would be more likely that the children of uneducated workers will be able to afford the education cost. Downward mobility is also more likely in this developed economy since the smaller wage gap decreases the incentive for children <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> workers to become educated. However, in an economy with low levels of education, the wage gap between educated and uneducated workers will be larger, and this will reduce the number of children of uneducated workers who get educated and increase the incentive for children <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> parents to remain in the class <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> workers. Hence, mobility between the two classes will be low. Therefore, the model generates a positive relationship between economic development and the degree of intergenerational mobility.|$|R
40|$|Abstract：Human {{capital and}} higher {{education}} have been increasingly emphasized {{with the rise of}} a knowledge-based economy. Cities are recognized as places to attract human capital and spur economic development. Educated workforce supply is one of the critical parts to sustain IT industries, which have been leading recent economic development. This paper examines factors affecting geographies <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> workforce supply from colleges and universities to companies in U. S. metropolitan areas through questionnaire survey and interviews with IT companies and IT-related programs at colleges and universities. The results show that: (1) physical proximity between IT companies and colleges/universities enhances the degree <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> workforce supply from colleges/universities to IT companies; (2) IT companies which seek more specialized and rarer expertise recruit the workforce from colleges or universities over longer distance; (3) colleges and universities which offer a higher degree have geographically more extensive supply <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> workforce to IT companies than those which offer a lower degree; and (4) large IT companies have more geographically extensive supply <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> workforce to colleges/universities than small IT companies...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the relation between marriage and higher education. We build up a model with educational assortative matching where individuals decide whether to acquire higher education both for obtaining educational surplus and for increasing the probability to be matched with an educated partner. Education can be either asymmetric or symmetric between genders. The educational choices between future partners are simultaneously determined as a Nash equilibrium. The results for asymmetric education suggest that, as assortative matching increases, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> men increases, and their educational surplus falls. On the other side, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> women diminishes and their educational surplus increases. In the case with symmetric education, the educational bene…t falls as assortative matching increases, regardless the gender. We test our model using the British Household Panel Survey. Our results are consistent with the theoretical assumption of educational assortative matching. Even if the proportion <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> men is slightly higher than the proportion <b>of</b> <b>educated</b> women, the educational surplus is lower as the educational quali…cation increases for both men and women, as suggested by the symmetric-education hypothesis...|$|R
