Look at her, bowed down under a humiliation which is unutterable in words. She has seen him below the surface--now, when it is too late. She rates him at his true value--now, when her reputation is at his mercy. Ask her the question: What was there to love in a man who can speak to you as that man has spoken, who can treat you as that man is treating you now? you so clever, so cultivated, so refined--what, in Heaven's name, could you see in him? Ask her that, and she will have no answer to give. She will not even remind you that he was once your model of manly beauty, too--that you waved your handkerchief till you could wave it no longer, when he took his seat, with the others, in the boat--that your heart was like to jump out of your bosom, <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>later</b> occasion when he leaped the last hurdle at the foot-race, and won it by a head. In the bitterness of her remorse, she will not even seek for that excuse for herself. Is there no atoning suffering to be seen here? Do your sympathies shrink from such a character as this? Follow her, good friends of virtue, on the pilgrimage that leads, by steep and thorny ways, to the purer atmosphere and the nobler life. Your fellow-creature, who has sinned and has repented--you have the authority of the Divine Teacher for it--is your fellow-creature, purified and ennobled.

I was now becoming interested in things outside my grooves, though my grooves were still there, deep and receptive, and I went about the place at last almost eagerly, tracing the outlines of that great departed city on whose colossal bones the churches and palaces {{of the middle ages}} cluster like weeds in the spaces and ruins of a magnificent garden. I found myself one day in the Forum, thinking of that imperialism that had built the Basilica of Julius Cæsar, and comparing its cramped vestiges with that vaster second administrative effort which has left the world the monstrous arches of Constantine. I sat down over against these last among the ruins of the Vestals' House, and mused <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>later</b> reconstruction when the Empire, with its science aborted and its literature and philosophy shrivelled to nothing, its social fabric ruined by the extravagances of financial adventure and its honor and patriotism altogether dead, united itself, in a desperate effort to continue, with all that was most bickeringly intolerant and destructive in Christianity--only to achieve one common vast decay. All Europe to this day is little more than the sequel to that failure. It is the Roman Empire in disintegration. The very churches whose domes rise to the northward of the ancient remains are built of looted stones and look like parasitic and fungoid growths, and the tourists stream through those spaces day by day, stare at the marble fragments, the arches, the fallen carvings and rich capitals, with nothing greater in their minds and nothing clearer....|$|E

Heisenberg noticed, however that if he tried to use the same schema to multiply two variables, such as momentum, p, and displacement, q, then [...] "a significant difficulty arises." [...] It turns out that multiplying a matrix of p by a matrix of q gives a different result from multiplying a matrix of q by a matrix of p.

30|$|Several {{papers have}} {{analyzed}} {{whether or not}} the weakness of lending growth might be related to the demand by the Japanese regulator for a rigorous self-assessment of their assets, which led to a substantial amount of loan loss write-offs and provisions. Focusing <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>later</b> development, Woo (2003) and Watanabe (2007) found that Japanese banks significantly reduced their lending in response to a large increase in bank capital requirements resulting from the reinforcement of the prudential policy guidelines by the Japanese regulator. Watanabe’s results suggest a very large role was played by the contraction of capital in business lending: had capital not been squeezed, business lending to sound industries (which indeed fell, depending on the industry, between 3 and 5  % points) would actually have increased. Instead of looking at regulatory changes, we analyze the impact of changes in bank capital associated to changes in house prices at the onset of a (severe) recession.|$|E

40|$|There is no adequate, broadly based, yet {{thorough}} textbook in planetary science. One suspects {{several reasons}} for this: the field is changing rapidly and texts are threatened by obsolescence, the field is so broad and interdisciplinary that no person or {{small group of people}} could hope to do it justice, the appropriate authors are too busy doing science or NASA committee work, or maybe it is simply a thankless task (certainly not a lucrative one, given the small scientific community involved). In these circumstances, John Lewis and Ron Prinn should be highly commended for their scholarly attempt to summarize part of the spectrum of disciplines involved in planetary science. Their new text may be a very personal (some would say idiosyncratic) view of planetary atmospheres, and has an overwhelmingly chemical perspective, but it is without peer. I expect it to become an invaluable reference source for most planetary scientists. It is not, in my view, a suitable text for a course, but more <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>later...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a puzzle about justification and withholding. The puzzle arises {{in a special}} case where experts advise us to not withhold judgment. My main thesis is simply that the puzzle is genuinely a puzzle, and so leads us to rethink some common assumptions in epistemology, specifically assumptions {{about the nature of}} justification and doxastic attitudes. Section 1 introduces the common assumptions. Section 2 presents the puzzle case. Section 3 assesses the puzzle case. Section 4 explains the choice we’re faced with. Sections 5 and 6 consider and reject some proposed solutions, and in the process refine and clarify the choice we’re faced with. Section 7 considers and rejects a miscellany of different proposed solutions. 1. Common assumptions The puzzle I will present arises in acute form if we accept three common views in epistemology. (In the end, it seems to arise if we accept only two of these, and arguably arises if we accept only one of them; more <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>later,</b> in sections 5 and 6.)

40|$|A certain {{tradition}} of philosophical considerations on the interrelation between sport and art {{has already been}} established. According to Tim L. Elcombe (Elcombe, 2012, p. 201), such considerations on the subject first appeared in English-language literature in the 1970 s and 1980 s, and were fruitful. Usually, they appear together with questions on the aesthetic properties of sport - in this case, a special issue of the Journal of the Philosophy of Sport dedicated to ―Sport and Aesthetics‖ (2012, vol. 39, no. 2), and an excellent postdoctoral dissertation by Jakub Mosz entitled ―Estetyczne aspekty uczestnictwa w sporcie‖ (English: Aesthetic aspects of participation in sports) may serve as good examples. In his article (Elcombe, 2012), Tim L. Elcombe describes the contention and briefly characterizes the main {{differences between the two}} opposing viewpoints (Elcombe, 2012, pp. 202 - 204). It should be noted that he sympathizes with the view of David Best, who some years ago argued that sport is not art (1988, pp. 527 - 539). He believes that ―although art could use sport as a subject, art could not be the subject of sport‖ (Elcombe, 2012, p. 202). I would like to make that statement more specific by adding that its second part suggests that the display of artistic values cannot be the fundamental purpose of sport. I shall expand <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> Best's viewpoint was criticized by Jan Boxil (1988), Spencer Wertz (1988), and Terry Roberts (1995), who believed that sport could be treated as art. Christopher Cordner (1995 a; 1995 b) and Joseph Kupfer (1988) also challenged Best, although they did not entirely disagree with him (see: Elcombe, 2012, pp. 202 - 204). Because literature on the subject published in English presents diversified statements on the interrelation between sport and art, and the circle of people engaged in the matters of physical culture in Poland is still in favor of equating sport with art, I have decided to present my own stance on that matter...|$|E
