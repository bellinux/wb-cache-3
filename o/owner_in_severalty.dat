Original plans were for land ownership to be held in common, as other American Indian land titles were held. However, legislation included a provision allowing the US President to assign individual tracts to individual <b>owners.</b> <b>In</b> 1860, thirty years after the creation of the Reservation, the government moved to allot tracts to individual households, in an effort to force assimilation to European-American practices.

50|$|Welsh {{became known}} as an earnest {{advocate}} {{for the rights of}} Native Americans, a calling triggered by a visit to the Sioux Reservation in 1882. In 1883, his actions resulted in the founding of the Indian Rights Association in Philadelphia, and he served as its corresponding secretary for 34 years and its president for 11 years.

50|$|At {{the time}} the Act passed, it was United States policy to {{eliminate}} Indian reservations, dividing the communal territory and allotting 160-acre plots to individual heads of households, to be owned <b>in</b> <b>severalty.</b> Before allotment, reservation territory was not owned in the usual European-American sense, but was reserved {{for the benefit of}} entire Indian tribes. The communal benefits were apportioned to tribe members according to tribal law and custom. Generally, Indians held the land in a communal fashion. Non-Indians were not allowed to own land on reservations, a fact which limited the value of the land to the Indians. (It reduced the market for it).|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study in}} the {{historical}} geography of a medieval Norwegian province, based on field evidence, Danish and Norwegian, medieval and early modern sources, and 17 th-to- 18 th century, Swedish cadastral maps. In previous literature, eastern Norway, including Bohuslän, is described as having been characterised by single farms with fields held <b>in</b> <b>severalty.</b> This study shows, however, that concentrated settlements, as well as subdivided fields existed in Bohuslän already in medieval times. The settlement development in Bohuslän, and possibly also in the rest of eastern Norway, must thus be seen as part of general European process, rather than a specifically Norwegian development, isolated from the rest of northern Europe. The specific forms that open fields took can, however be explained by some region-specific factors, among which the rules of inheritance were the most important. ...|$|R
50|$|The Dawes Act of 1887, which allotted tribal lands <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> to {{individual}}s, {{was seen}} as a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans. Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans' becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal self-government and institutions. It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of 93 e6acre km2 from Native American control. Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was also part of Americanization policy; it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations. The leading opponent of forced assimilation was John Collier, who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, and tried to reverse many of the established policies.|$|R

50|$|The Huron Indian Cemetery in Kansas City, Kansas, {{also known}} as Huron Park Cemetery, is now {{formally}} known as the Wyandot National Burying Ground. It was established circa 1843, soon after the Wyandot had arrived following removal from Ohio. The tribe settled {{in the area for}} years, with many in 1855 accepting allotment of lands <b>in</b> Kansas <b>in</b> <b>severalty.</b> The majority of the Wyandot removed to Oklahoma in 1867, where they maintained tribal institutions and communal property. As a federally recognized tribe, they had legal control over the communal property of Huron Cemetery.

50|$|The {{aftermath}} of the rebellion caused the Métis to no longer be considered as Canadian aboriginals- they became regarded as their own social group, and were distinct from other aboriginal groups. In order to pacify the Métis resistance further, the Canadian government gave them generous land grants in 1869-70 that was carefully structured to be given <b>in</b> <b>severalty,</b> rather than <b>in</b> common. Red River was now developing its own provincial government that had a political voice and political implications upon Canadian federal government. This rebellion also led to the Métis emerging as a unique, acknowledged group within Canada, and ultimately, {{the disappearance of the}} aboriginal rights paradigm in the public view of Red River. The rebellion was successful in a sense that it allowed the Métis to have a political voice, but it impacted the perception of how other aboriginals would be viewed in Red River.|$|R
50|$|The Big Pasture was 488000 acre {{of prairie}} land, {{in what is}} now southwestern Oklahoma. The land had been {{reserved}} for grazing use by the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes after their reserve was opened for settlement by a lottery conducted during June through August 1901. The tribes, however, leased most of the land out to large ranchers and it became known as Big Pasture. The Big Pasture was maintained for grazing until June 5, 1906, when Congress passed an act (Chapter 2580, 34 Stat. 213) requiring that it be disposed of by allotting 160 acre, <b>in</b> <b>severalty,</b> to each child born into the tribes after the act of 1900. The remaining land was sold by sealed bid in December 1906 and the proceeds placed in the U.S. Treasury for the tribes.

He urged that all the lands lying in this state owned in common or <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> by Massachusetts and Maine be purchased by the state. A resolve was passed in 1852 authorizing him to take such action as he deemed proper, and the Governor with Anson Morrill and John A. Poor entered into negotiations that finally resulted in the purchase of these lands at most satisfactory prices by the state. In 1851 he, as governor, signed the first prohibition act known as the [...] "Maine law".

5000|$|During Mayes' term as Chief {{beginning}} in 1896, the Dawes Commission {{took over the}} power of the Cherokee Nation to determine its citizenship rules. It had been established to manage a process of allotments of communal Native American lands to provide for assimilation of the people as farmers in the European-American style. In furtherance of planning to abolish tribal governments to allow the Oklahoma and Indian territories to be admitted jointly as a new state, the Dawes Commission set up to register the members of the Cherokee Nation. In 1898 the Curtis Act [...] "dissolved tribal courts, directed a survey of the tribal lands, required that tribal rolls of membership be prepared and that the surface rights of the lands of the tribe be allotted <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> among its members", all to achieve assimilation. The US government, through what is now called the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), would appoint chiefs for the tribes. The Cherokee tried to fight this but were forced into negotiations instead. The Five Civilized Tribes finally had to agree to the allotment process.|$|R
60|$|The {{building}} of railroads, and the access thereby given {{to all the}} agricultural and mineral regions of the country, is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of Indians. No matter {{what ought to be}} the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is they do not harmonize well, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too horrible for a nation to adopt without entailing upon itself the wrath of all Christendom and engendering in the citizen a disregard for human life and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see no substitute for such a system, except in placing all the Indians on large reservations, as rapidly as it can be done, and giving them absolute protection there. As soon as they are fitted for it they should be induced to take their lands <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> and to set up Territorial governments for their own protection. For full details on this subject I call your special attention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the higher}} courts in Queensland {{have had the}} {{opportunity}} to revisit the effect of severance on a joint tenancy. The cases allow for the opportunity to examine in more depth the nature of joint tenancy itself, and the concept of alienation as a means of severance of joint tenancy. This article provides an analysis of these decisions to ascertain the contemporary 'state of play' in the law applying to severance of a joint tenancy. A joint tenancy is characterised by the four unities - of possession, interest, title and time! – together with the right of survivorship. Given this characterisation, severance of a joint tenancy represents a fundamental change in the nature of the co-ownership. In particular, the destruction of the right of survivorship through severance will by definition change the potential of each co-owner to hold the whole of the estate <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> upon the death of the other co-owners. The nature of the common ownership of a joint tenancy, and the potential that it carries, can be adjusted by converting, or severing, the joint tenancy to create a tenancy in common. Unlike a joint tenancy, a tenancy in common is characterised by each tenant holding a distinct interest in the property; the shares may be in different proportions. ...|$|R
