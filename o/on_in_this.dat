5|$|Danilo Di Luca {{tried to}} {{attack from the}} pink jersey group a few times {{at the foot of}} the climb, but Menchov {{answered}} each time. When Ivan Basso and Carlos Sastre attacked, Menchov and Di Luca let them go, seeming fixed solely on one another. Sastre's attack proved to be the crucial one, as he seemed quite fresh for having been climbing for over seven hours, staying clear of the pink jersey and blowing past Popovych to claim the stage win. With the time gained on the road as well as bonus seconds at the line, Sastre moved up to third in the overall classification. Menchov outsprinted Di Luca to the finish line, gaining one second on the road and four bonus seconds to slightly pad his lead over Di Luca. Thomas Lövkvist, who had been in the white jersey as best young rider, was dropped very early <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> stage and finished 24 minutes behind the stage winner. He wound up dropping all the way to fifth in the youth classification, with Quick Step rider Kevin Seeldraeyers, 15th overall, assuming the white jersey.|$|E
5|$|The cup defeat {{prompted}} Wenger {{make changes}} to his squad. He signed young England internationals Richard Wright and Francis Jeffers, midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst from Rangers {{as a partner}} for Vieira, and convinced defender Sol Campbell to join from local rivals Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer. Campbell's arrival strengthened a defence which {{was going through a}} transition phase from 1999 and 2001; Steve Bould and Nigel Winterburn moved <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, club graduate Ashley Cole displaced Sylvinho as Wenger's first choice left back, while Lauren acted as Lee Dixon's understudy. Midfielders Fredrik Ljungberg and Robert Pirès – brought in during preceding transfer windows, had now established themselves into the first team. The 2001–02 season brought much success as Wenger led Arsenal to the double once more. The crowning moment was the win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the penultimate game of the season. Sylvain Wiltord scored the winning goal to secure the club's 12th league championship and third double; four days earlier, Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–0 in the 2002 FA Cup Final. The team scored in every single league fixture and were unbeaten away from home that season.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of reverse}} {{transcription}} was very unpopular at first, as it contradicted the central dogma of molecular biology, {{which states that}} DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. However, in 1970, when the scientists Howard Temin and David Baltimore both independently discovered the enzyme responsible for reverse transcription, named reverse transcriptase, the possibility that genetic information could be passed <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> manner was finally accepted.|$|E

25|$|In physics, {{conservation}} laws {{state that}} certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system {{do not change}} as the system evolves over time. In 1915, Emmy Noether discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature. The fact that physical processes don't care where in space they take place (space translation symmetry) yields conservation of momentum, {{the fact that such}} processes don't care when they take place (time translation symmetry) yields conservation of energy, and so <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> section, we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.|$|E
25|$|Halmstad {{began the}} 2008 Allsvenskan season well enough, with four wins and three ties {{after the first}} ten rounds. The team {{continued}} <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fashion, ending at a respectable 8th place with 41 points. But the following season did not end nearly as good. The team began very impressively, with consecutive wins and very few losses. But, following several losses, the team eventually found themselves in the bottom region of the table. However, the team ended the season better and finished 13th with 32 points, just three points from having {{to play in a}} relegation playoff series.|$|E

25|$|Having {{played in}} two Youth Test matches in 1997, he {{impressed}} {{enough to become}} a fully fledged member of the Durham side of 1998, having previously been an occasional member of their Second XI side, and carrying <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> role for five more years. In his debut in Second XI cricket, he finished his first innings admirably, but {{went out in the}} second innings for a duck. Gough played in eleven Youth Test Matches, debuting in South Africa in December 1997, in a match which ended up as a draw having seen England Under-19s follow on from 130 runs behind. He subsequently played against Pakistan, New Zealand and Australia Under-19s.|$|E
25|$|If, at the {{completion}} of its first innings, Team B's first innings total is 200 or more fewer than Team A's, the captain of Team A may (but is not required to) order Team B to have their second innings next. This is called enforcing the follow <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case, the usual order of the third and fourth innings is reversed: Team A will bat in the fourth innings. It is rare for a team forced to follow on to win the match. In Test cricket it has only happened three times, although over 285 follow-ons have been enforced: Australia was the losing team on each occasion, twice to England, in 1894 and in 1981, and once to India in 2001.|$|E
25|$|A {{month later}} on 24 January 2016, Faugheen made his debut at the Leopardstown Racecourse {{and it was}} {{for the first time in}} his three racing seasons when he run in the same {{calendar}} year prior to the Cheltenham Festival in which he was favourite for the Cheltenham Champion Hurdle with the main two dangers in the betting, Arctic Fire and Nichols Canyon also taking him <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> race. Arctic Fire was the 2015 Champion Hurdle runner-up and was considered by the official handicappers the main danger while Nichols Canyon was the only horse to have finished ahead of Faugheen in all of his 13 starts to date and was coming into the race on back of a victory in the Grade 1 December Festival Hurdle. The outsiders of the race were Plinth at 100/1 — Grade 2 Istabraq Hurdle winner at the start of the season trained by Aidan O'Brien and King Of The Picts at 150/1 — a previous season Grade 3 winner over hurdles who reversed back to the smaller obstacles after little success in his previous starts over fences.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in November 1918, Utah {{visited the}} Isle of Portland in Britain, and escorted the liner [...] in December, which carried President Woodrow Wilson to Brest, France, for the post-war peace {{negotiations}} at Versailles. Utah left Brest on 14 December, and arrived in New York on the 25th of the month. She remained there until 30 January 1919, after which time she returned to the normal peacetime routine of fleet exercises and training cruises. On 9 July 1921, Utah departed for Europe, stopping in Lisbon, Portugal, and Cherbourg, France. After arriving, she became the flagship of American warships in Europe. She carried <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> role until she was relieved by the armored cruiser [...] in October 1922.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the sound}} effects in Barton Fink are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie {{sustained}} bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that [...] "I hear everything that goes <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> dump". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed {{as it is with}} the sound of an ocean wave crashing– an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.|$|E

When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I hear everything that goes <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to help them out." ...|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Slanderous" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Mourning" [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] was {{the third}} song that was written for Machine Heads album The Blackening.

[...] In February 2005, Machine Head had penned a rough version of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate". A 13-track November 2005 demo featured the song, although it contained what Flynn described as a [...] "totally fucking lame 'Angel of Death' rip off. I hated it every time we played it so I {{was glad to see}} that part go!" [...] The band entered Sharkbite Studios, in Oakland, California on August 21, 2006 to begin recording.

Karthik Keramalu of CNN-IBN, in his review of Kumari 21F, stated that Sukumar’s lead characters are [...] "psychologically wired differently", adding {{that at least one}} of the characters in his films [...] "behaves in a way that will amuse the audience and the other characters present in the film". Regarding the same, Sukumar said, [...] "We all have a lot of emotions and we suppress most of them fearing rejection. Instead we sport a smile and move <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world. Problems arise when we don’t enjoy all feelings like jealousy, selfishness and don’t express them. To achieve something, there must be a driving force and that could be jealousy which you term as negative".|$|E
