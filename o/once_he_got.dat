5|$|During Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's {{grandmother}} treated Michigan {{head coach}} Fisher, his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard's aunt) and Howard to a soul food dinner. Dutcher had {{the responsibility to}} contact Howard several times a week. Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a driver's license. During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days. Dutcher developed {{an understanding of the}} dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as Lute Olsen, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life, and understood that Kirskey also had sway with Howard. He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that, which became the young athlete's introduction to Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E

He told Members that he was a Welshman and would warm up <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> going: he did.|$|E

On the other hand, it's quite impossible {{to lead him}} astray through his imagination. <b>He</b> hasn't <b>got</b> any--so <b>he's</b> difficult to deceive. He worries things out slowly, and <b>once</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> hold of anything he doesn't let go. The little lady's quite different. More intuition and less common sense. They make a pretty pair working together. Pace and stamina." ...|$|R

Guy was unhappy about this but he chose Neurosurgery over being the CEO, he apologised to Elliot about demoting him from being the Clinical Lead of Darwin and later reinstated him before he stepped down as the CEO.|$|E
25|$|Mount Hood {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{mountains}} Rusk saw when he and his family came from Illinois; however, he did not get to climb it until much later, in 1922. This climb he made solo up the Cooper Spur route. <b>Once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to the top, he spent a long time with the fire lookout, Charles A. Phelps, who regaled him of many his adventures as the lookout. On the way back down, Rusk had one of his few climbing accidents, losing his footing and sliding quickly down the slope for a short distance.|$|E
25|$|During their investigation, {{the police}} came {{to know that the}} couple had a history of {{domestic}} violence and that the couple fought on a regular basis. According to a source, Luetgert had financial difficulties so he started courting a rich widow whom he planned to marry <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> rid of his wife. The police continued their investigation and discovered that on the night of May 1, 1897, the night Louisa disappeared, she was seen entering the factory with her husband at 10:30pm. A watchman from the sausage plant confirmed the story, saying that Mr. Luetgert gave him an errand to run and told him that he could take {{the rest of the night}} off.|$|E

25|$|General Juan Lavalle was {{initially}} neither federalist nor unitarian, but {{after his return}} he began {{to be influenced by}} the unitarians, who tried to gain him for their side. The bulk of the army arrived to Buenos Aires on November 26, being in a bad shape: they lacked clothing and food, they had unpaid wages since months ago, and resented the peace treaty. There were rumors in the city that the army would revolt against the governor Dorrego, but he dismissed those rumors. The leaders of the revolution met on December 1 to organize the coup, and Dorrego began to reconsider it. But according to the memoirs of Tomás de Iriarte, the minister Tomás Guido prevented the government from organizing a proper resistance. Lavalle’s forces gathered in La Recoleta, and began to march at 3:30 in the morning, <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the horses for the cavalry. The admiral William Brown supported the operation and prepared a naval siege of the Fort (modern Casa Rosada), but it was not needed. Lacking any means of defense, Dorrego escaped to the countryside. A group of soldiers occupied the Buenos Aires Cabildo and another secured the police. It was unclear if the Fort would begin a resistance, but once the departure of Dorrego was known, the revolutionaries claimed victory and played a military march.|$|E
25|$|Greene {{was born}} in Alton, Staffordshire, England on April 15, 1817 to Robert Greene and Sefer Woodward. His parents were natives of Staffordshire, as were his two younger {{brothers}} William and Joseph. The family moved to the United States when he was two years old. They settled in Buffalo, New York. His father died in 1825, and his mother returned to England by herself, in hope of obtaining some property that she believed owned to her. She died in England in 1827 and George, {{at the age of}} 10, became an orphan with his brothers. During the next four years he had to provide for himself and his younger brothers. Then he attempted to return to England to recover the property his mother failed to secure. He had to work for his passage to England, and find employment <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> there. He did not reclaim the property and had to work for his passage back to the United States. When he returned, he decided that he would focus on his education, hoping that it would help him gain what he could not through inheritance. He studied one year at Carysville Collegiate Seminary, a year at Aurora Seminary, and two years at French's Collegiate Institute in Geneva, New York. During these four years he taught school as well, and did any other work he could find. He then took up the study of law, with the intention of making it his life profession. He studied with the Hon. George P. Baker in Buffalo, New York. He assisted in Baker's office and was bookkeeper for Dr. Chapin—whom he lived with—to meet his expenses during that time.|$|E
500|$|Hecht-Hill-Lancaster allowed Mackendrick to {{familiarize}} himself with New York City before shooting the movie. In Notes on Sweet Smell of Success, Mackendrick said, [...] "One of the characteristic aspects of New York, particularly {{of the area}} between 42nd Street and 57th Street, is the neurotic energy of the crowded sidewalks. This was, I argued, essential {{to the story of}} characters driven by the uglier aspects of ambition and greed". He took multiple photographs of the city from several fixed points and taped the pictures into a series of panoramas that he stuck on a wall and studied <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> back to Hollywood.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} debate ever since about whether Staunton's letter and {{article should be}} {{regarded}} as a polite refusal or a conditional acceptance of the challenge. Morphy, however, took Staunton's writing as a challenge. Although Staunton had not said anything about playing against Morphy, Morphy assumed that the match could easily be arranged <b>once</b> <b>he</b> just <b>got</b> to England.|$|R
500|$|The {{film was}} {{inspired}} while White was filming The Restorers, after a P-51C Mustang landed for refueling and White met Doug Rozendaal, {{the pilot of}} the Red Tail Project's Tuskegee Airmen plane. [...] When White heard Don Hinz {{had been killed in}} a crash of that very same plane, he felt compelled to do a story focusing on it. <b>Once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> involved in the project, a local PBS station committed to airing the final product, which was an early step in the successful development of the project. [...] When researching the film he noticed a lack of resources about the Tuskegee Airmen and felt driven to fill the void.|$|E
500|$|Dunne {{had never}} found the actual {{writing of the}} Dooley pieces difficult, <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> started—it was finding that initial inspiration, and putting himself in a {{suitable}} frame of mind to compose, that he found increasingly hard after 1905. Aware that the columns were reaching an audience of millions and would be reviewed by critics when placed in book form, Dunne was reluctant to release pieces he considered substandard, and defended his position strongly in correspondence with the syndicators. In 1906, he joined with Ida Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens in forming The American Magazine, a project that occupied time and energy, especially since his regular column, [...] "In the Interpreter's House", contained musings like Mr. Dooley's but without brogue or barroom. This allowed Dunne to make his points without tedious dialect. Thus, the Dooley columns continued only irregularly, occupying parts of each year from 1905 to 1915.|$|E
500|$|According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, [...] "Dodo was {{the most}} {{dedicated}} of players. He practiced {{an incredible amount of}} hours, often all day long. He wouldn't stop to eat. He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that I was aware of. He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. <b>Once,</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E
50|$|Kitchens {{made his}} series debut in 1994, driving the No. 82 Sports World Ford at IRP. Kitchens started 26th, but an early {{accident}} sidetracked his run to a 27th-place finish.

500|$|During the {{airing of}} the first show, Twitter users complained that finalist Angel McKenzie had made it through, as she was {{previously}} a housemate during Big Brother 10 in 2009. However, McKenzie's appearance was overshadowed by stories relating to £1 million winner Nathan Hageman, as {{it was revealed that}} he had a criminal background; it was initially reported that he had served a five-year sentence for breaking into a man's house and assaulting him, but it was later revealed by The Sun that he had in fact been convicted of attacking an ex–girlfriend. This led to the newspaper and Labour MP Hazel Blears calling for Hageman to be stripped of his prize money. ITV had conducted a CRB check on each finalist towards the end of July, over a month prior to the first live show. When later discussing the incident, Simon Cowell said, [...] "I'm {{not in a position to}} force anyone to do anything. <b>Once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> through that's why he got the money, that's his own conscience what he decides to do with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Production of {{the album}} began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from {{frequent}} collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins. The group worked on the album within {{a period of three}} weeks. Jerkins, who had worked with Beyoncé for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, [...] "How is this going to work?' Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?". He stated that <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's [...] "excitement being back in the studio together", calling the process [...] "natural". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{focused on}} the show's fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs. TV Guides Matt Roush, for instance, called the show [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "offbeat", and noted how {{literally}} the series took the metaphor of space operas as Westerns. Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was [...] "jarring", but that <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> used to this, he found the characters cleverly conceived, and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension and humor. Several reviewers, however, criticized the show's setting; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that the melding of the western and science fiction genres was a [...] "forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres {{just for the sake}} of being different" [...] and called the series a [...] "vast disappointment", and Carina Chocano of Salon.com said that while the [...] "space as Wild West" [...] metaphor is fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of the New York Times, reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured [...] "an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, a hard sell during a season dominated by Joe Millionaire".|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning, after satisfying his hunger and thirst with some roots {{which he had}} not to go very far to find, he returned to watch the sea once more, and there he remained, never removing {{his eyes from the}} wonderful scene until the sun was directly over his head; then, when the sea was calm <b>once</b> more, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up and started to walk along the cliff.|$|R

500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned {{a little bit more about}} what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities <b>once</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|E

However, after Obama was elected, she expressed that she would likely never do so again, saying in a 2013 interview in The Huffington Post that [...] "In some ways I'm disappointed, {{but in some ways}} it was silly to expect more.
