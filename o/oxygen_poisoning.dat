50|$|An {{example of}} histotoxic hypoxia is cyanide poisoning. There is a {{profound}} drop in tissue oxygen consumption since the reaction of oxygen with cytochrome oxidase is blocked {{by the presence of}} cyanide. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion on cytochrome oxidase a3 and prevents the fourth and final reaction in the electron transport chain. This completely stops oxidative phosphorylation and prevents the mitochondria from producing ATP. There are other chemicals that interrupt the mitochondrial electron transport chain (e.g., rotenone, antimycin A) and produce effects on tissue oxygenation similar to that of cyanide. Oxygen extraction decreases in parallel with the lower oxygen consumption, with a resulting increase in venous oxygen content and PvO2.

In this context, surface stress measurements have proven to be a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying catalysts and hydrogen storage materials in both vacuum and electrochemical environments. In each of these cases we have been able to determine thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural aspects of the phenomena under study. Technical Barriers One could reasonably argue that of all the technical barriers to the hydrogen economy, the overpotential required for the turn-on of oxygen reduction on Pt and the stable-high density storage of hydrogen are two of the most critical. We have been using high-sensitivity surface stress measurements (the most sensitive known to exist) to examine oxygen reduction on Pt electrodes. We have found that the water structure at the catalyst interface plays a critical role in the overpotential required for oxygen reduction, a big step in understanding the origins of this technical barrier. We have also been examining H-loading into storage materials to directly inspect thermodynamic parameters (e. g. molar volume, etc.), kinetics and cycling fatigue.

Density functional theory calculations are used in combination with the computational hydrogen electrode approach to calculate the free energy profile for electrochemical protonation of O and N 2 species on cuboctahedral Mo 13 nanoclusters.

The potentials required to reduce oxygen off the surface are − 0. 72 V or lower for all oxygen coverages studied, and it is thus possible to (re) activate (partially) oxidized nanoclusters for electrochemical ammonia production, e. g., using a dry proton conductor or an aqueous electrolyte.

40|$|Disease in prawn is any {{abnormal}} condition {{which may}} affect adversely the appearance, growth, {{and function of}} the animal. It {{may or may not}} result in mortalities. Disease outbreaks occur commonly in different culture systems such as hatcheries and grow-out ponds. Disease develops through the interaction of the prawn (the host), the causal agent (the pathogen), and the environment. In the presence of a susceptible host, a pathogen and predisposing environmental conditions (poor water quality, inadequate food, frequent handling, overstocking), disease is very likely to occur. Improved environmental conditions, healthy prawns and absence of disease agents would therefore lessen the chance of a disease outbreak. The causal agents may be pathogenic organisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, microcrustaceans) or nonpathogenic adverse environmental conditions (extreme temperatures, low <b>oxygen</b> levels, chemical <b>poisons).</b> Living disease agents cause infectious disease which generally result in gradual mortalities. Non-living disease agents cause non-infectious diseases that result in sudden mass mortalities. The environment determines the balance between the prawn as host and the disease agent. Microorganisms are always present in the water and some of them cause disease only when the prawn has been weakened through exposure to stressful environmental conditions. Hatchery personnel should realize that they themselves could transmit disease through their contaminated hands, clothing, and footwear. Equipment such as water pumps, blowers, pipes, and materials such as scoop nets, water hoses, pails, glasswares are also possible carriers of disease agents. Spawners, live natural food like diatoms, rotifers and brine shrimp, and artificial diets could also be vehicles of disease transmission. The prawn culturist, thus, must be able to manage the environment and make it favorable for the prawn. Hatchery management should, therefore, include operation procedures that will reduce the possibility of disease development during larval rearing. This manual recommends practices for disease prevention to prawn hatchery operators and technicians...|$|R
