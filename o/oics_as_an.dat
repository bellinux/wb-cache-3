However, it was opposed by Pakistan. India has never since made a formal application to join <b>OIC</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> observer or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> member state. While India's potential candidacy is supported by some OIC members, Pakistan's strong opposition and threat to boycott the OIC has effectively led to India's inclusion in the OIC being blocked. The Pakistan Foreign Office has argued that India's inclusion in OIC would violate the rules of the OIC, which require that an aspirant state should not have an ongoing conflict with a member state.|$|R

40|$|As economies {{become more}} innovation-driven, {{the need for}} {{entrepreneurial}} behaviour amongst employees working for existing companies increases {{in order to enhance}} the organisations' capacity to develop new ideas, products and services. Hence, entrepreneurial learning and the development of entrepreneurial competencies of employees on-the-job become more important. One of the most crucial competencies in this regard is the ability to identify potential business opportunities, referred to as opportunity identification competence (OIC). In this empirical study, antecedents of OIC were investigated in a small and medium-sized business context. Based on the 3 -P (i. e. presage, process, product) model, specific learner, work environment, and process factors influencing <b>OIC</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> outcome variable were studied. More than 200 employees from 12 companies completed a questionnaire.

40|$|Following the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran's {{relations}} with the OIC were largely characterised by mutual mistrust and a continuing battle for hegemony within the organisation. This piece explores how Iran sought to utilise one of the world's pre-eminent religious-based international organisations <b>as</b> <b>an</b> arena to further {{its position in the}} Muslim world not, as in previous years, through reprimand and alleged subversion, but rather through a policy based on détente and dialogue. It charts how the Khatami administration chose the <b>OIC</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> forum in which to showcase the key instruments of a new, conciliatory foreign policy based on the twin principles of détente and Dialogue among Civilisations. Using a range of Iranian and English-language sources, the article explores the application of these ideas as foreign policy tools and demonstrates how inter-religious dialogue and the use of a culture-based foreign policy was cultivated by Iran <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means of furthering its standing in the grouping and in wider international affairs. It examines how Iran's own ummah-wide aspirations were maintained in a way that sought to emphasise cooperation rather than confrontation, highlighting how Khatami's nuanced approach of blending religious and political discourse represents one of the more constructive diplomatic endeavours of the Islamic Republic to date...|$|R

40|$|Many {{scholars}} and service practitioners perceive service recovery <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important means to retain customer after service failures, {{but in practice}} many service recovery efforts are unsuccessful. Studies on service recovery suggest that recovery activities are the core process of service operations and frontline teams {{play an important role}} in performing such activities. So we propose operational improvement competence (<b>OIC)</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new approach that is highly relevant to process improvement and frontline teams for improving service recovery performance. We also draw on role stress theory and conservation of resources theory to argue that frontline teams peculiar characteristic (i. e.; role stress) and two types of important resources (i. e.; organization inducement and psychological resilience) moderate the effectiveness of OIC in improving service recovery performance. Based on data collected from 146 frontline teams in the banking sector in China, we test our posited hypotheses. Our study advances knowledge on service operations by establishing a link between OIC and service recovery performance. Our findings also contribute to the literature by showing that the process improvement approach can enhance service recovery performance, and ascertaining the intricacies among OIC, the peculiar characteristic pertinent to frontline teams, and service recovery in service firms.

5000|$|With the {{collapse}} of the isolationist communist regime, Albania's geopolitical orientation between West and East and the role of Christianity and Islam became debated among Albanian intellectuals and its politicians. Within the context of nationalist discourses during the 1990s the governing Albanian democratic party regarding European aspirations stressed aspects of Catholicism and as some government members were Muslims made overtures to Islam to join international organisations like the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In 1992 Albania became the only entirely European member of the OIC, generating intense controversy within Albania due to concerns that Albania might drift from a secular European future. The Albanian government viewed membership in the <b>OIC</b> <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> bridge between the Muslim-Christian worlds and also <b>as</b> having <b>a</b> [...] "civilising mission" [...] role within the Islamic world due to the Western orientation of Albania. The government of Sali Berisha in the 1990s generated a Muslim network in Albania which was dismantled by the incoming Socialist government in 1997. By 1998-99 Albania's OIC membership was suspended and temporarily withdrawn by prime-minister Fatos Nano who viewed it as inhibiting Albania's European aspirations. In the post communist period different socio-political reactions have occurred by regional neighbours and international powers toward Albania and Muslim Albanians. For example, in the 1990s, Greece preferred and assisted Orthodox Albanian leaders like Fatos Nano in Albania over Muslim Albanian ones like Sali Berisha as they were seen as being friendlier to Greek interests. During the Kosovo crisis (1998-1999), the Albanian political establishment was concerned with Western public opinion viewing Albanians as [...] "Islamic" [...] due to Serbian government claims portraying the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) as interested in creating a Balkan Islamic state.|$|R

40|$|The {{cross-sectional}} behaviour {{of steel}} sections {{can be shown}} to be influenced by two extreme behaviors: the resistance and the instability. These boundaries are accounted for in current standards through a classification system consisting on rules depending on the cross-section dimensions. For example, in EN 1993 - 1 - 1, classes are defined spanning from stocky sections (class 1) able to develop their full plastic capacity, to slender sections (class 4) for which the effective properties are used {{with the use of the}} effective width method (EWM). However, for cold-formed steel sections, characterized by a non-linear material law, the cross-section resistance can go beyond its plastic capacity due to strain hardening effects. Moreover, with the emergence of high strength steel (i. e. cross-sections falling into class 4) and more complex cross-section shapes, the effective width method is becoming too complicated. Many other reasons and discrepancies are making the cross-section classification too complex and inconsistent. The Overall Interaction Concept (<b>OIC)</b> stands <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new design approach that aims at a straightforward design check of the stability and resistance of steel cross-sections. Based on the use of a generalized relative slenderness and so-called interaction curves, it can be applied to any type of cross-section, further includes potential non-linear material behaviour and covers combined loading cases. The main aim of this thesis is to develop and propose OIC interaction curves dedicated to steel hollow sections subjected to various load cases. A test program was carried out <b>as</b> <b>a</b> part of a European project named ‘HOLLOPOC’ to investigate the cross-sectional behavior of cold-formed hot-finished and hot-rolled square, rectangular and circular sections. 57 cross-sections tests including simple and combined load cases were performed. Besides, a finite element model was developed and calibrated on the basis of the tests, and its accuracy was seen to be sufficient to subsequently undergo an extensive numerical parametric study for hot-rolled and cold-formed cross-sections, leading to over than 40 000 numerical results. Based on these computations, design proposals were made within the context of the Overall Interaction Concept, using an extension of the Ayrton-Perry approach. Finally, a validation of the proposed formulae was made through a comparison with existing approach and worked examples were presented, in order to illustrate (i) the application of the method and (ii) its benefits in comparison to application of current EC 3 rules...|$|R
