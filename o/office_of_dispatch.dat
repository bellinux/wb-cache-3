5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} Empire again in 293AD, {{appointing}} two Caesars (junior emperors) to rule over further subdivisions of East and West. Each would be subordinate {{to their respective}} Augustus (senior emperor) but would act with supreme authority in his assigned lands. This system would later be called the Tetrarchy. Diocletian's first appointee for the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> Caesar was Constantius; his second was Galerius, a native of Felix Romuliana. According to Lactantius, Galerius was a brutal, animalistic man. Although he shared the paganism of Rome's aristocracy, he seemed to them an alien figure, a semi-barbarian. On 1 March, Constantius was promoted to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> Caesar, and <b>dispatched</b> to Gaul to fight the rebels Carausius and Allectus. In spite of meritocratic overtones, the Tetrarchy retained vestiges of hereditary privilege, and Constantine became the prime candidate for future appointment as Caesar {{as soon as his}} father took the position. Constantine went to the court of Diocletian, where he lived as his father's heir presumptive.|$|R
2500|$|Jackson — in {{the late}} 1960s, Ketcham decided to add an African American {{character}} named Jackson to the cast. Ketcham designed Jackson {{in the tradition of}} a stereotypical cartoon pickaninny, with huge lips, big white eyes, and just a suggestion of an Afro hair style. A panel from May 13, 1970 depicted Jackson and Dennis playing in the backyard, with Dennis saying to his father, [...] "I'm havin' some race trouble with Jackson. He runs FASTER than I do!" [...] The attempt to integrate the feature did not go over well. Protests erupted in Detroit, Little Rock, Miami, and St. Louis, and debris was thrown at the <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> the Post <b>Dispatch.</b> Taken aback, Ketcham issued a statement explaining that his intentions were innocent, and Jackson was not used again. However, another African American character named Jay Weldon appeared in the 1986 animated series to far less controversy, as he was not a stereotype.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1905, Soo was in London for an {{engagement}} at the Hippodrome. His rival, magician Ching Ling Foo, was performing {{at the nearby}} Empire Theatre. By this time, Foo was aware that Chung Ling Soo was actually William Robinson {{and that he had}} copied virtually his entire act. He publicly called Chung Ling Soo an imposter and became intent on publicly exposing him as such. In order to garner publicity, Foo's promoter publicly announced that he would duplicate at least half of Chung Ling Soo's illusions to prove that he was the real [...] "Original Chinese Conjurer". Soo accepted the challenge and agreed to meet Foo at the <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> The Weekly <b>Dispatch</b> for a press conference. When Ching Ling Foo realized that the press was not interested in Chung Ling Soo's real identity, he refused to attend the press conference and backed out of the challenge. The episode was a public embarrassment for Ching Ling Foo, who played at the Empire Theatre for only four weeks (Chung Ling Soo's engagement at the Hippodrome lasted three months).|$|R

30|$|The study <b>of</b> {{economic}} <b>dispatch</b> {{dates back}} to the 1920 s. The spatial and temporal distribution variation of load demand is the prime cause <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch.</b> The goal <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> is the advanced decision-making for base-point generations of units and configuration of spinning reserves based on load forecast. From classical economic dispatch centering on the concepts of incremental cost, incremental loss and hydro-coal conversion equivalent in the mid and late of 1950 s [1], to the optimal power flow considering network security in the 1960 s [2], thence to the theories <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and control which emphasizing the coordination <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and automatic generation control (AGC) in the 1980 s [3, 4], the study <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch</b> has been relatively mature in theory and practice.|$|R

The employers <b>of</b> <b>dispatched</b> work agencies already hired or registered a certain amount <b>of</b> laborers, and <b>dispatched</b> them to the users enterprise to provide labor services when the enterprise had the demand. At that time, labor dispatching played matchmaker between the females, the older workers and dispatched work agencies. After 1975, due to the arising demand <b>of</b> many enterprises, <b>dispatched</b> work agencies grew rapidly.|$|R

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} and solved which captures {{the essence of the}} concept <b>of</b> mobile <b>dispatch</b> service. There are two types <b>of</b> users, <b>dispatch</b> and interconnect (calls routed from the public switched telephone network, of much longer holding times). Also, only some of the available repeaters can be used for interconnect traffic, and blocked interconnect calls are cleared. Dispatch calls, however, can access all repeaters, and then are queued if all repeaters are busy. One design decision involves a trade between blocking of interconnect calls and queueing <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> calls. A formula has been derived for both interconnect blocking probability and the mean dispatch queueing time to permit this trade. The results indicate that a good operating point is to have (N - a_d) (rounded down) interconnected repeaters, where there are N total repeaters and a_d Erlangs <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> traffic...|$|R
