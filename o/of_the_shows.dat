5|$|Neighbours {{executive}} producer Susan Bower said {{the creation of}} the character and his storyline was a result of requests from young viewers in the Neighbours website forums.

5|$|Although cartoon {{animals are}} often anthropomorphized, Santa's Little Helper {{generally}} exhibits canine behavior. Cast member Dan Castellaneta currently provides the dog's sounds on the show, but voice artist Frank Welker has also voiced him.

5000|$|<b>The</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> is {{a play on}} words. Mario is <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> and Netas is a Mexican Spanish {{slang for}} truth, so roughly {{translated}} <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> name would be [...] "Mario's truths".

5|$|The 8-track {{tapes of}} the three shows were {{carefully}} put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for future use. For the album's 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and archivist Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band's management if the tapes could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed the tapes at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, that was then mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including as much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shows</b> as possible and setting a realistic price that most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled Live in Japan. This included all {{of the three}} main shows except for two tracks already available on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{songs that}} could be considered American popular music, as opposed to the popular music of a particular region or ethnicity, were sentimental parlor songs by Stephen Foster and his peers, and songs meant for use in minstrel shows, theatrical productions that featured singing, dancing and comic performances. Minstrel shows generally used African instruments and dance, and featured performers with their faces blackened, a technique called blackface. By the middle of the 19th century, touring companies had taken this music not only to every part of the United States, but also to the UK, Western Europe, and even to Africa and Asia. Minstrel shows were generally advertised as though the music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shows</b> was in an African American style, though this was often not true.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{featured}} royal themes {{with the}} singer emulating different queens through her fashion {{for which she}} collaborated with numerous designers and fashion houses. The set list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shows</b> in 2013 included songs from all four studio albums of Beyoncé's solo career. After the release of her eponymous fifth studio album, the 2014 shows were changed to incorporate tracks from the album. The tour was lauded by music critics who praised Beyoncé for her energetic performances, dancing and vocal abilities.|$|E
50|$|Lebo M, Tsidii LeLoka, Willi Welp and Gustavo Vaz {{were the}} only actors who were {{performers}} and directors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> Lebo M was <b>the</b> composer <b>of</b> various <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> songs and performed on Broadway (1997-2000), Willi Welp performed as Scar from 2005 to 2015 and then left to be <b>the</b> resident director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> German production and Gustavo was <b>the</b> resident director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> Brazilian production {{at the same time}} he was a Scar and Pumbaa standby.

5|$|Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo, the arrangers for the Symphonic Fantasies and Symphonic Legends concerts, {{returned}} {{as the lead}} arrangers for the concert. Additional arrangements were made by Jani Laaksonen and Masashi Hamauzu, and Mikko Laine served as the lyricist for the choral components of the concert. Uematsu {{was not involved in}} any aspect of the production, even song selection, as he wanted to be surprised by the result. The style of arrangements followed in the tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shows</b> preceding Symphonic Odysseys, featuring a number of rich, sophisticated suites structured for melodic storytelling. A focus was put on presenting a balanced mix of fan favorites as well as lesser known material that was not commonly performed in orchestra concerts based on video game music. Böcker styled the concert to be a mix of Shades and Fantasies, in that there was a mix of shorter pieces with longer suites. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were the Final Fantasy series, King's Knight, Chrono Trigger, the SaGa series, The Last Story, Blue Dragon, and Lost Odyssey. Additionally, Uematsu composed an original fanfare to open the concert, which was arranged by Jonne Valtonen.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{of these shows}} developed them using a variant on the CTW model, a flexible model of production based upon {{the experiences of the}} creators and {{producers of}} the U.S. show. The model consisted of the combination of producers and researchers working together on the show, the development of a unique curriculum, and extensive test screening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shows.</b> The shows came to be called co-productions, and they contained original sets, characters, and curriculum goals. Different co-productions were produced, depending upon each country's needs and resources. They included both dubbed versions of the American show and versions created, developed, and produced in each country that reflected their needs, educational priorities, and culture. For example, the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, from the South African co-production Takalani Sesame, was created in 2003 to address the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, and was met with controversy in the U.S.. By 2006, there were 20co-productions in countries all over the world. In 2001, there were more than 120million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street, and by the US show's 40thanniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140countries.|$|E
