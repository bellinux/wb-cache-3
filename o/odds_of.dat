40|$|Use {{of condoms}} for {{protection}} against {{sexually transmitted diseases}} (STDs) was examined over a nine-month period among 536 women from 17 clinics in southeastern Texas who had selected the injectable depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) as a contraceptive. Among women who were using condoms prior to receiving DMPA, nearly half said they never or rarely did so after initiating DMPA use; only 18 % of all women in the study used condoms consistently while relying on DMPA. Factors associated with consistent condom use were being black (<b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2. 0), being unmarried (<b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2. 2), having a history <b>of</b> STD infection (<b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 1. 8), having previously used condoms (<b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2. 7) and having no interest in future childbearing (<b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 1. 8).

30|$|It bears {{mentioning}} that the magnitudes {{of the gender}} coefficients, though still very large, are substantially smaller in the set of analyses using the FT sample in comparison {{to those in the}} set of preliminary analyses referred to above. For example, the Netherlands has one of the largest gender coefficients. In Model 3, the gender coefficient declines from −[*] 2.16 to −[*] 1.19, corresponding to <b>odds</b> ratios <b>of</b> 0.12 and 0.30, respectively. An <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 0.12 means that holding constant all other variables in the model, males are about 8.5 times more likely than females to achieve the upper quartile. The corresponding interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 0.30 is that for the FT sample the male advantage is “only” a factor of 3.3. With one of the smallest gender coefficients among the 20 countries, the decline in the U.S. is only from −[*] 0.91 to −[*] 0.78, corresponding to <b>odds</b> ratios <b>of</b> 0.40 and 0.46, respectively. The male advantage in terms <b>of</b> <b>odds</b> ratios is thus reduced from a factor of 2.48 to 2.18.|$|R
50|$|Although 40-65% of AD {{patients}} {{have at least}} one copy of the ε4 allele, ApoE4 is not a determinant of the disease - at least a third of patients with AD are ApoE4 negative and some ApoE4 homozygotes never develop the disease. Yet those with two ε4 alleles have up to 20 times the risk of developing AD. There is also evidence that the ApoE2 allele may serve a protective role in AD. Thus, the genotype most at risk for Alzheimer's disease and at an earlier age is ApoE 4,4. Using genotype ApoE 3,3 as a benchmark (with the persons who have this genotype regarded as having a risk level of 1.0), individuals with genotype ApoE4,4 have an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 14.9 of developing Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with the ApoE 3,4 genotype face an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 3.2, and people with a copy of the 2 allele and the 4 allele (ApoE2,4), have an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2.6. Persons with one copy each of the 2 allele and the 3 allele (ApoE2,3) have an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 0.6. Persons with two copies of the 2 allele (ApoE2,2) also have an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 0.6.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether breast-feeding has a dose-related protective effect against illness and whether it confers special health benefits to poor infants. METHODS: The association between breast-feeding dose and illnesses in the first 6 months of life was analyzed with generalized estimating equations regression for 7092 infants from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Breast-feeding dose (ratio of breast-feedings to other feedings) was categorized as full, most, equal, less, or no breast-feeding. RESULTS: Compared with no breast-feeding, full breast-feeding infants had lower <b>odds</b> ratios <b>of</b> diarrhea, cough or wheeze, and vomiting and lower mean ratios of illness months and sick baby medical visits. Most breast-feeding infants had lower <b>odds</b> ratios <b>of</b> diarrhea and cough or wheeze, and equal breast-feeding infants had lower <b>odds</b> ratios <b>of</b> cough or wheeze. Full, most, and equal breast-feeding infants without siblings had lower <b>odds</b> ratios <b>of</b> ear infections and certain other illnesses, but those with siblings did not. Less breast-feeding infants had no reduced <b>odds</b> ratios <b>of</b> illness. Findings did not vary by income. CONCLUSIONS: Full breast-feeding was associated with the lowest illness rates. Minimal (less) breast-feeding was not protective. Breast-feeding conferred similar health benefits in all economic groups...|$|R

40|$|Background: Pneumonia is {{the main}} cause of late infant {{mortality}} in Chile. Over 60 % of these deaths occur at home. The lack of hospital beds and the inadequate outpatient management are contributing factors. Aim: To assess risk factors for home deaths due to pneumonia in Chilean children. Patients and methods: The clinical and environmental histories of 53 (39 male) children that died due to pneumonia in their homes were analyzed. The cause of death was confirmed by necropsy with histopathological studies in all cases. These cases were compared with 88 control children of similar age, gender, socioeconomic status and living in the same geographical area of Metropolitan Santiago. Results: Fifty four percent of deceased children were of less than 3 months of age and only 3 cases and their controls were above 1 year old. Identified risk factors for death were malnutrition with an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 30. 6 (CI 3. 9 - 64. 8, p< 0. 001), low birth weight with an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 5 (CI 1. 8 - 14. 1, p< 0. 001), previous admissions to hospitals with an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 5. 79 (CI 2 - 17. 1, p< 0. 001), congenital malformations (mainly cardiac) with an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 8. 4 (CI 2 - 39. 9, p= 0. 001) and a history of bronchial obstruction with an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 5. 68 (p< 0. 001). Identified maternal risk factors were smoking with an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 4. 13 (CI 1. 6 - 10. 7 p< 0. 001) and being a teenager with an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>of</b> 4. 3 (CI 1. 7 - 11, p< 0. 001). Malnutrition, low birth weight, history of previous hospital admissions and having a teenager or smoker mother were considered as independent risk factors using a stepwise analysis. Conclusions: Chilean low income children have identifiable risk factors for death at their homes due to pneumonia, that can be preventively managed. (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 627 - 32...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> disease for individuals having a specific allele and the <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E
