25|$|On 14 January 2013, No. 35 Squadron was re-raised {{under the}} command of Wing Commander Brad Clarke as an element of No. 84 Wing.

The squadron is based at RAAF Base Richmond. On 21 January 2014 No. 35 Squadron was temporarily transferred from No. 84 Wing to the C-27J Transition Team. The squadron will return to No. 84 Wing once its Spartans near initial operating capability status. The RAAF's first C-27J arrived in Australia on 25 June 2015, and No. 35 Squadron will begin operating the type from Richmond. However, the squadron is planned to move to Amberley prior to achieving full operational capability in December 2017.
