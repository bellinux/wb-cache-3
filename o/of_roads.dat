40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} hypothesis verification in automatic road extraction based on the topology <b>of</b> <b>road</b> networks. The method includes the generation <b>of</b> topology <b>of</b> <b>road</b> networks, verification <b>of</b> hypothesized <b>road</b> segments and prediction <b>of</b> missing <b>road</b> segments. The topology <b>of</b> <b>road</b> networks is generated using small scale aerial images as they exhibit a global structure <b>of</b> <b>road</b> networks. The hypotheses <b>of</b> <b>road</b> segments produced in medium scale images are verified using their relationships with the generated topological information <b>of</b> <b>road</b> networks. The missing road segments are also predicted during this process using topological information. An aerial image with an image scale of 1 : 25, 000 in New South Wales is tested. To generate the topology <b>of</b> <b>road</b> network, the images are resampled with a reduction factor of 15. The test {{results show that the}} topology <b>of</b> <b>road</b> network can be effectively used to remove spurious hypotheses and to infer the missing road segments. 1 INTRODUCT [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{taxation}} of ownership and operation <b>of</b> <b>road</b> vehicles in the Czech Republic. The result of study is the formulation of principles and functions that taxation <b>of</b> <b>road</b> vehicles should meet, including the subsequent evaluation of the feasibility of the optimal structure of the proposed tax. The text identifies many requirements for taxes and tax system, and also functions which have to be fulfilled. These findings are applied to the taxation <b>of</b> <b>road</b> motor vehicles. We find out, during use of standard general methods of scientific work, that taxation <b>of</b> <b>road</b> motor vehicles must provide primarily a fiscal function of a tax in sense of selection of means for the renewal of environmental and other damage caused by operation <b>of</b> <b>road</b> motor vehicles. It is not suitable to prefer other principles primarily in terms of redistribution, stabilization, and other requirements during taxation of operation or ownership <b>of</b> <b>road</b> vehicle.

Nevertheless, it is appropriate to consider the introduction of at least the best possible alternative of constructed model <b>of</b> taxation <b>of</b> <b>road</b> motor vehicles in the Czech Republic.
