25|$|At 5:30pm on 30 May 1940 a {{telephone}} request {{was made by}} the naval officer in charge at Margate that the Lord Southborough be launched and go across the channel to Dunkirk to help in the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force and the French Army. The lifeboat with her coxswain Edward Parker and her crew aboard headed off to Dunkirk, along with 18 other lifeboats which had been commandeered to help. The Margate crew were one of only three RNLI lifeboat crews used in the evacuation that were allowed to take their own lifeboat across. Many of the others were crewed by Navy ratings. Lord Southborough was second to arrive at the Dunkirk beaches, with the Ramsgate lifeboat Prudential (ON 697) arriving a little before. The two lifeboats spent their first hours on the beaches ferrying soldiers from the shore to larger ships in deeper water off shore. The Lord Southborough has been credited with having brought off 600 military personnel from the beaches of Dunkirk, but the true figure is thought to be far greater than this. 500 of these were conveyed from the beach at La Panne to the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Icarus. The Commanding Officer of the destroyer, Lieutenant Commander E. G. Roper, said of the Lord Southborough’s crew On behalf of every officer and man on this ship, I should like to express to you our unbound admiration for the magnificent behaviour of the crew of the lifeboat Lord Southborough…. The manner in which, with no thought of rest, they brought <b>off</b> <b>load</b> after load of soldiers under continuous shelling, bombing and aerial machine-gun fire will be an inspiration to us all as long as we live. We are proud to be the fellow countrymen of such men. The Lord Southborough’s Coxswain Edward Parker was one of the two lifeboat coxswains who were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their services at Dunkirk the other being Harold Knight coxswain of the Ramsgate Lifeboat.|$|E

50|$|Internal glazing {{and carbon}} {{build-up}} {{is due to}} prolonged periods of running at low speeds or low loads. Such conditions may occur when an engine is left idling as a 'standby' generating unit, ready to run up when needed, (misuse); if the engine powering the set is over-powered (misapplication) for the load applied to it, causing the diesel unit to be under-loaded, or as is very often the case, when sets are started and run <b>off</b> <b>load</b> as a test (misuse).|$|E

Upon returning to San Diego, she started preparation for preservation, was decommissioned on 19 March 1992. [...] She was towed to Bremerton, Washington, added to the United States Navy Reserve Fleet and stayed there until mid-1999. She was eventually transferred to the Mexican Navy renamed as the Armada Republica Mexicana Ignacio Allende F-211.|$|E
50|$|During the {{prohibition}} era {{the waters of}} the South Coast were a popular smuggling route in for alcohol. Largely forgotten in the later parts of the 20th Century, with increased security at the Mexico-United States border smuggling has increased; during the 2011 fiscal year, more than 200 smuggling vessels were observed. Most of the vessels attempt to <b>off</b> <b>load</b> their cargo of drugs and/or illegal immigrants in San Diego County, however destinations are as far north as the California Central Coast. Often, vessels used for smuggling operations are abandoned upon making landfall.|$|E
50|$|Castell Moel (Green Castle) {{is a local}} {{landmark}} at {{the sharp}} bend on the B4312. The ruins of the impressive, late medieval residence still stand. It was never a castle but a residence built for the Reed family in the early 15th century and was in ruin in Elizabethan times. It is possible {{there had been some}} earthen fortification there at one time. Some believe this to be at Old Castle. Doubtless this would have been a motte and bailey. Until recent times ships used to lie at anchor below to <b>off</b> <b>load</b> onto lighter vessels for transport to Carmarthen.|$|E

50|$|After many plot {{twists and}} {{harrowing}} experiences Jesse and Gail uncover {{the fact that}} Bret Easton {{is one of the}} leaders of the terrorist group and the reason he tried to murder Jesse was that Jesse's screenplay, of which Jesse is the real author, comes very close to describing the terrorists' latest attack plan. Meanwhile, the terrorists have secretly taken control of three airliners and have landed them on remote and desolate airfields that have been prepared in advance to <b>off</b> <b>load</b> and imprison the airliners' passengers and then quickly retrofit the planes to each transport and drop a nuclear bomb on three cities in the United States. These cities are Washington, D.C., New York City, and Miami, Florida.|$|E
50|$|Traditional high {{performance}} processors hit a performance wall {{during the late}} 2000s when clock-speeds couldn't be increased anymore due to increasing power requirements. One of the solutions is to include hardware to <b>off</b> <b>load</b> the most common and/or compute intensive tasks to specialized hardware called accelerators. This research area will try to identify these areas and design algorithms and hardware to overcome the bottlenecks. There will probably be accelerators doing pattern detection, parsing, data lookup and signal processing. The hardware will be of two classes; fixed accelerators for static tasks, or programmable accelerators {{for a family of}} tasks with similar characteristics. The project will also look att massively parallel computing using commodity graphics processors.|$|E
5000|$|A simple circuit {{used the}} DMA {{feature of the}} 1802 to permit entry of {{programs}} and data into RAM through the toggle switches. Entering a byte via the toggle switches and pressing the [...] "input" [...] button would enter a byte into RAM and display it on the pair of hex LEDs, then advance the DMA counter to the next location. A [...] "memory protect" [...] switch {{could be used to}} disable memory alteration. If an error was made in program entry, it could be corrected by turning on memory protect, turning <b>off</b> <b>load</b> mode (thus resetting the program counter to zero), turning on load mode, and pressing [...] "input" [...] to advance to the address of the incorrect data. After turning off memory protect, the correct value could be entered.|$|E

50|$|Little is {{revealed}} about George's family in Man About the House, except {{that his mother}} died in the late fifties or early sixties. In George and Mildred, his father Jack comes {{to stay with him}} and Mildred, despite the couples attempts to get rid of him. In the end, they <b>off</b> <b>load</b> him to the local nursing home. His youngest sibling, Charlie, also comes for a stay, and reveals that a letter arrived for a G. Roper, and they were call-up papers. They turned out to be for his sister, Gloria. He doesn't like Mildred's mother or her sister and brother-in-law, Ethel and Humphrey (Avril Elgar and Reginald Marsh), but he has no obvious relationship with Mildred's other sister, Hilda (Jean Harrow). His best fried, Jerry (Roy Kinnear) appears lots, but only brings strife towards the Ropers.|$|E
50|$|When a trawler {{was intercepted}} landing arms and {{ammunition}} at Vung Ro Bay in northern Khánh Hòa Province on 16 February 1965. it provided the first tangible evidence of the North Vietnamese supply operation. This {{became known as the}} Vung Ro Bay Incident. Operation Market Time was established by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff at the request of General William C. Westmoreland, commanding general of Military Assistance Command Vietnam. He requested that the U.S. Navy establish a naval blockade of the vast South Vietnam coastline against North Vietnamese gun-running trawlers. The trawlers, usually 100-foot-long Chinese-built steel-hulled coastal freighters, could carry several tons of {{arms and ammunition}} in their hulls. Not flying a national ensign that would identify them, the ships would maneuver “innocently” out in the South China Sea, waiting for the cover of darkness to make high-speed runs to the South Vietnam coastline. If successful, the ships would <b>off</b> <b>load</b> their cargoes to waiting Việt Cộng or North Vietnamese forces.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988 the {{technology}} laboratory {{moved to the}} International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet (IDC) in Minnesota. Memory-based reflectance meters with AGP analysis were used in all clinical research project. AGP was extensively used to characterize abnormalities in pregnancy, type 1 and type 2 diabetes., [...] This led to a re-designation of the laboratory as: WHO Collaborating Center for Diabetes Education, Translation and Computer Technologies (a joint program of IDC and Mayo Clinic). In 2004 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was introduced. A small sensor placed under the skin for three days (by 2013 up to 14 days) would measure glucose continuously and transmit the results to a receiver, which would periodically be connected to a PC to produce reports for the health care provider. Because CGM would overcome the episodic nature of SMBG, overnight glucose values, postprandial values and glucose levels during and after activity would be instantly available to the patient and later to the physician for analysis. For most systems, the patient had to calibrate the sensor by SMBG 2-4 times per day and the physician had to <b>off</b> <b>load</b> the data into proprietary non-standardized reports. Nevertheless, {{with the advent of}} CGM it was now possible to use AGP analysis to characterize diurnal patterns.|$|E
