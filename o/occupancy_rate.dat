5|$|The Clal Center {{enjoyed a}} high <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> from {{government}} offices, businesses, and private companies until the mid-1980s. The construction of Malha Mall and government facilities at Givat Ram precipitated {{the exodus of}} many private and government firms in the 1990s, leaving entire floors of the office tower unoccupied.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} rental concessions on apartment rent and <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates.</b> Using limited-information maximum likelihood estimation, equations for rent, occupancy, and concessions show that landlord-supplied rental concessions {{have a positive effect}} on both rent and <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates.</b> Rental concessions seem to provide the landlord a means to collect higher average rent and at the same time to increase <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates.</b> The results also indicate that a negative relationship exists between rent and <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> and that certain amenities, services, and occupancy restrictions influence rent. ...|$|R
40|$|Sialylated glycoproteins, which play {{important}} roles in tumor progression, have been extensively analyzed for the discovery of potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The site-specific N-sialoglycan <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> of glycoproteins reflect the activities of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases in vivo and could be novel disease biomarkers. However, a high-throughput method to determine the N-sialoglycan <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> is not available. On {{the basis of the}} fact that dihydroxy of sialic acid of glycan chains in glycoproteins can be specifically oxidized to aldehyde in mild periodate concentration while all types of glycan chains can be oxidized in high periodate concentration, we developed a modified protein-level hydrazide chemistry method for the determination of the N-sialoglycan <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates.</b> This method was first applied to determine the N-sialoglycan <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> of two glycosites on human transferrin. These two sites were found to be fully sialylated and the N-sialoglycan <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> were found to under significant decrease after the neuraminidase treatment. This method was then applied to analyze N-sialoglycan <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> in proteome samples. We determined 496 and 632 site-specific N-sialoglycan <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> on 334 and 394 proteins from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal human liver tissues, respectively. By comparing the N-sialoglycan <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> between the above two samples, we determined 76 N-sialoglycosites with more than a 2 -fold change. This method was demonstrated to be an effective and high-throughput method for the analysis of the N-sialoglycan <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

5|$|The South Tower was {{completed}} in September 2008, with all residential floors ready for residents. As of, April 2009, 70% of the South Tower's 376 luxury units and 14 townhouses had been sold. Because of the <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> and low profits so far, the developers had initially refused to pay $5.4 million in development fees that would be spent on rent subsidies, job training programs and community development in the South of Market area. However, the developers finally agreed to pay the city.|$|E

In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season.

5|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s, {{much of the}} area between Tyldesley and Astley has been built on for housing. Indicators show that the {{township}} has a strong housing market, with a high owner <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> of almost 80%. Parts of Astley are among the 5% least deprived areas in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, whilst parts of the Blackmoor area, where social housing is concentrated, are within the 10–20% most deprived neighbourhoods nationally.

The development of Astley Green Colliery Museum and the heritage centre at Damhouse attract visitors interested in the area's heritage.|$|E
5|$|Tourism to Costa Rica {{was down}} sharply {{during the first}} half of June 2013. Jorge Molina, {{president}} of The Southern Caribbean Tourism Chamber, said Mora's death was affecting reservations and would likely continue to do so for several months. Aurora Gámez, who owns an Manzanillo Beach hotel, said her <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> normally runs at 50% in June, but was at just 10% in the weeks after Mora's death. She said she had received cancellations that specifically cited Mora's death as a factor. Cahuita hotel owner Eddie Ryan echoed Gámez, saying he had two patrons cite Mora's death when cancelling. Restaurants, bars, tour guides, and transportation companies were also affected. Some entrepreneurs blamed WIDECAST for the lost business saying the organization was aware of the risks but continued to patrol anyway.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the hotel}} {{fell into a}} {{turbulent}} period. Terrorist threats from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75m. At {{the time of the}} sale, the hotel's <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> was just 45 percent; the Ritz Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times. In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only, as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.|$|E

5|$|The Forest Service {{and other}} {{scientists}} are currently studying the biological effects from the fire. There were 45 California spotted owl breeding sites within the Rim Fire perimeter on Forest Service land, and one year post-fire they had the highest-ever recorded <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> for California spotted owls. Spotted owl sites with 100% high-severity burn were occupied by pairs {{at the same rate}} as unburned sites. The Rim Fire contains many populations of rare California endemic flowers such as Clarkia australis and Clarkia biloba ssp. australis in places where plantation trees burned; these areas, however, are to be disturbed by planned thinning. Researchers estimate that the Rim Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found no significant difference in owl detection at burned versus unburned sites. A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, as is often the case with fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.|$|E

25|$|The {{onset of}} the 1980s oil glut had devastating {{economic}} consequences for Downtown. In the mid-1980s, a bank {{savings and loan crisis}} forced many tenants in Downtown Houston buildings to retrench, and some went out of business. This development further caused Downtown Houston to decline. In 1986, Downtown's Class A office <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> was 81.4%. The Downtown Houston business <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> of all office space increased from 75.8% at the end of 1987 to 77.2% at the end of 1988. By the late 1980s, 35% of Downtown Houston's land area consisted of surface parking. In the early 1990s Downtown Houston still had more than 20% vacant office space.

40|$|Gochenour/Light-syntax zones 2 This thesis {{proposes a}} novel method for {{understanding}} occupancy in public indoor spaces by creating hybrid light-syntax zones, based on both simulated illuminance data and simulated configuration data. Yearly illuminance profiles and spatial syntax {{characteristics such as}} physical connectivity and visual integration were examined to develop zones which theoretically have similar <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> to one another. To support the light-syntax zone concept, a case study was performed in a student cafe on a university campus. Occupancy and exterior light conditions were observed for thirteen days. <b>Occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> were mapped to each seat within the cafe and analyzed for correlations with the light-syntax zone data. A {{significant difference was found}} in the <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> between different exterior light conditions (direct light present, rapidly changing/intermediate, diffuse light present) in the test cafe. A slight negative correlation was found between <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> and integration and physical connectivity values, which seems to indicate that the cafe users are seeking out the most secluded spaces. However, higher illuminance values also show a correlation with higher occupancy ratios. Given the map of the space, it is possible that these two variables are confounded. Further studies ar...|$|R
25|$|One {{empirical}} study supports performance-based pricing {{by analyzing}} the block-level price elasticity of parking demand in the SFpark context. The study suggests that block-level elasticities vary so widely that urban planners and economists cannot accurately predict the response in parking demand to a given change in price. The public policy implication is that planners should utilize observed <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> in order to adjust prices so that target <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> are achieved.
