40|$|The {{topic of}} {{external}} costs of transport is widely {{studied in the}} scientific literature and policy makers are showing a growing awareness on this problem. One of the main tools used to control the social costs of transport and reduce welfare losses associated to externalities is that of internalisation via tariffs: road pricing, carbon taxes, dedicated taxes, etc. Actually, many taxes on transport already exist, but seldom have an explicit internalisation purpose. In this paper we compare current road transport perceived marginal costs in Italy with social ones. Starting from {{the literature on the}} topic, in the analytical part of the paper we present the case of Italy and quantify the current level of external costs and taxation. Then we compare unit taxes with marginal transport social costs, with particular respect to different driving contexts. Results show that gasoline passengers cars always perceive the external costs they generate more than any <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>category.</b> In urban contexts external costs are still not rightly perceived, with the exception of recent gasoline cars only and excluding congestion. Outside urban contexts, the perceived share is considerably higher. Estimates also suggest that a distortion exists with respect to the gap between highway tolls and infrastructure damage costs in Italy: trucks pay only a little more than marginal infrastructure costs they generate, so that only cars are actually paying for new investments...|$|E

40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} of new passenger cars (PCs) registered in Europe are monitored {{in order to}} meet the objectives of Regulation EC 443 / 2009. This calls for an average CO 2 emission of 130 g/km for new PCs registered in Europe to be met by vehicle measures in 2015. This decreases to 95 g/km in 2020. Similar regulations are gradually promoted for <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>categories</b> as well, more prominently for light commercial vehicles (LCVs). CO 2 {{emissions of}} new vehicle types are determined during the vehicle type-approval by testing over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Worries have been expressed that this driving cycle is not representative of real-world driving conditions. It is considered that fuel consumption, and hence CO 2 emissions (and air pollutant emissions), measured over this cycle under-represent reality. This report uses real-world information to compare in-use fuel consumption of PCs with type-approval CO 2. The main objective was to develop functions that may enable prediction of in-use fuel consumption values, based on vehicle specifications. The functions can then be used in inventorying tools, such as COPERT and HBEFA, to correctly allocate fuel consumption to the different PC vehicle types. JRC.

Research completed at the Department of Mechanical EngineeringThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has introduced a Driver Fatality Ratio (DFR), based on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and General Estimating System (GES) crash Involvement statistics, which has produced good estimates of the aggressive behavior of vehicles in crashes. The DFR proposed by NHTSA {{is based on the}} statistical data, which makes it difficult to evaluate DFR for <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>categories</b> (e. g., crossovers, etc.), which are relatively new in the market as they do not have sufficient crash statistics. This research work proposes a new methodology based on computational reconstruction of impact crashes and objective measures to predict the DFR for any vehicle. The objective measures considered include the ratios of maximum intrusion, peak acceleration, and weight for the two vehicles in head-on collisions. Factors which directly influence fatal injuries to the occupants are identified and studied to develop a relation between these objective measures to the DFR. The proposed method is then validated for a range of Light Trucks and Vans (LTVs) against a passenger car, and is then used to predict the DFR of cross <b>category</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Factors which influence these objective measures in predicting the DFR are discussed. Results from this study indicate that the ratio of intrusions produces a better estimate of the DFR and can be utilized in predicting fatality ratios for head-on collisions...|$|R

40|$|To date, 84 {{nations have}} signed the {{so-called}} Kyoto Protocol {{on the control}} of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In the Netherlands the Kyoto agreement has resulted in quantitative national targets for 2008 - 2012 of- 6 % GHG emission reduction compared to 1990; this is a reduction of 19 % compared to the emission forecasted for 2010. Two years ago the Dutch government launched a policy-making process for meeting the Kyoto target. In both the development and the evaluation of Dutch Kyoto-related policy, research has played a major role. For the transport sector no (a priori) targets were set; however, a list of measures and instruments to reduce transport GHG emissions were discussed in the Kyoto-related policy-making process. Nearly all transport instruments and measures on this list appeared to be car-related. The reason for this focus was an a priori choice of policymakers. However, cost-effective options for <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>categories</b> (road and non-road transport) may be available. The transport options finally chosen for the Policy document will reduce GHG emissions from transport by 3 - 5 % compared to the forecasted 2010 emissions. Researchers estimated that tax differentiation for new cars and in-car instruments such as fuel economy meters and cruise control {{will be the most}} effective instruments. The selected transport measures were not really chosen to induce a technology push; rather, the selection was mainly policy driven to meet short-term targets. Although research {{played a significant role in}} the policy-making process, several research improvements can still be made. Important improvements identified are: a) using a better and clearer method for the calculation of the costs of the measures and b) using a broader evaluation method of measures; this will mean including more environmental, economic and social indicators. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is divided}} into three interconnected parts. The first part presents a link travel time estimation algorithm that is based on the use of robust statistic able to exclude the impact of outliers. Outliers in travel time measurements are vehicles whose shortened or extended travel times are not caused by the traffic conditions, but are the result of individual behavior of such vehicle. As the adequate information on travel times is the one of personal cars, the influence of <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>categories</b> should be eliminated from the samples which is not feasible with the use of existing link travel time estimation algorithms. The second part of the dissertation presents a method to estimate the value of travel time based on speed extrapolations from point measurements. The method is able to determine whether a speed variation represents a random fluctuation due to individual driver’s behavior and should therefore be smoothed or is a consequence of a change in traffic conditions {{as a result of a}} shock wave and should therefore be kept as it is in order to provide prompt response of the algorithm. By extrapolating the speed, the value of travel time from point speed measurements is obtained. In the third part of the dissertation, a data fusion algorithm is presented, combining point and interval detector data to estimate highway travel times also taking into account qualititative measurements of traffic flow. The purpose of travel time data fusion from different sources is to overcome on one hand the spatial inaccuracy of indirect travel time estimation from point speed measurements and on the other hand to overcome the information delay of the direct travel time measurements. By combining both data sources, a short-term travel time prediction is achieved, as the input for the travel time information system...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. In {{the last}} decade, the {{increase}} in usage of light trucks and vans (LTVs) has resulted {{in an increase in}} fatal injuries to the occupants of passenger cars for truck-car accidents, because of the aggressive nature of LTVs. To study the aggressive behavior of LTVs, National Traffic Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) has developed an aggressivity metric (AM) for different vehicles in a specific impact configuration. These AM however does not produce consistent estimates when specific vehicle-to-vehicle impact categories are studied. Hence, NHTSA has introduced a Driver Fatality Ratio (DFR), based on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and General Estimating System (GES) crash Involvement statistics, which has produced good estimates of the aggressive behavior of vehicles in crashes. The DFR proposed by NHTSA is based on the statistical data, which makes it difficult to evaluate DFR for <b>other</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>categories</b> (e. g., crossovers, etc.), which are relatively new in the market as they do not have sufficient crash statistics. This research work proposes a new methodology based on computational reconstruction of impact crashes and objective measures to predict the DFR for any vehicle. The objective measures considered include the ratios of maximum intrusion, peak acceleration, and weight for the two vehicles in head-on collisions. Factors which directly influence fatal injuries to the occupants are identified and studied to develop a relation between these objective measures to the DFR. The proposed method is then validated for a range of LTVs against a passenger car, and is then used to predict the DFR for a cross <b>category</b> <b>vehicle,</b> a light pick-up truck, and a full-size car. Factors which influence these objective measures in predicting the DFR are discussed.
