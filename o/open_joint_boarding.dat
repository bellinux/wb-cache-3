50|$|Working with Legislative Council is a {{group of}} eight <b>Joint</b> <b>Boards</b> and Advisory Boards that provide {{oversight}} for several of CUSG's Cost Centers and operations. <b>Joint</b> <b>Boards</b> act as boards of directors, governing and supervising each Cost Center's management structure. The <b>Joint</b> <b>Boards</b> include the Recreation Board, the Health Board, the University Memorial Center (UMC) Board, the Air Board, the WRC Board, the Environmental Center Board, the Cultural Events Board (CEB) and the Finance Board. Finance Board is unique in that it does not oversee a single cost center, but manages student fees and creates the annual budget. Each <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> is led by a chair, elected internally by the board and subject to ratification by two-thirds of Legislative Council.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the formative {{years of the}} Joint Army and Navy Board, 1903 to 1919. It serves as an institutional history, focusing on {{the function of the}} interservice coordination body. The <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> is examined within the context of formulating American military strategy and U. S. diplomatic affairs from its creation in July 1903 to its reconstitution in 1919. At present no comprehensive historical study exists focusing on the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board.</b> Currently, interservice cooperation and coordination during this period receive no more than peripheral analysis in war plan studies. Thus, this work begins the first comprehensive history of the precursor to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This thesis analyzes the origins and creation of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board,</b> the Board??s basic duties and responsibilities, and <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> actions as they impacted U. S. diplomacy and military strategy concerning the homeland and coast defense, the Caribbean and Cuba, the Panama Canal, as well as the Pacific and the Philippines. Within this geographical framework, this thesis explores the relation of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> to the Navy General Board and Army General Staff, the cooperation of the U. S. Army and U. S. Navy between the Spanish-American War and World War I, the impact of <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> actions on American civil-military relations, and the efficacy of interservice cooperation. This thesis is based largely on unpublished as well as published primary sources, including the records of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board,</b> Navy General Board records, Army War College Division records, and members?? personal papers housed at the Library of Congress in Washington, D. C. In addition, secondary sources are used to place the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> within the larger contextual framework of interservice cooperation, U. S. civil-military relations, and American military history during the early twentieth century...|$|R

50|$|By 1925 governments {{had joined}} the roadbuilding movement, and began to assert control.

Increasing government support for roadbuilding was making the old road associations less important, but the LHA still had significant influence. The Secretary of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board,</b> BPR official E. W.

2500|$|Gold's {{success in}} leading the 1926 furrier workers' strike was short-lived. [...] On July 19, 1926, President Green {{sent a letter}} to Gold {{demanding}} that the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> turn over all books, papers, ledgers and materials related to the conduct of the strike. In a secret letter, Hugh Frayne assured IFWU President Shachtman that the International Union was not under investigation, and that the AFL intended only to purge the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> of [...] "radicals" [...] and [...] "communists." [...] Despite his reservations, Gold turned over the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board's</b> books, and the AFL conducted its investigation throughout August and September. The goal of the investigation soon became clear: The AFL accused Gold and the other strike leaders of debauchery, wasting union money, bribery, forcing workers to join the Communist Party, coercing workers to participate in the strike, prolonging the strike on the orders of the Communist Party, and lying to the AFL investigating committee. On January 13, 1927, the AFL's final report was issued, in which the AFL demanded that the IFWU purge the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> of all communists or expel the locals in question. On February 17, the New York City Central Labor Council expelled the <b>Joint</b> <b>Board</b> and its member locals; the IFWU expelled Gold and 36 other local leaders from the union on March 2.|$|R
