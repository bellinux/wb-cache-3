40|$|This paper {{explores the}} notion <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in {{relation}} to networked mobility and mobile phone use. Two key arguments are developed. The first is that the experience <b>of</b> <b>place</b> persists and remains an important consideration {{in relation to}} mobile phone use. The ‘domestication’ approach to understanding the development and uses of new technologies is considered useful in explaining this persistence. The second is that networked mobility actually forces a renegotiation <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> and leads to significantly altered understandings <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and place-making. This is theorised as a shift from a traditional understanding <b>of</b> <b>place</b> as stable and fixed (stabilitas loci), to a reconceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>place</b> as experienced in and understood through mobility (mobilitas loci). The paper concludes by sketching some of the potential, and possible implications, that this renewed understanding <b>of</b> <b>place</b> might have for future studies of networked mobility...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} meaning <b>of</b> <b>place</b> {{attachment}} and its connection to location and locale {{in the context}} of the urban neighbourhood. The concept <b>of</b> <b>place</b> is conceptualised in terms of the setting in which social relations are constituted, the effects upon locales of social and economic processes and the creation of a sense <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> defined as the local ‘structure of feeling’ (Williams 1977). Drawing on data gathered from residents in marginalised neighbourhoods across six European cities, the paper explicates the meaning <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in the everyday life <b>of</b> the community. <b>Place</b> is frequently construed through a repository of shared memories and traditions. A sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> rooted in the past is deployed as a resource to mobilise around the challenges of the present. Feelings <b>of</b> <b>place</b> attachment resonate as a significant marker of identity and community even as sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> is challenged by the developments in modern city places...|$|R
40|$|SEMANTIC STRUCTURE OF STANDARD LATVIAN ADVERBS <b>OF</b> <b>PLACE</b> Summary This is a {{description}} of the semantic structure of standard Latvian adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> It starts with a paradigmatic analysis (first, a reference is made to determinations of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> which are provided by Latviešu literārās valodas vārdnīca; then an orientation meaning is defined, followed by marking of the integral and differential features, and determination of semantic oppositions), later followed by a syntagmatic analysis. In analyzing the structure of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place</b> within the syntagmatic approach, it is necessary to consider a context and a situation. Analysis of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations underlie the classification of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> On the basis of this classification, differential features that are the least significant elements are being identified. 24 pairs of differential features can be used to describe the semantic structure of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> When the system of paradigmatic relations of all the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>place</b> is fully described, it is possible to characterize every single adverb <b>of</b> <b>place</b> as a particular combination of these features, and to set its place in this system. For instance, the adverb <b>of</b> <b>place</b> klāt can be characterized as [non-interrogative – non-cognitive – non-deictic – non-vertical – non-inside – side – non-concrete], etc. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{academic}} study <b>of</b> <b>place</b> {{has been}} generally defined by two distinct and highly refined discourses within outdoor recreation research: place attachment and sense <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> Place attachment generally describes the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>place</b> relationship, whereas sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> approaches place {{from a more}} holistic and intimate orientation. This study bridges these two methodological and theoretical separate areas <b>of</b> <b>place</b> research together by re-conceptualizing {{the way in which}} place relationships are viewed within outdoor recreation research. The Psychological Continuum Model is used to extend the language <b>of</b> <b>place</b> attachment to incorporate more of the philosophy <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> while attending to the empirical strength and utility <b>of</b> <b>place</b> attachment. This extension results in the term place allegiance being coined to depict the strong and profound relationships outdoor recreationists build with their <b>places</b> <b>of</b> outdoor recreation. Using a concurrent mixed methods research design, this study explored place allegiance via an online survey (n = 437) and thirteen in-depth qualitative interviews with outdoor recreationists. Results indicate that place allegiance can be measured through a multi-dimensional model <b>of</b> <b>place</b> allegiance that incorporates behaviours, importance, resistance, knowledge and symbolic value. In addition, place allegiance was found to be related to an individual's influence on life course and his/her willingness to exhibit preservation and protection tendencies. Place allegiance {{plays an important role in}} acknowledging the importance <b>of</b> authentic <b>place</b> relationships in an effort to confront placelessness.

In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number <b>of</b> <b>places</b> in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage <b>of</b> <b>places</b> in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need to increase the number <b>of</b> <b>places</b> there and {{to the fact that the}} Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The concept <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> has {{received}} considerable attention by social scientists in recent years. Research {{has indicated that}} a person’s sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> is influ-enced {{by a number of}} factors including the built environment, socio-economic status (SES), well-being and health. Relatively few studies have examined sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> at the neighbourhood level, particularly among communities exhibiting different levels of SES. This article investigates sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> among three neighbourhood groups in Hamilton, Ontario representing areas of low, mixed and high SES. It analyses data from a 16 -point sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> scale derived from the Hamilton Household Quality of Life Survey carried out in 2010 – 2011 among 1, 002 respondents. The paper found that sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> was highest among residents of the high SES neighbourhood group as well as among home owners, people residing in single-detached homes, retired residents and those living in their neighbourhood for more than 10 years. From a health perspective, the paper found that a strong association existed between sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and self-perceived mental health across the three neighbourhood groups. Furthermore, by way of regression modeling, the paper examined the factors influencing health-related sense <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> Among the sample of respondents, a strong connection was found between housing, particularly home owner-ship, and high levels of health-related sense <b>of</b> <b>place...</b>|$|R

Over the past 100 years, sound technology has advanced significantly from simple mono analogue electronic tape machines to sophisticated digital computer software and hardware. The opportunities afforded by sound technology has enabled artists to record, edit, and transmit the sounds <b>of</b> <b>place</b> {{in a variety of}} ways. Since the early 20 th Century artists have been experimenting with sound technology using different approaches to working with the sounds <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in their creative practice. The result is a number of different methodologies that can be applied when using the sound <b>of</b> <b>place</b> as a medium for art including sound walking, phonography, field recording, electroacoustic composition and sonification. Many artists apply these methodologies singularly or in combinations. This has resulted in the emergence of different genres to describe the use of the sound <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in art including Soundscapes, Sound Sculptures and Electroacoustic. The aim of this MFA thesis is to answer a fundamental question: How can the sound <b>of</b> <b>place</b> be used as a medium for art?
