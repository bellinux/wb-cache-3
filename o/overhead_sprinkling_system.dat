40|$|In the spring, apple {{orchards}} {{are susceptible}} to freeze damage. Various approaches to orchard protection {{have been used in}} the past. <b>Overhead</b> <b>sprinkling</b> for bloom delay has been effective in extending to a later period in the spring the freeze hardiness of apple buds. Thus, protection against a late spring freeze is obtained. Previous research has not been conducted to determine optimum sprinkling times in the spring, the most effective threshold temperature, the amount of water needed to provide adequate bud protection, and the daily length of sprinkling time. A 2 -year investigation was conducted with the objective of obtaining basic information to help in system design and the operational aspects of <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkling.</b> The experiment was designed to determine the effectiveness of a <b>system</b> <b>sprinkling</b> beginning at the end of rest and at Celsius growing degree hour accumulations relating to stages bud development. The evaluation of limited and unlimited water use and the relation to bloom delay was obtained. The two sprinkler types studied were umbrella and impact. On the umbrella sprinklers, four cycling times (1 / 2, 1 / 3, 1 / 4, and 1 / 6 time) and three threshold temperatures (7, 10, and 13 C) were tested. On the impact sprinkler, three nozzle sizes (4. 0, 3. 6, and 2. 8 mm) were evaluated. The investigation answered many questions, the most important of which were: (1) when only limited bloom delay is needed, more freeze protection can be obtained by sprinkling in the early spring than in the late spring; (2) bloom delay can be regulated by terminating sprinkling at different stages of bud development; (3) to obtain maximum delay, sprinkling should begin at the end of rest and a low threshold temperature for sprinkling should be used for sprinkler initiation; (4) when limited delay is required, greater efficiency of water use can be obtained by lowering the threshold temperature and lowering the application rate...|$|R

Alternative hypothesis was presumption, that the lying time of cows in lying cubicles with applied two different cooling systems are indifferent. The <b>sprinkling</b> <b>system</b> was used to animal cooling in group S in summer time. In group SV was disposable <b>sprinkling</b> <b>system</b> and diagonally rotated ventilators. Activities and the rest of animals were evaluated in 10 minute intervals using a camera system for 24 hours. Data obtained was tested by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and multiple comparison test for detecting of significant differences in the behaviors between groups of cows. There was found positive effect of animal enhanced cooling using <b>sprinkling</b> <b>system</b> with increased air movement by ventilators. It reflected in significant prolongation of whole lying time and shortening of time, when animals were standing. It resulted from final values of investigated behaviour manifestations of dairy cattle within 24 hour period that animals in group SV with sprinklers and ventilators lay in stalls longer than in group S with sprinklers, but without ventilators (10. 76 h*d- 1 *cow- 1 vs. 7. 71 h*d- 1 *cow- 1, P 0. 001).

40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{promoting}} grain mold development (overhead sprinkler irrigation on rain-free days, inoculation of panicles with mold-causing fungi, and bagging of panicles) for field screening of sorghum lines for resistance to grain molds were evaluated for two seasons (1982 and 1983) using genotypes susceptible and resistant to grain mold. Threshed grain mold ratings (TGMRs) of these genotypes in <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkled</b> plots {{were not significantly}} different from ratings in unsprinkled plots when rainfall was abundant and frequent from flowering through grain maturity to harvest. In a season of low and infrequent rainfall, however, TGMRs were higher in sprinkled plots. Grain germination was significantly lower in sprinkled than in unsprinkled plots in the season of frequent rainfall. There {{were no significant differences in}} TGMRs between inoculated and/or bagged treatments and noninoculated and nonbagged treatment for susceptible genotypes in years of either frequent or infrequent rainfall. Inoculation and bagging increased moldiness in resistant genotypes but not to the threshold level of susceptibility. Screening nursery results (1983 ‚Äì 1985) showed that mold resistance screening without inoculation and bagging of panicles appears feasible if overhead sprinkler irrigation is used from flowering to harvest...|$|R

30|$|In Sweden, {{the most}} common method used to protect wood from {{deterioration}} due to drying and biological degradation during storage is sprinkling logs with water to keep the essential moisture at sufficiently high levels. A central drawback of this method, however, is the runoff resulting from sprinkling the logs; to ensure wood protection, the safety margins used when sprinkling often result in large runoff volumes. Recycling the sprinkling/runoff water {{can be used to}} reduce the amount of runoff. According to the latest figures, for example, 39 % of the larger Swedish sawmills recycled runoff in 2001 [1]. One further possibility for reducing runoff is climate adaptation of the <b>sprinkling</b> <b>system</b> [2]. The amount of runoff can be considerably reduced with this method, although not completely eliminated. In spite of these methods, the runoff volume is still considerable in many locations.|$|R

40|$|Indoor air {{contaminants}} such as {{dust and}} gases {{are present in}} concentrations that may be hazardous to worker health in poultry production. Poultry dust may contain inflammatory agents (e. g., endotoxin) and inhalation exposure {{has been associated with}} pulmonary symptoms. The current control practice to reduce worker exposure to poultry dust is the use of respiratory protection (e. g., filtering face-piece respirators). Limited research has been conducted to evaluate engineering controls to reduce dust concentrations in broiler chicken production. Therefore, the purpose of this research was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a water <b>sprinkling</b> <b>system</b> to reduce inhalable dust and ammonia concentrations in a broiler chicken house. Inhalable dust and ammonia concentrations were measured daily for the production cycle of a flock of broiler chickens (63 days). Inhalable dust was measured gravimetrically using an inhalable sampler and ammonia was measured by a direct reading sensor. Sampling was performed on a stationary mannequin inside two broiler chicken houses. One house used a sprinkler cooling system to deliver a water mist throughout the house and the second house was an untreated control. The sprinkler system activated 5 days after chicken placement and continued through day 63 of the broiler chicken production cycle. The following sprinkler activation program was used each hour from 6 am to 10 pm: days 5 ‚Äì 9 five seconds, days 10 ‚Äì 14 ten seconds, and days 15 - 63 for fifteen seconds. Geometric mean (GM) inhalable dust concentrations collected in the treatment house (5. 2 mg/m 3) were lower than those found in the control house (6. 0 mg/m 3). The GM ammonia concentration within the treatment house was higher at 10. 6 ppm (GSD: 1. 80), compared to the control house (GM 9. 51 ppm; GSD: 1. 77).

40|$|Reducing {{the price}} of solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems {{has been a constant}} challenge. Despite recent advances, solar PV systems are still more costly than conventional energy resources. For the first time, this study examines the effectiveness of three different structures/materials: (i) silvered glass plane mirror; (ii) convex spherical mirrors; and (iii) aluminum (Al) foil as reflector. Comparative analysis of four different cooling techniques, i. e., water <b>sprinkling</b> <b>system,</b> passive heat sink method, active air fan method, and closed loop method, for enhancement of output power was performed. A novel Bi reflector solar PV system (BRPVS) was suggested to control the working of the reflectors. The Al foil enhanced the power output compared to the others. In addition, the effect of using a reflector on the temperature of a solar PV system was studied.
