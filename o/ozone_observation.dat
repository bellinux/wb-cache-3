40|$|A multi-resolution basis {{can provide}} a useful {{representation}} of nonstationary two-dimensional spatial processes that are typically encountered in the geosciences. The main advantages are its flexibility for representing departures from stationarity and importantly the scalability of algorithms to large numbers of spatial locations. The key ingredients of our approach are the availability of fast transforms for wavelet bases on regular grids and enforced sparsity in the covariance matrix among wavelet basis coefficients. In support of this approach we outline a theoretical proposition for decay properties of the multi-resolution covariance for mixtures of Matérn covariances. A covariance estimator, built upon a regularized method of moment, is straightforward to compute for complete data on regular grids. For irregular spatial data the estimator is implemented by using a conditional simulation algorithm drawn from a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization approach, to translate the problem to a regular grid {{in order to take}} advantage of efficient wavelet transforms. This method is illustrated with a Monte Carlo experiment and applied to surface ozone data from an environmental monitoring network.

40|$|Meteorological {{observations}} at Syowa Base in 5 th expedition {{were maintained}} {{in the year}} 1960 - 1962. Among scientific disciplines importance {{was attached to the}} meteorological section consisting of 4 members, to take various types of observation. General and characteristic features in meteorological observations are summarized in the following. A. Surface observation: 3 -hourly observations were made throughout the wintering period, 4 observations were transmitted to Mother Station (Mawson), twice daily. In addition to the specified observations, radiation, sunshine and ground temperature were also observed by continuous selfrecording instrument respectively. The special features of this year is that, compared with the appearance of the annual minimum temperature normally in September in the Antarctic, the minimum occurred in July and it is shown that the average temperature in September was 5. 5 ℃ higher than the normal value. B. Upper air observation: One time (12 Z) daily rawinsonde observations were made throughout the year except a few cases of only radiosonde observation. Twice daily (00 and 12 Z) rawinsonde observations were made during World Meteorological Interval of Post-IGY (July 16 -July 25). All observations were transmitted to Mother Station every day. Equipments used : D- 55 A type Automatic Direction Finder (Similar type with GMD- 1 A) JMA-RSII Rawinsonde, 1680 Mc JMA-SIII Radiosonde, 27 Mc 800 g Balloon (Latex) CaH_ 2 Cans for Hydrogen gas to fill balloons. Monthly average temperatures and heights were shown in respective figures. In September, combined with the surface temperature, the strong warm-air inflow throughout the troposphere below 300 mb could be seen. A rapid warming in the stratosphere in spring was also clearly observed. Wind rose at some selected pressure levels were shown in Figs. 7 - 10. In general, the wind is strong in winter, especially in the stratosphere and NE-ly and SW-ly winds are predominant in the troposphere, SW-ly or W-ly in the stratosphere. The E-ly winds were also observed above 30 mb in summer. C. Ozone observation: i) Total <b>ozone</b> <b>observation</b> Dobson ozone spectrophotometer was used for this observation. Table 3 shows the results of only direct sunlight observation with reliable AD wave length setting. Comparison is made in Figs. 11 and 12 between Syowa Base, Little America and Halley Bay. Total ozone amount can be said to increase in spring from November to December over the Antarctic and the maximum seems to appear in summer. The 10 -days average values of Syowa Base and Halley Bay show to be in good similarity in spite of different year. It may also be noted that a good correlation exists between rapid increase of ozone amount and temperature of 50 mb in late November. ii) Surface <b>ozone</b> <b>observation</b> The density of surface ozone was measured on days without drifting snow from the end of February 1961. Based on Ehmert method, the equipment developed by Mr. KAWAMURA, Meteorological Research Institute, was used. It may be seen that the density increase in autumn and reaches its maximum value about 40 μg/m^ 3 in early June in polar night season, then decreases rapidly until the sun comes back and indicates minimum in early summer. It should be noted that there is 6 months 2 ̆ 7 phase difference between the surface ozone amount and the total ozone amount. D. Special observation: Snow accumulation Toward ENE-ly direction from the base, 6 snow stakes were erected and snow accumulation was observed several times every month. The result is shown in Table 4 in which the annual accumulation was 121 cm. Average density of snow was 0. 474 and the equivalent amount of water was 574 m/m...|$|E

40|$|Extraction of {{wind and}} {{temperature}} information from stratospheric ozone assimilation is examined {{within the context of}} the Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM) hybrid 4 D-Var data assimilation (DA) system. Ozone can improve the winds and temperatures through the two different DA mechanisms. First, through the flow-of-the-day ensemble background error covariances that are blended together with the static background error covariance. Second, via the ozone continuity equation in the tangent linear model and adjoint used for minimizing the cost function. All experiments assimilate actual conventional data and satellite-derived wind vectors in order to maintain nearly the same realistic troposphere. In the stratosphere, the experiments assimilate simulated ozone and/or radiance observations in various combinations. The simulated observations are taken from a 16 -day truth experiment (TE), which is an analysis with no stratospheric observations. The impact of ozone on the analysis is evaluated by comparing the experiments to the TE. Ozone assimilation is found to benefit the winds and temperatures when data are of sufficient quality and frequency. For example, global hourly ozone data with no error constrains the stratospheric winds and temperature to within ~ 2  m s − 1 and ~ 1  K, respectively. This demonstrates that there is dynamical information in the ozone distribution that can potentially be used to improve the stratosphere. This is particularly important for the tropics, where radiance observations have difficulty constraining winds due to their broad weighting functions and breakdown of geostrophic balance. Global ozone assimilation provides the largest benefit when the hybrid blending coefficient is an intermediate value (0. 5 was used in this study), rather than 0. 0 (no ensemble background error covariances) or 1. 0 (no static background error covariances), which is consistent with other hybrid DA studies. Reduction of the ozone sampling frequency, addition of observational noise, or inclusion of radiance observations all reduce the benefit of ozone. For example, a single polar-orbiting ozone measurement set with realistic errors has no significant impact on the wind analysis when a full suite of radiance observations is also assimilated. An examination of cross-correlations between ozone and other variables shows that a single <b>ozone</b> <b>observation</b> behaves like a potential vorticity (PV) charge, or a monopole of PV, with rotation about a vertical axis and vertically oriented temperature dipole. Further understanding of this relationship may help in designing observation systems that would optimize the impact of ozone on the dynamics...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the surface ozone {{forecast}} over Beijing and surrounding regions, data assimilation method integrated into a high-resolution regional air quality model and a regional air quality monitoring network are employed. Several advanced data assimilation strategies based on ensemble Kalman filter are designed to adjust O 3 initial conditions, NO x initial conditions and emissions, VOCs initial conditions and emissions separately or jointly through assimilating <b>ozone</b> <b>observations.</b> As a result, adjusting precursor initial conditions demonstrates potential improvement of the 1 -h ozone forecast almost as great as shown by adjusting precursor emissions. Nevertheless, either adjusting precursor initial conditions or emissions show deficiency in improving the short-term ozone forecast at suburban areas.

A simultaneous adjustment of the above five variables {{is found to be}} able to reduce these limitations and display an overall better performance in improving both the 1 -h and 24 -h ozone forecast over these areas. The root mean square errors of 1 -h ozone forecast at urban sites and suburban sites decrease by 51 % and 58 % respectively compared with those in free run.

The method was calibrated with simultaneously measurements {{carried out by}} Brewer spectrophotometer (for UV and ozone) and pyranometer (global radiation) {{as part of the}} AZONET (AZores Observation NETwork) Setup in the José Agostinho Observatory. Results show a good adjustment (r = 0. 97) {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 5 for the UV Index estimation, small enough to be used for public information in a real-time basis...|$|R
40|$|Data {{assimilation}} has {{became an}} useful tool to reanalyse atmospheric fields. The assimilation produces 4 -dimensional, quality controlled fields that can offer many advantages, compared to sparse observations, in exploring physical phenomena. During the recent Framework 5 Assimilation of Envisat Data (ASSET) project, an intercomparison {{was made of}} ozone analyses from several assimilation systems. These analyses were produced for the same period- July to November 2003 - {{and the majority of}} them assimilated stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>observations</b> from only one source...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of the stratospheric ozone analyses delivered in near real time by the MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate) project during the 3 year period between September 2009 and September 2012. Ozone analyses produced by four different chemistry transport models and data assimilation techniques are examined: the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) coupled to MOZART- 3 (IFS-MOZART), the BIRA-IASB Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE), the DLR/RIU Synoptic Analysis of Chemical Constituents by Advanced Data Assimilation (SACADA), and the KNMI Data Assimilation Model based on Transport Model version 3 (TM 3 DAM). The assimilated satellite ozone retrievals differed for each system: SACADA and TM 3 DAM assimilated only total <b>ozone</b> <b>observations,</b> BASCOE assimilated profiles for ozone and some related species, while IFS-MOZART assimilated both types of <b>ozone</b> <b>observations.</b> This study shows that ozone analyses with realistic total ozone column densities do not necessarily yield good agreement with the observed ozone profiles. It also shows the large benefit obtained from the assimilation of a single limb-scanning instrument (Aura MLS) with a high density of observations. Hence even state-of-the-art models of stratospheric chemistry still require the assimilation of limb observations for a correct representation of the vertical distribution of ozone in the stratosphere...|$|R
