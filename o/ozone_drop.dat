The medium scales generally show correlations greater than 0. 6 throughout the middle latitudes of both hemispheres with some regions exceeding 0. 8. The areas of highest correlations seem {{to be associated with the}} storm track regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. A detailed spectral analysis is performed for the medium scales on five pairs of time series of area averaged tropopause pressure and total ozone. In middle latitudes, total ozone and tropopause pressure exhibit generally similar distributions in the power spectrum. In the subtropics and tropics the power in <b>ozone</b> <b>drops</b> off more rapidly with increasing frequency than the power in tropopause pressure. Only in the Northern Hemisphere middle latitudes does one find a clear association between increased power in ozone and tropopause pressure and maxima in the coherency spectrum.

40|$|Balloon-borne {{observations}} of ozone from Antarctic stations {{have been reported}} to reach ozone mixing ratios as low as about 10 ppbv at the 70 hPa level by late September. After reaching a minimum, ozone mixing ratios then increase to the ppmv level by late December. While the basic mechanisms causing the ozone hole have been known for more than 20 yr, the detailed chemical processes controlling how low the local concentration can fall, and how it recovers from the minimum have not been explored so far. Both of these aspects are investigated here by analysing results from the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). We discuss the processes responsible for stopping of the catalytic ozone depletion. We show that an irreversible chlorine deactivation into HCl can occur either when <b>ozone</b> <b>drops</b> to very low values or by temperatures increasing above the PSC threshold in these simulations. As a consequence, the timing and mixing ratio of the minimum depends sensitively on model parameters including the ozone initialisation. The subsequent observed ozone increase between October and December is linked not only to transport, but also to photochemical ozone production, caused by oxygen photolysis and by the oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Submitted study {{deals with}} {{assessment}} of enhanced daily values of UV-B radiation (280 - 320 nm) in July 2005 in the Czech Republic {{as a consequence}} of low amount of stratospheric ozone in this period. The 30 th July of 2005 was chosen as a representative day for case study, because the amount of total <b>ozone</b> <b>dropped</b> 12. 5 % below the long-term mean at Hradec Králové observatory. The statistical model for estimating daily values of UV-B radiation (developed at Institute of Agrosystems and Bioclimatology at Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno) was used for 88 stations from the Czech Republic. This model requires (as an input data) values of daily sum of Global radiation (RG), daily sum of extraterrestrial radiation (RA), amount of total ozone and altitude. Firstly, daily sums of UV-B for each station based on measured total ozone content were derived. Subsequently these values were compared with results of model which corresponds to average amount of total ozone content. The UV-B increment during 30 th July 2005 (as effect of stratospheric ozone decrease) reached 323. 6 J·m- 2 ·day- 1 at the average in the Czech Republic. For detailed assessing of UV-B increase the spatial analysis with using of Geographical Information System (ArcInfo GIS software) was conducted...|$|R

During September 2002, the ozone hole over the Antarctic was much smaller than in the previous six years. It has split into two separate holes, due to the appearance of sudden stratospheric warming that has never been observed before in the southern hemisphere. The analysis of this unprecedented event is attempted, regarding both the meteorological and photochemical aspects, in terms of the unusual thermal field patterns and the induced polar vortex disturbances.

In addition, HALOE observations of two long-lived species, HF and CH 4, are used as tracers to distinguish between change due to transport processes and change due to chemistry. The first study investigates the response of NO(x), (NO and NO 2) and ozone {{to the presence of}} large amounts of sulfate aerosol in the stratosphere following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. As the Pinatubo aerosol cleared the atmosphere at 17 mb (about 27 - 28 km), the partitioning of total reactive nitrogen shifted more toward NO(x), and ozone amounts declined. This trend is opposite that observed at lower altitudes. The second study examines the chemical aftermath of severe ozone depletion over Antarctica in spring. When <b>ozone</b> levels <b>drop</b> to a threshold amount (about 1 ppm near 20 km), the partitioning of the total chlorine family shifts rapidly from reactive species to the reservoir molecule HCl.

40|$|Ozone is the air {{pollutant}} {{about which we}} have probably heard the most. Two types of ozone exist: stratospheric and tropospheric. Stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the damaging ultra-violet sunlight and tropospheric ozone comes into direct contact with life-forms and is toxic at high levels. Ozone concentration in California has been studied for over five decades, {{and there is a}} long history of control efforts. During 2010, California Air Resources Board (CARB) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducted a major climate and air quality study in California called CalNex 2010 (California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change). Two goals of this study are to determine the natural ozone concentrations for various sites and whether they vary between central valley and coastal locations. The results show very different ozone behavior between the San Joaquin Valley (central valley) and South Coast (coastal) regions.

One experiment included collecting air samples at various cities and locations around the globe to determine CCl3F North-South mixing. By measuring the concentrations at different latitudes, Rowland {{was able to see}} that CCl3F was mixing between hemispheres quite rapidly. The same measurement was repeated 8 years later and the results showed a steady increase in CCl3F concentrations. Rowland's work also showed how the density of the ozone layer varied by season increasing in November and decreasing until April where it levels out for the summer only to increase in November. Data gained throughout successive years showed that although the pattern was consistent, the overall <b>ozone</b> levels were <b>dropping.</b> Rowland and his colleagues interacted both with the public and the political side and suggested various solutions, which allowd to step wise reduce the CFC impact. CFC emissions were regulated first within Canada, the United States, Sweden and Norway. In the 1980s, the Vienna Agreement and the Montreal Protocol allowed for global regulation.|$|R
40|$|Uncertainties of the {{photolysis}} {{cross sections}} of ClOOCl {{have long been}} a limiting factor in our theoretical understanding of the rate of polar stratospheric ozone losses. Previous work suggested that values slightly larger than current recommendations, {{which are based on}} laboratory measurements, result in improved agreement be- tween model calculations of polar stratospheric ozone loss rates and observations {{while at the same time}} also leading to improved agreement between observations of the diurnal variation of ClO and model calculations of this species. But new laboratory work (Pope et al, 2007) on the cross sections of ClOOCl suggest that its photolysis under polar stratospheric winter/spring conditions is nearly an order of magnitude slower than what would be required to explain the observations of ozone loss and ClO in the atmosphere and a factor of six slower than a value based on the current recommendations. We show what the impact of these new results on our understand- ing of polar ozone chemistry is. In model calculations that are based on the new cross sections and for typical Arctic conditions ratios of ClO/ClOx decrease by about a factor of two. The ozone loss rate by the ClO-dimer cycle, so far believed to be the most efficient <b>ozone</b> loss cycle, <b>drops</b> by about a factor of four and the loss rate by the coupled ClO-BrO cycle by nearly a factor of two. Overall ozone loss rates calculated based on the known <b>ozone</b> loss mechanisms <b>drop</b> by a factor of two to three and become much smaller than ob- servations. Also the calculated levels of ClO become much smaller than those ob- served in the stratosphere. These results demonstrate the tremendous uncertainty of current ozone loss calculations that comes from the broad range of the published cross sections for ClOOCl. In particular they suggest that, if the most recent publica- tion of the cross sections (Pope et al., 2007) is correct, a major fraction of observed polar ozone loss is due to a currently unknown mechanism - clearly are a major chal- lenge of our fundamental understanding of the polar stratospheric ozone loss proc- ess.

40|$|Recently, frost flowers {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} scientific interest due to their specific properties. They constitute highly delicate structures, which grow on newly formed sea ice in both polar regions under certain meteorological conditions like a stable atmospheric boundary layer and low air temperatures. Frost flowers exhibit high specific surface areas and also contain high concentrations of sea salt components like chloride and bromide. Therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that they contribute to the release of reactive halogen compounds to the atmosphere, which in turn can cause the well-known tropospheric ozone depletion events. During such events surface <b>ozone</b> concentrations <b>drop</b> from regular values of 30 to 40 ppbV to values below 1 ppbV. Remote sensing data indicate a significant spatial correlation between the occurrence of frost flowers and high levels of tropospheric BrO concentrations, which is a reactive intermediate during the chemical destruction of ozone in the presence of reactive bromine. Furthermore, frost flowers are potentially important sources of sea salt aerosol in the coastal regions of Antarctica. Due to fractionation processes during the formation, frost flowers contain only depleted amounts of certain compounds compared to the major sea salt components. These specific chemical signatures have been used to identify aerosols generated from frost flowers. In contrast to the mounting evidence of the impact of frost flowers on tropospheric chemistry and aerosols in the polar regions, direct observations of the processes involving frost flowers are currently non-existent. Here, we report results of laboratory experiments with frost flowers. We established a laboratory set-up for the investigation of the growth of frost flowers. In addition, we analyzed physical and chemical properties of the laboratory-grown frost flowers as a function of the sea salt concentration of the water used for the formation of the new sea ice...|$|R

The present study investigated the basic chemical mechanism of RBS at the Dead Sea using a numerical one-dimensional chemical model. Simulations were based on data obtained from comprehensive measurements performed at sites along the Dead Sea. The simulations showed that the high BrO levels measured frequently at the Dead Sea could only partially {{be attributed to the}} highly concentrated Br? present in the Dead Sea water. Furthermore, the RBS activity at the Dead Sea cannot solely be explained by a pure gas phase mechanism. This paper presents a chemical mechanism which can account for the observed chemical activity at the Dead Sea, with the addition of only two heterogeneous processes: the "Bromine Explosion" mechanism and the heterogeneous decomposition of BrONO 2. <b>Ozone</b> frequently <b>dropped</b> below a threshold value of ~ 1 to 2 ppbv at the Dead Sea evaporation ponds, and in such cases, O 3 became a limiting factor for the production of BrO x (BrO+Br).

The present study has shown that the heterogeneous decomposition of BrONO 2 has a great potential to affect the RBS activity in areas influenced by anthropogenic emissions, mainly due to the positive correlation between the rate of this process and the levels of NO 2.

40|$|UnrestrictedRecent {{focus of}} studies on health effects of ambient {{particulate}} matter (PM) have suggested particle chemical composition in addition to particle size, shape and number concentration responsible for the observed health outcomes. However, chemical composition and size distribution of the atmospheric particles can be strongly affected by the differences in ambient temperature, relative humidity, photochemical activity and source contributions. This thesis is intended to demonstrate the importance of characterizing predominant PM sources from an exposure perspective and develop methods of assessing their impact on air quality in Southern California. A study of particle number concentration and size distribution showed seasonal and spatial variability in Southern California. While contribution of local vehicular emissions was most evident in winter, effects of long-range transport of particles and photochemical particle formation were enhanced during warmer periods. Ship emissions {{are found to be}} dominant source of lower accumulation and ultrafine particles near ports. During the wildfires in October 2003 in Southern California, PM 10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 10 mm and less) levels were found highly elevated, while <b>ozone</b> concentrations <b>dropped</b> during the fire episode and these fire-borne particles were found to effectively penetrate indoors. To characterize the emission profiles from on-road diesel and gasoline vehicle-fleets, size-segregated PM samples were collected inside the Caldecott tunnel in Orinda, CA and analyzed for vehicular organic tracers such as hopanes and steranes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In a separate study, detailed information on the chemical characteristics of organic PM originating from a pure gasoline and a diesel dominated mixed-traffic freeway is obtained.; While hopanes and steranes, and high molecular weight PAHs levels are found comparable near these freeways, elemental carbon and lighter molecular weight PAHs are found much elevated near diesel dominated mixed-fleet freeway. Remarkably good agreement is observed between the roadside measurements and the emission factors calculated from the tunnel measurements especially for hopanes and steranes. Our results indicate that the fleet composition as well as atmospheric dilution has strong impact on the ambient concentrations of these organic tracers...|$|R

Ozone-particle cake reactions serve as a sink for ozone {{and a source of}} secondary carbonyls. The location of filters in air distribution systems can lead to byproducts being distributed throughout a building. Two experiments were performed to determine the ozone removal efficiency on two residential filters that were loaded with particles for one month (# 1) and three months (# 2). On both filters, the <b>ozone</b> removal efficiency <b>dropped</b> rapidly during the first 30 minutes and then stayed approximately constant for 4 hours.

The potential for HVAC filters to affect ozone concentrations in residential buildings was evaluated using a well-mixed reactor model. The tested filters reduced indoor ozone levels slightly when compared to indoor surfaces and an entire HVAC system, although the impact was much smaller than that of the air exchange rate. The influence of continuous particle deposition was not considered here, but would likely increase the impact of ozone interactions on HVAC filters...|$|R
40|$|Future {{trends in}} Arctic springtime total column ozone, and its {{chemical}} and dynamical drivers, are assessed using a 7 member ensemble from the Met Office Unified Model with United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols (UM-UKCA) simulating the period 1960 - 2100. The Arctic mean March total column ozone increases throughout the 21 st century {{at a rate}} of ~ 11. 5 DU decade- 1, and is projected to return to the 1980 level in the late 2030 s. However, the integrations show that even past 2060 springtime Arctic <b>ozone</b> can episodically <b>drop</b> by ~ 50 - 100 DU below the corresponding long-term ensemble mean for that period, reaching values characteristic of the near present day average level. Consistent with the global decline in inorganic chlorine (Cly) over the century, the estimated mean halogen induced chemical ozone loss in the Arctic lower atmosphere in spring decreases by around a factor of two between 1981 - 2000 and 2061 - 2080. However, {{in the presence of a}} cold and strong polar vortex elevated halogen induced ozone losses well above the corresponding long-term mean continue to occur in the simulations into the second part of the century. The ensemble shows a significant cooling trend in the Arctic winter mid- and upper stratosphere, but there is less confidence in the projected temperature trends in the lower stratosphere (100 - 50 hPa). This is partly due to an increase in downwelling over the Arctic polar cap in winter, which increases transport of ozone into the polar region as well as drives adiabatic warming that partly offsets the radiatively-driven stratospheric cooling. However, individual winters characterised by significantly suppressed downwelling, reduced transport and anomalously low temperatures continue to occur in the future. We conclude that despite the projected long-term recovery of Arctic ozone, the large interannual dynamical variability is expected to continue in the future, thereby facilitating episodic reductions in springtime ozone columns. Whilst our results suggest that the relative role of dynamical processes for determining Arctic springtime ozone will increase in the future, halogen chemistry will remain a smaller but non-negligible contributor for many decades to come...|$|R
40|$|The {{troposphere}} {{above the}} West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) was sampled for hydroperoxides at 21 locations during 2 -month-long summer traverses from 2000 to 2002, {{as part of}} the U. S. International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US ITASE). First-time quantitative measurements using a high-performance liquid chromatography method showed that methylhydroperoxide (MHP) is the only important organic hydroperoxide occurring in the Antarctic troposphere and that it is found at levels 10 times those previously predicted by photochemical models. During three field seasons, {{means and standard deviations for}} hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) were 321 ± 158 pptv, 650 ± 176 pptv, and 330 ± 147 pptv. While MHP was detected but not quantified in December 2000, levels in summer 2001 and 2002 were 317 ± 128 pptv and 304 ± 172 pptv. Results from firn air experiments and diurnal variability of the two species showed that atmospheric H 2 O 2 is significantly impacted by a physical snow pack source between 76 ° and 90 °S, whereas MHP is not. We show strong evidence of a negative correlation between stratospheric ozone and H 2 O 2 at the surface. Between 27 November and 12 December in 2001, when <b>ozone</b> column densities <b>dropped</b> below 220 Dobson units (DU) (means in 2000 and 2001 were 318 DU and 334 DU, respectively), H 2 O 2 was 1. 7 times that observed in the same period in 2000 and 2002, while MHP was only 80 % of the levels encountered in 2002. Photochemical box model runs match MHP observations only when the production rate from CH 3 O 2 + HO 2 was increased to the upper limit of its estimated range of uncertainty. Model results suggest that NO and OH levels on WAIS are closer to coastal values, while Antarctic Plateau levels are higher, confirming that region to be a highly oxidizing environment. The modeled sensitivity of H 2 O 2 and particularly MHP to NO offers the potential to use atmospheric hydroperoxides to constrain the NO background and thus estimate the past oxidation capacity of the remote atmosphere using ice cores.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the health and}} environmental impacts of the TSAP- 2012 baseline emission scenarios that have been presented in the TSAP Report # 1 to the Stakeholder Expert Group in June 2012. The baseline suggests for the next decades a steady decline of energy-related emissions from industry, households and transport while no significant changes are foreseen for NH 3 from agricultural activities. These emission trajectories will lead to significant improvements in air quality. For instance, loss of statistical life expectancy from exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) is expected to decline from 9. 6 months in 2000 and 6. 9 months in 2010 to 5. 5 months in 2020 and 5. 0 months in 2030. It is estimated {{that the number of}} premature deaths attributable to short-term exposure of ground-level <b>ozone</b> will <b>drop</b> by about 30 % by 2020. Ecosystems area where biodiversity is threatened by excess nitrogen deposition will shrink from 1. 2 million km 2 in 2000 to 900, 000 km 2 in 2030, and acidification will remain an issue at only four percent of the European forest area. However, by 2020 the baseline improvements for fine particular matter health impacts and eutrophication will fall short of the targets established in the 2005 Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution, while for acidification and ozone these targets will be met. Furthermore, {{it is unlikely that the}} baseline development will achieve full compliance with the air quality limit values for PM 10 and NO 2 throughout Europe. Equally, the baseline scenario will not provide protection against excess nitrogen deposition at almost 50 % of the legally protected Natura 2000 areas and other protected zones. In addition, the magnitude of air pollution impacts and resulting damage remains substantial. It is estimated that for the baseline in 2030, the European population would still suffer a loss of 210 million life-years and experience 18, 000 premature deaths because of ozone exposure. Biodiversity will remain threatened by excess nitrogen input at 900, 000 km 2 of ecosystems, including 250, 000 km 2 which are legally protected, inter alia as Natura 2000 areas. The analysis also highlights the scope for additional measures that could alleviate the remaining damage and move closer to the objectives of the Sixth Environment Action Program. Full application of readily available technical emission reduction measures in the EU could reduce health impacts from PM by 2020 by another 30 % and thereby gain more than 55 million life-years in the EU. It could save another 3, 000 premature deaths per year because of lower ozone concentrations. Further controls of agricultural emissions could protect biodiversity at another 200, 000 km 2 of ecosystems against excess nitrogen deposition, including 50, 000 km 2 of Natura 2000 areas and other protected zones. It could eliminate almost all likely exceedances of PM 10 air quality limit values in the old Member States, while in the urban areas of new Member States additional action to substitute solid fuels in the household sector with cleaner forms of energy would be required. Such Europe-wide emission controls would also eliminate in 2030 all likely cases of noncompliance with EU air quality standards for NO 2 with the exception of a few stations for which additional local measures (e. g., traffic restrictions, low emission zones) would be necessary. While the general trend appears to be robust, quantification of the remaining effects requires more uncertainty analyses...|$|R
