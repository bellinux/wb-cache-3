40|$|Due to the {{particular}} geographical location and geological condition, Taiwan is constantly attacked by typhoons, flood, landslides, debris flows, and earthquakes. Those natural hazards had caused huge loss of lives and properties. To reduce the damages and losses caused by the natural hazards, an integrated and complete decision support system for decision makers is necessary. In this study, Safe Taiwan information system (SATIS), which includes two subsystems, response <b>operation</b> <b>subsystem</b> for staff members and decision support subsystem for commanders, is developed for preparedness and response of typhoon hazards. It {{is based on the}} Web- GIS framework that the disaster information can be distributed via internet technology. When typhoon is approaching, response <b>operation</b> <b>subsystem</b> is used by National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) staffs to integrate real-time monitoring information, hazard models and graphical user interfaces to analyze and manage the disaster information such as the current position and possible path of typhoon, the spatial distribution of rainfalls, and potential areas of flooding, landslides and debris flows. The input data of this subsystem includes the basic maps, the real-time information of typhoon and rainfall issued by the Central Weather Bureau, the real-time water information from the Water Resources Agency, and the hazard maps indicating areas of potential landslide, debris flow and flooding made by NCDR herself to estimate endangered areas under the current typhoon. There are four main modules integrated into the subsystem including the rainfall monitoring and forecasting, the estimation of potential inundation areas, the estimation of potential landslide and debris flows, and the management of disaster information. The results of hazard risk analysis which include potential rainfall distribution, inundation and landslide risk areas, early warning messages, and total suggestion over the next 24 hours are finally demonstrated by decision support subsystem in the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) and help the commander to make the right decisions in disaster preparedness and response phases. In the future, SATIS will integrate social and economic information into the assessment of natural hazard vulnerability. It can help the commander to know the high-risk areas and make the right decision...|$|E

An efficient and flexible method is required for making decisions on which product or product group to manufacture and what processing system {{is to be applied}} for that purpose. ^ A multilevel approach is developed to meet this requirement. A process system was first decomposed into unit <b>operation</b> <b>subsystems</b> and the design model for each unit operation was developed. In addition to the regular detailed simulation unit model, a simplified simulation model was developed for each unit operation subunit to overcome the problem of slow solution speed and make the approach applicable for both regular programming method and interactive programming method. ^ As a typical problem, the alternative ways for whey treatment were investigated and the situation was analyzed. The approach method was applied to develope a computer package for solving the whey processing system development problem. Following the developed approach method, a computer package, called PPDPAK, was developed for demonstrating on developing whey processing systems. ^ From a comparison on different design modes, it was concluded that at the higher level of preliminary process development, the simplified simulation model should be applied for selection on alternative processing systems. The detailed simulation model should only be used to fine-tune the selected final processing schemes. ...|$|R

40|$|The lack of {{communication}} and of dynamic adaptation to working settings often hinder stable performances of subsystems of present multibiometric architectures. The calibration phase often uses a specific training set, so that (sub) systems are tuned with respect to well determined conditions. In this work we investigate the modular construction of systems according to CABALA (Collaborative Architectures based on Biometric Adaptable Layers and Activities) approach. Different levels of flexibility and collaboration are supported. The computation of system reliability (SRR), for each single response of each single subsystem, allows to address temporary decrease of accuracy due to adverse conditions (light, dirty sensors, etc.), by possibly refusing a poorly reliable response or by asking for a new recognition <b>operation.</b> <b>Subsystems</b> can collaborate at a twofold level, both in returning a jointly determined answer, and in co-evolving to tune to changing conditions. At the first level, single-biometric subsystems implement the N-Cross Testing Protocol: they work in parallel, but exchange information to reach the final response. At an higher level of interdependency, parameters of each subsystem can be dynamically optimized according to the behavior of their companions. To this aim, an additional Supervisor Module analyzes the single results and, in our present implementation, modifies the degree of reliability required from each subsystem to accept its future responses. The paper explores different combinations of these novel strategies. We demonstrate that as component collaboration increases, the same happens to both the overall system accuracy and {{to the ability to}} identify unstable subsystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|One {{possible}} next leap {{in human}} space exploration for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is {{a mission to}} a near Earth asteroid (NEA). In order to achieve such an ambitious goal, a space habitat will need to accommodate a crew of four for the 380 -day round trip. The Human Spaceflight Architecture Team (HAT) developed a conceptual design for such a habitat. The team identified activities that would be performed inside a long-duration, deep space habitat, and the capabilities needed to support such a mission. A list of seven functional activities/capabilities was developed: individual and group crew care, spacecraft and mission <b>operations,</b> <b>subsystem</b> equipment, logistics and resupply, and contingency operations. The volume for each activity was determined using NASA STD- 3001 and the companion Human Integration Design Handbook (HIDH). Although, the sum of these volumes produced an over-sized spacecraft, the team evaluated activity frequency and duration to identify functions that could share a common volume without conflict, reducing the total volume by 24 %. After adding 10 % for growth, the resulting functional pressurized volume was calculated to be a minimum of 268 cu m (9, 464 cu ft) distributed over the functions. The work was validated through comparison to Mir, Skylab, the International Space Station (ISS), Bigelow Aerospace s proposed habitat module, and NASA s Trans-Hab concept. Using HIDH guidelines, the team developed an internal layout that (a) minimized the transit time between related crew stations, (b) accommodated expected levels of activity at each station, (c) isolated stations when necessary for health, safety, performance, and privacy, and (d) provided a safe, efficient, and comfortable work and living environment...|$|R
