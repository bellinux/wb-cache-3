This will add gas at any time that the counterlung is emptied and the diver continues to inhale. Oxygen can also be added manually by a button which activates the demand valve.|$|E

The strategy combining the pulse width modulation with pulse frequency modulation is proposed to compensate the dead and saturated zones of the high-speed <b>on-off</b> <b>valve,</b> {{which is on the}} groundwork of the analysis of the flow characteristic of high-speed <b>on-off</b> <b>valve.</b> A compound algorithm of fuzzy & feedforward-feedback is put forward to realize the precise position control, which can be considered as the duty ratio is given ahead, and the fuzzy algorithm is designed and utilized to deal with the tracking error by adjusting to the frequency and duty ratio of the high-speed <b>on-off</b> <b>valve.</b> The mathematics modeling is analyzed and simulated with the proposed control algorithm using the finite chamber method.

Thereafter, a simulation model of the priority control system is established using the AMESim software and the dynamic characteristics are simulated. Simulation results including the variations in the pulse-width modulation signal, coil current, and the main spool displacement of the directional valve are presented and discussed. They indicate that the opening time of the main spool increases with the duty ratio of the voltage signal. Moreover, the main spool displacement is basically equal in one single pulse-width modulation signal cycle, and thus, it is proportional to the cycle number of the pulse-width modulation signal.

40|$|Fluid {{power control}} is {{dominated}} by the throttling orifice. This is an inherently inefficient methodology that is responsible for low system efficiencies. The field of digital fluid power seeks to replace the throttling orifice with <b>on-off</b> <b>valves</b> and in the process greatly improve the efficiency of fluid power systems. One implementation of these <b>on-off</b> <b>valves</b> is the Switched Inertance Hydraulic System (SIHS) which operates in a similar way to Switched Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) in power electronics. In order to realise SIHS it is necessary to have valves that can switch large flow rates between high and low pressure supplies quickly. This report details the development of such a valve. It is demonstrated empirically that by using multiple grooves on a single spool a flow rate of 55 L/min (at 10 bar pressure drop) can be achieved whilst switching in < 1 ms. This is achieved through cascading a State Variable Feedback (SVF) controller with Iterative Learning Control (ILC) feedforward. The addition of novel stop learning conditions to the simple proportional lag compensated ILC scheme allow the valve to be tested to the limit of its abilities giving a minimum switching time of 0. 5 ms, where the limitation proved to be the range of the accelerometer used. Using the valve in a SIHS yielded promising initial results with efficiencies above 80 % being achieved across a range of switching ratios...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{positive}} end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for {{the mechanical}} ventilation of small animals is frequently obtained with water seals or by using ventilators developed for human use.

Good examples are shape-changing aircraft wings which can adapt precisely to the ideal aerodynamic form for current flying conditions, and light but powerful robotic manipulators which can interact safely with human co-workers. A 'tensegrity structure' is a good candidate for this application due to its potentially excellent stiffness and strength-to-weight ratio and a multi-element structure into which actuators could be embedded. This paper presents results of an analysis of an example practical actuated tensegrity structure consisting of 3 ‘unit cells’.
