They put a ton of money into this event and they built up a valuable franchise, but, like Motorola, corporations change the way they do business".

40|$|In {{this project}} {{we have worked}} with traffic safety. We have chosen {{to focus on the}} {{pedestrians}} safety. We have the assumption that there is diminished visibility when it rains. When there is diminished visibility, it is more difficult for a driver to see the pedestrians. To be more visible in the traffic, pedestrians can choose to wear the known reflector. We think there is some problems combined with the reflector. We were surprised that the reflector’s effect is decreased after approximately a year. Lots of people is probably walking around with an old reflector, believing they are more safe and visible than they are in reality. Another problem is that the reflector only is visible in the light from a car. We believe there must be a better alternative to the reflector, which is the motivation for our project. To get to our results we have used the methods interview, statistics and test. We interviewed the designer Jesper Møllgaard. Jesper Møllgaard gave us knowledge about how a design process works. To find out the best light sources for <b>our</b> <b>product,</b> we tested different kinds of lights options. We made a jacket with an implanted lightsource. Only when there is diminished visibility, the jacket will light up. This jacket is an alternative to the existing reflector. To find the best solution you need to develop, test and then develop and test again. During the development of a project we {{thought it was a good}} idea to involve expert knowledge. We also learned that we had to be aware, that only one expert interview, only gives you one point of view. The larger implication with <b>our</b> <b>product</b> is that we do not know if <b>our</b> <b>product</b> will reduce accidents with pedestrians.
