5|$|Appearing from January to April, A. ocreata occurs {{later in}} the year than other amanitas except A. calyptroderma. It is found in mixed {{woodland}} on the Pacific coast of North America, from Washington south through California to Baja California in Mexico. It may feasibly occur on Vancouver Island in British Columbia though this has never been confirmed. It forms ectomycorrhizal relationships and is found in association with coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), as well as hazel (Corylus spp.). In <b>Oregon</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington,</b> it may also be associated with the Garry oak (Quercus garryana).|$|E

5|$|Between 15 and 16million years ago, in the Middle Miocene, eruptions of Columbia River basalts from {{volcanic}} vents {{in eastern}} <b>Oregon</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington</b> flowed {{across much of}} northern Oregon, sometimes reaching the Pacific Ocean. Although these basalts have been mapped in the West Hills under Marquam Hill, Hoyt Arboretum, and the steepest slopes of Forest Park, they flowed around but did not completely cover the Waverly Hills Formation in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E

5|$|After {{the lodge}} was completed, {{it was decided}} to build a {{restaurant}} and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad {{from as far away as}} <b>Oregon</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington</b> state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that become}} extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system, {{they can still}} retain winds of hurricane or gale force. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel became extratropical over North Carolina as a strong Category 3 storm. The Columbus Day Storm of 1962, which evolved from the remains of Typhoon Freda, caused heavy damage in <b>Oregon</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington,</b> with widespread damage equivalent to at least a Category 3. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma began to lose tropical characteristics while still sporting Category 3-force winds (and became fully extratropical as a Category 1 storm).|$|E
5|$|Although the Belloni {{decision}} {{established the}} rights of the Indians to exercise their treaty fishing rights, the states of <b>Oregon</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington</b> continued to arrest Indians for violations of state law and regulations that infringed on those rights. In September 1970, the United States Attorney filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the state of Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, and Skokomish tribes. Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes intervened in the case. Defendants were the state of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{histories}} {{describe the}} formation and destruction of the Bridge of the Gods, a land bridge that connected the <b>Oregon</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington</b> sides of the river in the Columbia River Gorge. The bridge, which aligns with geological records of the Bonneville Slide, was described in some stories {{as the result of}} a battle between gods, represented by Mount Adams and Mount Hood, in their competition for the affection of a goddess, represented by Mount St.Helens. Native American stories about the bridge differ in their details but agree in general that the bridge permitted increased interaction between tribes on the north and south sides of the river.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of <b>Oregon</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington.</b> In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E

5|$|Like all Lactarius species, L.argillaceifolius is mycorrhizal. The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius argillaceifolius grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under hardwoods, especially oak, from July to October. It is often {{one of the first}} mycorrhizal mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory. The fruit bodies are slow to develop and are long-lasting. The species is found from eastern Canada south to Florida, and west to Minnesota and Texas. It is common in northeast Mexico. The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of Santa Catarina) growing in association with pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations, where it has probably been introduced with pine seedlings brought by settlers. L.argillaceifolius var. megacarpus has been collected from Baja California, California, <b>Oregon,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington,</b> where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak.|$|E
5|$|The United States, {{with its}} large size and {{geographic}} variety, includes most climate types. To {{the east of}} the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal <b>Oregon</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington</b> and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Extreme weather is not uncommonâ€”the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.|$|E
5|$|On 5 January 1931, Breese was redesignated {{as a light}} minelayer, {{with the}} hull {{classification}} symbol of DM-18. Following an overhaul and conversion at Mare Island Navy Yard, she was recommissioned on 1 June 1931. She then returned to San Diego for sea trials and standardization tests in her new role. These completed, she departed for Pearl Harbor. She was assigned to Mine Division 1 of the Pacific Fleet, and operated out of Hawaiian waters. She conducted several training exercises, including with the submarine divisions where she served as a target ship. She {{also served as a}} station ship for aircraft. She returned to San Diego in June 1937, and placed out of commission and in reserve on 12 November 1937. On 25 September 1939, Breese was again recommissioned and assigned to Mine Division 5 of the Pacific Fleet. On 2 November 1939, she arrived at Puget Sound Navy Yard and began to conduct Neutrality Patrol off the <b>Oregon</b> <b>and</b> <b>Washington</b> coasts. Throughout 1940, she cruised to different bases along the coastline of Alaska with the commander of the Alaskan Sector aboard. Upon returning, she rejoined Mine Division 5 in San Francisco and steamed for Hawaii, returning there on 10 December 1940. Attached to Mine Division 2 in the Pacific Fleet, she took part in training exercises in the operating area and on the Maui range during much of 1941.|$|E
