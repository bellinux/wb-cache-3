5|$|However, {{when the}} king's uncle, Odo of Bayeux, raised a {{rebellion}} against the king in 1088, St-Calais was implicated in the revolt. William Rufus laid siege to St-Calais in the bishop's stronghold of Durham, and later put him on trial for treason. A contemporary record <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial,</b> the De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi, is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial. Imprisoned briefly, St-Calais was allowed to go into exile after his castle at Durham was surrendered to the king. He went to Normandy, where he became a leading advisor to Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, the elder brother of William Rufus. By 1091, St-Calais had returned to England and regained royal favour.|$|E

25|$|Important role (David Cameron as joint global Chief Investigator) in {{the pivotal}} {{clinical}} trial that tested {{the hypothesis that}} the combination of lapatinib and the cytotoxic drug capecitabine would be superior to capecitabine alone in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer that had progressed despite trastuzumab treatment.

25|$|Tianeptine {{has been}} found to be {{effective}} in depression in Parkinson's disease and in post-traumatic stress disorder of which it was as safe and effective as fluoxetine and moclobemide. A clinical trial has been conducted to compare its efficacy and tolerability with amitriptyline in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> showed that tianeptine was at least as effective as amitriptyline and produced less prominent adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these results, an uncontrolled clinical trial was carried out at the Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in St. Petersburg {{over a period of}} 17 years, and a controlled trial was carried out at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in California over period of 10 years, respectively. The Russian trial reported complete tumor regression in about 1% of cases, a partial response in about 3% of cases and some subjective improvement of symptoms in about half of the patients. The National Cancer Institute analysis <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> notes that interpretation of these data is difficult, due to the absence of controls, the lack of information on prior treatment and the study's reliance on subjective assessments of symptoms (i.e. asking patients if the drug had made them feel any better). Overall, the trials in California saw no statistically significant effect on survival from hydrazine sulfate treatment, but noted increased calorie intake in treated patients versus controls. The authors also performed a post-hoc analysis on one or more subgroups of these patients, which they reported as suggesting a beneficial effect from treatment. The design and interpretation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial,</b> and in particular the validity of this subgroup analysis, was criticized in detail in an editorial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.|$|E

25|$|Participants in {{the trial}} were {{recruited}} when they sought medical care at general medical or psychiatric clinics. No advertising was used to recruit subjects {{in order to maximize}} the generalizability of the study results. Participants were required to have a minimum score of 14 point on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) in order to be enrolled {{in the trial}}. Generally accepted cutoffs are 7–17 points for mild depression, 18–24 points for moderate depression, and ≥ 24 for severe depression. The average participant baseline HAM-D17 score was 22. The pre-specified primary endpoint <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> was remission as determined by the HAM-D score, with all patients with missing scores rated as non-responders. In the aftermath of the trial, the investigators have presented the results mainly using the secondary endpoint of remission according to the QIDS-SR16 Score, which tend to be somewhat higher.|$|E
25|$|The first {{randomized}} controlled trial {{to assess the}} effect of male circumcision on female to male HIV transmission was published in 2005 by Bertran Auvert and colleagues in PLOS Medicine. The Lancet a leading medical journal rejected this paper because of ethical concerns around how the trial was conducted before PLOS Medicine accepted it. The trial was stopped early by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board who advised the investigators to interrupt the trial and offer circumcision to the control group. The trial estimated that male circumcision provided protection of 60% (95% CI: 32%–76%) for female to male HIV transmission. The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> along with two others led to the World Health Organization (WHO) assessing the evidence for male circumcision to prevent HIV transmission. The WHO and UNAIDS subsequently issued recommendations concerning male circumcision and HIV/AIDS including suggestions for government strategic plans, advocacy challenges and exploring the role of new technologies for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) such as Prepex and other medical devices. A number of Ministries of Health along with key stakeholders have committed to scaling up VMMC for HIV prevention in Southern and Eastern Africa.|$|E

25|$|In 1611, {{her father}} was working with Agostino Tassi to {{decorate}} the vaults of Casino delle Muse inside the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome, so Orazio hired the painter to tutor his daughter privately. During this tutelage, Tassi raped Artemisia. Another man, Cosimo Quorli, was also involved. After the rape, Artemisia continued to {{have sexual relations with}} Tassi, with the expectation {{that they were going to}} be married and with the hope to restore her dignity and her future. Tassi reneged on his promise to marry Artemisia. Nine months after the rape, when he learnt that Artemisia and Tassi were not going to be married, Orazio pressed charges against Tassi. Orazio also claimed that Tassi stole a painting of Judith from the Gentileschi household. The major issue <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> was the fact that Tassi had taken Artemisia's virginity. If Artemisia had not been a virgin before Tassi raped her, the Gentileschis would not have been able to press charges. During the ensuing seven-month trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had engaged in adultery with his sister-in-law, and planned to steal some of Orazio’s paintings. During the trial, Artemisia was subjected to a gynecological examination and torture using thumbscrews to verify her testimony. At the end of the trial Tassi was exiled from Rome, although they never carried out the sentence. The trial influenced the feminist view of Artemisia Gentileschi during the late twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|During her lifetime, Blavatsky had {{suggested}} to many different persons {{that they would}} be her successor. Three of the most prominent candidates — Olcott, Judge, and Besant — all met in London shortly after to discuss the situation. Judge claimed that he too was in contact with the Masters, and that they had provided him with a message instructing him to co-delegate the Society's Esoteric Section with Besant. Olcott however suspected that the notes from the Masters which Judge was producing were forged, exacerbating tensions between them. Besant attempted to act as a bridge between the two men, while Judge informed her that the Masters had revealed to him a plot that Olcott was orchestrating to kill her. In 1893, Besant came down on Olcott's side in the argument and backed the internal proceedings that Olcott raised against Judge. A two-stage enquiry took place, which concluded that because the Society took no official stance on whether the Masters existed or not, Judge could not be considered guilty of forgery and would be allowed to retain his position. The details <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> were leaked to the journalist F. Edmund Garrett, who used them as the basis of his critical book, Isis Very Much Unveiled. Judge then announced that the Masters had informed him that he should take sole control of the Esoteric Section, deposing Besant; she rejected his claims. Amid calls from Olcott that Judge should stand down, in April 1895 the American section voted to secede from the main Society. Judge remained its leader, but died within a year.|$|E

500|$|As a {{young man}} Marbury was {{considered}} to be a [...] "hothead" [...] and felt strongly that the clergy should be well educated, and clashed with his superiors on this issue. [...] He spent time preaching at Northampton, but soon came into conflict with the bishop's chancellor, Dr. James Ellis, who was on a mission to suppress any nonconforming clergy. [...] After two short imprisonments, Marbury was directed to leave Northampton and not return. [...] He disregarded this order, and was then brought to trial in the consistory of St. Paul's in London before the high commission on 5 November 1578. [...] Here he was examined by the Bishop of London, John Aylmer, and by Sir Owen Hopton, Dr. Lewis, and Archdeacon John Mullins. [...] Marbury made a transcript <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> from memory and used it to educate and amuse his children, he being the hero, and the Bishop being portrayed as somewhat of a buffoon, and the transcript can be found in Benjamin Brook's study of notable Puritans.

500|$|By late 1637, the {{conclusion}} of the controversy was beginning to take shape. [...] During the court held in early November, Wheelwright was finally sentenced to banishment, the delay caused by the hopes that he would, at some point, recant. [...] On 7 November the trial of Anne Hutchinson began, and Wilson was there with most of the other ministers in the colony, though his role was somewhat restrained. [...] During {{the second day of the}} trial, when things seemed to be going in her favor, Hutchinson insisted on making a statement, admitting that her knowledge of things had come from a divine inspiration, prophesying her deliverance from the proceedings, and announcing that a curse would befall the colony. [...] This was all that her judges needed to hear, and she was accused of heresy and sentenced to banishment, though she would be held in detention for four months, awaiting a trial by the clergy. [...] While no statements made by Wilson were recorded in either existing transcript <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial,</b> Wilson did make a speech against Hutchinson at the end of the proceedings, to which Hutchinson responded with anger four months later during her church trial.|$|E
500|$|Kinne's third {{trial for}} the murder of James Kinne, {{originally}} scheduled to begin early in June 1964, began instead on June 29. Assistant prosecutor Donald L. Mason declared at jury selection that he intended to death-qualify the jury, a process in which a prosecutor peremptorily challenges any juror who automatically opposes the death penalty, and jury selection once again took more than twelve hours in one day. [...] John Boldizs's testimony in this trial remained contradictory as to whether he believed Kinne's offer had been intended seriously, but he added this time that after James Kinne's death, Sharon Kinne had asked that Boldizs not tell authorities about her $1,000 offer for the death of her husband. A new witness, a female acquaintance of Kinne's, testified that Kinne had once joked that the woman should [...] "get rid of [...] old man like [...] did", but defense cross-examination highlighted inconsistencies between this testimony and a similar quote the woman had offered at a previous deposition. For the first time at any of her trials, Kinne took the stand on the last day <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> to issue a categorical denial of all charges.|$|E
