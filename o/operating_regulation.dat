50|$|The industry’s growth {{continues}} {{to be driven by}} the long-term shift towards electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks, in addition to an improvement in security standards that require more advanced electronic payment systems. International and national security issues have become the main drivers of Verifone's business model as customers seek means to meet ever-escalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as <b>operating</b> <b>regulation</b> safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations. These trends have been accelerated by the usage of credit and debit card based payments, especially PIN-based debit. Another key driver is the growth in single application credit card products that enable merchants to provide payment solutions in non-traditional settings such as pay-at-the-table in restaurants.|$|E
50|$|Industry {{security}} standards are constantly evolving, driving re-certification and replacement of {{electronic payment system}}s, particularly in Europe and the United States. In order to offer electronic payment systems that connect to payment networks, electronic payment system providers certify their products and services with card associations, financial institutions, and payment processors and comply with government and telecommunications company regulations. Not surprisingly, security has become a driving factor in its business as customers endeavor to meet ever escalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as <b>operating</b> <b>regulation</b> safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations, members of which include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover Financial Services, and JCB. In response to increasing industry demands for high security products {{in the fiscal year}} ended October 31, 2007, Verifone incurred an obsolescence charge of $16.6 million primarily due to the implementation of new PCI {{security standards}}.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, whiteout conditions {{applied and}} visibility {{was no more}} than a few yards. The signalmen on this stretch of line were <b>operating</b> <b>Regulation</b> 5e. This means that a double section has to be clear ahead for a train to be signalled to pass the previous box, Greenhill Junction. A set of points ahead had been blocked by snow. The train from Dundee ran past the Castlecary home signal in poor visibility but managed to stop just beyond it. The Castlecary signalman failed to check its whereabouts and allowed the following Edinburgh express into the section. This also ran past the same signal and collided with the Dundee train. It is believed that the Castlecary distant signal had stuck in the 'off' ('clear') position, so the express took it that the line was now clear, it wasn't until he crossed the viaduct that he saw the home signal at 'danger'. Even a modern-day car would not have stopped in the remaining 50 yards to the tail lamp, which was to be flattened.|$|E

50|$|In this {{analysis}} {{of the causes of}} the accident, deficiencies in the reactor design and in the <b>operating</b> <b>regulations</b> that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually. Serious critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident. The following general picture arose from these observations. Several procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible. One was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night.|$|R

50|$|A {{merchant}} {{account is}} a type of bank account that allows businesses to accept payments in multiple ways, typically debit or credit cards. A merchant account is established under an agreement between an acceptor and a merchant acquiring bank for the settlement of payment card transactions. In some cases a payment processor, independent sales organization (ISO), or member service provider (MSP) is also a party to the merchant agreement. Whether a merchant enters into a merchant agreement directly with an acquiring bank or through an aggregator, the agreement contractually binds the merchant to obey the <b>operating</b> <b>regulations</b> established by the card associations.|$|R

30|$|Whilst the {{discussion}} {{has been focused}} principally on people, questions about the vulnerability of ecosystems, buildings, and urban environments are all equally relevant. Without dealing with {{the root causes of}} poor urban risk governance, inappropriate land use zoning, building code regulation and compliance, safety standards, post-construction <b>operating</b> <b>regulations,</b> and maintenance, our built environment will continue to remain sub-optimal, perpetuating the vulnerability of that built infrastructure and systems—and the people and the more-than-human species that occupy them (Acuto 2016; Birkmann et al. 2016). Consequently, hazard and disaster scholars with a focus on these areas have critical roles to play in changing the way we do business.|$|R
50|$|The {{committee}} {{investigated the}} perception, current in the 1930s, that the safety, pricing and <b>operating</b> <b>regulations</b> that {{applied to the}} railways had left them at an unfair disadvantage {{when compared to the}} road haulage industry, which was unregulated. It noted that the railway system, then organised into several regional companies, probably had no need for many of the small branch lines and services, as motor transport had shown itself to be more efficient for local deliveries. But it concluded that the existing system of road funding, which relied on local authorities to fund {{a significant portion of the}} road network, represented a subsidy to the road hauliers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Strengthening the {{practice}} training {{is a primary}} means {{to ensure the safety}} in coal production.

The paper makes a detailed explanation of the design and development of SSCMT from the following aspects: system functions, creating a virtual environment, training evaluation, system optimization. The realistic application demonstrates that the SSCMT system has brought good results in reduction of training cost, stimulation of learning interest, and improvement of training quality...|$|R
