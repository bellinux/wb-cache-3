5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} {{is the sole}} member of the genus Tetracerus, and is placed under the family Bovidae. The species was first described by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816. The {{four-horned antelope}} has only one <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> in the tribe Boselaphini, the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus). The Boselaphini have the horns with a keel {{on the front and}} lack rings as found in other antelope groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} nilgai is Boselaphus tragocamelus. The nilgai is the sole member of the genus Boselaphus {{and placed in the}} family Bovidae. The species was described and given its binomial name by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. He based his description on a 1745 account of a male nilgai by British physician James Parsons in the 43rd volume of Philosophical Transactions (now known as the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society). The nilgai has one <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> in the tribe Boselaphini, the four-horned antelope (the sole member of Tetracerus).|$|E
25|$|England ranked {{seventh in}} the ODI rankings had had mixed {{performances}} winning the 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series and the recent ODI series against India but lost to the West Indies and performed poorly in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The team had a new look with new captain Paul Collingwood going on his first away tour while James Anderson and Stuart Broad formed a new front line attack. <b>Other</b> <b>relative</b> newcomers to the squad were all-rounders Dimitri Mascarenhas and Ravi Bopara. England had still not resolved their keeping problem with Matt Prior not being offered a central contract and had selected five wicketkeepers in the past 12 months; Chris Read, Geraint Jones, Paul Nixon, Prior and Phil Mustard.|$|E

25|$|Another case is Uthman's <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> named Marwan bin Hakam, the {{one which}} {{instigate}} the controversy regarding nepotism {{was the case of}} the Marwan corruption of the spoils of war from the conquest of northern Africa. However, it is argued that that is non existent because the allegation of corruption was originated from the misconception regarding of how Marwan transported the spoils tribute to the capital. Marwan did not directly send the tribute of spoils of war because it was not efficient as the spoils of war was in the form of cattle and hardware. As such, he sold the spoils of war first and then the treasury in the form of Dinars, which easier to be transported was sent directly to the caliph.|$|E
25|$|Until today, {{no child}} or <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> of Huni can be {{identified}} and connected to him with certainty. William Stevenson Smith and George Andrew Reisner propose to identify queen Hetepheres I (concubine of Sneferu and mother of king Khufu; 4th dynasty) {{as the daughter of}} King Huni. Hetepheres bore the female title Sat-netjer ("daughter of a god"), which led Smith and Reisner to the conclusion that this could be a hint to her family position as the daughter of Huni. In this case, Hetepheres would have been an heir princess and by marrying Snefru, she secured the blood line of the royal dynasty. But other scholars, such as Wolfgang Helck and Winfried Seipel, raise strong doubts against this theory. They argue that the title of Hetepheres does not explicitly reveal to whom she was married in her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Adjustment {{of status}} (AOS) – Adjustment of status is {{for when the}} {{immigrant}} is in the United States and entered the U.S. legally. Except for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, the immigrant must also be in legal status {{at the time of}} applying for adjustment of status. For immediate relatives and <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> categories whose visa numbers are current, adjustment of status can be filed for at the same time with the petition (step 1 above). Adjustment of status is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. The USCIS conducts a series of background checks (including fingerprinting for FBI criminal background check and name checks) and makes a decision on the application. Once the adjustment of status application is accepted, the alien is allowed to stay in the United States even if the original period of authorized stay on the Form I-94 is expired, but he/she is generally not allowed to leave the country until the application is approved, or the application will be abandoned. If the alien has to leave the United States during this time, he/she can apply for travel documents at the USCIS with form I-131, also called Advance parole. If there is a potential risk that the applicant's work permit (visa) will expire or become invalid (laid off by the employer and visa sponsor) or the applicant wants to start working in the United States, while he/she is waiting for the decision about his/her application to change status, he/she can file form I-765, to get Employment Authorization Documents (also called EAD) and be able to continue or start working legally in the United States. In some cases, the applicant will be interviewed at a USCIS office, especially if it is a marriage-based adjustment from a K-1 visa, in which case both spouses (the US citizen and the applicant) will be interviewed by the USCIS. If the application is approved, the alien becomes an LPR, and the actual green card is mailed to the alien's last known mailing address.|$|E

500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] {{was first}} {{broadcast}} on March 27, 2011 {{as part of}} the animation television night on Fox. The episode ended the line-up, the first time an American Dad! episode ended the animation television night on Fox since the season-six episode [...] "For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls". It was the first new episode of American Dad! shortly following a month-long hiatus. It was preceded by The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, and a rerun of its sister show Family Guy. Its <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> show, The Cleveland Show, was notably absent, as it did not air on that date. It was viewed by 4.9 million viewers upon its original airing, despite airing simultaneously with Celebrity Apprentice on NBC, Undercover Boss on CBS, and a rerun of Desperate Housewives on ABC. The total viewership of the episode was slightly higher than Bob's Burgers, but significantly lower than Family Guy and The Simpsons. It achieved a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic group, according to the Nielsen ratings, the third highest rating in the line-up. The episode's total viewership and ratings were significantly up from the previous episode, [...] "You Debt Your Life", which was viewed by 4.25 million viewers upon its initial airing, and garnered a 2.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic. The episode's ratings and total viewership were also the highest since the season six episode [...] "For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls", which was viewed by 6.26 million viewers and acquired a 3.1 rating in the 18-49 demographic.|$|E

2500|$|Relative value {{arbitrage}} strategies {{take advantage}} of relative discrepancies in price between securities. The price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities, the underlying security or the market overall.

Relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral, as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole. <b>Other</b> <b>relative</b> value sub-strategies include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Avoidance speech, or [...] "mother-in-law language," [...] is {{the most}} common example of a {{bystander}} honorific.
