40|$|Moisture {{content is}} one of the most crucial factors {{influencing}} soil and rock strength. This paper deals with the effect of moisture content on strength of older alluvium under dry, wet and saturated conditions. Older alluvium is semi cemented eroded deposited and reshaped by water to make non-marine setting. Specimens were tested in for shear strength, hardness and point load index. According to these results, the petrophysical properties of older alluvium decrease with increasing moisture. The strength was extremely reduced after the moisture content increased over the range of natural moisture content i. e. at saturated condition. For soil mechanics and soil engineering projects the shear strength, friction angle and cohesion assess at dry condition in order to give classification for soil strength. While the design parameters (shear strength, friction angle and cohesion) were taken at weak condition i. e. saturated and wet condition. However the difficulties and non reliable preparing regular samples at laboratory, most of samples destroyed during the sample preparation. Point load apparatus and Schmidt (rebound) hammer test did not able to record any reading during test the samples for both wet and dry condition. Older alluvium shows equilibrium between distribution of the clay/silt and gravel with percent finer approximately 38 % and 38. 5 % respectively, and lower presence of sand with percent finer approximately 23. 4 %. The range of natural moisture content was within range of 17. 98 to 19. 65 %. The results revealed that moisture content have great influence in the reduction of the shear strength t, friction angle Ø and cohesion c. When the moisture content on older alluvium deposits increased the shear strength reduced to 22. 3 % and to 75. 3 % at wet and saturated condition respectively (the shear strength equal to 57. 4 kPa and 18. 3 kPa for wet and saturated condition respectively) in comparison to the magnitude of shear strength at dry condition (shear strength at dry condition equal to 74. 1 kPa). The same as for friction angle, when the moisture content increased the friction angle reduced to 18. 6 % and 66. 9 % at wet condition and saturated condition respectively (friction angle equal to 55. 19 o and 22. 45 o for wet and saturated condition respectively) in comparison to the magnitude at dry condition (at dry condition friction angle equal to 67. 83 <b>o).</b> <b>Otherwise</b> the effective of increase the moisture content at cohesion is different i. e. the magnitude of cohesion at dry condition was equal to 21. 044 kPa.

Two methods are reported which were developed for analysis of small icy samples and which are modified for larger samples in cometary matter simulation experiments (KOSI). A conventional optical cryostat system was modified to allow for transport of samples at 5 K, ion beam irradiation, and measurement in an off-line optical spectrophotometer. The new system consists of a removable window plug containing nozzles for condensation of water and volatiles onto a cold finger. This plug can be removed in a vacuum system, changed against another plug (e. g., with other windows (IR, VIS, VUV) or other nozzles). While open, the samples can be treated under vacuum with cooling by manipulators (cut, removal, sample taking, irradiation with light, photons, or ions). After bringing the plug back, the samples can be moved to another site of analysis.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the problem of constructing associative memory models which store and retrieve information in a distributed fashion - that is each store location can be involved in the storage of more than one piece of information. The models are to be logically simple in form and efficient in their use of store. It is hoped that those proposed may find a place in neurophysiological theories of memory. From the starting point of seeking a less complex representation of a holographic model of memory called the Holophone, several memory models have been proposed and their properties investigated by analytical and computer simulation methods. All the systems considered belong to a family of memory models which are described by a pair of matrix equations. It is found that the models which perform well are non-linear devices which have to store and retrieve highly redundant information. One of these, the Associative Net, is closely related to a recent theory of the cerebellum.

40|$|Abstract. Discovery of {{abundant}} anhydrite (CaSO 4) and gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 <b>O)</b> in the <b>otherwise</b> carbonate sediments {{comprising the}} upper {{portion of the}} rocks contained within the Chicxulub impact crater has prompted research on the shock-induced vaporization of these minerals. We use a vaporization criterion determined by shock-induced entropy. We reanalyze the shock wave experiments of Yang [1]. He shocked 30 % porous anhydrite and 46 % porous calcite. Post-shock adiabatic expansion of the sample across a 5 mm-thick gap and then impact upon an aluminum witness plate backed by LiF window that is monitored with a VISAR. Reanalysis uses Herrman’s P-α model [2] for porous materials, and a realistic interpolation gas equation-of-state for vaporization products. Derived values of the entropies for incipient and complete vaporization for anhydrite are 1. 65 ± 0. 12 and 3. 17 ± 0. 12 kJ(kg. K) - 1, and for calcite these are 0. 99 ± 0. 11 and 1. 93 ± 0. 11 kJ(kg. K) - 1. Corresponding pressures for incipient and complete vaporization along the Hugoniot of non-porous anhydrite are 32. 5 ± 2. 5 and 122 ± 13 GPa and for non-porous calcite are 17. 8 ± 2. 9 and 54. 1 ± 5. 3 GPa, respectively. These pressures are a factor of 2 - 3 lower than reported earlier by Yang...|$|R
