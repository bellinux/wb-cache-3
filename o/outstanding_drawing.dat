5000|$|The Château de Condé is {{a private}} estate, listed as a {{historic}} monument and inhabited year round. Its sumptuous 17th and 18th century interiors were created by the most prestigious artists (Watteau, Boucher, Oudry, Servandoni and others) {{at the behest of}} the Princes of Savoy and then the Marquis de la Faye. This château evokes part of France's history, through illustrious characters like the Condés, the Savoies, Jean de La Fontaine, Cardinal Richelieu, Mazarin, not forgetting Olympe and her suspect [...] "powders". Highlights include the [...] "Watteau" [...] wing and its recently discovered frescoes, Richelieu's bed chamber, the magnificent [...] "trompe-l'œil" [...] effects of Servandoni, the [...] "little private apartments" [...] and the <b>outstanding</b> <b>drawing</b> room decorated by Oudry.|$|E
40|$|Quite {{a number}} of studies, such as those by Íñiguez (1963, pp. 193 - 211), García Tapia (1990, pp. 172 - 181) and Lorda (1997), have {{discussed}} the cranes used {{in the construction of}} Spanish Renaissance buildings. All these papers deal with the surviving evidence about the construction of the Escorial complex, in particular the main church or basilica, such as a large number of contracts and other documents, a manuscript by Juan de Herrera called Architectura y machinas, and the <b>outstanding</b> <b>drawing</b> of the Escorial building site now at Hatfield House, England. Another source for studies about Spanish Renaissance cranes is Lázaro de Velasco’s translation of Vitruvius’ De architectura libri decem. Velasco was the grandchild of a wood carver, Juan López de Velasco, and the son of Jacopo Torni, a Florentine painter and sculptor who was master mason of Murcia cathedral and architect of the church of San Jerónimo in Granada. Velasco followed an ecclesiastical career, holding a post as beneficiado in the chapter of Granada cathedral. However, his artistic interests show up in his work as illuminator of choir books, in his ill-fated attempt to obtain the office of master mason for Granada Cathedral in 1577 and in his complete translation of Vitruvius into Spanish, about 1564. Of course, Velasco translates the passages of Vitruvius’ tenth book about machines, such as the tryspast and the polyspast, adding drawings of these hoisting devices. Furthermore, Velasco interpolates a long passage describing a big crane, similar but not identical to the ones in the Escorial, with a pyramidal frame, a windlass or mástil, moved by men treading inside a wheel, a rotating pole, ropes and a tryspast, but does not furnish a drawing of this big, non-Vitruvian crane. After a brief review of Velasco’s career, I shall try to reconstruct the big crane in Lázaro de Velasco’s text, comparing it with the Escorial cranes, as depicted in the Hatfield drawing and described in the studies of Íñiguez, García Tapia and Lorda. I shall also discuss the possible sources of Lázaro de Velasco expertise on cranes; on the one hand, classical sources such as Vitruvius or Greek mechanics, on the other, the traditional and empirical lore of carpenters and masons, embodied in the ingenio or crane put up in Murcia cathedral in the years of Jacopo Torni, or the cranes that Velasco may have seen in Granada cathedral...|$|E

40|$|This {{major new}} book tackles key {{questions}} on Europe {{in the context}} of shifting parameters of East and West. The contributors - sociologists, anthropologists, philosophers and historians - show, from a variety of different perspectives, that the conventional equation of Europe with the West must be questioned. Featuring four thematically organized chapters, the book looks at: - a post-Western world - Asia in Europe: encounters in history - between Europe and Asia - otherness in Europe and Asia Exploring new expressions of European self-understanding in a way that challenges recent ideological notions of the ‘clash of civilizations’, this <b>outstanding</b> work <b>draws</b> on recent scholarship that shows how Europe and Asia were mutually linked in history and in contemporary perspective. It argues {{that as a result of}} current developments and the changing geopolitical context, both Europe and Asia have much in common and that it is possible to speak of cosmopolitan links rather than clashes. This book will be of great value to students and researchers in the fields of sociology, European politics and history and cultural theory...|$|R

40|$|This tribute {{article to}} Professor Alan G. Hannam {{is based on}} 7 presentations {{for him at the}} July 1, 2008 {{symposium}} honoring 3 "giants" in orofacial neuroscience: Professors B. J. Sessle, J. P. Lund, and A. G. Hannam. This tribute to Hannam’s <b>outstanding</b> career <b>draws</b> examples from his 40 -year academic career and spans topics from human evolution to complex modeling of the craniomandibular system. The first presentation by W. Hylander provides a plausible answer to the functional and evolutionary significance of canine reduction in hominins. The second presentation, by A. McMillan, describes research activities in the field of healthy aging, including findings that intensity-modulated radiotherapy improves the health condition and quality of life of people with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in comparison to conventional radiotherapy. The developments in dental imaging are summarized in the third paper by E. Lam, and an overview of the bite force magnitude and direction while clenching is described in the fourth paper by M. Watanabe. The last 3 contributions by G. Langenbach, I. Staveness, and C. Peck deal with the topic of bone remodeling as well as masticatory system modeling, which was Hannam’s main research interest in recent years. These contributions show the considerable advancements that {{have been made in the}} last decade under Hannam’s drive, in particular the development of an interactive model comprising, in addition to the masticatory system, also the upper airways. The final section of the article includes a final commentary from Professor Hannam...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} 13 January 1786, {{in the town}} of Scy-sur-Moselle, son of Pierre Bazaine (1760-1832) and Francoise Gilbert. Educated in Paris, {{graduate}} of the Ecole polytechnique and the Ecole des ponts. Initially he practised as an Engineer in Italy and Southern France. His <b>outstanding</b> abilities <b>drew</b> the attention of Napoleon I who subsequently recommended him to the Russian Emperor Czar Alexander I, along with engineers Fabrom, Destremom and Potier, to take up senior posts in the Russia corps of Civil Engineers. Bazaine arrived in St.Petersburg, Russia in 1810 with Lieutenant Fabrom but due war with France, did not immediately take up his post. Instead he was sent to Odessa under the Governor-General of the Duke de Richelieu, where his first work was at the Russian port of Evpatoriya. He was then sent to Yaroslavl, to Poshehone and then in 1812 due to the war with France, he was deported to Eastern Siberia, where he spent more than two years. Bazaine devoted himself entirely to science and analytics whilst in Siberia, writing his great treatise on differential calculus and several memoirs about plane geometry and properties of various lengths in three dimensions. In 1815, with the end of war in Europe, he returned to St. Petersburg where with the new rank of Colonel, he was appointed Chair Professor of Higher Analytics and Mechanics at the Civil Engineering Institute. In 1820, he was promoted to Major-General and in 1823 he was appointed a member of the Council Ways and Communications, being made Inspector-General. In January 1824, He became Director of the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, and also Chairman of the Committee for Buildings and Hydraulic works in St.Petersburg. In 1828, Bazaine returned to France but on his return to Russia was promoted to Lieutenant General on 1 April 1830. Bazaine's structural engineering works were extensive and much remains in the historic infrastructure in Russia. His main works are: ...|$|R
60|$|Asking you to {{remember}} that I consider time as being very important, both to the general cause {{of the country and}} to the soldiers in the field, I beg to remind you that I waited, at your request, from the 1st until the 6th inst., to receive your communication dated the 3d. In view of its great length, and the known time and apparent care taken in its preparation, I did not doubt that it contained your full case as you desired to present it. It contained the figures for twelve districts, omitting the other nineteen, as I suppose, because you found nothing to complain of as to them. I answered accordingly. In doing so I laid down the principle to which I purpose adhering, which is to proceed with the draft, at the same time employing infallible means to avoid any great wrong. With the communication received to-day you send figures for twenty-eight districts, including the twelve sent before, and still omitting three, for which I suppose the enrolments are not yet received. In looking over the fuller list of twenty-eight districts, I find that the quotas for sixteen of them are above 2000 and below 2700, while, of the rest, six are above 2700 and six are below 2000. Applying the principle to these new facts, the Fifth and Seventh districts must be added to the four in which the quotas have already been reduced to 2200 for the first draft; and with these four others just be added to those to be re-enrolled. The correct case will then stand: the quotas of the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth districts fixed at 2200 for the first draft. The Provost-Marshal-General informs me that the drawing is already completed in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-second, Twenty-fourth, Twenty-sixth, Twenty-seventh, Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, and Thirtieth districts. In the others, except the three <b>outstanding,</b> the <b>drawing</b> will be made upon the quotas as now fixed. After the first draft, the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Twenty-first, Twenty-fifth, Twenty-ninth, and Thirty-first will be enrolled for the purpose and in the manner stated in my letter of the 7th inst. The same principle will be applied to the now outstanding districts when they shall come in. No part of my former letter is repudiated by reason of not being restated in this, or for any other cause.|$|R
40|$|The tourism {{industry}} is a highly information intensive-industiy. In few other areas of activity are the generation, gathering, processing, application and communication of information as important for dayto- day operations as they are for the {{tourism industry}} (Buhalis 1994). Traditional sources of tourism information, images, text, sound, animation and video, provide potential tourists with short and often rather limited glimpses of tourism destinations which may be inadequate {{to enable them to}} make informed decisions (Cheong 1995). In addition, these sources of tourist information provide only a passive experience as they often possess little involvement {{on the part of the}} potential tourist. Virtual Reality (VR), on the other hand, enables potential tourists to interact with and experience each tourist destination in high detail and provides them with enough information to make a well-informed tourist decision. When considering its application within the tourism industry, VR will offer the ability not only to view a destination, but also, to participate in the activities offered at the destination. Through VR the tourist advances from being a passive observer to being an active participant (Williams & Hobson 1994). This thesis addresses issues associated with the design and evaluation of a VR application to the tourism industry that provides users with all the traditional types of tourist information along with allowing them to experience a multi-participant, realistic, interactive and real-time walkthrough of real-life tourist destinations. In order to develop these walkthroughs, the basic concepts of VR had first to be analysed. This was achieved by gaining hands-on experience of the different types of VR hardware and software available in conjunction with an in-depth literature review. Following the completion of this analysis, an overview of the tourism industry was developed. This overview identified certain properties of the tourism product that lend themselves readily to the application of VR Once this was completed the final stage of the research was concerned with the development of the walkthroughs and the elicitation of knowledge from the development of these walkthroughs. There were many conclusions uncovered by this research but the most important was that VR can indeed be applied successfully to the tourism industry. The main areas of application will be in the areas of tourism policy and planning and the marketing of the tourism product. Another conclusion that was drawn from this research was that VR applications can help to generate realistic impressions and expectations of what can be experienced at a tourism location. The final <b>outstanding</b> conclusion <b>drawn</b> from this research was that potential tourists viewed the VR application as a decision making tool that increases their desire to actually visit a tourist location and not as a tourism substitute...|$|R
40|$|Children’s {{books have}} {{been around since the}} early 1500 s. They reflect the traditionalvalues of the times, yet they still serve as a socializing tool {{transmitting}} values from onegeneration to the next in today’s society (Gooden and Gooden 2001). Only in the latteryears of the twentieth century has the picturebook become a serious object of academicstudy (Lewis 2001). Researchers began to take notice of the (under-) representation ofwomen in children’s books and asserted commonly that reducing sexism in children’sreading materials is crucial for developing an equitable and democratic society. Although previous research has examined the representation of gender and race inchildren’s literature extensively, there is, however, a major gap, focusing on theportrayal of New Zealand’s indigenous Polynesian people – specifically, the Maoriwoman. Little is known about the visibility of Maori women in print media (Evans 1994) and even less about their depiction in children’s picturebooks. In order to addressthis gap in the literature, this paper investigates the visual and verbal representation ofMaori women in contemporary New Zealand picturebooks. Following the theories ofPeter L. Berger, Thomas Luckmann and George Herbert Mead I developed a modelillustrating the circular process of picturebook communication. Moreover those theoriesserve as a theoretical framework, constituting the subsequent content analysis. As Iexamined the characters of Maori women in different New Zealand picturebooks, Iidentified three typifications, constituting the identity of an indigenous New Zealandwoman in those narratives. The Teacher, the Entertainer and the Spiritual Maori womanreinvent and reproduce, yet delimit and constrain the identity of Maori women incontemporary picturebooks. Those books fail to intertwine and integrate the twodiffering cultures of Maori and Pakeha (New Zealander of European descent), in theirstoryline, and neglect current struggles or conflicts in the social reality of New Zealand. Based on one <b>outstanding</b> book, I <b>drew</b> the conclusion that it is through integrating thetwo differing symbolic universes of Pakeha and Maori into the storyline, that themultiple roles carried by Maori women can be acknowledged and an authentic portrayalof Maori women is achieved...|$|R
