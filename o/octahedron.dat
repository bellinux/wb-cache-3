5|$|Researchers have {{synthesized}} many three-dimensional DNA complexes {{that each}} have the connectivity of a polyhedron, {{such as a}} cube or <b>octahedron,</b> meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex. The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra were very work-intensive, requiring multiple ligations and solid-phase synthesis steps to create catenated polyhedra. Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier. These include a DNA <b>octahedron</b> made from a long single strand designed to fold into the correct conformation, and a tetrahedron that can be produced from four DNA strands in one step, pictured {{at the top of}} this article.|$|E

Two mode behavior was observed for both end-members and all the solid-solution in the vibration of BO_ 6 -type <b>octahedrons,</b> where B indicates Mn, Ta and Nb ions. The coexistence of TaO_ 6 and MnO_ 6 <b>octahedrons</b> in solid solutions, however, resulted in the one-mode behavior, instead of the two-mode one. That is, these two <b>octahedrons</b> represent one-mode behavior...|$|R

5|$|Vanadinite is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions {{at the corners}} of a regular <b>octahedron,</b> with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The <b>octahedron</b> shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms {{at the corners of}} an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds occur {{most often}} as {{euhedral}} or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic {{arrangement of the}} atoms, they have many facets that belong to a cube, <b>octahedron,</b> rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in nyf, an opaque gum-like skin.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation can be {{extended}} to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated <b>octahedron,</b> and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion {{is known as a}} plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.|$|E

In an experiment at the observatory in Wettzell from July to November 2015 these cost-efficient and mobile radar targets were measured with TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight and High-Resolution Spotlight. Applying the geodetic stereo SAR concept, <b>octahedrons</b> are very robust for absolute 3 D positioning through their backscattering in multiple directions. Using <b>octahedrons</b> with as size of 47 cm, we achieve 3 σ standard deviations of about 3 cm for east, north and height components. For individual measurements in Staring Spotlight the standard deviation shows 1. 4 cm in range and 3. 2 cm in azimuth...|$|R

Numerous other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds {{float in the}} background; the four largest are, on the upper left, the compound of cube and octahedron; on the upper right, the stella octangula; on the lower left, a compound of two cubes; and on the lower right, a solid {{version of the same}} <b>octahedron</b> 3-compound. The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the <b>octahedron</b> where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
5|$|Frusciante {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} his friend Omar Rodríguez-López. Along with providing guitar work to The Mars Volta's studio albums, The Bedlam In Goliath and <b>Octahedron,</b> and Rodríguez-López's solo albums Se Dice Bisonte, No Búfalo and Calibration (Is Pushing Luck and Key Too Far), he functioned as executive producer for Rodríguez-López's directorial film debut, The Sentimental Engine Slayer. The film debuted at the Rotterdam Film Festival in February 2010. Along with work on the film, Frusciante and Rodríguez-López have released two collaborative records in May 2010.

5000|$|The {{structure}} of gibbsite is interesting and {{analogous to the}} basic {{structure of}} the micas. The basic structure forms stacked sheets of linked <b>octahedrons</b> of aluminium hydroxide. The <b>octahedrons</b> are composed of aluminium ions with a +3 charge bonded to six octahedrally coordinated hydroxides with a -1 charge. Each of the hydroxides is bonded to only two aluminium atoms because one third of the <b>octahedrons</b> are vacant a central aluminium. The result is a neutral sheet since +3/6 = +1/2 (+3 charge on the aluminiums divided by six hydroxide bonds times the number of aluminiums) and -1/2 = -1/2 (-1 charge on the hydroxides divided between only two aluminiums); thus the charges cancel. The lack of a charge on the gibbsite sheets means that there is no charge to retain ions between the sheets and act as a [...] "glue" [...] to keep the sheets together. The sheets are only held together by weak residual bonds and this results in a very soft easily cleaved mineral.|$|R

25|$|However, {{the equator}} of a Bricard <b>octahedron</b> is not {{required}} to lie in a plane; instead, it can be a skew quadrilateral.

However, for some Bricard octahedra, such as the <b>octahedron</b> with an antiparallelogram equator shown in the illustration, the symmetries of the polyhedron cause its equator to remain planar at all times.|$|E

40|$|VAlO(N) oxynitrides are {{promising}} novel catalysts for the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile. These catalysts are obtained after nitridation of a VAlO oxide precursor in NH 3 {{or during the}} reaction in a NH 3 /C 3 H 8 /O- 2 mixture. The local structure around the vanadium atoms in the oxide precursor and in several catalysts {{that have been used}} in catalytic tests is studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The nitridation in NH 3 was followed with in situ XAS. The oxide precursors have tetrahedral co-ordinated vanadium, while after full nitridation <b>octahedrons</b> are found and a small decrease in vanadium oxidation state occurs. The catalysts used in the ammoxidation reaction consist of a mixture of these tetrahedrons and <b>octahedrons.</b> (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Indium oxide (In 2 O 3) <b>octahedrons</b> and {{nanowires}} were synthesized by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) through selecting appropriate source {{materials and}} controlling proper external conditions.

The vapor pressures of different source materials, the temperature difference between the central heating zones and the product deposition zones, the reaction time, and the surface energies are all responsible for the final crystalline morphologies of the In 2 O 3 nanostructures.
