Lang chose Magdalen; the idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> charge of young men who might in the future achieve positions of responsibility was attractive to him and, in October 1893, with many regrets, he left Leeds.|$|E

It was a suspicion {{that turned out to be}} groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she probably only had months to live.|$|E

5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E
5|$|Although the College {{building}} was saved from the war, its walls and roof {{were left in}} a perilous state.

Eventually {{with the help of}} the Ministry of Works and a public subscription, the {{building was}} repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> possession of Derby Place.

In Game 2 of the 1988 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics, Smith gave up three singles, {{including}} Walt Weiss' game-winning RBI single, in the ninth inning of a tied game. Boston had a 0–2 series deficit going to Oakland. After Boston lost Game 3, Smith surrendered two insurance runs after entering Game 4 with the score 2–1 to complete the four-game sweep.|$|E
5|$|Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, also {{supported}} Richard's seizure of {{the throne of}} England. The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl's allegiance. Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom. From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace. Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north. Northumberland was mollified when he was promised {{he would be the}} Warden of the East March, a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys. He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> a position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard's bid for kingship. However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position. According to Carpenter, although the earl was amply compensated, he despaired of any possibility of advancement under Richard.|$|E

Holkar responded to the Peshwa's call for insurrection against the British by initiating a battle in Mahidpur.|$|E

Meredith is the series' protagonist, and was introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital (later Seattle Grace-Mercy West, and afterwards Grey Sloan Memorial), eventually obtaining {{the position of a}} resident, and later the position of an attending, and in 2015, attaining the Chief of General Surgery position.

5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E

5|$|Stace {{was praised}} for his clarity and ambitious aims in Time and Eternity by Abraham Kaplan who {{believed}} {{the book was}} one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the manner of Samuel Alexander. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.|$|E
5|$|Taxonomy in the Middle Ages {{was largely}} based on the Aristotelian system, with {{additions}} concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included concepts such as the Great chain <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the Western scholastic tradition, again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. Aristotelian system did not classify plants or fungi, {{due to the lack}} of microscope at the time, as his ideas were based on arranging the complete world in a single continuum, as per the scala naturae (the Natural Ladder). This, as well, was taken into consideration in the Great chain of being. Advances were made by scholars such as Procopius, Timotheos of Gaza, Demetrios Pepagomenos, and Thomas Aquinas. Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy.|$|E
