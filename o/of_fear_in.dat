5|$|The {{death of}} Germanicus in dubious {{circumstances}} greatly affected Tiberius' popularity in Rome, {{leading to the}} creation of a climate <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> Rome itself. Also suspected of connivance in his death was Tiberius' chief advisor, Sejanus, who would, in the 20s, create an atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> Roman noble and administrative circles by the use of treason trials and the role of delatores, or informers.|$|E

Although Amnesty International in 2003 found considerable improvement in the human rights situation, attributed to a ceasefire and peace talks {{between the government and the}} LTTE, by 2007 they reported an escalation in political killings, child recruitment, abductions, and armed clashes, which created a climate <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> the north and east of the country.|$|E

40|$|Extinction <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> {{conditioning}} <b>in</b> {{animals is}} an excellent model for the study <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> inhibition <b>in</b> humans. Substantial evidence has shown that extinction is a new learning process that is highly context-dependent. Several recovery effects (renewal, spontaneous recovery, and reinstatement) after extinction suggest that the contextual modulation of extinction is a critical behavioral mechanism underlying <b>fear</b> extinction. <b>In</b> addition, recent studies demonstrate a critical role for hippocampus in the context control of extinction. A {{growing body of evidence}} suggests that the hippocampus not only plays a role in contextual encoding and retrieval <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> extinction memories, but also interacts with other brain structures to regulate context-specificity <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> extinction. <b>In</b> this article, the authors will first discuss the fundamental behavioral features of the context effects of extinction and its underlying behavioral mechanisms. In the second part, the review will focus on the brain mechanisms for the contextual control of extinction. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
25|$|One {{political}} theorist, James Blight, has {{analyzed the}} behavior of EXCOMM's members {{in the midst of}} the impending crisis with the Soviet Union. He suggests that the thought of war with the Soviet Union instilled a sense <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> the committee members so that their deliberations became more productive as they reacted to this emotion. Blight argues that EXCOMM's focus of attention shifted: as the possibility of war with the Soviet Union became more probable, the committee members became less concerned with removing the missiles from Cuba and instead focused their energy on avoiding a nuclear war.|$|E
25|$|Sejanus {{created an}} {{atmosphere}} <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> Rome, controlling {{a network of}} informers and spies whose incentive to accuse others of treason was {{a share in the}} accused's property after their conviction and death. Treason trials became commonplace; few members of the Roman aristocracy were safe. The trials played up to Tiberius' growing paranoia, which made him more reliant on Sejanus, as well as allowing Sejanus to eliminate potential rivals. Victims of this reign of terror related to the imperial family included Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus, second husband of Tiberius' first wife Vipsania, who had since died, Decimus Haterius Agrippa, grandson of Agrippa and husband of Augustus' great-niece, Quinctilius Varus.|$|E
25|$|Sometime in May 1832 a Methodist {{minister}} {{and his wife}} disappeared and were subsequently tied to a tree and executed by burning by a band of Potawatomi. Also in May an attack at Holderman's Grove killed another minister, Adam Payne, and an attack at Hollenbeck's Grove drove numerous residents out of the area. In another attack, just before the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, a German immigrant named Henry Apple {{was killed in a}} Kickapoo ambush. At Ament's Cabin, near present-day Bureau County, Illinois, an attack left early settler Elijah Phillips dead. Together with other incidents during the war, these attacks helped contribute to an atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> the region during the war.|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major: Psychology. Advisor: Shmuel Lissek, Ph. D. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 123 pages. A {{review of the}} literature demonstrates a lack of research on fear-generalization processes in many anxiety disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Chapter 2 represents the first study that attempted to investigate the generalization <b>of</b> conditioned <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> individuals with obsessive-compulsive traits using startle EMG and behavioral measures. The results of this study demonstrated that individuals with high levels of Threat Estimation as measured by the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ- 44) displayed overgeneralization <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> responses to a greater range of stimuli resembling the danger cue than those with low levels of Threat Estimation. In addition, despite etiological theories proposing that fear conditioning and overgeneralization <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> play prominent roles in the development and maintenance of PTSD, little research had been done on the neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to <b>fear</b> conditioning processes <b>in</b> PTSD patients and none have been specifically conducted on generalization. Chapter 3 investigated the neurobiological substrates associated with the overgeneralization <b>of</b> conditioned <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> PTSD patients using behavioral, skin conductance, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures. This study provides evidence that PTSD patients demonstrate overgeneralization <b>of</b> conditioned <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral insula, left and right caudate, left inferior parietal lobule, and right superior frontal gyrus. This body of work provides novel evidence regarding the generalization <b>of</b> conditioned <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> OCD and PTSD...|$|R

25|$|Captain Charles Brown, {{in command}} of the settlers, was ordered to march down the coast until he reached the rear of the Māori {{positions}} at Waireka. The Regulars, under Lieut-Colonel G.F. Murray, marched down the main road to Omata, intending to dislodge a war party reported to be at Whalers Gate, north of Omata. Once the road was clear, it was intended they would be joined by the Volunteers and militia, who would rescue the settlers, before marching back to New Plymouth. Because of the heightened state <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>in</b> New Plymouth, however, Murray had been ordered to return his troops to the town before nightfall. The Volunteers were armed with muzzle-loading Enfield rifles and the militia had old smooth-bore muskets from the 1840s, with each man issued with just 30 rounds of ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Deterrence: Theories of {{deterrence}} claim that by sentencing criminals to extremely harsh penalties, {{other people who}} might be considering criminal activities will be so terrified of the consequences that they will choose not to commit crimes out <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> <b>In</b> reality, most studies show that high incarceration rates either increase crime, have no noticeable effect, or only decrease it by a very small amount. Prisons act as training grounds for criminal activity, form criminal social networks, expose prisoners to further abuse (both from staff and other prisoners), foster anti-social sentiments towards society (law enforcement and corrections personnel in particular), fragment communities, and leave prisoners with criminal records that make it difficult to find legal employment after release. All of these things can result in a higher likelihood of reoffending upon release.|$|E

500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985.
