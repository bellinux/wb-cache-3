40|$|This {{work has}} {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} different <b>oil</b> <b>ageing</b> mechanisms which typically occur in diesel vehicles (thermooxidative breakdown and particle contamination) on engine lubricant properties and their subsequent influence on the filtration of the combined or colloidal (i. e. solid and liquid particles) aerosol, using fibrous filters. Oil viscosity was found to increase with increasing soot contamination and decrease with thermooxidative breakdown of the oil. Filtration tests showed that the pressure drop across the filter correlated strongly with oil viscosity and increased linearly with increasing soot content in the oil. Concurrent to the laboratory work, a field test using 15 diesel vehicles was conducted. The vehicles were equipped with test filters identical to the laboratory test filters and were used for approximately 6 months without oil change. The filters were then analysed and {{it was found that}} the final pressure drop also increased linearly with the soot content in the filter. A comparative analysis showed a good agreement in pressure drop, filter saturation and filter efficiency between laboratory and field test filters, for similar soot contents. It was found that the use of artificial <b>oil</b> <b>ageing,</b> combined with a discontinuous filtration method developed previously allowed reproduction (in the laboratory) of the filtration processes which occur in vehicle closed crankcase ventilation (CCV) systems. This therefore allowed “realistic” CCV tests to be conducted in a laboratory.

40|$|Recent trends to {{downsize}} diesel engines {{have increased the}} stress on lubricants. Oils naturally degrade during operation, undergoing continual reactions, changing chemically and physically, detracting in performance from initial specifications. This thesis investigates the role of fuel in the ageing of diesel engine oils, specifically Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel (ULSD) and Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME – a common European biodiesel). <b>Oil</b> <b>ageing</b> is assessed distinctly with fuel dilution, the entrainment of exhaust gases; {{and the effects of}} soot loading. Results show fuel dilution has the greatest influence on oil performance. Effects are seen with an instant ‘dilution’ of properties, with the resultant blend performing as an amalgam of the fluids. This can be both positive and negative, depending on the property being measured, with the entrainment of biodiesel generally beneficial. The entrainment of exhaust gases in the oil leads to increased unburnt hydrocarbons and fuel content, with similar dilution effects. Soot loaded oil performance is heavily dependent on the respective fuel content. RME contamination has a positive influence which far outweighs its negligible soot production, whereas ULSD detracts from oil performance, also producing more soot. During an equivalent timeframe, the influence of RME is less detrimental than ULSD on overall performance...|$|E

40|$|Molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamates (MoDTCs) {{are very}} {{effective}} friction modifier additives {{for use in}} engine oils and other lubricants. However, as engine oils age during extended drain intervals, MoDTCs can lose {{some or all of}} their ability to reduce friction and this is generally believed to result from their oxidative degradation. In this study, MoDTC solutions in base oil have been subjected to <b>oil</b> <b>ageing</b> in a controlled NOx/air flow rate, controlled temperature test apparatus and the effect of ageing on the ability of the MoDTC to reduce friction has been explored. As shown in previous studies, the additive’s friction-reducing properties are completely lost after a quite short period of ageing at 160 °C. However, it was found that at this temperature the presence of NOx has little if any influence on the rate of friction loss, indicating that the latter is controlled primarily by the rate of reaction of oxygen with the base oil and thus the rate of consumption of MoDTC as a peroxide decomposer. By contrast, when ageing tests are carried out at lower temperatures it is found that NOx has a very strong effect on the rate at which MoDTC loses its ability to reduce friction, so that at 100 °C NOx accelerates this rate by two orders of magnitude compared to air alone. This suggests that at low temperatures the rate at which MoDTC is consumed is controlled by its reaction as a radical inhibitor with NOx species...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} hydraulic system performance using vegetable-based palm oil as hydraulic fluid. Design/methodology/approach - The hydraulic system performance test at different operating conditions, such as pressure, speed and <b>oil</b> <b>ageing,</b> was performed using a Yuken vane pump test rig. The endurance system performance test was also conducted for 200 and 400 h. The effect of speed on flow slip coefficient in discrete and continuous tests was studied. In discrete testing, pressure of 35 and 200 bar and speed of 750 and 1, 439 rpm were used in determining flow slip coefficient. The instantaneous data were recorded in a computer using an analog-to-digital data acquisition system with respect to time and the parameters stored were reservoir temperature, return line temperature, suction and delivery pressures, instantaneous flow rate, total flow, total running time and torque. The obtained results were interpolated for future prediction of the system performance. Findings - The experimental and interpolated results showed that slip coefficient decreases with increasing pump speed. The effect of aging condition on volumetric efficiency showed that the efficiency increases with aging period due to increase in oil viscosity. Practical implications - This vegetable-based palm oil could be a potentially useful substitute for mineral-based energy transport media such as hydraulic fluid. Originality/value - The investigation of hydraulic system performance using palm oil as hydraulic fluid is scarce in the literature. Therefore, the current study is quite new for the hydraulic system performance and it is hoped that it will provide a high value to researchers for further research before it can be used as hydraulic fluid...|$|E
40|$|An {{engine oil}} is capable {{reliably}} and longtime to perform specified functions {{only in the}} case when its properties correspond to those thermal, mechanical and chemical impacts to which the oil is subjected in the engine. Compatibility of the engine design, its uprate and oil properties {{is one of the}} main conditions for provision of high operational reliability. Type and properties of fuel, quality of an engine oil, engine type, its design, its health, its operational regime and conditions and a number of other factors influence on intensity of oil contamination in the operated engine. Oil quality is deteriorated due to accumulation of incomplete combustion products in it and this process is associated with the engine's health. This leads to reduction of viscosity, deterioration of lubrication ability, troubles in fluid friction mode. Combustion products have rather high amount of aggressive corrosive oxides. Service-life of engine oil prior to its change is determined not only by automobile mileage or tractor operating time but also by the period of time within which this work has been carried out. Corrosion processes are speeding up, protective processes are worsening, <b>oil</b> <b>ageing</b> is accelerating when vehicles have short daily and small mileages.
