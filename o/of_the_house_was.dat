5|$|Henry Strachey, the 2nd Baronet, was {{appointed}} High Sheriff of Somerset in 1832 and Edward Strachey the 3rd Baronet High Sheriff in 1864. In 1858 much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> remodelled for the 3rd Baronet by Thomas Henry Wyatt.|$|E
5|$|The colour scheme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> beige, which {{included}} a beige piano. Chanel may have been assisted in her design of the interior of La Pausa by Stéphane Boudin, {{the president of the}} interior design firm Maison Jansen.|$|E
5|$|The {{owners of}} the house are also unknown, but two records do exist. The 1854 Baker map of New London, listed owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> Captain J. Avery. An 1868 map lists a H. Bennett in residence. After the {{rehabilitation}} of the property, the Avery House became the Hopeville Park manager's residence.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> order; <b>The</b> blessing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> contentment; <b>The</b> glory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> hospitality; <b>The</b> crown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> godliness.

50|$|The {{office was}} created in 1951 by the Prime Minister at the time, Robert Menzies. <b>The</b> Leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> and <b>the</b> Deputy Leader are {{appointed}} by the Prime Minister. Since 18 September 2013, Leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> has <b>been</b> Christopher Pyne, and the current Deputy Leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> Luke Hartsuyker. <b>The</b> duties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deputy Leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> largely contingent, coming into play only when <b>the</b> Leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> absent from <b>the</b> <b>House</b> or <b>is</b> on leave, {{when he or she}} is referred to as Acting Leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b>|$|R

5|$|Boughton Monchelsea Place, {{previously}} Boughton Court, is a 16th-century {{country house}} in Boughton Monchelsea, Kent, England. The first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> built by Robert Rudston circa 156775 {{on the site}} of an earlier manor house. It has been modified a number of times during its history achieving its present form in 1819. It has been a home to a number of members of parliament for Maidstone or for Kent, including Sir Francis Barnham (owner 161346), Sir Robert Barnham (164685) Sir Barnham Rider (16981728) and Thomas Rider (180547).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{successive}} remodelings and enlargements {{the architecture}} at Ashton Court {{is complex and}} seldom what it seems. The core of the house, a 15th-century manor, has been obliterated by later wings, which have in turn been remodelled and altered, most substantially around 1635. Therefore, the plan of the house has evolved as irregular with many juxtapositions and little cohesion; while the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> built in the 17th century, a time of classical architecture, remodelling and alteration to the fenestration has created an overall Gothic appearance.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} by the family that a new and far grander house would be built, using the money that the Wrights had earned through their inventions and business. Called affectionately Hawthorn Hill, {{building}} had begun in the Dayton suburb of Oakwood, Ohio, while Wilbur was in Europe. Katharine and Orville oversaw the project in his absence. Wilbur's one known expression upon the design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> that he have a room and bathroom of his own. The brothers hired Schenck and Williams, an architectural firm, to design the house, along with input from both Wilbur and Orville. Wilbur did not live to see its completion in 1914.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 <b>the</b> {{remaining}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{estate and}} <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{sold to a}} group of local businessmen, who formed Alton Towers Limited. Although <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> sold off, <b>the</b> grounds were restored and remained open to <b>the</b> public. Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> converted into cafés and toilets for public use.|$|R
50|$|The first aerial {{pictures}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>were</b> {{released by}} <b>the</b> Daily Star magazine {{as early as}} mid-May. On 5 June, pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>were</b> released. Rooms revealed were the entrance, living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and the garden.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> three-storey octagonal tower {{that gave the}} owners a panoramic view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and the surrounding landscape. At <b>the</b> rear portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> a rounded balcony adjacent to the master bedroom.|$|R
5|$|Mrs Smith's Cottage is a {{mid-19th century}} Grade II listed {{building}} made from early Victorian red bricks. The range, the heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>was</b> in daily use for cooking and heating until the mid-1990s. The only {{access to the}} bedrooms is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap – installed to prevent the local council condemning the cottage in the late 1970s – and an inside toilet. The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed.|$|E
5|$|The Mao {{family lived}} in a clay-brick {{farmhouse}} which had been constructed in 1878, although Yichang oversaw its extension during Zedong's boyhood. They occupied the eastern wing of their house, with the neighboring Zou family living in the western half. The building was large enough for Zedong to be allocated his own bedroom; a rarity at the time. In front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> a pond and a rice paddy, while pine and bamboo groves grew behind the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} by Charles Payne, an engraver {{who founded the}} firm of Payne & Taylor for calico printers in 1849. In 1849, Payne becan to purchase parcels of land that he would later construct the house on. The main block <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> erected in 1855–1856 and later expanded with a north wing in the mid-1870s. The final major addition was an ell {{on the west side}} of the house, the date of construction occurred prior to 1902. Though the house has been the subject of some alterations, these changes are largely inconspicuous.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> date <b>of</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> 1901 as {{inscribed in}} a wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> two story. <b>The</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> made <b>of</b> wood which sits on a low stone pedestal. This method of {{construction}} suggest that <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> originally located in <b>the</b> other part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town then transferred piece by piece on its present site.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1974 and 2010, the neighborhood's {{population}} {{changed in}} several respects. In 1974 <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>housed</b> about 2,000 people and about 5% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> vacant. [...] In 2010, the neighborhood's population {{had declined to}} about 800 people and about 25% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> vacant.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{foundations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>are</b> made <b>of</b> cut stone, {{while the}} rear wing's foundation {{is made of}} rubble stone interfiled with cement. <b>The</b> outer walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>are</b> made <b>of</b> red brick. <b>The</b> porches are made of wood and painted white.|$|R
5|$|The main barn is {{oriented}} on a north–south axis and has {{a conventional}} bent framing and sheathed with vertical boards. It is believed that {{the addition of a}} cupola with a hip roof may have been a later addition to the barn. Photos dating from 1870 confirm its age, but the date of construction for the barn cannot be determined, but it may date from the 18th century. The former ell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> converted in a shed and dates to around 1780.|$|E
5|$|The street {{contained}} {{two other}} architecturally important residences. Schomberg House, at Nos.80–82 Pall Mall {{was built in}} 1698 for Meinhardt Schomberg, 3rd Duke of Schomberg and divided into three parts in 1769. The eastern section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> demolished in 1850, but reconstructed in the mid-1950s for office use. Buckingham House was the London residence of the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos. It was rebuilt in the 1790s by Sir John Soane and sold by the Buckingham estate in 1847. The house was demolished in 1908 {{to make way for}} the Royal Automobile Club.|$|E
5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E
50|$|Facing {{the church}} is Grade II listed Church Farm. <b>The</b> central part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> Elizabethan, with later Georgian additions, {{including}} larger windows. <b>The</b> south wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> constructed in <b>the</b> same manner, and is the same age as, the 13th-century church tower.|$|R

5|$|By 1799, the {{original}} house at Luscombe had been demolished, and work began {{on a new}} house for Hoare in 1800. The house was designed by John Nash, who was a pioneer for the Gothic Revival style. In his early drawings for the house, Repton suggested two sketches to Hoare; one of a more standard house, {{and the other with}} the more natural design which would settle into the landscape. The latter was chosen and the final design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> based upon Downton Castle, but with an asymmetrical plan to experience the panoramic views around the house. It was Nash's first attempt at a Gothic castle design and he would subsequently create several further houses in the same style.|$|E
5|$|By 1853 {{a service}} range {{had been added}} to the south wing of the house. In 1868 the {{external}} flight of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a Norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed {{to the north of the}} Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> levelled and formal gardens were established.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Rowan began {{construction}} of Federal Hill, his family estate, on land that his father-in-law gave {{him as a}} wedding present. Due to limited financial resources, {{the time required to}} import building materials from the east, and the craftsmanship required to construct the large home, the mansion was not completed until 1818. After a fire destroyed the log cabin in which the Rowans lived in 1812, they moved into the part of the mansion that was completed, and continued to live there while construction on the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> finished. Federal Hill was once {{believed to be the first}} brick house constructed in the state of Kentucky, but more contemporary sources give the designation to the William Whitley House, also known as Sportsman's Hill, which was completed in 1794 near Crab Orchard, Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|If {{you happen}} to observe carefully, not only <b>the</b> outer {{surfaces}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>are</b> washed in white, but <b>the</b> inner walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>are</b> white as well.

5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine (1694–1749) oversaw a remodelling {{of the north}} of the house, that added a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms to the {{pediment}} of the north facade. In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James Townsend, the narrow east facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance. An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground floor, with a library and billiard room on the first floor.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, at the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>was</b> a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, {{as is often the case}} in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E
