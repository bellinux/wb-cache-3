40|$|The main {{thrust of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the development}} and effectiveness <b>of</b> a <b>pastoral</b> counseling center in an African-American church. Prior to the development <b>of</b> this <b>pastoral</b> counseling center, there were none in an African-American church in the southeast. This document seeks to link the need for pastoral counseling centers to the rich history of care offered by the African-American Church. A consideration of theological issues regarding pastoral counseling and developing pastoral counseling centers is offered in this dissertation. Also, a look at liberation as being the aim of theology is presented. In addition, the theology <b>of</b> the <b>pastoral</b> counselor who developed this center {{can be found in}} this dissertation. The factors to be considered when developing a pastoral counseling center in an African-American church are offered in this dissertation. The organizational structure and methodology of this center are also elaborated upon in the document. Included is a description of the various individuals who were directly involved in the development <b>of</b> the <b>pastoral</b> counseling center. Additionally, a description of the church where the center was developed is given which includes a demographic study of the community, a historical view of the host church, and a description of the city where the church is located. To ascertain the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>pastoral</b> counseling center, interviews with the senior pastor, the ministerial staff, the advisory committee, and selected clients were conducted. A summary of services rendered at the center over a one-year period is presented in the dissertation. Finally, a comprehensive look at the training and the process of certification <b>of</b> a <b>pastoral</b> counselor is documented. The training <b>of</b> a <b>pastoral</b> counselor is linked to the development and effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>pastoral</b> counseling center. There is also given a general theory of the development <b>of</b> a <b>pastoral</b> counseling center in an African-American church...|$|R
5|$|Originally {{slated for}} a {{theatrical}} release in November 2007, its release date was postponed, and it received a wide theatrical release on May 30, 2008. It grossed $82.4 {{million at the}} box office worldwide. Although a box office hit, it received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere and tension, and others criticizing its script and characters. Contemporary film scholars have interpreted the film as a criticism of the perceived safety <b>of</b> <b>pastoral</b> life, as well as an exploration of stranger-on-stranger violence.|$|E
5|$|When this happened, Soegijapranata was in Europe {{to attend}} the Second Vatican Council {{as part of the}} Central Preparatory Commission; he was one of eleven diocesan bishops and archbishops from Asia. He was able {{to attend the}} first session, where he voiced {{concerns}} about declining quality <b>of</b> <b>pastoral</b> work and called for the modernisation of the Church. He then returned to Indonesia, but his health, poor since the late 1950s, quickly declined.|$|E
5|$|Yet if the Benedictine reforms {{dominate}} the sources from this period, their wider impact {{should not be}} overstressed: large areas of England were affected only minimally, if at all.

5|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} {{books of}} the Bhagavata Purana are widely {{considered to be a}} poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism <b>of</b> <b>pastoral</b> life found in the Harivamsa. Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (lila), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king. Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in Harivamsa, but is a symbolic universe in the Bhagavata Purana, where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The Bhagavata Purana manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.|$|E
5|$|The crosier was {{displayed}} {{as a symbol}} <b>of</b> <b>pastoral</b> jurisdiction by bishops, abbots, abbesses, and cardinals {{even if they were}} not bishops. The crosier of a bishop is turned outward or to the right. Frequently the crosier of an abbot or abbess is turned inward, either toward the mitre or to the left, but this distinction is disputed and is not an absolute rule. Pope Alexander VII decreed in 1659 that the crosiers of abbots include a sudarium or veil, but this is not customary in English heraldry. The veil may have arisen because abbots, unlike bishops, did not wear gloves when carrying an actual crosier. Because the cross has similar symbolism, the crosier was suppressed for cardinals and bishops by the Catholic Church in 1969, and is now used only on some corporate arms, and the personal arms of abbots and some abbesses. In English custom and in the Anglican Churches, two crosiers are often found crossed in saltire behind the shield. In the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the crosier is displayed in the arms of bishops in office but is removed when a bishop retires.|$|E
