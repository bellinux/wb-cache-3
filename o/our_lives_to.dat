2500|$|Critics {{originally}} {{praised the}} show for its non-reliance on nostalgia (in contrast to shows such as As the World Turns) and its portrayal of [...] "real American contemporary families." [...] By the 1970s, critics deemed Days of <b>Our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>to</b> be the most daring daytime drama, leading the way in using themes other shows of the period would not dare touch, such as artificial insemination and interracial romance. [...] The January 12, 1976 cover of Time magazine featured Days of Our Lives Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes, the only daytime actors ever to appear on its cover. The Hayeses themselves were a couple whose on-screen and real-life romance (they met on the series in 1970 and married in 1974) was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press.|$|E

2500|$|The Tunnel Rats {{performed}} at churches throughout Southern California, and eventually throughout the Northeast and Deep South. While the group found some acceptance from progressive church leaders, {{who thought that}} hip-hop might {{be a way to}} reach youth, many church leaders took issue with the group's style, which fell somewhere between battle rapping and street preaching, and accused the group of sinfully glorifying their rapping skills as opposed to glorifying God. In addition, the group, consisting predominantly of Mexicans, encountered prejudice when performing in the South. Reynosa recounts how one night in Mississippi, an establishment would not serve the group because some of the members were Mexican. When they went to a Motel 6, member Redbonz screamed [...] "WHY?" [...] continuously into a pillow. [...] "He couldn't believe that we had given up <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> minister the gospel through rap music and ... had nothing.

2500|$|Days of Our Lives {{had been}} losing viewers in early 2000. The show managed to lure back James E. Reilly, {{who had left}} the show in 1997 to create his own soap opera, Passions.

Next, viewers saw 34-year veteran recovering alcoholic Maggie Horton (Suzanne Rogers) get bludgeoned to death with a wine bottle. The next murder is when Caroline Brady (Peggy McCay) is poisoned. Viewers then saw bad girl Cassie Brady (Alexis Thorpe) fall out of a Halloween pinata with stab wounds. [...] Marlena's ex-husband, Roman Brady (Josh Taylor) is murdered at his wedding to Kate Roberts. At the Horton circus, the serial killer releases a tiger (named Horton), and sets him loose on Tony DiMera.
