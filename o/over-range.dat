A field sampling which covered 10 stations was conducted at the outer and inner boundary of KWNP in August 2011 during high tide. Physico-chemical water parameters were recorded. Triplicate of near bottom water samples were collected using 2. 5 L Van don water sampler (Wildco®) for further analyses of nutrient, chlorophyll a (chl a), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS). The aimed {{of the study were}} to assess the water quality of KWNP and to determine the distribution pattern of physico-chemical components and its relationship to the phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentrations in water between the outer and inner part of KWNP. One-way analyses of similarity indicated that all the study sites were significantly different between stations (p-value < 0. 05) and boundaries (p-value < 0. 05).

The migration of adult birds lasted from mid-July to mid-September with a peak in the second decade of July. At the beginning, females were more numerous than males, then on the turn of July males outnumbered females. The proportion of females increased again {{in the second half}} of August and decreased in September. First young Bar-tailed Godwits arrived in small number in the third decade of July, but their regu-lar migration started in mid-August (single young birds were seen until the end of Novem-ber). The total numbers of migrants differed between seasons, reaching highest values every third year, which may have corresponded with lemming cycles on breeding grounds of the species. Low numbers of Bar-tailed Godwits stopping at the Gulf of Gdaæsk coast together with short length of stay and low number of retraps of adult birds proved that southern coast of the Baltic Sea was only an emergency stopover site for this species. Values of adults meas-urements were generally larger than those of juveniles what is connected with growth process still lasting in young birds.

40|$|The first fiber Bragg grating (FBG) {{accelerometer}} using direct transverse {{forces is}} demonstrated by fixing the FBG by its two ends and placing a transversely moving inertial object at its middle. It is very sensitive because a lightly stretched FBG is more sensitive to transverse forces than axial forces. Its resonant frequency and static sensitivity are analyzed by the classic spring-mass theory, assuming the axial force changes little. The experiments show that the theory can be modified for cases where the assumption does not hold. The resonant frequency can be modified by a linear relationship experimentally achieved, and the static sensitivity by an alternative method proposed. The principles of the <b>over-range</b> protection and low cross axial sensitivity are achieved by limiting {{the movement of the}} FBG and were validated experimentally.

(The characterizations focused on phase structure, sintering behavior, relative density, electrical conductivity and thermal expansion.) The XRD analysis indicates that a pure orthorhombic perovskite phase was obtained for all the samples. Cell volume decreases as x increases from 0 to 0. 10. The Y 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 Cr 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 O 3 -δ (YCCZ 10) powder exhibited the best sintering ability, and a relative density of 96. 6 % could be obtained for the sample sintered at 1400 °C for 4 h in air. The electrical conductivities of the specimens increase with the Zn 2 + content at x ≤ 0. 10, but then remarkably decrease at x = 0. 15, which might relate to the <b>over-range</b> of the substitution amount of Zn (0. 15) for Cr position. YCCZ 10 shows a remarkable electrical conductivity of 20. 9 S cm- 1 at 850 °C in air, and a very suitable thermal expansion coefficient value of 10. 8 × 10 - 6 K- 1 (YSZ: ∼ 10. 8 × 10 - 6 K- 1).

It is shown {{that some of}} the most widely used area allocation schemes are suboptimal and that significant improvements in parametric yield can be achieved with less intuitive area allocation approaches such as the optimal and near-optimal area allocation methods introduced in this work. Simulations and experimental results are presented which show quantitatively what improvements in yield can be achieved with improved area allocation strategies for resistive feedback amplifiers and R- 2 R DACs;A strategy to optimize the power consumption in a class of digitally calibrated pipelined ADCs with a kT/C noise constraint is proposed. This optimization is based upon making tradeoffs between the kT/C noise budgeted in each stage, the number of stages, and the number of comparators in each stage. It is shown that significant reductions in total power consumption can be achieved with optimal noise distribution and bit/stage allocation;Existing approaches for the design of interstage switched-capacitor amplifiers used in pipelined data converters have evolved following the notion that there are firm limits on input range and output range of the amplifier.

40|$|Flash Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), {{targeting}} {{optical communication}} standards, {{have been reported}} in SiGe BiCMOS technology. CMOS implementation of such designs faces two challenges. The first is to achieve a high sampling speed, given the lower gain-bandwidth (lower ft) of CMOS technology. The second challenge is to handle the wide bandwidth of the input signal with a certain accuracy. Although the first problem can be relaxed by using the time-interleaved architecture, the second problem remains as a main obstacle to CMOS implementation. As a result, the feasibility of the CMOS implementation of ADCs for such applications, or other wide band applications, depends primarily on achieving a very small input capacitance (large bandwidth) at the desired accuracy. In the flash architecture, the input capacitance is traded off for the achievable accuracy. This tradeoff becomes tighter with technology scaling. An effective way to ease this tradeoff is to use resistive offset averaging. This permits the use of smaller area transistors, leading to a reduction in the ADC input capacitance. In addition, interpolation can be used to decrease the input capacitance of flash ADCs. In an interpolating architecture, the number of ADC input preamplifiers is reduced significantly, and a resistor network interpolates the missing zero-crossings needed for an N-bit conversion. The resistive network also averages out the preamplifiers offsets. Consequently, an interpolating network works also as an averaging network. The resistor network used for averaging or interpolation causes a systematic non-linearity at the ADC transfer characteristics edges. The common solution to this problem is to extend the preamplifiers array beyond the input signal voltage range by using dummy preamplifiers. However, this demands a corresponding extension of the flash ADC reference-voltage resistor ladder. Since the voltage headroom of the reference ladder {{is considered to be a}} main bottleneck in the implementation of flash ADCs in deep-submicron technologies with reduced supply voltage, extending the reference voltage beyond the input voltage range is highly undesirable. The principal objective of this thesis is to develop a new circuit technique to enhance the bandwidth-accuracy product of flash ADCs. Thus, first, a rigorous analysis of flash ADC architectures accuracy-bandwidth tradeoff is presented. It is demonstrated that the interpolating architecture achieves a superior accuracy compared to that of a full flash architecture for the same input capacitance, and hence would lead to a higher bandwidth-accuracy product, especially in deep-submicron technologies that use low power supplies. Also, the gain obtained, when interpolation is employed, is quantified. In addition, the limitations of a previous claim, which suggests that an interpolating architecture is equivalent to an averaging full flash architecture that trades off accuracy for the input capacitance, is presented. Secondly, a termination technique for the averaging/interpolation network of flash ADC preamplifiers is devised. The proposed technique maintains the linearity of the ADC at the transfer characteristics edges and cancels out the <b>over-range</b> voltage, consumed by the dummy preamplifiers. This makes flash ADCs more amenable for integration in deep-submicron CMOS technologies. In addition, the elimination of this <b>over-range</b> voltage allows a larger least-significant bit. As a result, a higher input referred offset is tolerated, and a significant reductions in the ADC input capacitance and power dissipation are achieved at the same accuracy. Unlike a previous solution, the proposed technique does not introduce negative transconductance at flash ADC preamplifiers array edges. As a result, the offset averaging technique can be used efficiently. To prove the resulting saving in the ADC input capacitance and power dissipation that is attained by the proposed termination technique, a 6 -bit 1. 6 -GS/s flash ADC test chip is designed and implemented in 0. 13 -μm CMOS technology. The ADC consumes 180 mW from a 1. 5 -V supply and achieves a Signal-to-Noise-plus-Distortion Ratio (SNDR) of 34. 5 dB and 30 dB at 50 -MHz and 1450 -MHz input signal frequency, respectively.

The simulation {{results showed that the}} optimal area ratio for cultivation pond and purification pond was 20. 5 to meet the Ⅲ type surface water standard. It was reduced by 3. 1 %, 6. 3 % and 10. 0 % for TN concentration and by 4. 2 %, 8. 3 % and 8. 3 % for TP concentration in the cultivation pond with a substitution of commercial feeds for 5 %, 10 % and 15 %, respectively. TN concentration was decreased by 4. 5 %, 10. 1 % and 14. 6 % in the purification pond with a substitution of commercial feeds for 5 %, 10 % and 15 %, respectively. Water quality regulation technology did not affect TN and TP concentration in the cultivation and purification ponds. Compared with one time's harvest for water hyacinth, it was reduced 10. 0 % and 10. 0 % for TN concentration and 11. 1 % and 11. 1 % for TP concentration in the cultivation pond by harvest two times and three times, respectively.

40|$|Out-of-band noise (OBN) is {{troublesome}} in analog circuits {{that process}} {{the output of}} a noise-shaping audio DAC. It causes slewing in amplifiers and aliasing in sampling circuits like ADCs and class-D amplifiers. Nonlinearity in these circuits also causes cross-modulation of the OBN into the audio band. These mechanisms lead to a higher noise level and more distortion in the audio band. OBN also leads to interference in the LF and MF band, compromising e. g. AM radio reception. To avoid these problems, it is desired to reduce OBN power to below - 60 dBFS. An active low-pass filter after the DAC output can reduce the OBN power to acceptable levels, but this solution is expensive in terms of power consumption and chip area. A FIR-DAC approach implements a 1 b PWM modulator, followed by a semi-digital low-pass FIR reconstruction filter. It achieves high-end audio performance with sufficiently low OBN, but the FIR structure costs area, adds latency, and (like an analog low-pass filter) inherently limits the maximum output signal frequency. Multi-bit noise shapers employ smaller quantization steps and therefore output lower OBN. A cascaded-modulator architecture can directly be followed by an on-chip amplifier without low-pass filtering. However, with only 330 quantization levels, it still cannot achieve the desired - 60 dBFS OBN without additional filtering. Moreover, this approach requires complex dynamic-element matching (DEM) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) shaping mechanisms. The paper present an approach that reduces OBN to below - 60 dBFS with minimal increase in power and area consumption. It consists of two paths. The main path {{is based on the}} work of van Tuijl et al. (2004), containing a 128 × oversampled 5 b 3 rd-order noise shaper, thermometer decoder and real-time DEM algorithm followed by a current DAC. Since the digital noise shaper generates negligible in-band noise products, the error signal of the noise shaper is practically equal to the OBN. This err- r signal is integrated (as part of the loop filter), quantized and fed to a correction path with a differentiating DAC (DIFF-DAC). This DAC inverts the integration action, obtaining unity signal transfer. The output currents of both paths are subtracted, reducing OBN significantly. Quantization noise of the correction path is shaped because the error signal is differentiated after quantization. Depending on the shape of the noise transfer function of the main DAC, the DIFF-DAC needs an <b>over-range</b> in order to accommodate the increased signal swing caused by the integration action. Still, area and power cost is minimal because the range of the DIFF-DAC is still only a fraction of the main DAC range...|$|E
