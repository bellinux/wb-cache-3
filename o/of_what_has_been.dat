5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, {{in the context of}} male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Riga summit or the 19th NATO Summit was a NATO summit {{held in the}} Olympic Sports Centre, Riga, Latvia from 28 to 29 November 2006. The most {{important}} topics discussed were the War in Afghanistan and the future role and borders of the alliance. Further, the summit focused on the alliance's continued transformation, taking stock <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> accomplished since the 2002 Prague Summit. NATO also committed itself to extend further membership invitations in the upcoming 2008 Bucharest Summit. This summit was the first NATO summit held on territory of a former USSR republic.|$|E
5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win}} the stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E

25|$|Selah {{is used in}} Iyaric Rastafarian vocabulary. It can {{be heard}} {{at the end of}} spoken-word {{segments}} of some reggae songs. Its usage here, again, is to accentuate the magnitude and importance <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> said, and often is a sort of substitute for Amen. Notable, according to Rastafarian faith, is also the word's similarity with the incarnated god and savior Selassie (Ethiopia's former emperor Haile Selassie).|$|E

25|$|Many analysts {{considered}} that, {{in order}} to secure the approval of this reform, Uribe may have slacked on his campaign promises, because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> perceived as his indirect bribing of congressmen, through the alleged assignment of their relatives to the diplomatic corps and through promises of investment in their regions of origin. Uribe's supporters consider that no actual bribing took place, and that a consensus among the diverse sectors that back Uribe's policies in Congress had to be reached through political negotiation.|$|E
25|$|Intruding these {{rocks in}} central Palawan (Cleopatra's Needle area) and {{northern}} Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite).

In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic magmatism and basaltic magmatism are both expressions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading magmatism that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} significant find {{from this period}} was made in 1943 at Llyn Cerrig Bach on Anglesey, when the ground was being prepared {{for the construction of}} a Royal Air Force base. The cache included weapons, shields, chariots along with their fittings and harnesses, and slave chains and tools. Many had been deliberately broken and seem to have been votive offerings. These finds are considered to be one of the most important collections of La Tène metalwork discovered in Britain. Pottery on the other hand is fairly rare in Wales during this period and most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found appears to be imported.|$|E

25|$|Drought in Australia {{is defined}} by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology as {{rainfall}} over a three-month period being in the lowest decile <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recorded for that region in the past. This definition takes into account that drought is a relative term and rainfall deficiencies need to be compared to typical rainfall patterns including seasonal variations. Specifically drought in Australia is defined in relation to a rainfall deficiency of pastoral leases and is determined by decile analysis applied to a certain area. Note that this definition uses rainfall only because long-term records are widely available across most of Australia. However, it {{does not take into account}} other variables that might be important for establishing surface water balance, such as evaporation and condensation.|$|E
25|$|The {{manner in}} which a paradoxer will show himself, as to sense or nonsense, will not depend upon what he maintains, but upon whether he has or has not made a {{sufficient}} knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> done by others, especially as to the mode of doing it, a preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself... New knowledge, when to any purpose, must come by contemplation of old knowledge, in every matter which concerns thought; mechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often, escapes this rule. All the men who are now called discoverers, in every matter ruled by thought, have been men versed {{in the minds of}} their predecessors and learned in what had been before them. There is not one exception.|$|E
25|$|Bach wrote virtuoso {{music for}} {{specific}} instruments, {{as well as}} music independent of instrumentation. For instance, the Sonatas and partitas for solo violin are considered the pinnacle <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> written for this instrument, only within reach of accomplished players: the music fits the instrument, pushing it to the full scale of its possibilities, requiring virtuosity of the player, but without bravura. Notwithstanding that {{the music and the}} instrument seem inseparable, Bach made transcriptions for other instruments of some pieces of this collection. Similarly, for the cello suites, the virtuoso music seems tailored for the instrument, the best of what is on offer for it, yet Bach made an arrangement for lute of one of these suites. Likewise for much of his most virtuoso keyboard music. Bach exploited the capabilities of an instrument to the fullest while keeping the core of such music independent of the instrument on which it is performed.|$|E

25|$|On 16 December 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Feyenoord had been placed in the more favorable second category (Categorie 2). Meaning that Feyenoord were no longer in debt according to the KNVB. They have earned this by the transfer of significant players and a large capital injection made by the organisation VVF (Friends of Feyenoord, Vrienden Van Feyenoord). However to stay in the second category, Feyenoord needed to obtain the same amount of points earned rounding up to or higher than 65 points. On 13 April 2012 Feyenoord was officially out <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described as the 'financial dangerzone' and was officially placed in the second Category. According to chairman of the club Eric Gudde the placing in the more favourable category came earlier than anticipated, he also congratulated the fans and promised to maintain the same policy until Feyenoord was completely healthy again and will never fall back into the 1st Category.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} part of Adrian Lewis' career until 2007, he was Taylor's protégé having practised {{together}} in their home city Stoke-on-Trent and made his television debut in 2004, aged 19, at the UK Open. However, Lewis has kicked on since then and has amassed four PDC major titles including two consecutive World titles in 2011 and 2012. The pair have been part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a feisty rivalry at times. For instance, in their semi-final meeting at the 2010 World Grand Prix, Taylor accused Lewis of playing up to the crowd to put him off. Lewis would win that encounter five sets to four. Lewis and Taylor have met in four PDC major finals during their rivalry. These have included the finals of the 2008 and 2011 European Championship which Taylor won 11–5 and 11–8 respectively, the final of the 2013 Masters which Taylor won 10–1, as well as the final of the 2013 World Matchplay where Taylor averaged 111.23 and won 18–13. The latter involved Lewis playing in his first Matchplay final where he averaged 105.92 and hit 19 maximums. Taylor has played Lewis 70 times, winning 52 and losing 16, with 2 draws.|$|E
