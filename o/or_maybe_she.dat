25|$|Semiotic {{art history}} seeks {{to uncover the}} codified meaning or {{meanings}} in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a collective consciousness. Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, Meyer Schapiro borrowed Saussure’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system. According to Schapiro, to {{understand the meaning of}} frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a , or a three-quarter view. Schapiro combined this method with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the Mona Lisa. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to Leonardo da Vinci? What significance did she have to him? <b>Or,</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations {{as much as it is}} to reveal new possibilities.|$|E

But that was her; and she was married again upon my uncle Robin, and went with him a while to kirk and market; and then wearied, or else her friends got claught of her and talked her round, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> turned ashamed; at the least of it, she ran away, {{and went back to}} her own folk, and said we had held her in the lake, and I will never tell you all what. I have never thought much of any females since that day. And so, in the end, my father, James More, came to be cast in prison, and you know the rest of it as well as me." ...|$|E

60|$|A young couple, I {{once heard}} of, went for their honeymoon to Scotland. The poor girl {{did not know}} he was a golfer (he had wooed and won her {{during a period of}} idleness {{enforced}} by a sprained shoulder), <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> would have avoided Scotland. The idea they started with was that of a tour. The second day the man went out for a stroll by himself. At dinner-time he observed, with a far-away look in his eyes, that it seemed a pretty spot they had struck, and suggested their staying there another day. The next morning after breakfast he borrowed a club from the hotel porter, and remarked that he would take a walk while she finished doing her hair. He said it amused him, swinging a club while he walked. He returned in time for lunch and seemed moody all the afternoon. He said the air suited him, and urged that they should linger yet another day.|$|E
60|$|When the {{measurements}} {{indicate that the}} yawl is approaching the shoalest part of the reef, the command is given to 'ease all!' Then the men stop rowing and the yawl drifts with the current. The next order is, 'Stand by with the buoy!' The moment the shallowest point is reached, the pilot delivers the order, 'Let go the buoy!' and over she goes. If the pilot is not satisfied, he sounds the place again; if he finds better water higher up or lower down, he removes the buoy to that place. Being finally satisfied, he gives the order, and all the men stand their oars straight up in the air, in line; a blast from the boat's whistle indicates that the signal has been seen; then the men 'give way' on their oars and lay the yawl alongside the buoy; the steamer comes creeping carefully down, is pointed straight at the buoy, husbands her power for the coming struggle, and presently, at the critical moment, turns on all her steam and goes grinding and wallowing over the buoy and the sand, and gains the deep water beyond. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> doesn't; maybe she 'strikes and swings.' Then she has to while away several hours (or days) sparring herself off.|$|E
5000|$|In Sting's {{inauguration of}} Amie and Lizzy, Amie's eyes {{can be seen}} {{watering}} as if she still {{wants to be in}} Claw <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>she</b> let her former team down in [...] "Tower of Strength." [...] She felt very sad but got through it in the end.|$|R
50|$|Elsa Neumann {{was aware}} of her unique and privileged {{position}} and advocated for women's right to higher education in Prussia. Although (<b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because) <b>she</b> came from a wealthy family, she recognized that women needed financial support for their education. She was the founder, the first chairwoman, and later an honorary member of the Verein zur Gewährung zinsfreier Darlehen an studierende Frauen ("Association for granting interest-free loans to women students"), which was founded on 26 April 1900.|$|R
50|$|Martha Southgate of the New York Times {{claims the}} {{problems}} inherent in All-American Girl are very clear — the show struggles “to find its groove, a not-uncommon occurrence for a sitcom built around a stand-up comedian” However, those {{who are familiar with}} Cho’s comedic work argue “the show failed because it had no sense of Margaret Cho, <b>or</b> <b>maybe,</b> because <b>she</b> had no sense of it…She was smarter than any box the producers wanted to put her in, but that’s precisely what they tried to do”.|$|R
50|$|If {{one finds}} oneself believing all three propositions of an {{inconsistent}} triad, then (in {{order to be}} rational) one must give up or modify {{at least one of}} those beliefs.

50|$|The stage curtain dropped for Ariana Nozeman {{when she}} was not even 35 years old. She died on December 7, 1661. Three months earlier, {{she had lost her}} only 7-year-old son Mathijs. Maybe she died of heartbreak <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> fell victim to the plague. She was buried in the Oude Kerk (Old Church), now in the heart of Amsterdam’s famous red light district. Her death meant a great loss for the Amsterdam Schouwburg. They {{contracted}} immediately four new actresses to replace her.|$|E
5000|$|This Modern Age {{is notable}} also for Crawford playing a blonde. According to a biography, she [...] "wore her hair that color because the actress who was {{originally}} {{to play the}} part of the mother, Marjorie Rambeau (who'd played her mother in Laughing Sinners), was a blonde. When Rambeau became ill, the part was recast with a brunette actress, Pauline Frederick, whom Joan greatly admired. Joan's scenes had already been shot, and the difference in hair color was not reason enough to reshoot them. Besides, there was no reason why a brunette mother couldn't have a blonde-haired daughter - <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> was just into peroxide." ...|$|E
5000|$|The bees {{begin to}} emerge from their cocoons in the spring when the daytime {{temperature}} reaches 14°C (57°F). [...] The males emerge first. They remain near the nesting site {{and wait for the}} females to emerge, which can be several days to weeks depending on the number of days of warm weather. The first thing the females do is mate. A female typically mates once, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> twice. <b>She</b> is absent from the nesting site for several days while she feeds and waits for her ovaries to fully mature.|$|R
5000|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times {{observed}} [...] "Until now, Ms. Mol {{has been}} {{best known for}} her premature designation several years ago as Hollywood's newest It Girl. The label seemed to plague her, and she all but faded from view despite promising turns in little-seen films. <b>Maybe</b> because <b>she</b> felt protected by her female director and female producers (six out of seven), or emboldened by the material, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>she</b> knows how beautiful her gently padded silhouette looks in the raw, Ms. Mol takes to this tricky role with the carefree expressivity you tend to see only in young children who have learned the joys of nudity, usually when their parents are throwing a dinner party. When she strips, Bettie soars".|$|R
5000|$|Jazz singer Alberta Hunter {{sometimes}} recorded {{under the}} name [...] "May Alix", {{with the permission of}} the real May Alix. The two singers were friends, and Hunter thought the switch might help her friend's career, as well as get Hunter out of exclusive recording contracts. In the 1940s [...] "Alex was often billed as [...] "The Queen of the Splits," [...] a name that could have originated with the moves she made on-stage, a skill at getting out of clubs quickly when the show was over, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>she</b> was [...] "splitting" [...] the use of her name with Hunter." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{called us}} to {{order for the}} speeches. As a hush descended, one person continued to speak, too engrossed in her conversation to notice, her strong Australian accent reverberating around the room. At the graduates' table, Germaine was explaining {{that there could be}} no liberation for women, no matter how highly educated, as long as we were required to cram our breasts into bras constructed like mini-Vesuviuses ... The willingly suffered discomfort of the Sixties bra, she opined vigorously, was a hideous symbol of male oppression.... were astonished at the very idea that a woman could speak so loudly and out of turn and that words such as 'bra' and 'breasts' - <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> said 'tits' - could be uttered amid the pseudo-masculine solemnity of a college dinner.|$|E
5000|$|When you're {{having lunch}} with her, {{you get the}} urge to put down your butter knife, spill your life story and shed tears. Maybe it's her endearing lisp, her Midwest {{upbringing}} or her unblinking eyes. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> just gives more of a darn. —Neal Justin in the Star Tribune Jeanne Phillips began assisting her mother, Pauline Phillips, with the Dear Abby column {{at the age of}} 14 in order to earn an allowance. When Jeanne asked her mother for an allowance, Pauline answered, [...] "What {{are you going to do}} for it?" [...] Pauline then said that her Dear Abby column received a substantial amount of mail from teenagers and that Jeanne could reply to some of them. If Jeanne's responses were [...] "good", her mother would use them in the column. If her responses were not good, Jeanne would rewrite them. Jeanne spent her allowance money on watching movies and plays. She went to San Francisco several times to see the play, Li'l Abner.|$|E
5000|$|Lita and Josh {{traced the}} stolen bag {{to the park}} where the thief left it. It seems when the thief {{retrieved}} the voicemail, it triggered something which could be traced. Lita tries to explain this but Josh disagrees. Lita returns playful remarks then suddenly embraces Josh and gives him a passionate kiss. Lita says [...] "YES" [...] but Josh is confused. Lita reminds him of the dream he told her many times about proposing on the Spanish Steps in Italy, but didn't when they actually were on vacation there. This was enough for Josh {{to pull out the}} engagement ring from his pocket and confesses waiting for the right moment and puts it on Lita's finger. Both relieved, they hug and kiss then Lita's phone rings. Instead of another call to investigate another crime, it's a text from Lita's mother saying her phone was on and she heard the whole proposal. Josh picks up his phone reading a message that Lita's parents called his parents about the news. Thinking that all surprises have been revealed, Lita briefly mentions a baby shower in a comment peaking Josh's curiosity. The viewer is left wondering if Lita was distressed in the beginning because she was pregnant but not married to Josh <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> was just hinting at wanting to be.|$|E
5000|$|This {{inscription}} {{has generated}} many - and sometimes contradicting - interpretations. First, {{there is some}} disagreement regarding Xenokrateia’s familial status. Most scholars agree that both her father and son were named Xeniades, and that her husband is {{not mentioned in the}} inscription. Mclees thinks she was a widow <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> that <b>she</b> was not legally married, Kron believes she was an heiress who did not need a guardian, and Purvis suggests that Xenokrateia was married to Kephisodotos, who dedicated the other relief mentioned earlier. [...] Cook, however, claims Xenokrateia was the wife of Xeniades, and that she dedicated the relief “as daughter (before her marriage) and mother (after it).” ...|$|R
500|$|A Little More Personal (Raw) {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The album holds {{a score of}} 50 out of 100 based on 9 critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album three stars out of five, saying, [...] "Lindsay Lohan clearly spells out her ambition in the title to her second album, A Little More Personal (Raw) -- she's going to shed the glitzy trappings of her debut, Speak, and dig down deep in her heart, letting feelings flood onto the page". Erlewine also stated that the album [...] "is far from being totally successful, it is an intriguing mash-up of heart and commerce. And it does suggest one thing that Speak never did: Lindsay Lohan may have an artistic vision as a recording artist, which is indeed a huge step forward". Entertainment Weekly 's Leah Greenblatt said, [...] "like so many pop records today, Personal has {{more than its share}} of filler, and like all teenagers, Lohan contradicts herself. [...] Perhaps Personal 's vulnerability is calculated, and its rawness a misnomer, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she's</b> really opening up. We'll probably never know. Lindsay may no longer be on the edge of 17, but being 19, troubled, and ridiculously famous can cut pretty deep, so props to her for letting us see her bleed — just a little".|$|R

40|$|About 40 years ago, {{the author}} was posted to a {{government}} school {{in the north of}} Uganda, run by an Irish priest belonging to an Italian missionary order. The school had two campuses: one for the girls and another for the boys. The author was to teach English and asked what the class had been reading: Thackeray 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 Vanity Fair 2 ̆ 7. The author recounts the girls 2 ̆ 7 reaction to the famous sofa scene in Chapter 53, wondering if the hidden meanings in the story had been understood when they declined to answer his questions about what lay behind the words. He was then asked to also take over the library in the girls 2 ̆ 7 school, which was managed by a head girl - Rukia, whom he remembers as one of the brightest in the class. After talking with Rukia - who surprised him with her response - the author realised that she and the other girls had indeed understood the hidden meanings in 2 ̆ 7 Vanity Fair 2 ̆ 7. He wonders what happened to Rukia in the wake of Africa 2 ̆ 7 s political purges; perhaps she became a teacher herself, a writer, a lawyer?

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Serket's identification with a scorpion may be a misinterpretation of the determinative of her name and animal associated with her, and that could refes not to a scorpion, but rather to a waterscorpion (Nepidae). According to this hypothesis, Serket is referred to as [...] "She who gives breath" [...] because of the way waterscorpions seem to breath underwater. The appearance of a waterscorpion must have made it be associated with the scorpion, therefore the use of the goddess for curing scorpion stings and other venomous creatures, <b>or,</b> <b>maybe</b> exactly because <b>she</b> [...] "causes to breathe", not for the physical similarities of the creatures.|$|R

Whilst the track attracted positive commentary from critics, mainly for Minogue's newly experimented sound of electronic dance music, she revealed {{that it would not}} feature on the then-upcoming studio album. In February 2014, Minogue confirmed Furler as the album's executive co-producer's. Minogue stated in an interview with American website Idolator that [...] "I got on with her so well...

60|$|We always {{spoke to}} each other in broad Scotch (I think in it still), but now and again she would use a word that was new to me, or I might hear one of her contemporaries use it. Now is my {{opportunity}} to angle for its meaning. If I ask, boldly, what was chat word she used just now, something like ‘bilbie’ or ‘silvendy’? she blushes, and says she never said anything so common, or hoots! it is some auld-farrant word about which she can tell me nothing. But if in the course of conversation I remark casually, ‘Did he find bilbie?’ or ‘Was that quite silvendy?’ (though the sense of the question is vague to me) she falls into the trap, and the words explain themselves in her replies. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> to-day <b>she</b> sees whither I am leading her, and such is her sensitiveness that she is quite hurt. The humour goes out of her face (to find bilbie in some more silvendy spot), and her reproachful eyes—but now I am on the arm of her chair, and we have made it up. Nevertheless, I shall get no more old-world Scotch out of her this forenoon, she weeds her talk determinedly, and it is as great a falling away as when the mutch gives place to the cap.|$|R
40|$|My abstractions {{originate}} in my relationships to my mother, father, and self. Visual entry points of whiteness, flatness, and organic shapes become a language and {{form of communication}} that speak to my connections with my family. They begin as quiet and contemplative works with minimal use of color and imagery that oscillate around an ovular organic form and shift to more colorful pure abstractions. Working consecutively with a similar shape in size and appearance came naturally to me as I began putting paintbrush to paper. My impetus was to complete a form and reveal its edges with gesso – lines that connect in infinity with muted color, making a shape embedded within the charged white around the spaces. It was months later that I attended my first ultrasound and saw a tiny circular form surrounded by deep space; its mark resonated within me. Shapes and text became even more meaningful to the work after the unexpected passing of my father. Organically rendered pages with quasi-biblical phrasing collaged on top began to correlate with my grief. They transformed from random religious poetic sentiments into a manual on {{what it means for}} me to grieve with words like: “The cold damp terrified her” and “There was a deep silence. ” The text, which meditates on sin and wickedness, relates to conditions that I concern myself with as a Christian. Inclusion of found phrases from the discarded library book Infelice began as a curiosity to explore textual conversation in abstract work. Out-of-context quotes from a nun scolding a little girl about killing her pet dove became odd poetic phrasings, which intrigued me. The language of the shapes also connects in all of the works due to the pervasive reworking of the surfaces. Sanding represents a physical change of the page. My act of removal is a process that reveals a more unified or complete image. Each page, crafted over a series of months is worked, layered, sanded, and drawn upon again. The labor and intensity within each page represents my desire to offer the viewer a gift at my show, where they are invited to engage with the pages through prompting text to sit, contemplate, and take one from the wall. A small space, built by two walls at my thesis exhibition welcomes the viewer to spend time in a room where formalism and experience meet. I provide two benches in this space, which invite an opportunity for a collective experience. Taken from my church, they symbolize my connection with my community and where I spend my time. Through communal participatory actions I invite the viewer {{to become a part of}} my community. This setting is meant to coax the viewer into a moment where their only task in the world, right then and there, is to be present in the intimate space. This is achieved by viewing the work through the lens of a prompt on the wall or taking the time to sift through the imagery and choose which piece they want. Within here lies the insight for the viewer. I do not remember when we began using the word with each other in conversation but somewhere over the years my mom and I began referring to the fateful events in our lives as “kismet” (kis·met /ˈkizmit,-ˌmet/ noun destiny; fate). A true lover of random occurrences, my mom always marveled at the kismet of her zodiac readings, once choosing a life-changing career due to the prediction of a Chinese fortune cookie. Kismet became a dialogue between us for all of the things that we could not communicate, such as my deepening move towards faith and spirituality or her occasional frustration with her lot in life – it was all just kismet. Perhaps then, it too was kismet the evening she began painting a sketchbook as a gift for me from an old textbook titled Insight. Every night, settled into the couch long after work, she would flip the page, paint a spread, and wait for it to dry. Sometimes the paintings took the form of milky whites drifting to pinks and browns and other times she skipped passages and pages where the text was too important to cover. Maybe she had run out of that one color in the paint-by-number set left over from her younger years <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>she</b> felt the need to switch things up. Either way, every night she would flip the page and paint. My works on paper incorporate all of these elements: through stages over time, including screen-printed text, painting over the text, various choices of materials and fortunes written on the back (fortune source: Infelice by Augusta Jane Evans). My thesis exhibition presents an installation of these works in which the viewer is welcomed into an inner sanctum space and offered an invitation – a gift of art and of time to contemplate their inner world. My communication of generosity is a chance to be a part of something larger and a chance to participate in an event guided by kismet and insight. Advisor: Karen Kun...|$|E
