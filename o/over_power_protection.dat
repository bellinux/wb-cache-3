40|$|Housed {{in a tiny}} TSOP 6 package, the NCP 1250 {{lends itself}} very well {{to the design of}} {{moderate}} to high output power converters. Some features such as <b>Over</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Protection</b> (OPP) and internal Over Voltage Protection (OVP) make the part a component of choice for applications where high performance and cost must be combined. This application note demonstrates the part capabilities in a 60 W ac−dc adapter, typical of what is needed for the high−volume net/notebook market. A Comprehensive Feature Set Rather than jumping directly to the board description, it is interesting to enumerate the various features we have packed in this part. Generally speaking, the component operates in peak current mode control and switches at a constant frequency when the converter delivers its nomina...|$|E
40|$|The NCP 1028 {{offers a}} new {{solution}} targeting output power levels from a few watts up to 15 W in a universal mains flyback application. Our proprietary high-voltage technology lets us include a power MOSFET together with a startup current source, all directly connected to the bulk capacitor. To prevent lethal runaway in low input voltage conditions, an adjustable brown-out circuitry blocks the activity until sufficient input level is reached. Current-mode operation together with an adjustable ramp compensation offers superior performance in universal mains applications. Furthermore, an <b>Over</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Protection</b> pin brings the ability to precisely compensate all internal delays in high input voltage conditions and optimize the maximum output current capability. Protection wise, a timer detects an overload or a short-circuit and stops all operations, ensuring a safe auto-recovery, low duty cycle burst operation. Finally, a great RDS(on) figure makes the circuit an excellent choice for standby/auxiliary offline power supplies or applications requiring higher output power levels...|$|E
40|$|The NCP 1250 is {{a highly}} {{integrated}} PWM controller capable of delivering a rugged and high performance offline power supply in a tiny TSOP− 6 package. With a supply range up to 28 V, the controller hosts a jittered 65 kHz or 100 kHz switching circuitry operated in peak current mode control. When the power on the secondary side starts to decrease, the controller automatically folds back its switching frequency down to a minimum level of 26 kHz. As the power further goes down, the part enters skip cycle while limiting the peak current. <b>Over</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Protection</b> (OPP) is a difficult exercise especially when no−load standby requirements drive the converter specifications. The ON proprietary integrated OPP lets you harness the maximum delivered power without affecting your standby performance simply via two external resistors. An Over Voltage Protection input is also combined on the same pin and protects the whole circuitry in case of optocoupler failure or adverse open loop operation. Finally, a timer−based short−circuit protection offers the best protection scheme, letting you precisely select the protection trip point irrespective of a loose coupling between the auxiliary and the power windings...|$|E

40|$|<b>Power</b> system <b>protection</b> is {{concerned}} with protecting electrical power systems from faults within the network by isolating the faulted components so as to leave {{as much of the}} remaining the electrical network operational as possible. Moreover, by properly protecting the system components from overloading, the probability of fires and other catastrophic and expensive system failures can be minimized. In understanding <b>power</b> <b>protection,</b> it is necessary to understand what is actually being protected. Providing superior protection is essential in mitigating the effects of disruptions on system stability. As such, it is essential for power engineers to understand the concepts and practices underlying <b>power</b> <b>protection.</b> The creation of a <b>Power</b> System <b>Protection</b> Lab at Boise State University gives students the opportunity to gain some real world experience in protection. Moreover, a lab of this type facilitates educational opportunities. It also provides numerous additional benefits such as research and industry cooperation. The overall objective of this project is to determine the design requirements and parameters for a <b>Power</b> System <b>Protection</b> lab at Boise State University. Some design considerations for the lab include cyber <b>protection,</b> <b>power</b> quality, and future interchangeability studies. Moreover, in the interest of efficiency and cost effectiveness, we avoided acquiring redundant or unnecessary equipment.
