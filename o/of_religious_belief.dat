5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Michael Persinger is a {{neurophysiologist}} who {{has worked}} at Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He trained as a psychologist {{and focused on the}} impacts of religious experience. Persinger {{is the author of the}} book Neuropsychological Basis of Human Belief, and since its publication he has researched and examined the physiological and neurological causes <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> systems. Normand Carrey received education as a medical doctor and specialized in psychiatry. He became a child psychiatrist, and worked out of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Carrey has conducted studies into psychological resilience, and has taught physicians in a psychiatry residency program in the field of family therapy. He has worked in the field of adolescent psychiatry at IWK Health Centre. Lynn Suess assisted Persinger in 1980, in researching geological phenomena which may have affected unidentified flying object sightings in Washington. Suess and Persinger performed similar research in Toronto and Ottawa.|$|E

40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between subjective well-being (SWB) and the strength <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs?</b> A full account of {{the relationship}} between SWB and religion must include a measure of the effects <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Unfortunately, the empirical happiness literature focuses on the effects of the social aspects <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> life. I measured the effects of the strength <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> by using data on the frequency of prayer. I found that stronger <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> are positively correlated with SWB. According to the happiness literature, religion influences SWB by providing meaning and purpose to people 2 ̆ 7 s lives; stronger <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> reflect a stronger influence of religion when interpreting life events. 1 Studying the social aspects of religion gives only a partial understanding of its relationship to SWB; it is important study the role <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> to get a more complete understanding of religion‟s effects on well-being...|$|R

25|$|If {{religious}} liberty includes, as it must, {{the right to}} communicate such experiences to others, {{it seems to me}} an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from real ones, dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance. Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight.

30|$|From the {{descriptive}} statistics (Fig.  2), {{we see that}} the amount of donations from business owners who are religious is relatively high. Among them, Christians donated more than Buddhist and folk believers on average. Linear regression analysis was also used for further analysis (see Table  1): controlling for material interests composed mainly of basic economic situations, <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs,</b> and panreligious practices of business owners had a significant positive effect on donation behaviors. From Models 1 and 2, in 2008 and 2009, the regression coefficients <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> and charitable donations are 9.933 and 9.916, P[*]<[*] 0.01; panreligious activities and charitable donations are 3.992 and 4.170, respectively, and significant at the 0.01 and 0.001 level.

25|$|As Hoxha began {{experiencing}} more health problems, he progressively started {{withdrawing from}} state affairs and taking {{longer and more}} frequent leaves of absence. Meanwhile, he began planning for an orderly succession. He worked to institutionalize his policies, hoping to frustrate any attempt his successors might make to venture from the Stalinist path he had blazed for Albania. In December 1976, Albania adopted its second Stalinist constitution of the postwar era. The document guaranteed Albanians freedom of speech, the press, organization, association, and assembly but subordinated these rights to the individual's duties to society as a whole. The constitution continued to emphasize national pride and unity, and enshrined in law the idea of autarky and prohibited the government from seeking financial aid or credits or from forming joint companies with partners from capitalist or revisionist communist countries. The constitution's preamble also boasted that the foundations <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> in Albania had been abolished.|$|E

500|$|The {{protection}} of {{the free exercise of}} religion was also interpreted narrowly in early High Court judgments. [...] In 1912, the court in Krygger v Williams, held that a person could not object to compulsory military service on the ground <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> The court considered that Section116 would only protect religious observance from government interference; it would not permit a person to be excused from a legal obligation merely because the obligation conflicted with his or her religious beliefs. In a 1929 case, Higgins, then a Justice of the High Court, suggested (as obiter dictum) that a person could lawfully object to compulsory voting on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> However, in 1943, the court continued the narrow approach it took in Krygger v Williams, upholding war-time regulations that caused the Adelaide branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses to be dissolved and have its property acquired by the Commonwealth government. The government had declared the branch to be an organisation whose activities were [...] "prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth": one of the branch's professed beliefs was that the government was an [...] "organ of Satan". Chief Justice John Latham held that the Constitution permitted the court to [...] "reconcile religious freedom with ordered government".|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how clinicians make sense <b>of</b> Muslim <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> when the client may have {{psychotic}} symptoms. Limited literature suggests that psychiatrists draw on a Western empiricist epistemology and implicit cultural norms in utilising the DSM’s diagnostic criteria. Concerns have been raised that practitioners can overlook <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> and pathologise <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> from non-Western cultures. No research has specifically explored psychiatrists’ understanding <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> This research aimed to explore how psychiatrists understand Islamic <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> when assessing clients referred with possible psychotic symptoms. It also hoped to explore how they understand {{the impact of their}} views on subsequent assessment decisions. Interviews were conducted with five psychiatrists and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. In contrast to expectations, the participants did not view their understanding <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> as central to their assessment decisions. Service pressures and psychiatrists’ sense of accountability for clients appeared to inform the emphasis of psychiatric assessments; risk assessments and case management decisions were prioritised above all else. This appeared to limit the participants’ opportunity to engage with clients’ <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs,</b> to fully understand their presentations or to make fluid assessment decisions they felt were often appropriate. Participants also demonstrated a more intricate, nuanced understanding <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> than previous literature has suggested. In keeping with best practice guidelines participants viewed <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> as a normal manifestation of a person’s culture and existing on a continuum. The participants showed an awareness of the impact of their cultural position on their understanding <b>of</b> <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> However, their understanding remains embedded within a psychiatric framework informed by the secular, empirical, bio-medical paradigm of the DSM. This provides an important insight into some of the barriers between mental health services and Muslim clients who present with <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs...</b>|$|R
