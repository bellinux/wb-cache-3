5|$|However, {{it is by}} {{no means}} an {{arbitrary}} convention, because not adopting it forces one either to invent strange new <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> to abandon some of the familiar rules of arithmetic.|$|E
5|$|Some Mayan {{languages}} allow {{incorporation of}} noun stems into verbs, either as direct <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> in other functions. However, {{there are few}} affixes with adverbial or modal meanings.|$|E

50|$|Multiple {{inheritance}} is {{a feature}} of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> class can inherit characteristics and features {{from more than one}} parent <b>object</b> <b>or</b> parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> class may only inherit from one particular <b>object</b> <b>or</b> class.|$|R
50|$|In {{the entire}} program, an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> non-inline {{function}} cannot {{have more than}} one definition; if an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> function is used, it must have exactly one definition. You can declare an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> function that is never used, in which case you don't have to provide a definition. In no event can there be more than one definition.|$|R
5|$|According to the {{dominant}} scholarly view during the late 19th {{and much of the}} 20th century, Roman religion was originally animistic, directed towards spirits associated with specific <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> activities which were only later perceived as gods with independent personal existence. Terminus, with his lack of mythology and his close association with a physical object, seemed a clear example of a deity who had developed little from such a stage.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 <b>objects)</b> <b>or</b> Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of <b>objects,</b> <b>or</b> types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|People with Asperger {{syndrome}} {{can display}} behavior, interests, {{and activities that}} are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in stereotyped and repetitive ways, preoccupy themselves with parts of <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> compulsive behaviors like lining objects up to form patterns.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relative}} velocity [...] (also [...] or [...] ) is {{the velocity of}} an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> observer B in the rest frame of another <b>object</b> <b>or</b> observer A.|$|R

5|$|The caliph Al-Mu'izz {{moved from}} {{the city to the}} new city of al-QƒÅhira (Cairo) in 973, but Al-Mansuriya {{continued}} to serve as the provincial capital. In 1057 it was abandoned and destroyed. Any useful <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> materials were scavenged during the centuries that followed. Today only faint traces remain.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the formal}} start of naming, {{tropical}} cyclones were named after places, <b>objects,</b> <b>or</b> saints' feast days {{on which they}} occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins, as well as the Australian region, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Built between 946 and 972, el-Mansuriya was a walled city holding {{elaborate}} palaces {{surrounded by}} gardens, artificial pools and water channels. It was briefly {{the centre of}} a powerful state that encompassed most of North Africa and Sicily. It continued to serve as provincial capital of the Zirids until 1057, when it was destroyed by the invading Banu Hilal tribes. Any useful <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> relics were scavenged during the centuries that followed. Today, only faint traces remain.|$|E
50|$|Value {{theory is}} {{a range of}} {{approaches}} to understanding how, why, and to what degree persons value things; whether the <b>object</b> <b>or</b> subject of valuing is a person, idea, <b>object,</b> <b>or</b> anything else.|$|R
25|$|Icons, indices, and symbols. Every sign refers either (icon) through {{similarity}} to its <b>object,</b> <b>or</b> (index) through factual connection to its <b>object,</b> <b>or</b> (symbol) through interpretive habit or norm of reference to its object.|$|R
5000|$|Definition is an {{abstract}} view on an <b>object</b> (<b>or</b> on a module) {{from a certain}} perspective. It is a facet of the <b>object</b> <b>or,</b> in other words, {{an abstract}} presentation {{of one or more}} of its services.|$|R
5|$|CGW {{said the}} in-game combat became a {{confusing}} mess once allies became involved, {{in part due}} to poor Artificial Intelligence (AI) that caused them to use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> each other during combat, use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at staying alive in battle. Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game with 2D graphics. The player controls a cursor {{to direct the}} main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> opening doors. Jennifer can walk and run, although running will reduce her stamina, in which case she may recover her stamina by sitting on the floor. Jennifer's character portrait {{in the corner of}} the screen will change depending on her stamina level. In addition to interacting with objects in the game, Jennifer can also store them as inventory for later use. The layout of items changes with each play-through.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{only means}} of {{communication}} is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah. Players may choose {{from a number of}} dialog options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use.|$|E
50|$|Subject, Object, and Locative PhrasesThe {{only way}} to expand upon the Subject, <b>Object,</b> <b>or</b> Locative is with a {{preceding}} Possessive. These connections can only occur with {{a single pair of}} words, one Possessive plus the Subject, <b>Object,</b> <b>or</b> Locative.|$|R
50|$|Toying(T) {{consists}} of a brief but repeated touching of an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> <b>objects</b> on the table.|$|R
50|$|One major {{division}} of truth claims is that between {{positive and negative}} truth claims. Positive truth claims proclaim {{the existence of an}} <b>object</b> <b>or</b> entity. Negative truth claims are the opposite and proclaim the non-existence of an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> entity.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers began finding {{other objects}} {{at least as}} far away as Pluto, now known as Kuiper Belt <b>objects,</b> <b>or</b> KBOs. Many of these shared some of Pluto's key orbital {{characteristics}} and are now called plutinos. Pluto came to be seen as the largest member of a new class of objects, and some astronomers stopped referring to Pluto as a planet. Pluto's eccentric and inclined orbit, while very unusual for a planet in the Solar System, fits in well with the other KBOs. New York City's newly renovated Hayden Planetarium did not include Pluto in its exhibit of the planets when it reopened as the Rose Center for Earth and Space in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Models for a {{continuous}} formation throughout {{the age of}} the Solar System illustrate that at weak resonances within the Kuiper belt (such as 5:7 or 8:1), or at the boundaries of stronger resonances, objects can develop weak orbital instabilities over millions of years. The 4:7 resonance in particular has large instability. KBOs can also be shifted into unstable orbits by close passage of massive <b>objects,</b> <b>or</b> through collisions. Over time, the scattered disc would gradually form from these isolated events.|$|E
5|$|Potential contestants of the {{original}} primetime version had {{to compete in a}} telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method. Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.|$|E
50|$|An <b>object</b> {{identifier}} (<b>or</b> <b>object</b> ID <b>or</b> OID) uniquely identifies a {{managed object}} in the MIB hierarchy.|$|R
5000|$|... where [...] is {{the vector}} from the {{barycentre}} to the observer, [...] is the unit vector from the observer to the <b>object</b> <b>or</b> event, [...] is {{the distance from}} the observer to the observed <b>object</b> <b>or</b> event, and [...] is the speed of light.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} demonstrative pronouns are ÿ®€á bu, ÿ¶€á u and ÿ¥€á shu, the first being {{translated}} as {{this and the}} remaining two as that. The first is used when referring to an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> person which is visible {{and close to the}} speaker, the second is used when referring to an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> person which is away from the speaker and the third is used when referring to a previously mentioned <b>object</b> <b>or</b> person which is not particular close to the speaker in an affirmative statement.|$|R
5|$|The game's {{head-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus's helmet and {{features}} a radar, map, missile ammunition meter and health meter. Several visors are available, and each performs a different function. One, also seen in the previous game, is a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses, interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators and retrieves text entries from certain sources. The others reveal and highlight interdimensional <b>objects</b> <b>or</b> cloaked enemies, and create a visual representation of sound.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Aiden, the game becomes monochromatic. Amongst the shades of greys, {{interactive}} objects are highlighted by an aura shining {{in one of}} several colours, with the colour of the aura indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue <b>objects</b> (<b>or</b> characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow the dead {{to speak to the}} living through her, grant her an ability to see events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.|$|E
5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine <b>objects,</b> <b>or</b> attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{representing}} a data distribution derived from an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> image by processing signals {{corresponding to the}} <b>object</b> <b>or</b> image comprising deriving an approximate representation of the data distribution and analysing the errors of the data elements when {{expressed in terms of}} the approximate representation...|$|R
50|$|In geometry, {{the mirror}} image of an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> {{two-dimensional}} figure is the virtual image formed by reflection in a plane mirror; it is {{of the same size}} as the original object, yet different, unless the <b>object</b> <b>or</b> figure has reflection symmetry (also known as a P-symmetry).|$|R
50|$|Safety can {{be limited}} in {{relation}} to some guarantee or a standard of insurance to the quality and unharmful function of an <b>object</b> <b>or</b> organization. It is used {{in order to ensure}} that the <b>object</b> <b>or</b> organization will do only what it is meant to do.|$|R
