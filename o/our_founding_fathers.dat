Hence after the mid-1780s the historical record shows repeated petitions to allow river improvements or charters for turnpikes and toll roads, so historians can correctly paint the era as either the canal age or the turnpike age. In 1793 the engineers of the Middlesex Canal, located a hydraulic cement and generally showed the way forward, and for the next several decades, canals to support commerce such as the Delaware and Hudson Canal, the Potomack Canal, the Raritan, the Morris, or the more famous Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, Lehigh Canal, Schuylkill Canal and Erie Canal & Illinois Canals all cheapened long distance shipping, spurred commerce, and enabled the industrial revolution, including the production of enough Iron to make railroads to create their own assassins.|$|R
