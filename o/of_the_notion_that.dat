25|$|While the {{confounding}} Gog and Magog as confined Jews {{was becoming}} commonplace, some, like Riccoldo or Vincent de Beauvais remained skeptics, and distinguished the Lost Tribes from Gog and Magog. As noted, Riccoldo had reported a Mongol folk-tradition {{that they were}} descended Gog and Magog. He also addressed many minds (Westerners or otherwise) being credulous <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Mongols might be Captive Jews, but after weighing the pros and cons, he concluded this was an open question.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, some Christian {{groups have}} become more open to {{religious}} pluralism; {{this has led to}} many cases of reconciliation between Christians and people of other faiths. The liberalization of many Seminaries and theological institutions, particularly in regards to the rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the Bible is an infallible document, has led to a much more human-centered and secular movement within Mainline Christian denominations, particularly in the United States. Some Mainline churches no longer hold to exclusivist views on salvation.|$|E
25|$|In the 15th and 16th century, despite {{considerations}} and systematization {{of the laws}} of war, women remained objects available to the conquering male in any way whatsoever. The influential writer Francisco de Vitoria stood for a gradual emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> glory or conquest were not necessarily acceptable reasons to start a war. The jurist Alberico Gentili insisted that all women, including female combatants, should be spared from sexual assault in wartime. However, in practice war rape was common.|$|E

25|$|A new {{consciousness}} of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women, or NOW, to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|Postmodernism is a {{rejection}} of 'totality', <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> planning could be 'comprehensive', widely applied regardless of context, and rational. In this sense, Postmodernism is {{a rejection}} of its predecessor: Modernism. From the 1920s onwards, the Modern movement sought to design and plan cities which followed {{the logic of the}} new model of industrial mass production; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardisation and prefabricated design solutions (Goodchild 1990). Postmodernism also brought a break from the notion that planning and architecture could result in social reform, which was an integral dimension of the plans of Modernism (Simonsen 1990). Furthermore, Modernism eroded urban living by its failure to recognise differences and aim towards homogenous landscapes (Simonsen 1990, 57). Within Modernism, urban planning represented a 20th-century move towards establishing something stable, structured, and rationalised within what had become a world of chaos, flux and change (Irving 1993, 475). The role of planners predating Postmodernism was one of the 'qualified professional' who believed they could find and implement one single 'right way' of planning new urban establishments (Irving 1993). In fact, after 1945, urban planning became one of the methods through which capitalism could be managed and the interests of developers and corporations could be administered (Irving 1993, 479).|$|E

500|$|Following the {{box office}} success of J. J.

[...] Writer Damon Lindelof declared that Khan's [...] "intense gravity," [...] particularly regarding the character's delivery of monologues, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that [...] "it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We really have to do this but if we don't get it right people are going to kill us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{controversy}} of his game, Ledonne became an unwitting spokesman for the games industry, facing the medium's opponents in debates and forums. The furor resulting from Slamgate was called out by Ledonne and others in the media as a sign that video games had not yet outgrown the traditional stereotype of children's games. Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that despite being confused and tawdry, Super Columbine Massacre [...] "symbolizes a growing understanding that videogames have more to say than 'shoot the enemies and pick up health.'" [...] Authors Andreas Jahn-Sudmann and Ralf Stockmann consider controversial video games such as Super Columbine Massacre and the Grand Theft Auto [...] "Hot coffee mod" [...] evidence of sociopolitical tensions present between gamers and older generations. The game and others like it continue to {{be at the center of}} the video games as art debate, and Gamasutra credited Super Columbine Massacre and Slamgate as having two highly positive and far-reaching effects; first, forcing print game journalism to focus on the issue; and second, the [...] "evangelization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> games can be as meaningful and important as other media, even if the example is offensive to the sensibilities of most Americans [...] To win is to lose, but to play is to experience an enrichment that cannot be scored." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an honest}} {{description}} of the disadvantages of Florida, Stowe attempts to disabuse readers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the region is perfect. She writes, [...] "In New England Nature is an up-and-down smart, decisive, housemother that has her times and seasons and brings up her ends of life with a positive jerk" [...] and contrasts that characterization with Nature in Florida, an [...] "indulgent old grandmother, who has no particular time for any thing and does every thing when she happens to feel like it". Those who wish to live in Florida, Stowe warns, must also get to know its deficiencies: occasional freezing weather in winter, unsculptable lawns, insects and snakes, and people who disagree as they do everywhere else. Were Florida a woman, Stowe writes, {{she would be a}} dark brunette, full of jolly untidiness. Malaria is a fact of life, and Stowe cautions Northerners who may be lured to the region by tales of the mild climate to understand that temperature extremes are common, taking particular effort to address consumptives, or those afflicted with tuberculosis. Those who consider moving to the region should weigh all these issues before making their decisions. In The Journal of Southern History, Susan Eacker attests that Stowe's assignment of female characteristics to Florida coincided with her own gradual admission that she may be turning into a [...] "woman's rights woman".|$|E

30|$|While <b>the</b> earlier {{conceptualization}} <b>of</b> scaffolding in <b>the</b> {{first language}} acquisition context is quite clear, the construct has experienced significant variations in meaning and definition in SLA (Van Lier 2004). The reason behind such conceptual variations resides mostly in <b>the</b> substantial subjectivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construct itself. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> {{have been developed}} to define and depict scaffolding spring most probably from the writers’ conceptual dimensions and judgments because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstract, qualitative, highly interpretable, and objectively non-measurable nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term. It is subjective because the properties the people apply to define it are also subjective, relative and unobservable. Furthermore, the obscurity in <b>the</b> previously-developed <b>notions</b> on scaffolding normally adds greater weight to <b>the</b> subjectivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construct, affording a vehicle for further notional constructions.|$|R

The tradition is distinguished from other Buddhist traditions by its doctrinal emphasis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the mind precedes the world, its description of the Buddhist path as a training regimen for the mind, and its objective to reach proficiency in a diverse range of both meditative techniques and aspects of conduct that will eradicate defilements (Pali: [...] "kilesas") – unwholesome aspects of the mind – in order to attain awakening.|$|E
