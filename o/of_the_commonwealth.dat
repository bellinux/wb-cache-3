5|$|By {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commonwealth</b> formation, {{there was little}} {{practical}} difference between the Polish and Lithuanian components; the Lithuanian component formed about a fourth to a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commonwealth</b> army. The army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commonwealth</b> was organized along several different models, with the primary division being that into two 'contingents' or 'enlistments' (or in Polish: autorament): national and foreign. The name applied to types of formation, regulations and the officer cadres; the majority of regular recruits for both came from within the Commonwealth, particularly from the 1630s onward. National units included the towarzysz cavalry (including the Polish hussars and lighter pancerni (Polish) and petyhorcy (Lithuanian) units) and some light cavalry units, with infantry being the distant second in reputation; whereas the foreign units were primarily centered around the infantry and artillery formations, with dragoons gaining prominence from the 1620s, and reiter cavalry soon afterward.|$|E
