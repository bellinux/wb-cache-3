25|$|In early March 1976, Maeno flew around Kodama's {{neighborhood}} in Setagaya, gaining {{knowledge of the}} area in preparation for an attack. On the morning of March 23, 1976, Maeno arrived in the western suburbs of Tokyo at Chofu Airport with two friends. All three were dressed in the uniforms of kamikaze pilots, and Maeno informed airport officials that they were renting two planes for a kamikaze segment of a film. The flight was to prepare publicity for a planned film on the suicide bombers. Before 9:00a.m., the actor posed in his uniform, with white scarf, rising-sun images <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and a headband {{in front of the}} Piper Cherokee plane he had rented.|$|E
500|$|The boxing {{scene was}} {{intended}} to differentiate the relationship between Q and Sisko from that of Q and Picard. [...] "Picard is an explorer, and in some ways, very much an intellectual. Sisko is a builder, {{a different kind of}} guy. He wears his heart a little more <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and he acts on emotion, on instinct, more than Picard", Wolfe explained. John de Lancie offered a similar opinion: [...] "Q's relationship with Picard has always been a battle of wits, but I come into Deep Space Nine, and Sisko just bopped me on the nose! From a character point of view, that's a very big difference." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Honesty" [...] is a piano ballad with {{synthesizer}} embellishments. It {{opens with}} [...] "sad and tender" [...] piano chords. According to Ken Bielen {{in his book}} The Words and Music of Billy Joel, Liberty DeVitto's drums and cymbal crashes, remind listeners that [...] "the track is a predecessor of the power ballads of the 1980s and 1990s". It talks about the inherent lack of honesty even in the closest of relationships. In the song Joel sings the lines [...] "Honesty is such a lonely word". Joel further sings about wearing his heart <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> in [...] "Honesty". According to Chuck Klosterman of The New York Times, [...] " [...] implies {{that the only way}} you can tell that someone really cares about you is if they tell you you're bad." [...] "Leningrad" [...] (1989), a song from Joel's eleventh studio album Storm Front, has been compared to [...] "Honesty". According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, [...] "Honesty" [...] is a pop rock and classical rock song written in the key of B♭ major. The song is set in common time and performed in a slow tempo of 80 beats per minute. Joel vocals range from the note of Bb2 to Bb4.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{occasion}} of his retirement, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland praised him. [...] "George Hardy does not wear his social philosophy <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b> He carries it in his heart," [...] Kirkland said. [...] "Because he is so uncompromising in his beliefs, {{it would be impossible}} not to have been {{on the opposite side of}} an issue at least once. But win or lose, George knows that when the fight for idealism is over, the practical battle for the survival of the labor movement begins. This commitment is what turns a collection of unions into a movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2008 {{re-election}} bid, Thomas faced Democrat Tim Nelson. Thomas lost {{many of his}} 2004 endorsers. The Arizona Republic wrote [...] "Thomas {{simply has}} worn his intensely partisan Republican politics too boldly <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Nowhere has that partisanship been more in evidence than in his rabid pursuit of the small fry of illegal immigration, the petty hoodlums and the traffic violators." [...] Rick Romley stated [...] "Police chiefs {{tell me that the}} Maricopa County attorney's relationships with their police agencies are at an all-time low. And people are fearful that they are being targeted just {{because of the color of}} their skin." [...] Thomas still won the election decisively, beating Nelson by an over 7% margin.|$|E

2500|$|... "Dark layers", and a nuanced {{personality}} of [...] "many different levels and shades" [...] attracted Akingbola to the role. Malick has a violent streak, and is introduced after hitting his former boss, though he becomes calmer with time. A February 2011 episode saw his composure {{threatened by a}} racist patient. Akingbola appreciated the storyline for highlighting the continuation of racism and prejudice: [...] "In this country, we can feel like there's no racism and it's like a lovely Benetton advert but it's still there – that's the truth." [...] He characterised Malick as [...] "not all bad", capable of becoming [...] "a nice guy", and expanded: [...] "I think the thing with Malick is that he's young, confident and he speaks from the heart. He wears his heart <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and I don't think there's many people like that on the ward! He doesn't care if what he says offends people, because that's what he believes. But he becomes a bit more sensitive." [...] Akingbola anticipated many [...] "twists and turns" [...] in Malick's storylines. He described him as having many secrets, and being a closed off person who [...] "keeps his cards very close to his chest." [...] Using the simile of an onion, he asserted that Malick's layers would be peeled back slowly, to reveal his [...] "wonderful heart".|$|E
2500|$|In this novel, {{published}} by Arbor House/William Morrow in 1988, a man dying of AIDS is {{taken in by}} his cousin, a rancher in the Colorado mountains. Award-winning author Nancy Kress writes [...] "Michael Bishop has pulled off a rare and amazing feat. [...] Unicorn Mountain successfully weaves such traditional fantasy elements as unicorns and Indian lore together with the all-too-contemporary..." [...] Orson Scott Card writes [...] "The triumph of this, Bishop's most artistically whole and successful novel to date, is that {{he set out to}} do something that is nearly impossible in fiction: He wrote a novel about constructing a tribe...To do it, he had to bring us to know and understand and care about more created characters than most writers produce in a career." [...] John Clute's assessment emphasizes another theme of the work: [...] "Michael Bishop, whose voice is like a shout {{from the bottom of the}} well of the enormous South, and whose heart is <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve,</b> [...] in Unicorn Mountain to generate a moving tale out of ecological disaster here and in another world, AIDS, the death of cultures, the death of species, and the slow sea-changing of America into themeparks." [...] The novel would go on to win the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, and was shortlisted for the 1989 Locus Award.|$|E

The desire to see his native land once more determined him to submit to the condition, but he revenged himself by combining the long train of his gown and the three deep ruffles <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> with the attitude and conversation of a grenadier, which made him very disagreeable company." ...|$|R
