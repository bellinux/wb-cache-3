Eighteen non-demented PD patients, treated with both MED and STN-DBS (64. 3 ± 10. 2 years, UPDRS III MED off, DBS off 45. 5 ± 17. 1) were tested with the Game of Dice Task (GDT) which probes decision-making under risk during four conditions: MED on/DBS on, MED on/DBS off, MED off/DBS on, and MED off/DBS off.

To delineate the nature of this dysfunction we aimed at identifying the particular VF-related operations modified by STN DBS. Eleven PD patients performed VF tasks in their STN DBS ON and <b>OFF</b> <b>condition.</b> To differentiate VF-components modulated by the stimulation, a temporal cluster analysis was performed, separating production spurts (i. e., 'clusters' as correlates of automatic activation spread within lexical fields) from slower cluster transitions (i. e., 'switches' reflecting set-shifting towards new lexical fields). The results were compared to those of eleven healthy control subjects. PD patients produced significantly more switches accompanied by shorter switch times in the STN DBS ON compared to the STN DBS <b>OFF</b> <b>condition.</b> The number of clusters and time intervals between words within clusters were not affected by the treatment state. Although switch behavior in patients with DBS ON improved, their task performance was still lower compared to that of healthy controls.

40|$|Improvement of obsessions and compulsions by {{deep brain}} {{stimulation}} (DBS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is often preceded by a rapid and transient mood elevation (hypomania).

The aim of our present study was to evaluate the time course of rapid clinical changes following DBS reactivation in more detail and to assess their association with additional neuroendocrine parameters. We included therapy-refractory OCD patients treated with DBS (> 1 year) and performed a baseline assessment of symptoms, as well as plasma concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, growth hormone, copeptin and homovanillic acid. This was repeated after a 1 -week DBS <b>OFF</b> <b>condition.</b> Next, we assessed the rapid effects of DBS reactivation by measuring psychiatric symptom changes using visual analog scales as well as repeated neuroendocrine measures after 30 [*]min, 2 [*]h and 6 [*]h.

The TRT consisted of an encoding phase (during which visual stimuli of durations from 5 s to 16. 6 s, varied at 8 levels were presented) and a reproduction phase (during which interval durations were reproduced by a button pressing).

In this study of 13 patients with Parkinson's disease, we tested the effects of deep brain stimulation on the somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold. To investigate whether deep brain stimulation and dopaminergic medication induce similar changes in somatosensory discrimination, somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values were acquired under four experimental conditions: (i) medication ON/deep brain stimulation on; (ii) medication ON/deep brain stimulation off; (iii) medication OFF/deep brain stimulation on; and (iv) medication OFF/deep brain stimulation off. Patients also underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluations during each experimental session. Somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values obtained in patients were compared with 13 age-matched healthy subjects. Somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values were significantly higher in patients than in healthy subjects. In patients, somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values were significantly lower when patients were studied in medication ON than in medication <b>OFF</b> <b>conditions.</b> Somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values differed significantly between deep brain stimulation on and deep brain stimulation <b>off</b> <b>conditions</b> only when the patients were studied in the medication ON condition and {{were higher in the}} deep brain stimulation on/medication ON than in the deep brain stimulation off/medication ON condition.
