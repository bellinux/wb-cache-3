5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>day-to-day</b> basis airliners are routed {{to take advantage of the}} jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind.

5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>day-to-day</b> basis than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside {{the home and the}} mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

The nonlinear effects of path flows and path time differences on the path swapping are then investigated. Participants’ path preferences, time-varying sensitivity and learning behavior in the day-to-day process are also examined. The prediction power of various models with various settings (nonlinear effects, time-varying sensitivity, and learning) is compared. Assumption of rational behavior adjustment process in Yang and Zhang (2009) is further verified. Finally, evolutions of different Lyapunov functions used in the literature are plotted and no obvious diversity is observed...|$|R

40|$|A {{traumatic}} hand injury {{can involve}} {{damage to a}} number of structures including skin, nerves, tendons, muscle bone, and soft tissue.

40|$|Health {{sciences}} libraries {{have considerable}} potential as resources for both formal continuing professional education, {{as well as}} the informal continuing education that results from the professional's efforts to solve problems in daily practice. While there is a growing interest in making the resources of health sciences libraries more accessible to practitioners <b>on</b> <b>a</b> routine, <b>day-to-day</b> basis, there also needs to be more awareness of how, when, where, and why professionals look for information in the context of practical problems. This paper reviews recent research that identifies the context in which physicians seek information and advice from external sources, the information sources that physicians access, and the factors that influence which particular sources are sought. The results indicate that physicians vary in their information needs, preferences, motivations, and strategies for seeking information. This diversity suggests that health sciences libraries, in their efforts to be more accessible, should consider "market research" to determine the needs, preferences, and use patterns of the library's targeted users. Libraries may also benefit from exploring alternative methods of improving access to their resources...|$|R
