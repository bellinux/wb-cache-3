25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience,</b> both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTeachers are {{transmitter}} of knowledge, {{skills and}} values {{to the mass}} population, therefore they are considered as nation's valuable asset. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences,</b> teachers are required to play their roles to their utmost capabilities. However, research clearly showed that, <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> shaped teachers’ perceptual, thinking and behavior capabilities. A set of questionnaire was developed aimed to identify personal constructs between novice and expert Science teacher concerning teacher function. Two groups of Science teacher with different level <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> in <b>teaching</b> are formed. One of the groups is of teachers with high level <b>of</b> practical <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> and the other group is formed by inexperienced Science teachers. The results revealed {{a greater number of}} similarities than differences in personal constructs. Some of the differences observed were mainly related to teaching strategies. Based from this finding, it is suggested that more customize professional development programs especially on teaching aspects are conducted for specific groups of teachers...|$|R

500|$|The first {{high school}} in Garden City that would {{eventually}} become Garden City High School was established in 1910 on the location that is now Sabine Hall in order to educate a rapidly increasing population. During the school's inaugural year, the school newspaper, The Sugar Beet, was established. In 1913, the high school was accredited by the North Central Association. In 1916, the Garden City School Board set a minimum teaching standard of one year of college and two years <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> for all staff members, and a year later, the high school was accredited by the U.S. Military Academy. Later that year, a new high school was constructed at the site that {{is now known as}} Calkins Hall. Two years later, the high school was renamed [...] "Sequoyah High School". The Board of Education approved night school in 1920 and summer school was approved the following year. In 1926, vocational home economics was started and in 1927, the Board established a maximum for teaching of two years of college and two years of experience. Calkins Hall was remodeled in 1929 and 15 credits were now required for graduation. This number was increased to 16 credits in 1931 when the high school was renamed [...] "Garden City High School". During this time, the main gym was named in honor of Ben Grimsley and was known as the [...] "Ben Grimsley Gymnasium". The hot lunch program began in 1938.|$|E
