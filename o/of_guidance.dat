5|$|As {{punishment}} {{for bringing the}} world into chaos, Ashera subsequently petrifies Tellius; only the most powerful warriors and human-laguz half-breeds survive. She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival and must be eradicated, and recruits the Begnion senate to this end. Guided by Yune through Micaiah, who sides with humanity, Ike, Micaiah, and King Tibarn of Phoenicis lead three groups in a campaign through Begnion to the Tower <b>of</b> <b>Guidance</b> (a massive structure in Begnion's capital) where Ashera lies. Micaiah and her fellow Daeins seek to use the petrification {{of the world as}} a means to destroy the blood pact without harming Daein. Each of them run into the Disciples of Order, formerly regular {{men and women who have}} been empowered by Ashera to stop the protagonists. In separate engagements they confront various senators and Izuka, who reveals that Pelleas was not Ashnard's son, but an unwitting dupe used to place Daein further under Begnion's thumb. Ike also learns that the Black Knight's true identity is that of the Begnion general Zelgius. In an encounter with Senator Lekain, Empress Sanaki asks him why she has been declared a false apostle by the senate. Lekain responds that Sanaki lacks the clairvoyance and foresight traditionally associated with the royal line of Begnion as the trait only effects the eldest child, and that her (previously unknown) older sister was killed years previously. This revelation is outwardly refuted by the Empress, but she inwardly develops a degree of doubt in herself. All three armies eventual convene at the base of the Tower <b>of</b> <b>Guidance.</b> Fifteen heroes are then picked to be Yune's champions against Ashera.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (i) to compare the reproducibility of lateral tooth contacts of casts mounted in a semi-adjustable articulator when condylar guidance was set by different methods and (ii) to assess the margin of error of the variations <b>of</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> without changing lateral tooth contacts, depending on the type <b>of</b> lateral <b>guidance.</b> In subjects with different types <b>of</b> lateral <b>guidance,</b> intraoral lateral tooth contacts identified with occlusal registration strips were compared with those identified by use of a semi-adjustable articulator, setting the condylar guidance in four different ways: using protrusive wax wafers, by axiography and by adding and subtracting 5 degrees from the value <b>of</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> obtained by protrusive wax wafers. Tolerance to variations <b>of</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> without changing lateral tooth contacts was determined by increasing and decreasing the value <b>of</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> until lateral tooth contacts changed. Different ways <b>of</b> setting condylar <b>guidance</b> on a semi-adjustable articulator give rise to different values <b>of</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> in the same subject. The occlusal repercussions of these variations <b>of</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> values depend on the type <b>of</b> lateral <b>guidance.</b> Canine protection had the greatest tolerance to variations in the setting <b>of</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> without changing lateral occlusal contacts...|$|R

5|$|Ependymal cells {{actively}} regulate neuronal fate {{specification of}} adult neural precursors through release of Noggin. Beating of the cilia of ependymal cells appears {{to set up}} concentration gradients <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, {{such as in the}} RMS. Microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis. Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by unactivated microglia in the adult SGZ. Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action. In one study, the activation of microglia and recruitment of T cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment-induced SGZ neurogenesis, suggesting a possible role in the RMS.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast. While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans {{may no longer be}} needed in the forecast process {{at some point in the}} future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not give}} the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided experience for the planners in handling deception and for the Twenty Committee in proving the worth of double agents. Terry Crowdy, writing in 2008, argued that any experience that the LCS attained was limited by the lack <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> from Cairo and knowledge of double agents. Dudley Clarke had already shown that the most effective method of deception involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including Operation Tindall and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 Operation Fortitude North, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSpacecraft {{equipped}} with the capability to vary their ballistic coefficient can use differential drag as the control force to perform propellant-less relative maneuvers. Because atmospheric drag is proportional to atmospheric density, uncertainty in atmospheric density makes the generation and tracking <b>of</b> drag-based <b>guidances</b> difficult. Spatio-temporal resolution, or the mapping of density information to altitude and time, is shown in this work to improve atmospheric density estimation from forecasted density for spacecraft in LEO. This is achieved by propagating simulated orbits for two spacecraft using forecasted density. Additionally, a receding-horizon control algorithm is introduced, {{with the goal of}} improving the tracking <b>of</b> <b>guidances.</b> Using a simulated perfect forecast of the atmospheric density for propagation of the orbits, relative guidance trajectories are generated and tracked, establishing the benefit of adding spatio-temporal resolution. Next, imperfect density forecasting is added, indicating that the benefit of spatio-temporal resolution is retained in the presence of imperfect forecasting. Finally, a receding-horizon control algorithm is used with imperfect forecasting, demonstrating that receding-horizon control improves the tracking <b>of</b> <b>guidances</b> compared to single-horizon control...|$|R
