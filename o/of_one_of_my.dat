500|$|Many {{observers}} {{found the}} practice humorous. Luke Meredith, {{a writer for}} the Associated Press, wrote that it [...] "has already led to a few amusing moments where a coach, enraged with a call gone against his wrestler, had to reach for a tiny stuffed animal and fling it across the mat to get the referee's attention." [...] NBC Sports commentators for their Olympic coverage began referring to Vinicius as [...] "the challenge mascot." [...] Dustin Nelson, a news writer for the website Thrillist, wrote that the mascot took [...] "a little of the anger out of a challenge." [...] Jason Bryant, the in-house commentator for wrestling at the 2016 Olympics, was slightly surprised to see the practice at the Olympics, given the emphasis there on [...] "protocol", but he eventually commented that it does not matter what the challenge object is, particularly if it has cultural significance to the location of the competition. Coach Mike Maliconico argued that the practice does not belong at the Olympic Games, stating, [...] "The fate <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> athletes who has been training for this specific moment for four years hangs in the balance of a referee's error.
