40|$|Communicated by Yang Kuang) Abstract. In {{a turning}} process modeled using delay {{differential}} equations (DDEs), we investigate {{the stability of}} the regenerative machine tool chatter problem. An approach using the matrix Lambert W function for the analytical solution to systems of delay differential equations is applied to this problem and compared with the result obtained using a bifurcation analysis. The Lambert W function, known to be useful for solving scalar first-order DDEs, has recently been extended to a matrix Lambert W function approach to solve systems of DDEs. The essential advantages of the matrix Lambert W approach are not only the similarity to the concept of the state transition matrix in linear ordinary differential equations, enabling its use for general classes of linear delay differential equations, but also the observation that we need only the principal branch among an infinite number of roots to determine the stability of a system of DDEs. The bifurcation method combined with Sturm sequences provides an algorithm for determining the stability of DDEs without restrictive geometric analysis. With this approach, one can obtain the critical values of delay, which determine the stability of a system and hence the preferred <b>operating</b> <b>spindle</b> speed without chatter. We apply both the matrix Lambert W function and the bifurcation analysis approach to the problem of chatter stability in turning, and compare the results obtained to existing methods. The two new approaches show excellent accuracy and certain other advantages, when compared to traditional graphical, computational and approximate methods...|$|E

Based on this principle, the power matching between spindle heat generations and dissipations is realized by the real-time power estimations of spindle heat sources and the modified constant supply cooling powers strategy. It can be ultimately verified by experiments that the power matching based dissipation strategy is more advantageous than existed spindle cooling strategies in dissipation of spindle heat generations and decrease of thermal errors...|$|R

The next decade saw vast expansion of the mill and village. The company began constructing 40 more duplexes and apartment buildings north of Oakwood Avenue, on a tight grid pattern of streets which became known as Lincoln Village. A new mill building, costing $2 million and containing 750,000 square feet (70,000 sq. m.), was built in 1923-24. A one-story dye house quickly followed, and the mill employed 1000 workers and <b>operated</b> 102,000 <b>spindles.</b> 600 additional houses and apartments were built to serve the expanded workforce. Another expansion in 1927 included more units for Mill No. 3 and 500 houses and apartments south of the mill.

40|$|Advances in {{high-speed}} machining create {{the need to}} model spindle-bearing performance at high rates of rotation and under <b>operating</b> conditions. <b>Spindle</b> analysis, design, and control requires a complex representation {{of the dynamics of}} stepped shafts rotating at high speeds and supported by flexible nonlinear bearings. Previous spindle-bearing models simplify either the spindle or bearing dynamics to the extent of prohibiting a detailed analysis of a <b>spindle</b> <b>operating</b> at high speeds. A complete model should include a dynamic analysis of rotating bearings coupled to a comprehensive spindle model, including thermal growth in both the spindle and bearing. Thermal expansion can degrade spindle-bearing performance and life, while centrifugal loading in the bearing can cause stiffness softening. This work presents a coupled system of spindle and bearing dynamic models including a comprehensive thermal model. The angular contact ball bearing model is coupled to a spindle model based on the influence-coefficient method using lumped masses with Timoshenko beam theory. Full coupling of the loads, deflections, and thermal parameters occur between the bearing and spindle. This approach overcomes limitations on bearing reactions or spindle geometry of previous models. The thermal model is a quasi-three dimensional model for thermal equilibrium between the spindle, bearing, and housing including, heat generated in the bearings, the motor, and at the cutting surface. The spindle-bearings model also allows applied static loads to be superimposed on the dynamic excitation, showing the influence of the cutting load on non-linear bearings. Based on this model, a modular computer program has been developed which allows easy modeling of a spindle system with different cutters, loading, and other operational parameters. The computer model is both rapid and robust, and shows good agreement with experimental analysis. This model can be used to aid in spindle design, machining process design, and selection of optimal operating conditions. ...|$|R

It reduces the moment of inertia of the wings and limits the negative lift generated during the upstroke. Thus, we consider it important to achieve wing folding during the upstroke. A mechanism was designed to couple the flapping cycle to the folding cycle of the robot. We then use biological data to further optimize the mechanism such that the kinematic synergies of the robot best match those of a biological bat. This ensures that folding is performed at the correct point in the wingbeat cycle...|$|R

40|$|Anaphase B spindle {{elongation}} {{is characterized}} by the sliding apart of overlapping antiparallel interpolar (ip) microtubules (MTs) as the two opposite spindle poles separate, pulling along disjoined sister chromatids, thereby contributing to chromosome segregation and the propagation of all cellular life. The major biochemical “modules” that cooperate to mediate pole–pole separation include: (i) midzone pushing or (ii) braking by MT crosslinkers, such as kinesin- 5 motors, which facilitate or restrict the outward sliding of antiparallel interpolar MTs (ipMTs); (iii) cortical pulling by disassembling astral MTs (aMTs) and/or dynein motors that pull aMTs outwards; (iv) ipMT plus end dynamics, notably net polymerization; and (v) ipMT minus end depolymerization manifest as poleward flux. The differential combination of these modules in different cell types produces diversity in the anaphase B mechanism. Combinations of antagonist modules can create a force balance that maintains the dynamic pre-anaphase B spindle at constant length. Tipping such a force balance at anaphase B onset can initiate and control the rate of spindle elongation. The activities of the basic motor filament components of the anaphase B machinery are controlled by a network of non-motor MT-associated proteins (MAPs), for example the key MT cross-linker, Ase 1 p/PRC 1, and various cell-cycle kinases, phosphatases, and proteases.

Two major system parameter uncertainties, an additive uncertainty and a multiplicative uncertainty, are constituted by the wind turbine and the VIF respectively. Frequency Shaping Sliding Mode Control (FSSMC) loop is proposed to account for these uncertainties and suppress the unmodeled higher-order plant dynamics.

In 1857 he constructed his first residence, Wren Nest House, now on Sunlaws Street, Glossop, on higher ground overlooking the mill, which was common practice at the time. This is a substantial stone built property which was sold at auction after the closure of the Mill in 1957 and then became St Mary's Convent.

The existence of uncertainties in either engineering simulations or manufacturing processes calls for a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) model for robust and cost-effective designs. In the present work a three shaft four speed gear box is designed using reliability principles. For the specified reliability of the system (Gear box), component reliability (Gear pair) is calculated by considering the system as a series system. Design is considered to be safe and adequate if the probability of failure of gear box is {{less than or equal to}} a specified quantity in each of the two failure modes. A FORTRAN program has been developed to calculate the mean values of face widths of gears for the minimum mass of gear box. By changing the probability of failure of system variations in the face widths are studied. The reliability based optimum design results are compared with those obtained by deterministic optimum design. The minimum mass of the gear box is increase as the specified values of the reliability is increased...|$|R

Methods Two retrograde tracers, Dil and True Blue Chloride, were injected into the mystacial pad and the masseter muscle {{on the same side}} of deeply anesthetized rats to label the respective projecting sensory neurons. This double-labeling technique was used to assess the co-innervation of both structures by the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (TMnu). In a separate group of anesthetized animals, the spontaneous electrical activities of TMnu neurons were analyzed by extracellular recordings during spontaneous movements of the macrovibrissae. Mesencephalic neurons (TMne) were previously identified by their responses to masseter muscle stretching. Changes in TMne spontaneous electrical activities, analyzed under baseline conditions and during whisking movements, were statistically evaluated using Student's t -test for paired observations. Results Neuroanatomical experiments revealed different subpopulations of trigeminal mesencephalic neurons: i) those innervating the neuromuscular spindles of the masseter muscle, ii) those innervating the mystacial pad, and iii) those innervating both structures. Extracellular recordings made during spontaneous movements of the macrovibrisae showed that whisking neurons similar to those observed in the trigeminal ganglion were located in the TMnu. These neurons had different patterns of activation, which were dependent on the type of spontaneous macrovibrissae movement. In particular, their spiking activity tonically increased during fan-like movements of the vibrissae and showed phasic bursting during rhythmic whisking. Furthermore, the same neurons may also respond to masseter muscle stretch. Conclusions results strongly support the hypothesis that the TMnu also contains first-order neurons specialized for relaying spatial information related to whisker movement and location to trigeminal-cortical pathways. In fact, the TMnu projects to second-order trigeminal neurons, thus allowing the rat brain to deduce higher-order information regarding executed movements of the vibrissae by combining touch information carried by trigeminal ganglion neurons with proprioceptive information carried by mesencephalic neurons. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the development, synthesis, properties, and {{applications}} of nano materials for critical technologies, including three areas: (1) 	 Microbial contamination of drinking water is a serious problem of global significance. About 51 % of the waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States can be attributed to contaminated ground water. Development of metal oxide nanoparticles, as viricidal materials is of technological and fundamental scientific importance. Nanoparticles with high surface areas and ultra small particle sizes have dramatically enhanced efficiency and capacity of virus inactivation, which cannot be achieved by their bulk counterparts. A series of metal oxide nanoparticles, such as iron oxide nanoparticles, zinc oxide nanoparticles and iron oxide-silver nanoparticles, coated on fiber substrates was developed in this research for evaluation of their viricidal activity. 	We also carried out XRD, TEM, SEM, XPS, surface area measurements, and zeta potential of these nanoparticles. MS 2 virus inactivation experiments showed that these metal oxide nanoparticle coated fibers were extremely powerful viricidal materials. Results from this research suggest that zinc oxide nanoparticles with diameter of 3. 5 nm, showing an isoelectric point (IEP) at 9. 0, were well dispersed on fiberglass. These fibers offer an increase in capacity by orders of magnitude over all other materials. Compared to iron oxide nanoparticles, zinc oxide nanoparticles didn’t show an improvement in inactivation kinetics but inactivation capacities did increase by two orders of magnitude to 99. 99 %. Furthermore, zinc oxide nanoparticles have higher affinity to viruses than the iron oxide nanoparticles in presence of competing ions. The advantages of zinc oxide depend on high surface charge density, small nanoparticle sizes and capabilities of generating reactive oxygen species. The research at its present stage of development appears to offer the best avenue to remove viruses from water. Without additional chemicals and energy input, this system can be implemented by both points of use (POU) and large-scale use water treatment technology, which will {{have a significant impact on}} the water purification industry. (2) 	A new family of aliphatic polyester lubricants has been developed for use in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), specifically for hard disk drives that <b>operate</b> at high <b>spindle</b> speeds (> 15000 rpm). Our program was initiated to address current problems with spin-off of the perfluoroether (PFPE) lubricants. The new polyester lubricant appears to alleviate spin-off problems and at the same time improves the chemical and thermal stability. This new system provides a low cost alternative to PFPE along with improved adhesion to the substrates. In addition, it displays a much lower viscosity, which may be of importance to stiction related problems. The synthetic route is readily scalable in case additional interest emerges in other areas including small motors. (3) 	The demand for increased signal transmission speed and device density for the next generation of multilevel integrated circuits has placed stringent demands on materials performance. Currently, integration of the ultra low-k materials in dual Damascene processing requires chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to planarize the copper. Unfortunately, none of the commercially proposed dielectric candidates display the desired mechanical and thermal properties for successful CMP. A new polydiacetylene thermosetting polymer (DEB-TEB), which displays a low dielectric constant (low-k) of 2. 7, was recently developed. This novel material appears to offer the only avenue for designing an ultra low k dielectric (1. 85 k), which can still display the desired modulus (7. 7 Gpa) and hardness (2. 0 Gpa) sufficient to withstand the process of CMP. We focused on further characterization of the thermal properties of spin-on poly (DEB-TEB) ultra-thin film. These include the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), biaxial thermal stress, and thermal conductivity. Thus the CTE is 2. 0 * 10 - 5 K- 1 in the perpendicular direction and 8. 0 * 10 - 6 K- 1 in the planar direction. The low CTE provides a better match to the Si substrate which minimizes interfacial stress and greatly enhances the reliability of the microprocessors. Initial experiments with oxygen plasma etching suggest a high probability of success for achieving vertical profiles...|$|R
