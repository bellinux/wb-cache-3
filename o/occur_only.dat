5|$|The first 94 {{elements}} occur naturally; {{the remaining}} 24, americium to oganesson (95–118) <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> in decay chains of primordial elements. No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) {{has ever been}} observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed {{in the form of}} light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).|$|E

5|$|Only a {{few small}} populations of B.acanthopoda exist. Until 1999, it was thought to <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region, in the {{vicinity}} of Woodanilling and Katanning; since then, a population has been found in the Jarrah Forest region, south of Darkan.|$|E

50|$|Capping with NAD+, NADH, or 3'-dephospho-coenzyme A is {{targeted}} by promoter sequence. Capping with NAD+, NADH, or 3'-dephospho-coenzyme A <b>occurs</b> <b>only</b> at promoters that have certain sequences at and immediately upstream of the transcription start site and therefore <b>occurs</b> <b>only</b> for RNAs synthesized from certain promoters.|$|R
50|$|Tuart {{forest is}} an open forest in which the {{dominant}} overstorey tree is Eucalyptus gomphocephala (tuart). This form of vegetation <b>occurs</b> <b>only</b> in the Southwest Botanical Province of Western Australia. Tuart being predominantly a coastal tree, tuart forest <b>occurs</b> <b>only</b> in a narrow belt along the coast.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{high-performance}} applications involve four-quadrant loads (Quadrants I to IV) {{where the}} speed and torque can be in any direction such as in hoists, elevators, and hilly conveyors. Regeneration can <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> in the drive's DC link bus when inverter voltage is smaller in magnitude than the motor back-EMF and inverter voltage and back-EMF are the same polarity.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos have a {{much more}} {{restricted}} range than the true parrots, occurring naturally only in Australasia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Eleven of the 21 species exist in the wild only in Australia, while seven species <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> in the islands of the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Interestingly, no cockatoo species are found in Borneo (despite their presence on nearby Palawan and Sulawesi) or many Pacific islands, although fossil remains have been recorded from New Caledonia.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma austroprunicolor is a {{commonly}} occurring mushroom of wet sclerophyll forests in Tasmania. Fruiting occurs from late spring to early winter, with most fruit bodies recorded between {{the months of}} January to March. In {{a study of the}} distribution of mushroom species in this area, it was found to <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> in mature or uncut forests.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, Category5 hurricanes usually <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> in El Niño years. During El Niño years, {{conditions}} are more favorable for tropical cyclones because of warmer sea surface temperatures and reduced wind shear. This is why Category5s cluster in single seasons. The effects of El Niño are most {{significant in the}} central Pacific (140°W to the dateline).|$|E
5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Its fruit bodies grow singly to {{scattered in}} soil under madrone and manzanita. Known to <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> in North America, {{it is commonly}} found from central California to southern Oregon, but has also been reported further north in Washington and British Columbia (Canada). Thiers considered it the most abundant Leccinum in California.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E

5|$|The Peak District {{is formed}} almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Carboniferous period. They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone, the overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> on the extreme margins of the area and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates.|$|E
5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity. The {{reason for this is}} still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a massive companion brings many other possibilities. If Eta Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, {{it might be a}} less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This would result in a type Ib or type Ic supernova {{due to the lack of}} hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> normally in less massive stars.|$|E

5|$|The shape, size, {{insertion}} and {{origin of}} the arch can vary widely. The arch usually occurs {{on both sides of}} the body; but may also <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> on one side. The muscular component of the arch varies, with some arches seen to be purely fibrous. The origin can be a direct continuation of the latissimus dorsi muscle fibres, originate with the tendinous element of the latissimus dorsi, or be a mixture of the two types originating from both the muscle and the tendon.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{found in the}} spring, often on duff under {{conifers}} shortly after the snow melts. In North America, {{where it has been}} noted to <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> between March and July, it is widespread in the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest. C.fulgens has been collected in Britain, and possibly arrived there from imported infected seeds. It has also been collected from Japan, Sweden, The Netherlands, and Turkey. It is listed on the Red List of protected species in Slovakia.|$|E
5|$|Classical Nahuatl {{and most}} of the modern {{varieties}} have fairly simple phonological systems. They allow only syllables with maximally one initial and one final consonant. Consonant clusters <b>occur</b> <b>only</b> word-medially and over syllable boundaries. Some morphemes have two alternating forms: one with a vowel i to prevent consonant clusters and one without it. For example, the absolutive suffix has the variant forms -tli (used after consonants) and -tl (used after vowels). Some modern varieties, however, have formed complex clusters from vowel loss. Others have contracted syllable sequences, causing accents to shift or vowels to become long.|$|E
