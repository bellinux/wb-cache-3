25|$|A {{month after}} the mass rally, the South Carolina {{legislature}} voted to raise pay scales for all state employees-from the governor <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lowliest hospital worker. Gov. McNair ended the curfew and publicly announced {{that the decision to}} rehire the 12 fired workers was up to Medical College Hospital administrators.|$|E
25|$|Ailsa Craig had two quite {{separate}} {{rail transport}} systems, one dated from 1886 and supplied coal, oil fuel and provisions to the lighthouse and gas works via the North Port {{and later the}} New Jetty and the other transported road stone from the quarries at Kennedy's Nags via the stone crusher to the Quarry Pier. The Northern Lighthouse Board's tramway had a section worked via a powered cable way that hauled wagons up from the North Port and later from the New jetty. This well-built tram line is largely intact and has a gauge of 3 feet with junction/points at the gas works and a further set of points {{that led to a}} siding that ran down parallel to the gable end of the gas works to presumably collect the coal ash for disposal. The main line runs <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lighthouse and its ancillary buildings, taking a right-angled bend to run parallel to {{the southern end of the}} lighthouse buildings block. This section of the line was worked by hand and at least two wagons remain at the site together with a set of spare wheels at the gas works.|$|E
500|$|Later, at {{one point}} in the picnic scene, as Mayhew wanders drunkenly away from Barton and Audrey, he calls out: [...] "Silent upon a peak in Darien!" [...] This is the last line from John Keats's sonnet [...] "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer" [...] (1816). The {{literary}} reference not only demonstrates the character's knowledge of classic texts, but the poem's reference to the Pacific Ocean matches Mayhew's announcement that he will [...] "jus' walk <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise".|$|E

500|$|Brunner was {{disappointed}} at {{the condition of}} the land {{along the banks of the}} Buller River as it neared the coast. [...] He had briefly scouted the area on his previous journey and believed it had potential for pastoral farming. He now found it too damp and mossy to be cultivated. The party reached the mouth of the Buller on 1 June and made their way to the pā that Brunner and Heaphy had stayed at on their last journey but on arrival, found that it had been abandoned. They continued <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arahura River and reached the Taramakau Pā where they stayed for three months over the worst of the winter months. On 12 October, Brunner continued south with some local Māori. He went as far south as Tititira Head, near Paringa where in December he severely sprained his ankle. After recovering, he decided to make his way back to Taramakau Pā. From here he along with his companions, journeyed up the Arahura River and in late January 1848, discovered the coalfield and lake which now bears his name. He wanted to continue on this route to Canterbury but Kehu and Pitewate would have none of it. The party began to make their way back to Nelson.|$|E
2500|$|The American {{physicist}} Richard Feynman lectured, [...] "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," [...] at an American Physical Society {{meeting at}} Caltech on December 29, 1959, {{which is often}} held to have provided inspiration for the field of nanotechnology. Feynman had described a {{process by which the}} ability to manipulate individual atoms and molecules might be developed, using one set of precise tools to build and operate another proportionally smaller set, so <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> needed scale. In the course of this, he noted, scaling issues would arise from the changing magnitude of various physical phenomena: gravity would become less important, surface tension and Van der Waals attraction would become more important.|$|E
2500|$|Arnout Viele {{and company}} left Albany, {{traveling}} southbound, crossing portions of present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. They apparently followed the West Branch of the Susquehanna River into the mountains, {{going through the}} Tioga river, and then reaching some tributary of the Allegheny River, and floated <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shawnee towns along the Ohio River. Viele and his pioneer expedition spent most of 1693 exploring the Ohio river and its tributaries in northern Kentucky with their Shawnee hosts. In February 1694, Gerit Luykasse, two of Viele's Dutch traders, and two Shawnees reappeared at Albany on a mission [...] "to fetch powder for Arnout [...] and his Company." [...] The party was gone fifteen months, but Arnout was gone for 2 years. In August 1694, Viele and his companions appeared out of the Pennsylvania wilderness—accompanied by hundreds of Shawnees who intended to relocate in the Minisink country on the upper Delaware River and by the diplomats of [...] "seven Nations of Indians" [...] seeking either trade with the English or peace with the Iroquois.|$|E

50|$|Facing 4th-and-1 {{from the}} Wake Forest 41-yard {{line at the}} start of the fourth quarter, Connecticut elected <b>to</b> hand <b>the</b> ball <b>to</b> Donald Brown.

Wake Forest {{promptly}} earned two first <b>downs,</b> <b>on</b> a pass from Riley Skinner to Kenneth Moore for 14 yards and an 11-yard run by running back Micah Andrews. The Demon Deacons were stopped at the Connecticut 26-yard line; kicker Sam Swank connected on a 43-yard field goal, expanding the Wake Forest lead to 17 - 10 with 11:44 left in the fourth quarter.|$|R
50|$|On {{the next}} drive, Washington forced Oregon State into a 4th and 20 {{position}} {{on their own}} 28 yard line.
