40|$|In 2012, the European Union {{introduced}} two <b>optional</b> <b>quality</b> <b>terms</b> (OQT) as {{new tools}} for {{the enhancement of}} food products. Two years later, the requirements {{for the use of}} the OQT “mountain product” were defined to enhance agricultural production in harsh environments, such as mountain areas. This new tool aimed at promoting local development, maintaining the economic activities in mountain areas and redistributing wealth. The present research aims at understanding if farmers perceived this tool as useful and evaluates their level of awareness. To this aim, a sample of 68 traditional cheese producers from the North West Alpine Arch was interviewed. The results show that some cheese producers have a positive attitude towards the concepts set out in the OQT “mountain product” and consider it a useful tool to promote and enhance their products. Some critical elements are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|With a view {{to making}} the {{mountain}} {{products on the market}} more clearly identifiable and less misleading for consumers, the EU institutions legislated on a common definition of an <b>optional</b> <b>quality</b> <b>term,</b> 'mountain product', in the labelling of agricultural products. The term 'mountain product' should only be used for products for which the feed and the raw materials come essentially from mountain areas and for which the processing also takes place in mountain areas. The European Commission will adopt implementing acts setting derogations to the general principles of the new Regulation (EU) No 1151 / 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs in order {{to take into account the}} specificities of the different sectors involved. In this context, the present report aims to (i) gather and analyse information on the supply chains for agricultural and food products in mountain areas; (ii) review the possible reasons why citizens, stakeholders and consumers need clarity regarding the provenance of mountain products; and (iii) assess past and present labelling practices for mountain products. Flexibility might be sought in the derogations to the rules governing the term 'mountain product' with regards to the exact place where feed is sourced, to the places where agricultural raw material produced in mountain areas are transformed in further processed goods, to the share of non-mountain ingredients within a mountain processed product that may be considered as acceptable. Means for a proper enforcement of the rules and to ensure coexistence between the new <b>optional</b> <b>quality</b> <b>term</b> 'mountain product' and other existing tools, such as trademarks and geographical indications, should be proposed. In absence of derogations, the applicability the <b>optional</b> <b>quality</b> <b>term</b> 'mountain products' would be impaired. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R
40|$|Farming in {{the islands}} of the European Union faces {{specific}} challenges due to isolation and small size, which justify specific policy tools in terms of structural and regional polices. The question whether the output of island farming (island agricultural and food products) is of such a specific quality that labelling it as such by ways of an <b>optional</b> <b>quality</b> <b>term</b> {{in the sense of}} Regulation (EC) No 1151 / 2012 is justified or not. Capturing the socio-economic reality of island farming in the EU as well as the labelling strategies pursued by stakeholders on the market demonstrates that a specific labelling rule for island products has benefits in particular for small producers and/or small islands, but that it would better be accompanied by the labelling of the specific name of the island(s) concerned.

25|$|The MIPS MT {{architecture}} {{also allows}} {{the allocation of}} processor cycles to threads, and sets the relative thread priorities with an <b>optional</b> <b>Quality</b> of Service (QoS) manager block. This enables two prioritization mechanisms that determine {{the flow of information}} across the bus. The first mechanism allows the user to prioritize one thread over another. The second mechanism is used to allocate a specified ratio of the cycles to specific threads over time. The combined use of both mechanisms allows effective allocation of bandwidth to the set of threads, and better control of latencies. In real-time systems, system-level determinism is very critical, and the QoS block facilitates improvement of the predictability of a system. Hardware designers of advanced systems may replace the standard QoS block provided by MIPS Technologies with one that is specifically tuned for their application.|$|R

On this basis, the retailer provides paid <b>optional</b> <b>quality</b> assurance service to consumers to promote sales. Users are divided into two categories in this paper: users with no optional service and users with optional services. We derive the equilibrium decisions between the manufacturer and the retailer under the following two cases: (i) the optional after-sales service level and the wholesale price determined by the manufacturer and the retail price determined by the retailer; (ii) the wholesale price determined by the manufacturer and the optional after-sales service level and the retail price determined by the retailer...|$|R

40|$|Global ionospheric maps (GIMs) {{are still}} {{commonly}} used to represent total electron content (TEC). However, {{a large number of}} permanent GPS receivers provide significant data for monitoring ionosphere. The GIMs supply accurate TEC results, although spherical models are not able to fit local ionospheric perturbations as a source of local receiver data. Therefore, the use of station-based TEC computation becomes more preferred and convenient. The station-based TEC approach is established on weighting averaging or modeling vertical TECs. Using this approach to reveal ionospheric activity depends on geometric distribution of ionospheric piercing points (IPP). The most effective parameter for examination of station-based TEC estimation is a function of relative geometry between receiver and satellite. In this study, a <b>quality</b> <b>term</b> has been used to define, for TEC estimation according to distribution of IPPs, similar to geometric dilution of precision (GDOP).

Here, we present that the iterative re-melting (laser-assisted) and milling step is no longer needed to reach a high homogeneity. The sol-gel method also offers a high degree of compositional flexibility with respect to dopants; it further facilitates achieving high concentrations, even in cases when several dopants are used. We employed optical active doped sol-gel derived granulate for the fiber core, whereas pure or index-raised granulated silica has been employed for the cladding. Based on the powder-in-tube technique, where silica glass tubes are appropriately filled with these granular materials, fibers has been directly drawn (“fiber rapid prototyping”), or eventually after an additional <b>optional</b> <b>quality</b> enhancing vitrification step.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{quantification}} of metabolic fluxes {{is gaining}} increasing {{importance in the}} analysis of the metabolic behavior of biological systems such as organisms, tissues or cells. Various methodologies (wetlab or drylab) result in sets of fluxes which require an appropriate visualization for interpretation by scientists. The visualization of flux distributions is a necessary prerequisite for intuitive flux data exploration in the context of metabolic networks. Results We present FluxMap, a tool for the advanced visualization and exploration of flux data in the context of metabolic networks. The template-based flux data import assigns flux values and <b>optional</b> <b>quality</b> parameters (e. g. the confidence interval) to biochemical reactions. It supports the discrimination between mass and substance fluxes, such as C- or N-fluxes.

40|$|We study {{unreliable}} {{serial production}} lines with known failure probabilities for each operation. Such a production line {{consists of a}} series of stations; existing ma-chines and <b>optional</b> <b>quality</b> control stations (QCSs). Our aim is to decide on the allocation of the QCSs within the assembly line, so as to maximize the expected profit of the system. In such a problem, the designer has to determine the QCS con-figuration and the production rate simultaneously. The profit maximization problem is approximated assuming exponentially distributed processing times, Poisson ar-rival process of jobs into the system and the existing of holding costs. The novel feature of our model is the incorporation of holding costs which significantly compli-cated the problem. Our approximation approach uses a branch and bound strategy that employs our fast dynamic programming algorithm for minimizing the expected operational costs for a given production rate as a subroutine. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the branch and bound procedure for solving large scale instances of the problem and for obtaining some qualitative insights. “Ever increasing quality is mandatory-not only for corporate profitability-but also for corporate survival” Inman, Blumenfeld, Huang and Li [10]. ...|$|R

However, since each VPE includes a complete copy of the processor state as seen by the software system, each VPE appears as a complete standalone processor to an SMP Linux operating system. For more fine-grained thread processing applications, each VPE is capable of supporting up to 9 TCs allocated across 2 VPEs. The TCs share a common execution unit but each has its own program counter and core register files so that each can handle a thread from the software.The MIPS MT architecture also allows the allocation of processor cycles to threads, and sets the relative thread priorities with an <b>optional</b> <b>Quality</b> of Service (QoS) manager block. This enables two prioritization mechanisms that determine the flow of information across the bus. The first mechanism allows the user to prioritize one thread over another. The second mechanism is used to allocate a specified ratio of the cycles to specific threads over time. The combined use of both mechanisms allows effective allocation of bandwidth to the set of threads, and better control of latencies. In real-time systems, system-level determinism is very critical, and the QoS block facilitates improvement of the predictability of a system. Hardware designers of advanced systems may replace the standard QoS block provided by MIPS Technologies with one that is specifically tuned for their application.|$|R
