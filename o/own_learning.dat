25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected to do their <b>own</b> <b>learning,</b> so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their <b>own</b> <b>learning,</b> and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study on}} Holstein–Friesian heifers {{learning}} to press a panel to open a gate for access to a food reward, the researchers also recorded the heart rate and behavior of the heifers when moving along the race towards the food. When the heifers made clear improvements in learning, they had higher heart rates and tended to move more vigorously along the race. The researchers concluded this was an indication that cattle may react emotionally to their <b>own</b> <b>learning</b> improvement.|$|E
25|$|Dewey's {{educational}} theories {{were presented}} in My Pedagogic Creed (1897), The School and Society (1900), The Child and the Curriculum (1902), Democracy and Education (1916) and Experience and Education (1938). Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive {{in an environment where}} they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their <b>own</b> <b>learning.</b>|$|E

This campus also houses its <b>own</b> <b>Learning</b> Resource Centre, a combined library and computer centre. Hertfordshire Sports Village which includes a gym, swimming pool, squash courts is also on this site. The large Weston Auditiorium is present on the de Havilland campus, adjacent to the Learn Resource Centre. The auditorium has a capacity of 450 and can host talks both by university lectures for students and for guest lecturers for guests and students, music and films events and dance events. The campus also contains 11 halls of residence; named after local towns and villages. Ashwell and Welwyn are examples of the buildings with the towns being present in Hertfordshire. The campus is mostly themed around law and business, having its business school located on the campus {{as well as its}} law school. A full scale, mocked up court room is present, being available for use for students studying a law degree. Over the past decade, the law school has earned an excellent track record in moot competitions, regularly beating teams from both Oxbridge and Russell Group universities and winning national trophies.|$|E
500|$|According to Little, Rosenberg's {{early work}} with {{children}} with learning disabilities shows his interest in psycholinguistics and the power of language, as well as his emphasis on collaboration. In its initial development, the NVC model re-structured the pupil-teacher relationship to give students greater responsibility for, and decision-making related to, their <b>own</b> <b>learning.</b> The model has evolved over the years to incorporate institutional power relationships (i.e., police-citizen, boss-employee) and informal ones (i.e. man-woman, rich-poor, adult-youth, parent-child). The ultimate aim is to develop societal relationships based on a restorative, [...] "partnership" [...] paradigm and mutual respect, rather than a retributive, fear-based, [...] "domination" [...] paradigm.|$|E

50|$|Harkness {{learning}} can vary, most notably between humanities {{subjects such as}} English and history and technical subjects such as math or physics. There are general principles and goals, however, {{that go along with}} that method regardless of subject matter. The main goal is to encourage students to come up with ideas of their <b>own,</b> <b>learn</b> good reasoning and discussion skills. Depending on style, the teacher may interact very little, interjecting only to guide the discussion.|$|R
2500|$|Under Empowered Learners, Gee {{includes}} the learning principles of “co-design,” “customize,” “identity,” and “manipulation and distributed knowledge.” [...] These principles incorporate {{the idea that}} an engaged student is active in designing and customizing their <b>own</b> <b>learning</b> experience, can learn by taking on new identities (e.g. in explore career paths or specialized skill sets in simulated roles), and feels “more expanded and empowered when they can manipulate powerful tools in intricate ways that extend their area of effectiveness" [...] (p.8).|$|E

2500|$|The Silent Way is a {{discovery}} learning approach, invented by Caleb Gattegno {{in the late}} 1950s. The teacher is largely silent, giving more space {{for the students to}} explore the language. [...] Students are responsible for their <b>own</b> <b>learning</b> and are encouraged to express themselves; beginners talk about what they see, more advanced students talk about their lives and what they think. [...] The role of the teacher is not to model the language but to correct mistakes by giving sensitive feedback. With respect to teaching pronunciation, the Silent Way {{is a good example of}} the Articulatory Approach.|$|E

[...] He also showed interest in hypnosis, but this was not his top priority in his work and research life. [...] In both his drive theory and hypnosis research, Hull made sure that his experiments were under strict control. [...] Also, in his work he emphasized quantitative data so everything could be analyzed more precisely, and less open to interpretation than previous studies on the topics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gradual release}} of {{responsibility}} model or GRR {{model is a}} particular style of teaching which is a structured method of pedagogy framed around a process devolving responsibility within the learning process from the teacher to the eventual independence of the learner. This instructional model requires that the teacher, by design, transitions from assuming [...] "all the responsibility for performing a task...to {{a situation in which}} the students assume all of the responsibility". The ideal result is a confident learner who accepts responsibility for their <b>own</b> <b>learning</b> and directs this learning through the cognitive processes involved, moving through the academic spectrum, to independent choice (personalised learning). As Buehl (2005) stated, the GRR model [...] "emphasizes instruction that mentors students into becoming capable thinkers and learners when handling the tasks with which they have not yet developed expertise".|$|E
2500|$|Richthofen's {{experiences}} were {{to serve the}} Luftwaffe well in the long-term and he was leading proponent of army support aviation at this time. His <b>own</b> <b>learning</b> curve in the war highlighted several issues that a modern air force would have to overcome. The most important issues concerned tactical and operational level warfare. Unlike the Italian officers from the Regia Aeronautica operating in Spain, the Germans put {{a great deal of}} effort into developing close air support doctrine in the late 1930s. Tactically, Richthofen found little need to retain anti-aircraft artillery to defend airfields. He pushed Flak units into the frontline to bolster the artillery units. Rapid fire 20mm calibres and 88mm weapons were first used in Spain and their effectiveness was reported to Berlin. Soon this tactic became part of Luftwaffe doctrine. [...] Richthofen was pleased with his idea, and the knowledge the [...] "Flak" [...] theorists in Berlin were not happy about using air defence artillery in the ground battle.|$|E

The respect was paid to the caste, and not to the individual, to his species, or to his nation.|$|R

2500|$|Nik Wallenda {{was born}} in Sarasota, Florida, on January 24, 1979, to Delilah Wallenda and Terry Troffer. At age two, his parents bought him a swing set. [...] Before Troffer had even {{finished}} assembling it, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar and did a somersault. [...] "And he did it perfectly," [...] Troffer recalls. [...] "I didn't teach him that." [...] Around the same time, he began performing {{with his family in}} their circus act. Wallenda's first public performance, dressed as a clown, was at SeaWorld San Diego in 1981. [...] He began to play on the wire at age two, walking back and forth while holding his mother's hand. At age four, he starting walking the wire on his <b>own,</b> <b>learning</b> primarily from his father. As a child, he would play on his parent's practice wire with his older sister Lijana, two feet (0.6 m) off the ground. [...] Wallenda's parents would throw objects at him as he practiced, and even shot him with a BB gun, to train him to deal with distractions. At age six, he first visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that one day he wanted to walk a tightrope across it. [...] He spent most of his youth on the road, living in a mobile home as his parents performed across America. [...] However, Wallenda says there was never any family pressure to become a circus performer.|$|E
