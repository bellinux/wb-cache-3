In either case, of course, the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable. One key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even {{a small amount of}} surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates. The difficulties in using gauge data are that 1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the <b>observation</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> undergo the necessary transmission, assembly, processing and quality control. Thus, precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates.

This formulation is motivated by energy constrained communications devices where sampling the signal, rather than transmitting or processing it, dominates energy consumption. We show that sequentially observing samples with the maximum a posteriori entropy can significantly reduce observation costs. Equivalently, observation costs identical to traditional coding are achieved at blocklengths that are an order of magnitude smaller. To put this in perspec-tive, our sampling strategy can be applied to realizing feedback systems that surpass the cutoff rate limit using the (24, 12) Golay code, the highest such performance reported over the AWGN channel at these blocklengths.

Generalizing the traditional concept of taking on-source/off-source observations of equal duration (e. g. 30 minutes ON followed by 30 minutes OFF), Faster Background Determination (FBD) permits an off-source observation {{with the same}} zenith angle distribution as the on-source observation to be obtained within less time. The method permits the on-source <b>observation</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be maximized without compromising {{the quality of the}} background determination. It also increases the signal significance for strong sources. The only modification necessary in the data acquisition is a small change to the tracking algorithm.

In this paper, we derive a low-complexity Robust Adaptive LCMV beamformer based on an Iterative Suboptimal solution (RAIS-LCMV) using conjugate gradient (CG) optimization method. The merit of our proposed method is threefold. Firstly, RAIS-LCMV beamformer can reduce the complexity of CF-LCMV remarkably.

40|$|Multiuser {{transmission}} {{methods for}} {{digital subscriber line}} (DSL) systems have become of interest {{with the potential for}} increased data rate and loop reach. These methods often assume that the set of crosstalk interferers, called the crosstalk profile, and their associated channel responses are known. For DSL systems, the interferers are often uncoordinated, so that in a dynamic environment where DSL transmitters can energize and deenergize, the crosstalk profile cannot be transmitted to the user of interest. While the crosstalk channel estimation problem in a dynamic environment can be intractable for general transmission systems, channel and crosstalk analysis can make use of the specific DSL environment. Namely, the physical channels in a DSL system do not change rapidly, and hence estimates of the crosstalk channel can be saved for future reference. For this reason, we introduce the concept of a channel profile. We develop several algorithms to detect the crosstalk profile and investigate the asymptotic behavior of the new algorithms. Simulations show that for typical crosstalk interference scenarios, the <b>observation</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> determine the correct crosstalk profile at probability of error less than 10 (- 3) can be less than 2 ms...|$|E

It is a slit camera with a field of view of 1 deg. 5 x 90 deg and scans the sky as the rotation of the ISS.

40|$|Interactions {{in nature}} can be {{described}} by their coupling strength, direction of coupling and coupling function. The coupling strength and directionality are relatively well understood and studied, at least for two interacting systems, however {{there can be a}} complexity in the interactions uniquely dependent on the coupling functions. Such a special case is studied here { synchronization transition occurs only due to the time-variability of the coupling functions, while the net coupling strength is constant throughout the <b>observation</b> <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> motivate the investigation, an example is used to present an analysis of cross-frequency coupling functions between delta and alpha brainwaves extracted from the electroencephalography (EEG) recording of a healthy human subject in a freerunning resting state. The results indicate that time-varying coupling functions are a reality for biological interactions. A model of phase oscillators is used to demonstrate and detect the synchronization transition caused by the varying coupling functions, during an invariant coupling strength. The ability to detect this phenomenon is discussed with the method of dynamical Bayesian inference, which was able to infer the time-varying coupling functions. The form of the coupling function acts as an additional dimension for the interactions and it should be taken into account when detecting biological or other interactions from data.
