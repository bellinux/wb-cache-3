5000|$|The 1990s {{witnessed}} dramatic innovations {{at every}} level of hierarchy from the tumbaos, to the sections built over repetitions of those tumbaos, to the way the sections were combined in the overall arrangement.Most pre-Revolution tumbaos last one clave before repeating. Two-clave tumbaos became dominant in the 1970s and 80s. By the 1990s, tumbao lengths of four claves were as common as two and sometimes extended to eight. <b>Odd</b> <b>lengths</b> such as three, five and six were also occasionally used. In this sense, timba {{can be seen as a}} continuation of the ongoing trend toward longer tumbaos, but overall length is only half of the story. Many of the tumbaos of the 70s and 80s applied a one-clave rhythm to a two-clave chord progression. With Latin jazz, and jazz-influenced salsa, the chord progression might extend to eight or even sixteen claves, but the basic rhythmic cell keeps repeating every clave. In the 1990s, even the two-clave tumbaos usually featured distinctly different rhythms for each half of the pattern.Zooming out a level to examine the larger mambo and coro sections built from the tumbaos, we immediately encounter a new type of arranging device which is almost entirely unique to timba. I call it the [...] "asymmetrical coro". Instead of a one- or two-clave coro followed by a lead vocal of the same length with the same progression, timba arrangers might follow a three-clave coro with a one-clave guía, a one-clave coro interjection and then a three-clave guía, all over an eight-clave chord progression. They might also provide different chord progressions for the coro and lead vocal.The horns were also part of the new paradigm. To review, the idea of using a horn section to play repeating riffs began with the diablo sections of Arsenio Rodríguez. Arsenio usually combined a coro and a horn riff over a one-clave tumbao. By the 1980s it had become standard for each arrangement to include several such sections, now called mambos, but featuring horns alone with no vocals. The horn mambos would alternate with coro/guía sections. Timba arrangers put a dramatic end to this type of predictable, formulaic arranging. By the time Charanga Habanera's David Calzado and Juan Carlos González hit their stride in 1993, no combination of horns, guías, coros and tumbao lengths was left unexplored and the possibilities were further multiplied by accompanying the hybrid mambos with a variety of rhythm section [...] "gears."—Moore (2010: v. 5: 12, 13).|$|E

40|$|Sequences having zero {{correlation}} {{zones are}} of vital importance in applications, for example, wireless communications and quasi-synchronous CDMA systems. In this thesis, we construct new near perfect sequences of odd and even lengths, {{and those of}} <b>odd</b> <b>lengths</b> are constructed here, for the first time. Near perfect sequences are a special category of zero correlation zone sequences. Near perfect sequences over roots of unity have many potential applications, in cellular communication systems, radar, position sensing and ultrasonic imaging. Our contribution consists of three parts. Part I: First, we provide a method of constructing new near perfect sequences of <b>odd</b> <b>lengths,</b> over the roots of unity. We use a completely orthogonal pair of sequences and a shift sequence obtained by folding a binary M-sequence of length 2 ^ 2 J- 1, row-wise, into a (2 ^J- 1) ×(2 ^J+ 1) array for J≥ 2. We provide many examples of near perfect sequences of <b>odd</b> <b>lengths,</b> illustrating our construction. We prove our main result, that near perfect sequences over the m^th roots of unity, m any odd prime, can be constructed for unbounded lengths. These lengths guarantee arbitrarily long zero correlation zones. Global Position Sensing (GPS) uses sequences of lengths approximately equal to 2 ^ 40. Our method {{can be used to}} construct new near perfect sequences of similar lengths, with very large zero correlation zones, since our construction produces near perfect sequences of unbounded lengths. To examine the universality of our construction, we perform an exhaustive computer search of near perfect sequences of length 15. We found that, of all sequences obtained, one third of the sequences were equivalent to our constructed sequences. We classify these sequences into three types. We also present a variation of our first construction of near perfect sequences. We obtain shift sequences by the method of folding M-sequences of length 2 ^ 2 J- 1, diagonally (rather than row-wise) into arrays with co-prime sizes. Part II: Next, we construct new near perfect sequences of even lengths, by concatenating two distinct near perfect sequences of the same odd length, under some given conditions. Part III: Finally, we examine some cross correlation sequences of some of our near perfect sequences of <b>odd</b> <b>lengths.</b> We find that, for each of our new near perfect sequences, say, s, the cross correlation between s and s^* is also near perfect...|$|E
