500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of <b>our</b> <b>objective,</b> their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|Iravan first {{appears as}} a minor {{character}} in the Mahabharata {{as the son of}} Arjuna, the chief hero of the epic. The background to the Mahabharata infers a date that is [...] "after the very early Vedic period" [...] and before [...] "the first Indian 'empire' was to rise in the third century B.C.", so [...] "somewhere in the eighth or ninth century". It is generally agreed, however, that [...] "Unlike the Vedas, which have to be preserved letter-perfect, the epic was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform to changes in language and style." [...] The earliest surviving components of this dynamic text are believed to be no older than the earliest external references to the epic, which may include an allusion in Panini's 4th-century grammar manual Ashtadhyayi (4:2:56). It is estimated that the Sanskrit text probably reached something of a [...] "final form" [...] by the early Gupta period (about the 4th century CE). The editor of the first great critical edition of the Mahabharata commented: [...] "It is useless to think of reconstructing a fluid text in a literally original shape, on the basis of an archetype and a stemma codicum. What then is possible? <b>Our</b> <b>objective</b> can only be to reconstruct the oldest form of the text which it is possible to reach {{on the basis of the}} manuscript material available." ...|$|E

On April 10, 1996, Forever... was released and was received favorably by both fans and critics, leading Earth AD Records in Germany and Immortal Records in Poland to sign licensing deals with Quo Vadis. Bart said of the album, [...] "We recorded a demo which was released as an EP on cassette last year. The reaction was very positive. We were still searching for direction at that time, experimenting with keyboards and femme vox. The music is much more focused now as we have found our sound. Forever... is much more aggressive then the EP was, it's much more melodic and intricate. That {{may sound like a}} contradiction but that is the case. I think we had more to say as musicians this time in the studio as well. <b>Our</b> <b>objective</b> was to keep the aggression and not to loose our edge.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} routing for supporting many-to-many communication and optimizing the Quality of Service (QoS) for the Secondary Users (SUs) in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN). The goal is to build the routing tree for many-to-many communication that optimizes the delay, rate {{and the number of}} transmission links. We model the network using the Multi-Layer Hyper Graph, and we model the optimization problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We also study the problem of many-to-many communication schedul-ing in CRNs. We employ a modified version of an Ant Colony optimization algorithm (MOACS) to solve our problem of finding the routing tree that optimizes <b>our</b> <b>objectives.</b> <b>Our</b> simulation results show that the performance of MOACS outperforms the Shortest-Path Tree (SPT) in all <b>our</b> <b>objectives.</b> Index Terms—Many-to-many communication, group commu-nication, cognitive radio network, scheduling, multi-objective optimization, ant colony system.
