50|$|The trophozoite is the feeding, dividing, and infective {{stage for}} humans. The trophozoite {{attaches}} to olfactory epithelium, where it follows the <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> axon through the cribriform plate (in the nasal cavity) to the brain. This reproductive {{stage of the}} protozoan organism, which transforms near 25 °C (77 °F) and grows fastest around 42 °C (106.7 °F), proliferates by binary fission. The trophozoites are characterized by a nucleus and a surrounding halo. They travel by pseudopodia, {{which means that they}} extend parts of their body's cell membrane (the pseudopods) and then fill them with plasma to force locomotion. The pseudopods form at different points along the cell, thus allowing the trophozoite to change directions. In their free-living state, trophozoites feed on bacteria. In tissues, they phagocytize (consume by enclosing and then digesting prey) red blood cells and white blood cells, destroying tissue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first stop}} in the {{olfactory}} system is the olfactory epithelium, or tissue resting {{on the roof of}} the nasal cavity which houses smell receptors. Smell receptors are bipolar neurons that bind odorants from the air and congregate at the olfactory nerve before passing axons to the dendrites of mitral cells in the olfactory bulb. Sensory receptors in the mouth and nose are polarized at resting state, and they depolarize in response to some change in environment, such as coming in contact with odor molecules. Odor molecules, consisting of hydrocarbon chains with functional groups, bind to sensory receptors in the nose and mouth. Properties of functional groups include: (1) length of carbon chain, (2) terminal group, which concord with differences associated with different smells, (3) side group, (4) chirality, (5) shape, and (6) size. When odor molecules bind to sensory receptors, they do so in according to these properties. Each <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> has a single type of receptor, but that receptor can be “broadly tuned” and odor molecules further interact at the receptor level, meaning that, in certain cases, an odor molecule alone may not bind to a receptor, but in the presence of another odor molecule, the original would bind and thus create a sensation of smell only in the presence of the second molecule.|$|E

SgIGSF is expressed not only in spermatogenic cells but also in lung and liver epithelial cells and in neurons and glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the present study, we examined the expression and localization of SgIGSF in mouse olfactory epithelium before and after transection of the olfactory nerves, by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. In normal olfactory mucosa, SgIGSF showed 100 kDa in molecular weight, which was identical with that in the lung but different from that in the brain.

In addition, nanoparticles (NPs) have been described as efficient shuttles for direct nose-to-brain delivery of drugs. Nevertheless, there are few studies describing NP nose-to-brain transport. Thus, the aim of this work was (i) to develop, characterize and validate in vitro <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> monolayers and (ii) to study the transport of polymeric- and lipid-based NPs across these monolayers in order to estimate NP access into the brain using cell penetrating peptide (CPPs) moieties: Tat and Penetratin (Pen).

Nevertheless, 0. 7 % of PLGA NPs was able to cross the <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> monolayers, whereas 8 % and 22 % of NLC and chitosan-coated NLC (CS-NLC) were transported across them, respectively. Moreover, the incorporation of CPPs to NLC surface significantly increased their transport, reaching 46 % of transported NPs.

40|$|Polysialic acid is a developmentally regulated, {{anti-adhesive}} polymer that {{is added}} to N-glycans on the fifth immunoglobulin domain (Ig 5) of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). We found that the first fibronectin type III repeat (FN 1) of NCAM {{is required for the}} polysialylation of N-glycans on the adjacent Ig 5 domain, and we proposed that the polysialyltransferases recognize specific sequences in FN 1 to position themselves for Ig 5 N-glycan polysialylation. Other studies identified a novel FN 1 acidic surface patch and α-helix that play roles in NCAM polysialylation. Here, we characterize the contribution of two additional FN 1 sequences, Pro 510 -Tyr 511 -Ser 512 (PYS) and Gln 516 -Val 517 -Gln 518 (QVQ). Replacing PYS or the acidic patch dramatically decreases the O-glycan polysialylation of a truncated NCAM protein, and replacing the α-helix or QVQ shifts polysialic acid to FN 1 O-glycans in full-length NCAM. We also found that the FN 1 domain of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule, a homologous but unpolysialylated protein, could partially replace NCAM FN 1. Inserting Pro 510 -Tyr 511 eliminated N-glycan polysialylation and enhanced O-glycosylation of an NCAM- <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule chimera, and inserting other FN 1 sequences unique to NCAM, predominantly the acidic patch, created a new polysialyltransferase recognition site. Taken together, our results highlight the role of the FN 1 α-helix and QVQ sequences in N-glycan polysialylation and demonstrate that the acidic patch primarily functions in O-glycan polysialylation...|$|E

However, the postnatal morphofunctional adaptations of olfactory mucosa (OM) are not fully elucidated. To clarify on the extent and the pattern of refinement of the OM following birth in the rabbit, morphologic and morphometric analysis of the mucosa were done at neonatal (0 - 1 days), suckling (2 weeks), weanling (4 weeks), and adult (6 - 8 months) stages of postnatal development. In all the age groups, the basic components of the OM were present. However, proliferative activity of cells of the mucosal epithelium decreased with increasing age as revealed by Ki- 67 immunostaining.

Multiple forebrain progenitor domains contribute to the cellular diversity of the olfactory cortex, which is invaded simultaneously by cells originating in distinct germinal areas in the dorsal and ventral forebrain.

40|$|Transplants {{of cells}} {{obtained}} from the olfactory system are a potential treatment for spinal cord injury {{and a number of}} clinical trials are in progress. However, the extent to which transplants improve recovery of function remains unclear and there are contradictory reports {{on the extent to which}} they support axonal regeneration. Here, we have used anatomical and electrophysiological techniques to investigate the repair promoted by <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> transplants after a dorsal column lesion. Since the use of olfactory cells of varying type and origin may contribute to the differing outcomes of previous studies, regeneration of dorsal column axons was compared following transplants of pure olfactory ensheathing cells from neonatal animals and mixed olfactory cells from both neonatal and adult rats. Two to three months after lesioning, numerous regenerating fibres could be seen in each type of transplant. However, tracing of ascending dorsal column fibres showed that few regenerated beyond the lesion, even when transplanted with mixed olfactory cells from the adult olfactory bulb which have previously been reported to support regeneration which bridges a lesion. Despite the absence of axonal regeneration across the injury site, <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> transplants led to improved spinal cord function in sensory pathways investigated electrophysiologically. When cord dorsum potentials (CDPs), evoked by electrical stimulation of the L 4 /L 5 dorsal roots, were recorded from the spinal cord above and below a lesion at the lumbar 3 / 4 level, CDPs recorded from transplanted animals were significantly larger than those recorded from lesioned controls. In addition, sensory evoked potentials recorded over the sensorimotor cortex were larger and detectable over a more extensive area in transplanted animals. These results provide direct evidence that transplants of olfactory cells preserve the function of circuitry in the region of the lesion site and of ascending pathways originating near the injury. These actions, rather than axonal regeneration, may help ameliorate the effects of spinal cord injury...|$|E

The model is the longest experimentally based composite structural model of an entire IgCAM ectodomain. It displays an essentially linear arrangement of IgI–V, followed by bends between IgV and Fn 3 I and between Fn 3 I and Fn 3 II. Proteins containing IgI–IgII domains formed stable homodimers in solution and in crystals. Dimerization could be disrupted in vitro by mutations in the dimer interface region. In conjunction with the bent ectodomain conformation, which can position IgI–V parallel with the cell surface, the IgI–IgII dimerization enables OCAM-mediated trans-interactions with an intercellular distance of about 20  nm, which is consistent with that observed in synapses...|$|E

The <b>olfactory</b> <b>cells</b> could be divided into the following two types of responses. (1) R-Type I: Only 2 -butanone was effective for all cells of this type. The impulse frequency increased with increase of stimulus concentration. The slope of the dose-resoonse curve was relatively steep. Threshold concentration of the individual <b>olfactory</b> <b>cells</b> varied in the value. Impulse discharges of some of the cells to 2 -butanone disappeared of decreased by stimulus of the mixture with other four odors.

The dose-response curve to 2 -butanone of this type of cells resembled with that of R-Type I.

Cell adhesion molecules are increasingly recognized as regulators of these processes. Here we report {{the expression of the}} <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule (OCAM/NCAM 2 /RNCAM) during mouse spinal cord development and in neural stem cells cultured as neurospheres. OCAM is also weakly expressed in the dormant adult stem cell niche around the central canal and is overexpressed after spinal cord injury. Both transmembrane (TM) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -linked isoforms are present in neurospheres. Electron microscopy and internalisation experiments revealed a dynamic trafficking of OCAM between the membrane and intracellular compartments. After differentiation, OCAM remains in neurons and oligodendrocytes whereas no expression is detected in astrocytes. Using OCAM knockout (KO) mice, we found that mutant spinal cord stem cells showed an increased {{proliferation and}} self-renewal rates although no effect on differentiation was observed. This effect was reversed by lentivirus-mediated re-introduction of OCAM. Mechanistically, we identified the ErbB 2 /Neu/HER 2 protein as being implicated in the enhanced proliferation of mutant cells. ErbB 2 protein expression and phosphorylation level were significantly increased in KO cells whereas no difference was observed at the mRNA level. Overexpression of ErbB 2 in wild-type and mutant cells also increased their growth while reintroduction of OCAM in mutant cells reduced the level of phosphorylated ErbB 2. These results indicate that OCAM exerts a posttranscriptional control on the ErbB 2 signalling in spinal cord stem cells. This study adds further support for considering cell adhesion molecules as regulators of the ErbB signalling...|$|E
40|$|Vinblastine {{sulphate}} (VBS) is an anticancer {{drug that}} acts by disrupting microtubule dynamics of highly mitotic tissue cells. The consequences of VBS on the olfactory mucosa (OM), a tissue with high mitotic numbers, are not clearly understood. We used {{qualitative and quantitative}} methods to determine the structural changes that may be produced on the rabbit OM by VBS. Following a single dose (0. 31 mg/kg) of this drug, {{the structure of the}} mucosa was greatly altered on the first 3 - 5 days. The alteration was characterized by disarrangement of the normal layering of nuclei of the epithelia, degeneration of axonal bundles, occurrence of blood vessels within the bundles, localized death of cells of Bowman's glands and glandular degeneration. Surprisingly on or after day 7 and progressively to day 15 post-exposure, the OM was observed to regenerate and acquire normal morphology, and the vessels disappeared from the bundles. Relative to control values, bundle diameters, <b>olfactory</b> <b>cell</b> densities and cilia numbers decreased to as low as 53. 1, 75. 2 and 71. 4 %, respectively, on day 5. Volume density for the bundles, which was 28. 6 % in controls, decreased to a lowest value of 16. 8 % on day 5. In contrast, the volume density for the blood vessels was significantly lower in controls (19. 9 %) than in treated animals at day 2 (25. 8 %), day 3 (34. 3 %) and day 5 (31. 5 %). These findings suggest that the changes induced on the rabbit OM by VBS are transient and that regenerative recovery leads to the restoration of the normal structure of the mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{look for}} changes in human {{olfactory}} epithelium, related with age and gender. Materials and Methods: This study {{was carried out in}} the Department of Anatomy, University of Health Sciences, Lahore. Eighty tissue samples (forty for either sex) were collected from cadavers ranging from 30 to 82 years of age. The tissues were decalcified, processed, stained with H&E and observed under light microscope. Results: In age group 30 - 39 years (male and female), at places respiratory epithelium was seen in the area of olfactory epithelium. In age group of 40 - 49 years, changes were observed as occasional short epithelial invaginations, and disturbance of zonal distribution of <b>olfactory</b> and supporting <b>cells.</b> In age group 50 - 59 years, changes observed were: substantial {{reduction in the number of}} nuclei resulting in decreased height of epithelium, disturbance of zonal distribution and presence of epithelial invaginations. The age group of 60 years onwards showed gradual thinning of epithelium, epithelial invaginations, and in few cases atrophied olfactory epithelium devoid of <b>olfactory</b> <b>cells.</b> ANOVA showed significant age related decrease in number of <b>olfactory</b> <b>cells</b> among male and female groups. The loss of <b>olfactory</b> <b>cells</b> was pronounced in individuals of> 50 years of age. Conclusion: There is decline in the sense of olfaction with age possibly due to the mechanism of reduction in the number of olfactory receptors; in addition no evident sex related differences were seen in these groups.

40|$|Olfactory mucosa, {{the sense}} organ of smell, is an adult tissue that is {{regenerated}} and repaired throughout life {{to maintain the}} integrity of the sense of smell. When the sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium die they are replaced by proliferation of stem cells and their axons grow from the nose to brain assisted by <b>olfactory</b> ensheathing <b>cells</b> located in the lamina propria beneath the sensory epithelium. When transplanted into the site of traumatic spinal cord injury in rat, olfactory lamina propria or purified <b>olfactory</b> ensheathing <b>cells</b> promote behavioural recovery and assist regrowth of some nerves in the spinal cord. A Phase I clinical trial demonstrated that autologous <b>olfactory</b> ensheathing <b>cell</b> transplantation is safe, with no adverse outcomes recorded for three years following transplantation. Autologous olfactory mucosa transplantation is also being investigated in traumatic spinal cord injury although this whole tissue contains many cells in addition to <b>olfactory</b> ensheathing <b>cells,</b> including stem <b>cells.</b> If <b>olfactory</b> ensheathing <b>cells</b> are proven therapeutic for human spinal cord injury there are several important practical issues that will need to be solved before they reach general clinical application.
