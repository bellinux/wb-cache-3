40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to compare, along three strategic dimensions, franchising with other types of <b>operating</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the lodging industry. The <b>operating</b> <b>arrangements</b> studied are, in additlon to franchising, chain-managed and independent hotels. The three strategic dimensions include: (I) the variability or volatility of the task environment facing a hotel; (2) the business strategy chosen by a hotel's general manager; and (3) the level of sales revenue and profit margin achieved by a hotel. The strategic management literature argues that an organization can only achieve superior performance when the charactetistics of its task environment, its business strategy, and its decision structure (i. 8 [...] operating method or extent of veriical integration) are maligned. Thus, comparing franchising with the two other <b>operating</b> <b>arrangements</b> along these dimensbns seems to be a first step in determining franchising's role in successful strategic coalgnments.

50|$|Mining, {{the basic}} {{industry}} in this region, suffered a severe decline {{soon after the}} Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad Company was completed. The decline of the mining resources soon led, in 1908, to a joint <b>operating</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the Tonopah & Tidewater Railroad Company under a holding company incorporated in Delaware as the Tonopah & Tidewater Company. The failure of this arrangement {{to bring about the}} desired financial improvement led to a reorganization in June, 1914, whereby the parallel line of the Las Vegas & Tonopah Railroad Company was eliminated and the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad Company passed {{under the control of the}} latter company, with which it has since been operated as a continuous road, but as a distinct corporation.|$|E

40|$|The {{business}} of providing pickup and delivery service for intercity passengers flourishes in Indonesia. In Lampung Province, {{it is available}} to popular destinations, including Jakarta, Palembang, and Bakauheni. To date, there is no detailed information regarding operating characteristics, highlighting {{the importance of this}} research for future reference. The data for analysis were collected through a series of field surveys on service frequency and passenger and driver interviews conducted at the ferry terminal of Bakauheni. Results of the analysis suggest that there are too many vehicles operating on the Bandar Lampung-Bakauheni route. The implications are that the total number of trips, the number of passengers carried, and crew income per vehicle per day are limited. The vehicle queuing and dispatching system needs to be improved to prevent passengers from waiting too long. The conclusion is that this business is profitable only if there is a good <b>operating</b> <b>arrangement...</b>|$|E
40|$|A legal {{doctrine}} {{conceived in}} ambiguity seldom achieves clarity {{with the passage}} of time. Such had been the experience with the Noerr-Penningon doctrine, the principal focus of this article. In its first Noerr-Pennington decision in 16 years, Allied Tube 2 ̆ 6 Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., the Supreme Court created new uncertainties. However, it also offered hope for resolution of some of the inconsistencies that have plagued the doctrine. It did this by distinguishing sharply between harm caused directly by petitioning activity (for which petitioners may be liable), and harm caused by requested government action (for which petitioners may not), and by recasting the 2 ̆ 2 sham exception 2 ̆ 2 as being narrower and less important than some courts had held. Whether Allied Tube will eventually lead Noerr-Pennington out of its 2 ̆ 2 quagmire 2 ̆ 2 remains to be seen. This article will discuss Allied Tube, most of the recent Noerr-Pennington developments, and, for the issues raised by these developments, the implications of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion. In addition, the paper will briefly consider two recent cases that struggle with the tension between competition policy and the first amendment, even though their outcomes did not turn on Noerr. In Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association v. Federal Trade Commission, the D. C. Circuit rebuffed an FTC challenge to a publicized 2 ̆ 2 strike 2 ̆ 2 by the attorneys who regularly accept court appointments to represent indigent defendants. The court ruled that the first amendment might protect the challenged activity even though Noerr did not. The second case, Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press v. Attorney General of the United States, interprets the Newspaper Preservation Act. That Act embodies a congressional balancing of concerns about concentration and the preservation of diverse reportorial and editorial voices. On August 8, 1988, Attorney General Meese issued a troubling decision applying that Act and approving a proposed Joint <b>Operating</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (JOA) between The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press. A subsequent challenge to that opinion has been rejected by a district court and, as of this writing, is on appeal...|$|E

Monetary instruments are employed by the central bank and fiscal instruments are employed by ministry of finance. The objectives and implications of policy measures taken by the two institutions often conflict with each other and thus call for policy coordination for effective implementation of policy decisions to achieve the set targets. The policy coordination has to be supported by concrete institutional and <b>operating</b> <b>arrangements</b> like monetary and fiscal coordination board. In Pakistan there was no concept of such policy coordination before financial sector reforms which were initiated in 1989 - 90.

5000|$|The United States, Australia, and to {{a lesser}} extent Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Kingdom, and Japan have [...] "deregulated" [...] their airlines. In the past, these governments {{dictated}} airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own <b>operating</b> <b>arrangements</b> with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.|$|R
