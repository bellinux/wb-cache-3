5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{considered}} the above 'fairy lover' tradition {{to be connected}} to another about a lullaby. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in {{the last half of the}} 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> and sang him a lullaby. This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right.|$|E

25|$|The first coins {{produced}} by the Geto-Dacians were imitations of silver coins of the Macedonian kings Philip II and Alexander III (the Great). Early in the 1st century BC, the Dacians replaced these with silver denarii of the Roman Republic, both official coins of Rome exported to Dacia, as well as locally made imitations of them. The Roman province Dacia is represented on the Roman sestertius coin as a woman seated on a rock, holding an aquila, a small child <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee.</b> The aquila holds ears of grain, and another small child is seated before her holding grapes.|$|E

But less than a month before the Olympics, they came to know that the injury was more serious than expected, forcing her to undergo surgery, ruling her out of London.

25|$|The Jesse {{window of}} 1892 by Lavers & Westlake is a {{colourful}} design. All {{the figures are}} seated in the vine except for the Virgin Mary who is seated within a flowering virga, outside the vine. Above her head are seven doves representing the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. The figures in the window are; in the first light - Hezekiah, Solomon, Melchizedek. Middle light - Jesse, David, the Virgin and Christchild <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee.</b> Third light - Jehoshaphat, Asa, and Isaiah. The three light window {{is dedicated to the}} Honourable J J Carnagie born 8 July 1807 died 18 January 1892, placed in the church by Henry Allen Rolls (brother of the co-founder of Rolls Royce Limited) in 1892.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} of later paintings impersonating Circe {{have a history}} of sexual experience behind them, starting with “Mary Spencer in the character of Circe” by William Caddick, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter George Stubbs. A portrait of “Mrs Nesbitt as Circe” by Joshua Reynolds followed in 1781. Though this lady’s past was ambiguous, she had connections with those in power and was used by the Government as a secret agent. In the painting she is seated sideways, wearing a white, loose-fitting dress, with a wand in her right hand and a gilded goblet near her left. A monkey is crouching above her in the branches of a tree and a panther fraternizes with the kitten <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee.</b> While the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation, it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character.|$|E

25|$|Parvati, {{the gentle}} aspect of Devi Shakti, is usually {{represented}} as fair, beautiful, and benevolent. She typically wears a red dress (often a sari), {{and may have}} a head-band. When depicted alongside Shiva, she generally appears with two arms, but when alone, she may be depicted having four. These hands may hold a conch, crown, mirror, rosary, bell, dish, farming tool such as goad, sugarcane stalk, or flowers such as lotus. One of her arms in front {{may be in the}} Abhaya mudra (hand gesture for 'fear not'), one of her children, typically Ganesha, is <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee,</b> while her younger son Skanda may be playing near her in her watch. In ancient temples, Parvati's sculpture is often depicted near a calf or cow - a source of food. Bronze has been the chief metal for her sculpture, while stone is next most common material.|$|E
500|$|Blyton's {{daily routine}} varied little over the years.

Stopping only for a short lunch break she continued writing until five o'clock, by which time she would usually have produced 6,000–10,000 words.|$|E
500|$|Tracks on {{this album}} include [...] "E Pari Ra", [...] "One Fine Day", [...] "Let Me Lie", [...] "Danny Boy", and [...] "Abide with Me". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also {{features}} singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with {{a real sense of}} history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 23, Berkman gained {{access to}} Frick's office with a {{concealed}} handgun and shot Frick three times, then stabbed him in the leg. A group of workers—far from joining in his attentat—beat Berkman unconscious, and he was carried away by the police. Berkman was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman suffered during his long absence. [...] Convinced Goldman {{was involved in the}} plot, police raided her apartment and—finding no evidence—pressured her landlord into evicting her. Worse, the attentat had failed to rouse the masses: workers and anarchists alike condemned Berkman's action. Johann Most, their former mentor, lashed out at Berkman and the assassination attempt. Furious at these attacks, Goldman brought a toy horsewhip to a public lecture and demanded, onstage, that Most explain his betrayal. He dismissed her, whereupon she struck him with the whip, broke it <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee,</b> and hurled the pieces at him. She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend: [...] "At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason." ...|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{said that}} the episode was [...] "still satisfying, even when it's {{not one of the}} show's funnier episodes", but [...] "it's a bit of a shame this episode wasn't a home run, because having Dwight and Michael hit the clubs is a funny idea." [...] Fickett went on to praise the episode's awkward moment between Toby and Pam, when Toby placed his hand on Pam's leg, and Toby's {{subsequent}} escape by hopping the fence. Fickett stated that, for Toby's growing love of Pam, and growing jealousy of Jim, [...] "this is pretty great pay off". Claire Zulkey, a writer for the Los Angeles Times, was not as pleased with the episode. Zulkey wrote [...] "that when it's at its zaniest, The Office is at its worst", and the episode was [...] "just too silly to be funny". Zulkey did say that [...] "it was hilarious to see him [...] let his hand more-than-linger <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> and then abruptly flee the premises by jumping over the fence and running home." [...] In a poll done by Office fansite OfficeTally.com, viewers ranked [...] "Night Out" [...] as the 13th-most popular episode out of the 14 episodes of season four.|$|E
