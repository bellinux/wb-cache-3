Introduction A first step towards the construction of Runge-Kutta methods is thecalculation of the <b>order</b> <b>conditions</b> that the coefficients have to obey. In the old days they were obtained by expanding the error term ina Taylor series by hand, a procedure which for higher orders sooner or later runs into difficulties because of the largely increasing combi-natorial complexity. It was a major break-through when Butcher [1] published his result of systematically describing <b>order</b> <b>conditions</b> byrooted trees.

The <b>order</b> <b>conditions</b> correspond to a certain subsets of the set of ordered rooted trees. We discuss ways to select these subsets and their combinatorial properties. We also suggest how the reuse of flow calculations can be included {{in order to reduce}} the computational cost. In the case that at most two flow calculations are admitted in each stage, the <b>order</b> <b>conditions</b> simplify substantially.

The standard <b>order</b> <b>conditions</b> analysis involves the GL matrix itself and a starting procedure; however, a finishing method (F) {{is required to}} extract the actual ODE solution. The standard order analysis and stability are sufficient for the convergence of any GL method. Nonetheless, using a simple GL scheme, we show that the order definition may be too restrictive. Specifically, the order for GL methods with low order intermediate components may be underestimated.
