50|$|The TSFAs 2009 season saw the {{contract}} with Holy Cross High School continue while only playing a handful of games at The Winston School. The Bucs returned and the Outlawz name returned to the scene while the Ruff Ryders had a name and <b>owner</b> <b>change</b> while a rookie team {{stepped out onto the}} field. Tays Newsletter expanded to more regular blogs and also into online videos with a name change to TSFA Live. 2009 saw the fall of {{what was left of the}} Bandits dynasty as they went 1-8 and forfeit the rest of their games after week 8. The Revolution won the North in the regular season with the Bulldawgs landing on top of the standings for their first time. The Revolution were upset by Carlos Garcia and the Bucs in round 1 of the playoffs and the Bulldawgs couldnt handle the Renegades in the conference championships. The Outlawz easily defeated the Bucs in the conference championship and made it to Epler Cup XI. Playing under the lights for the first time in TSFA history the Outlawz and Renegades went into the first ever Epler Cup overtime game with the Renegades pulling it out 38 to 32. The South destroyed the North 32 to 6 in the fourth annual All-Star game.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we use a}} {{production}} function approach to {{examine the impact of}} ownership concentration, product market competition and financial pressure on German firm productivity. Additionally, we are interested in the influence of ownership identity and changes in ownership structure. We also test whether the specificity of assets affects productivity performance. Based on a panel of 361 German manufacturing companies for the time period of 1991 - 1996 we find that supplier concentration has a positive influence on firm productivity. There is also some evidence for a discipline-of-debt effect. Interestingly, the presence of several strong shareholders affects productivity negatively. In high sunk costs industries an <b>owner</b> <b>change</b> is negatively correlated with firm productivity whereas in low sunk costs industries productivity increases after owners have changed. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the field}} of {{studying}} factors that influence infrastructure sustainability (IS), it seems that cultural influences are scarcely mentioned compared with social, economic and environmental influences. So we aim to explore relationships between cultures and IS in this study by analyzing how national culture influences infrastructures’ owner attitudes and behaviors when an infrastructure project is implemented. A case study method is adopted including four projects in China, United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka. Data is collected through interviews. Differences on aspects of IS of the four projects are found and discussed {{on the basis of}} Hofstede's theory. It was found that among the five dimensions in Hofstede's theory, IDV, UAI and LTO help explain most of the difference. In the end, a framework is formed to reveal the relationship between culture and IS. Gaining information on the relationships is of great importance to help infrastructure <b>owner</b> <b>change</b> their mind to promote IS level...|$|E
40|$|Intraspecific cleptoparasitism {{represents}} a facultative strategy advantageous for reducing {{time and energy}} costs. However, only a few studies about nesting dynamics have described intraspecific cleptoparasitic behaviour in obligate solitary bees. We focused on nesting dynamics with the characterisation of nest owner replacements and frequency of true usurpation in four aggregating species belonging to different phylogenetic lineages – Andrena vaga (Andrenidae), Anthophora plumipes (Apidae), Colletes cunicularius (Colletidae), and Osmia rufa (Megachilidae). Our study, based on the regular observation of individually marked females, shows that nest owner replacement affects 10 – 45 % of nests across all of the studied species and years. However, 39 – 90 % of these nests had been abandoned before <b>owner</b> <b>change</b> and thus true nest usurpations represent {{only a part of}} observed nest replacement cases. Females tend to abandon their nests regularly and found new ones when they live long enough, which is in accordance with risk-spreading strategy. We suggest that the original facultative strategy of observed solitary bees during nest founding is not cleptoparasitism per se but rather reuse of any pre-existing nest (similar to ‘‘entering’ ’ strategy in apoid wasps). This is supported by gradual increase of nests founded by ‘‘entering’ ’ during the season with {{an increase in the number}} of available nests. Although the frequent reuse of conspecific nests results in frequent contact between solitary females, and rarely, in the short-term coexistence of two females in one nest, we detected unexpectedly low level of conflict in these neighbourhood societies. We suggest that nesting dynamic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is {{impossible}} to avoid changes in construction projects. Construction changes have minor and major effects {{on the success of}} a project, particularly on its cost. A detailed study of change is needed to alleviate such effects on project cost. This paper introduces the identification of specific change issues regarding costs that may lead to conflicts between the owner and the contractor of a project. Such identification would help project practitioners be aware of change issues and manage them effectively as well as open up alternative viewpoints of change by the two parties. To achieve the research objective, a 16 -item questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale was conducted to collect the necessary information. The data were collected from respondents in Cambodian building construction projects. Responses from 53 professionals working for contractors and owners were analysed with the aid of software package, Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The result of tests passed internal reliability of the scale and significant agreement among the respondents. The analysis of a one sample t-test showed that there were fifteen significant and important change issues. The five top priority change issues related to project costs are changes in scheduling made by the owner, project scope change made by the <b>owner,</b> <b>change</b> due to poor and incomplete design, change in design functions required by owner/client, and change in material specifications. The research findings would be beneficial to all project participants for gaining a deeper understanding of specific change issues so that change management can be carried out more efficiently. In addition, project stakeholders would be more perceptive about the consequences of any changes...|$|E

40|$|Adaptive re-use of {{heritage}} buildings in George Town has gained attention from their owners. Their owners either private owners or government, want to adapt their respective buildings to new usage for instance {{to become a}} gallery, museum, restaurant, boutique hotel and many more. Every heritage building that is being adapted to paper main objective is to identify the changes made in terms of structure, space and material when adapting the heritage buildings to a new usage specifically into a gallery. Two heritage buildings are chosen as case studies for this paper which are Rumah Teh Bunga and Fort Cornwallis; both buildings located in Penang, Malaysia. The changes made to these two buildings were analyzed using the guidelines provided which are Guideline for Conservation areas and Heritage Buildings and National Heritage Acts 2005. Both buildings will be analyzed using National Heritage Acts, while only Fort Cornwallis will be analyzed using Guideline for Conservation areas and Heritage Buildings. Adaptation of these two heritage buildings requires changes in structure, space and material. The changes in Rumah Teh Bunga focuses more on materials and space while changes in Fort Cornwallis emphasize more to space and addition of other structures. Analysis on the changes are made by using the guideline provided, most of the changes made to both of these heritage buildings comply {{the rules and regulations}} stated in the guideline. It was found from the data that some of the reasons on why the <b>owner</b> <b>change</b> Rumah Teh Bunga to gallery are because of its complicated procedure that involves in privatization of this building to other owner and the need to promote the heritage significance of this building to the public. As for Fort Cornwallis, the adaptation is more on strengthening its value as a fort and becoming a tourist attraction...|$|E
