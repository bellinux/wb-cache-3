5|$|Only {{three classes}} of pigment (ommochromes, bilins and guanine) have been {{identified}} in spiders, although other pigments have been detected but not yet characterized. Melanins, carotenoids and pterins, very common in other animals, are apparently absent. In some species, the exocuticle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> and prosoma is modified by a tanning process, resulting in brown coloration.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in {{the early}} nineteenth century, a storm washed away one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> leaving it much as it is today, {{although}} erosion continues. By 1992 a 40-metre (130ft) crack had appeared {{in the top of the}} south face, leaving a large overhanging section that will eventually collapse.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} chairs started In ancient Egypt chairs {{appear to have}} been of great {{richness}} and splendour. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly materials and supported upon representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> of beasts or the figures of captives.|$|E
50|$|The plantaris is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{superficial}} muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superficial {{posterior compartment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fascial compartments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|R

5|$|The non-reproductive castes of {{termites}} are wingless {{and rely}} exclusively on their six legs for locomotion. The alates fly {{only for a}} brief amount of time, so they also rely on their legs. The appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> is similar in each caste, but the soldiers have larger and heavier legs. The structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> is consistent with other insects: the parts of a leg include a coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and the tarsus. The number of tibial spurs on an individual's leg varies. Some species of termite have an arolium, located between the claws, which is present in species that climb on smooth surfaces but is absent in most termites.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{appearance}} of the Saluki is one of grace and symmetry. Two coat types—smooth and feathered—are evident in the breed's gene pool. The latter variety has light feathering on the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> and thighs. The fur on both types is silky and is low-shedding {{when compared to other}} breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs,</b> pelvis and sacrum of the Rodrigues and red rail {{were generally}} similar. The Rodrigues rail {{differed from the}} red rail by having a broader and shorter skull, longer and lower nostrils, a proportionately longer humerus, a shorter, stouter femur, {{as well as a}} considerably different plumage, based on early descriptions.|$|E
50|$|Partial: An {{irregular}} marking {{that only}} extends up part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> to <b>the</b> height indicated, sometimes with <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> dark. Usually {{used to describe}} socks and other short markings.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> or foot, is {{considered}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leg; {{other times it}} {{is considered}} separate. Similarly, the hip joint or other place where <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> attaches to <b>the</b> main body may be considered separate or part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|R
25|$|On May 15, 2012, testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> {{began with}} two LRT cars. As <b>the</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> moved towards completion, four LRT cars were used, until revenue service began on December 10, 2012.|$|R
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the medial surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E
5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
5|$|There may be {{symptoms}} of thyroid overactivity, such as weight loss, a fast heart rate, tremor, and perspiration; but such symptoms occur in {{only half of}} all cases. The {{most common type of}} hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease, may additionally cause eye problems (Graves' ophthalmopathy) and skin changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> (pretibial myxedema). Thyroid disease may also cause muscle weakness in the form of thyrotoxic myopathy, but this is constant rather than episodic.|$|E

50|$|A peroneal {{strike is}} a {{temporarily}} disabling {{blow to the}} common peroneal nerve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> just above <b>the</b> knee. The attacker aims roughly a hand span above <b>the</b> exterior side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee, towards <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> This causes a temporary loss of motor control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> accompanied by numbness and a painful tingling sensation from <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> impact all <b>the</b> way down <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> usually lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes in duration.|$|R

5|$|They have a {{moderately}} long single coat with no undercoat. Feathering of the fur {{appears on the}} chest, belly, ears and on the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs.</b> The coat is not as heavy {{as that of a}} Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docked tails were often used in working dogs, as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} a genetic {{disorder}} in which copper builds up in the body. Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver. Liver related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, swelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs,</b> yellowish skin, and itchiness. Brain related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and seeing or hearing things that others do not.|$|E
5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{interosseous}} membrane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> (middle tibiofibular ligament) extends between <b>the</b> interosseous crests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tibia and fibula, helps {{stabilize the}} Tib-Fib relationship and separates the muscles {{on the front}} from those on <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is a {{variation}} upon <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> wrap where instead <b>of</b> outstretching <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> it is bent to 90 degrees at the knee, with <b>the</b> lower portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> {{turned out to}} the side. The string/chain then contacts with and winds round <b>the</b> ankle instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> <b>The</b> ankle wrap is usually not carried out on both legs at once as this requires jumping, which is exceptionally difficult to carry out at the required height and speed to complete the move before requiring to land.|$|R
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs),</b> fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs.</b> To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas. Individuals {{found in the}} west of its geographic range (areas like the Great Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler complexion on the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> and underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit {{a fair amount of}} diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E
40|$|A 55 {{year old}} woman {{with pain and}} {{swelling}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> was heparinized on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a clinically diagnosed ilio-femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{frequently}} {{observe a}} tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saphenous vein with the origin in <b>the</b> saphenous compartment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> It runs transversally in the interfascial compartment toward <b>the</b> lateral aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> Constantly it feeds by reflux varicose veins clinically {{visible in the}} paratibial region and/or in <b>the</b> lateral aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> For <b>the</b> peculiarity <b>of</b> its anatomical shape as well as duplex appearance, we defined it as the "T" vein. OBJECTIVES: To assess how frequently <b>the</b> "T" vein <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> is involved in varicose networks. METHODS: A total of 218 consecutive patients affected by primary varicose veins have been evaluated by <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> duplex scanning. We assessed both <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above-mentioned tributary and <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> its hemodynamic involvement in the varicose network. RESULTS: In 15 of 218 cases (7 %) we demonstrated the above-mentioned tributary with an interfascial length ranging between 5 and 12 cm involved in varicose networks. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> anterior tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saphenous vein <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterolateral aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> is a neglected clinical entity, whose existence {{is important to know}} for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> varicose veins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg...</b>|$|R

5|$|Bales burned {{some of the}} victims' bodies, an act {{considered}} desecration under Islamic law. Witnesses {{said that}} the eleven corpses from one family were shot in the head, stabbed, then gathered into one room and set on fire. A pile of ashes {{was found on the}} floor of one victims' house; at least one child's body was found partially charred. A reporter for The New York Times inspected the children's bodies taken to a nearby American military base and reported seeing burns on some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> and heads.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
