5|$|While {{the term}} Holocaust {{generally}} {{refers to the}} systematic mass murder of the Jewish people in Nazi-occupied Europe, the Nazis also murdered {{a large number of}} non-Jewish people who were considered subhuman (Untermenschen) or undesirable.

25|$|In {{some studies}} Arrúe is {{presented}} as “a vascófilo within the regime”, a person who tried to accommodate Basque cultural ambitions within the Francoist system. In this perspective, Arrúe appears to be either someone whose contribution was merely a byproduct of his Carlist political leaning, someone who unintentionally promoted the cause, <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> {{was used by the}} Basques to pursue their cultural and national goals.|$|E

25|$|Morley {{was taken}} to St. Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth, where he was {{operated}} on, but was pronounced dead at 7.40pm.

25|$|Dickensian {{characters}} are amongst {{the most memorable}} in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley, Bob Cratchit, Oliver Twist, The Artful Dodger, Fagin, Bill Sikes, Pip, Miss Havisham, Sydney Carton, Charles Darnay, David Copperfield, Mr. Micawber, Abel Magwitch, Daniel Quilp, Samuel Pickwick, Wackford Squeers, and Uriah Heep are so well known as to be {{part and parcel of}} British culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a scrooge, for example, is a miser - <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> dislikes Christmas festivity.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{experiments}} conducted {{in order to}} test how early speakers gain the ability to judge grammaticality in their native language. In an experiment by Cairns et al., preschool children aged 4–6 were presented sentences such as (15) and (16) orally. (To make sure that the meaning of the sentences was clear to the children, sentences were enacted with toys.) While sentence (15) is well-formed in the adult grammar, sentence (16) is not, as indicated by the asterisk (*). The source of the ill-formedness is that the verb hug is a transitive verb and so must have a direct object, namely something <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> receives the action of the verb. Sentence (16) is missing the receiver of hug.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, {{he founded}} DirectSong, a record label that publishes digital DRM-free {{versions}} of his soundtracks {{as well as}} those of classical composers. Soule's works have been played in several live concerts such as the Symphonic Game Music Concert in Germany and the international Play! A Video Game Symphony concert series. While many of his works are orchestral, he considers himself a [...] "music practitioner", <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> creates music in general rather than just one type of music. Several of Soule's soundtracks have been created both credited and uncredited with the help of his brother, Julian.|$|E
500|$|Although many of {{his works}} are orchestral in nature, Soule has denied that it is his [...] "style", as he feels that the term boxes him into only {{creating}} one type of music. He prefers to call himself a [...] "music practitioner", <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> creates music in general rather than just one type of music as {{he is capable of}} many styles, such as Japanese pop, which he has written along with Jeff Miyahara. Soule considers music to be like a language, which can be arranged in many different ways if you understand the structure. He does not have a favorite genre of game to compose for, preferring instead to compose for [...] "ambitious" [...] games by people with [...] "new ideas".|$|E
500|$|Mustaine has {{elaborated}} on {{the subject}} matter of several of the album's other songs as well. He has noted that [...] "Forget to Remember" [...] was intentionally written in an ambiguous way so that it could interpreted as being about either a person trying to forget about a relationship <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> suffers from Alzheimer's disease and has memory problems. He also compared the concept behind the song to the film The Notebook. [...] "The Blackest Crow" [...] has a Southern influence and features a slide guitar, while the lyrics are about loss and subsequent depression. Mustaine initially hoped to have a guest feature on the song, and reached out to country musicians Willie Nelson and Miranda Lambert; however, neither appeared on the song. [...] "Don't Turn Your Back..." [...] was inspired by a friend of Mustaine, who described him as [...] "the kind of guy that will steal your dope and then help you look for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Through {{the lyrics}} of the song, Minogue expresses her {{obsession}} with an anonymous figure. Dorian Lynskey from The Guardian termed the song a [...] "mystery" [...] as Minogue never reveals the identity of her object of infatuation. The critic suggested that the person Minogue is referring to is either [...] "a partner, an evasive one-night stand <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> doesn't know she exists." [...] Writing for the same newspaper, Everett True identified a [...] "darker element" [...] in the simple lyrics and felt this sentiment was echoed in Minogue's restrained vocals. Further, True emphasised that while Minogue's 1987 single [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] had presented an optimistic romantic future, [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] focuses on an [...] "unhealthy" [...] and potentially destructive obsession. He also noted that in the former song, Minogue played [...] "the wide-eyed ingénue with alacrity," [...] but in the latter song she {{is aware of the}} harmful nature of her infatuation, calling it a [...] "desire that is wholly dependent on her own self-control." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} Fever chiefly focuses on themes {{of love and}} enjoyment. Thompson {{described}} the album to be [...] "all about dancing, fucking, {{and having a good}} time". In the song [...] "Love at First Sight", Minogue describes how {{she fell in love with}} her partner at [...] "first sight" [...] and how it led to good things happening for her. [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was termed a [...] "mystery" [...] as the singer never mentions who her object of desire in the song is. Lynskey Dorian from The Guardian suggested that Minogue refers to either [...] "a partner, an evasive one-night stand <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> doesn't know she exists" [...] as her obsession. The production of [...] "Give It to Me" [...] contrasts with its lyrics: Minogue urges her partner to [...] "slow down," [...] but the beat [...] "goes in the opposite direction and tells your body to push it a little more on the dance floor." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Fragile" [...] are simple and aim directly at the [...] " [...] heart". [...] "Come into My World" [...] is a [...] "plea for love" [...] as Minogue invites her partner into her life. On the other hand, [...] "Dancefloor" [...] focuses on issues like dealing with an end of a relationship, with Minogue celebrating a break-up by [...] "lose it in the music".|$|E
500|$|... "Scheiße" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} techno, electroclash, Eurodisco, and Eurodance {{from the middle}} of 1990s influences. Andrew Unterberger of PopDust noted that the song was {{influenced}} by Madonna's music, notably [...] "Justify My Love," [...] which, like [...] "Scheiße," [...] has sections in which the artist speaks rather than sings. [...] "Scheiße" [...] has been described as [...] "a strange mash up of digestible, American shopping mecca music and the thud of German nightclub electronica." [...] The song features a [...] "grimy" [...] bass and so many [...] "fizzing" [...] synths that it produces a [...] "keyboard assault on the senses." [...] The song's lyrics are of female empowerment. Although the theme of [...] "Scheiße" [...] is similar to the inspirational theme of other songs on Born This Way, The Village Voice questioned the sincerity of the feminist lyrics, after Gaga had once said, [...] "I’m not a feminist. I hail men, I love men," [...] but calls herself on the song a [...] "blond high-heeled feminist enlisting femmes for this." [...] " [...] someone who we’re watching evolve <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who,</b> at any given point, doesn’t really know what she’s talking about?" [...] the article wrote of Gaga. The German word [...] "scheiße", the title of the song and a word frequently used in the song, translates into [...] "shit" [...] into English. Gaga repeatedly speaks in German sounding gibberish during the song, although in a French accent.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Wikinews, Tashi Wangdi, representative to the Dalai Lama, further elaborated his perspective on these views. [...] If a person was to engage in homosexuality, [...] "a person would not be considered as following all the precepts of Buddhist principles. People don’t follow all the principles. Very few people can claim they follow all the principles. For instance, telling a lie. In any religion, if you ask if telling a lie is a sin — say Christian — they will say yes. But you find very few people who don’t at some point tell a lie. Homosexuality is one act, but you can’t say [...] not a Buddhist. <b>Or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> tells a lie is not a Buddhist. <b>Or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> kills an insect is not a Buddhist, because there’s a strong injunction against that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The name Rama appears {{repeatedly}} in Hindu texts, for many different scholars and kings in mythical stories. The word also appears in ancient Upanishads and Aranyakas layer of Vedic literature, {{as well as}} music and other post-Vedic literature, but in qualifying context of something <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is [...] "charming, beautiful, lovely" [...] or [...] "darkness, night".|$|E

50|$|Typical {{duties of}} a {{caregiver}} might include {{taking care of}} <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has a chronic illness or disease; managing medications or talking to doctors and nurses on someone's behalf; helping to bathe <b>or</b> dress <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is frail <b>or</b> disabled; or taking care of household chores, meals, <b>or</b> bills for <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> cannot do these things alone. With an increasingly aging population in all developed societies, the role of caregiver has been increasingly recognized as an important one, both functionally and economically. Many organizations which provide support for persons with disabilities have developed various forms of support for carers as well.|$|R
