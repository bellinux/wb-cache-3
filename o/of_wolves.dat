5|$|Romania {{has a large}} {{population}} <b>of</b> <b>wolves,</b> numbering 2,500 animals. The wolf has been a protected animal in Romania since 1996, although the law is not enforced. The number <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> in Albania and Macedonia is largely unknown, despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from Greece to those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Although protected, sometimes wolves are still illegally killed in Greece, and their future is uncertain. Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1986, while the species is fully protected in neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia.|$|E
5|$|Wolf populations {{throughout}} Northern and Central Asia {{are largely}} unknown, but are estimated {{in the hundreds}} of thousands based on annual harvests. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, continent-wide extermination <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> has ceased, and wolf populations have increased to about 25,000–30,000 animals throughout the former Soviet Union. In China and Mongolia, wolves are only protected in reserves. Mongolian populations have been estimated at 10,000–30,000, while the status <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> in China is more fragmentary. The north has a declining population of an estimated 400 wolves, while Xinjiang and Tibet hold about 10,000 and 2,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E

5|$|Hagenbeck's modern zoo {{techniques}} proved effective, and Edinburgh quickly {{gained a}} reputation for its good animal conditions. 1934 saw the births in captivity of a sea lion and beaver, and in 1936 a baby chimpanzee followed. A litter <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> was born in 1938, and soon afterwards the first orangutan to be born in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{a genetic}} {{study found that}} the wolf {{population}} in Europe was divided along a north-south axis and formed five major clusters. Three clusters were identified occupying southern and central Europe in Italy, the Dinaric-Balkans, the Carpathians. Another two clusters were identified occupying north-central Europe and the Ukrainian steppe. The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity. Wolves from Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece formed the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. Wolves from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia formed the north-central Europe cluster, with wolves from the Carpathians cluster coming from a mixture <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> from the north-central cluster and the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. The wolves from the Carpathians were more similar to the wolves from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe than they were to wolves from north-central Europe. These clusters may have been the result of expansion from glacial refugia, an adaptation to local environments, and landscape fragmentation and the killing <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> in some areas by humans.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas where}} the ranges of coyotes and gray wolves overlap, {{interference}} competition and predation by wolves has been hypothesized to limit local coyote densities. Coyote ranges expanded during the 19th and 20th centuries following the extirpation <b>of</b> <b>wolves,</b> while coyotes were driven to extinction on Isle Royale after wolves colonized the island in the 1940s. One study conducted in Yellowstone National Park, where both species coexist, concluded that the coyote population in the Lamar River Valley declined by 39% following the reintroduction <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> in the 1990s, while coyote populations in wolf inhabited areas of the Grand Teton National Park are 33% lower than in {{areas where the}}y are absent. Wolves have been observed to not tolerate coyotes in their vicinity, though coyotes {{have been known to}} trail wolves to feed on their kills.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of large}} land mammals such as caribou, moose, deer, elk, have been declining {{dramatically}} since the reintroduction <b>of</b> <b>wolves.</b> Species almost entirely gone {{that were once}} common in the area include the white-tailed jackrabbit, pygmy short-horned lizard, band-tailed pigeon and passenger pigeon. After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population was nearly exterminated as well.|$|E
5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates of the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{that are}} {{employed}} to guard sheep help to mitigate human–wolf conflicts, {{and are often}} proposed {{as one of the}} non-lethal tools in the conservation <b>of</b> <b>wolves.</b> Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviors, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation, especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs. However, shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> in elk population management.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, wolves began recolonising central Sweden after a twelve-year absence, {{and have}} since {{expanded}} into southern Norway. As of 2005, {{the total number}} of Swedish and Norwegian wolves is estimated to be at least one hundred, including eleven breeding pairs. The gray wolf is fully protected in Sweden and partially controlled in Norway. The Scandinavian wolf populations owe their continued existence to neighbouring Finland's contiguity with the Republic of Karelia, which houses a large population <b>of</b> <b>wolves.</b> Wolves in Finland are protected only in the southern third of the country, and can be hunted in other areas during specific seasons, though poaching remains common, with 90% of young wolf deaths being due to human predation, and the number <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> killed exceeds the number of hunting licenses, in some areas by a factor of two. Furthermore, the decline in the moose populations has reduced the wolf's food supply. Since 2011, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark have also reported wolf sightings presumably by natural migration from adjacent countries. In 2016, a female wolf tracked 550 kilometers from a region southwest of Berlin to settle in Jutland, Denmark where male wolves had been reported in 2012 {{for the first time in}} 200 years. Wolves have also commenced breeding in Lower Austria's Waldviertel region for the first time in over 130 years.|$|E

5|$|In Eastern Europe, wolves {{were never}} fully exterminated, {{because of the}} area's {{contiguity}} with Asia and its large forested areas. However, Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late nineteenth century. Wolves were extirpated in Slovakia during {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century and, by the mid-twentieth century, could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern Poland. Wolves in the eastern Balkans benefitted from the region's contiguity with the former Soviet Union and large areas of plains, mountains and farmlands. Wolves in Hungary occurred in only half the country around the start of the 20th century, and were largely restricted to the Carpathian Basin. Wolf populations in Romania remained largely substantial, with an average of 2,800 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4,600 from 1955–1965. An all-time low was reached in 1967, when the population was reduced to 1,550 animals. The extermination <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> in Bulgaria was relatively recent, as a previous population of about 1,000 animals in 1955 was reduced to about 100–200 in 1964. In Greece, the species disappeared from the southern Peloponnese in 1930. Despite periods of intense hunting during the eighteenth century, wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans, from Albania to the former Yugoslavia. Organized persecution <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> began in Yugoslavia in 1923, with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee (WEC) in Kocevje, Slovenia. The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the Dinaric Alps.|$|E
5|$|Other than humans, tigers {{appear to}} be the only serious predators <b>of</b> <b>wolves.</b> Wolf and tiger {{interactions}} are well documented in Sikhote-Alin, where tigers depress wolf numbers, either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem. Wolves appear capable of escaping competitive exclusion from tigers only when human persecution decreases tiger numbers. Proven cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks {{appear to be}} competitive rather than predatory in nature, with at least four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them.|$|E
5|$|Other vocalisations <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> {{are usually}} {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a {{fundamental}} frequency between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E

5|$|The adult {{wolves and}} their pups {{remained}} east of Medford in the Rogue River watershed, and in early 2015 officials named the group the Rogue Pack, the ninth contemporary wolf pack in Oregon. By July, wildlife biologists {{found evidence that}} OR-7 and his mate had produced a second litter of pups. A month later, trail cameras identified two new pups, bringing the known total <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> in this pack to seven. By 2016, the pack size had grown to nine.|$|E
5|$|A {{scenario}} {{consistent with}} the phylogenetic, ice sheet size, and sea-level depth data is that during the Late Pleistocene the sea levels were at their lowest. A single wave of wolf colonization into North America commenced {{with the opening of}} the Bering land bridge 70,000YBP. It ended with the closing of the Yukon corridor that ran along the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 23,000YBP during the Late Glacial Maximum. As wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but the genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced back only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population <b>of</b> <b>wolves</b> by a more recent one is {{consistent with the}} findings of earlier studies.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{a fairly}} wide variety of animal species. Several hoofed mammals call the {{mountain}} home: mountain goats, Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer. Large carnivores include cougar, black bear, coyote, bobcat, and the Cascade mountain fox, an endemic subspecies of the red fox. There have also been sightings of wolverine and unconfirmed reports <b>of</b> <b>wolves.</b> Many small mammals also make Adams their home. Squirrels and chipmunks are numerous throughout the forest. Douglas squirrels, least chipmunks, and Townsend's chipmunks live throughout the forest with golden-mantled ground squirrels and California ground squirrels occupying drier areas as well. These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive pine martens that also call Adams their home. Hoary marmots and pikas make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive snowshoe hare lives throughout the forest.|$|E
