The screenplay was written by Clifford Odets, Ernest Lehman and Mackendrick from the novelette by Lehman. Mary Grant designed the film's costumes.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel <b>of</b> <b>success)</b> <b>is</b> a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E

5|$|When Schaefer {{rejected}} Hearst's {{offer to}} suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane lays {{the blame for the}} film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason Kane failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message {{at the heart of the}} film (that the pursuit <b>of</b> <b>success</b> <b>is</b> ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.|$|E

25|$|Virtually any DNA {{sequence}} can be cloned and amplified, {{but there}} are some factors that might limit the success of the process. Examples of the DNA sequences that are difficult to clone are inverted repeats, origins of replication, centromeres and telomeres. Another characteristic that limits chances <b>of</b> <b>success</b> <b>is</b> large size of DNA sequence. Inserts larger than 10kbp have very limited success, but bacteriophages such as bacteriophage λ can be modified to successfully insert a sequence up to 40 kbp.|$|E

[...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{university}} students’ fear <b>of</b> <b>success</b> from the perspective of positive psychology.

The results confirmed that fear <b>of</b> <b>success</b> <b>was</b> positively related to search for meaning, and negatively to optimism, self-esteem, and self-efficacy. The variance of the fear <b>of</b> <b>success</b> <b>was</b> explained by the self-esteem and search for meaning in life. Implications for school psychologists were discussed...|$|R

500|$|Outliers: The Story <b>of</b> <b>Success</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} non-fiction book written by Malcolm Gladwell and {{published}} by Little, Brown and Company on November 18, 2008. In Outliers, Gladwell examines the {{factors that contribute to}} high levels of success. To support his thesis, he examines why the majority of Canadian ice hockey players are born in {{the first few months of}} the calendar year, how Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates achieved his extreme wealth, how The Beatles became one of the most successful musical acts in human history, [...] how Joseph Flom built Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom into one of the most successful law firms in the world, how cultural differences play a large part in perceived intelligence and rational decision making, and how two people with exceptional intelligence, Christopher Langan and J. Robert Oppenheimer, end up with such vastly different fortunes. Throughout the publication, Gladwell repeatedly mentions the [...] "10,000-Hour Rule", claiming that the key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours, though the authors of the original study this was based on have disputed Gladwell's usage.|$|E
500|$|On 15 October 1936, {{the first}} {{shipment}} of 50 Soviet T-26 light tanks arrived at Cartagena. [...] These {{were put into}} combat as early as 26 October, {{under the leadership of}} Soviet Lieutenant Colonel Semyon Krivoshein, south of Madrid. [...] The first combat operation in Spain for the T-26 was near the town of Seseña, when a Republican tank company counterattacked against the spearhead of the Nationalist's drive towards Madrid. [...] The counterattack, although partially successful, did not hinder the Nationalist advance. By the beginning of the operation, the tanks had separated themselves from the infantry, following them. However, the Republican armor successfully surprised a company of Nationalist infantrymen, who had mistaken then for Italian allies, and routed them. The tank company then continued towards the town of Esquivias, to the West, where they were counterattacked by cavalry from the Moroccan Legion and finally forced to withdraw. Lacking infantry support, a number of T-26s were knocked out by Nationalist infantrymen using wine bottles as bomblets. [...] The tank company returned through Seseña, which had been reoccupied by Nationalist infantry, and came under heavy fire. Despite the withdrawal, the counterattack was heavily publicized in Madrid, by the Republic, as a victory. [...] The lack <b>of</b> <b>success</b> <b>is</b> attributed to the lack of coordination between Republican tanks, infantry and artillery. [...] Although it's commonly mentioned that Spain received 312 T-26s, this number includes 16 FTs, delivered by Poland, and 15 T-26s which never actually made it to Spain. Ultimately, 281 T-26s were delivered to Spain during the Spanish Civil War.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, recent {{industry}} trends suggest the reemergence {{of something that}} looks very like the traditional A-B split in major studio production, though with fewer [...] "programmers" [...] bridging the gap. According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone, [...] "The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around $60m, rising to $100m when the cost of marketing for domestic launch (USA only) is factored into the equation. However, we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions ($120–150m) and niche features ($5–20m). The rationale is that the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>success</b> <b>is</b> maximised by coupling ultra-large budget and highly marketable features (e.g., [...] ), with multiple low-cost bets (e.g., Little Miss Sunshine). Fewer $30–70m releases are expected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} over {{which of the}} {{alternative}} formulations of the test Turing intended. Sterrett argues that two distinct tests can be extracted from his 1950 paper and that, pace Turing's remark, they are not equivalent. The test that employs the party game and compares frequencies <b>of</b> <b>success</b> <b>is</b> {{referred to as the}} [...] "Original Imitation Game Test," [...] whereas the test consisting of a human judge conversing with a human and a machine {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Standard Turing Test," [...] noting that Sterrett equates this with the [...] "standard interpretation" [...] rather than the second version of the imitation game. Sterrett agrees that the Standard Turing Test (STT) has the problems that its critics cite but feels that, in contrast, the Original Imitation Game Test (OIG Test) so defined is immune to many of them, due to a crucial difference: Unlike the STT, it does not make similarity to human performance the criterion, even though it employs human performance in setting a criterion for machine intelligence. A man can fail the OIG Test, but it is argued that it is a virtue of a test of intelligence that failure indicates a lack of resourcefulness: The OIG Test requires the resourcefulness associated with intelligence and not merely [...] "simulation of human conversational behaviour." [...] The general structure of the OIG Test could even be used with non-verbal versions of imitation games.|$|E
