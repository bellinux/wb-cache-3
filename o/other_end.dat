5|$|Immediately after lunch, Lindwall made a {{confident}} appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) against Washbrook, {{but was not}} supported behind the stumps by a silent Saggers, and the umpire ruled against the tourists. At the <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Hutton square drove Toshack for four, bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes. He followed this with another boundary in the same direction, and Washbrook back cut Lindwall for four more at the <b>other</b> <b>end.</b> This brought up England's 100, its first without loss for the series. Washbrook then on-drove a ball to the boundary and brought up his half-century, as Bradman pondered how to capture Australia's first wicket. England brought up 150 without loss 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day, Morris fell at 1/73 and Bradman {{came in to}} join Barnes. Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. He packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Alec Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. While Jim Laker stopped the scoring at the <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At the <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently {{as he had done}} in the past.|$|E

5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} bowled for 31 by Laker after two hours of batting. Morris tried to force a ball from Laker away, but hit it {{from the middle of}} his bat into his back pad, and the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the leg side with fielders, including two short legs, and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. With Laker stopping the scoring at the <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting.
