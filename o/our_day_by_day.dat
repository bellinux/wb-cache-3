The increasing oil prices rapidly in <b>our</b> life <b>day</b> <b>by</b> <b>day.</b> In environmental aspects, it is require to increase energy independence and produce employment are inspiring the countries around the whole world in support of biofuels research, invention and production. Biodiesel production is an important method which requires a sustained study and optimization process because of its advantageous ecological aspects and its renewable nature. Biodiesel fuel is clean burning diesel alternative and has several attractive characteristics including biodegradability, renewability, low emission and non toxic. The main objectives of this study to produce biodiesel from Rice Bran Oil (RBO) by transesterification (alcoholysis) process and investigated the performance parameters of single cylinder four stroke diesel engines operating on Rice Bran Oil (RBO) & Rice Bran Oil Methyl Ester (RBOME) blends. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel to the broadly used petroleum-diesel fuel. Biodiesel can be produced by domestic and non-domestic sources such as Rice Bran Oil, Soybeans, Karanja, Cotton seeds, Coconuts, Jatropha, Rubber seed, Ratanjot Oil, Rapeseeds oil etc. and thus these reduces dependence on retreating petroleum fuel from distant sources. The main reason of the transesterification process is to decrease the viscosity of oil.

That we are not to fancy, because David was an inspired prophet, that therefore he was in a different case from us, of different passions from ours, or that his words are too sacred and holy for us to use. Not so, we are to believe the very contrary. We are to believe that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation--that is--has not merely to do with the man who spoke it first--but that because David spoke by the Spirit of God, who is no respecter of persons, therefore his words apply to you, and to me, and to every human being--that David is revealing to us the everlasting laws of God's Spirit, and of God's providence, whereby He works alike in every Christian soul, and then, therefore, whatever our sin may be, whatever our sorrows may be, whatever our station in life may be, {{we have a right to}} offer up to God our repentance, our doubts, our fears, our hopes, our thanksgivings, in the very words which David used two thousand years and more ago, certain that they are the right words, better words than we can find for ourselves, exactly fitting our own souls, and fitting too the mind and will of Almighty God, because they are inspired by the same Spirit of God who descended on us, when we were baptized unto Christ's Church.|$|R
6000|$|... § 6. In {{all these}} {{passages}} the meaning is unmistakable, if they possess definite meaning at all. We are too apt {{to take them}} merely for sublime and vague imagery, and therefore gradually to lose the apprehension of their life and power. The expression, [...] "He bowed the Heavens," [...] for instance, is, I suppose, received by most readers as a magnificent hyperbole, having reference to some peculiar and fearful manifestation of God's power to the writer of the Psalm in which the words occur. But the expression either has plain meaning, or it has no meaning. Understand by the term [...] "Heavens" [...] the compass of infinite space around the earth, and the expression, [...] "bowed the Heavens," [...] however sublime, is wholly without meaning; infinite space cannot be bent or bowed. But understand by the [...] "Heavens" [...] the veil of clouds above the earth, and the expression is neither hyperbolical nor obscure; it is pure, plain, and accurate truth, and it describes God, not as revealing Himself in any peculiar way to David, but doing what he is still doing before <b>our</b> own eyes <b>day</b> <b>by</b> <b>day.</b> <b>By</b> accepting the words in their simple sense, we are thus led to apprehend the immediate presence of the Deity, and His purpose of manifesting Himself as near us whenever the storm-cloud stoops upon its course; while by our vague and inaccurate acceptance of the words we remove the idea of His presence far from us, into a region which we can neither see nor know; and gradually, from the close realization of a living God who [...] "maketh the clouds his chariot," [...] we refine and explain ourselves into dim and distant suspicion of an inactive God, inhabiting inconceivable places, and fading into the multitudinous formalisms {{of the laws of}} Nature.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Our</b> real experiences, <b>day</b> <b>by</b> <b>day</b> and moment <b>by</b> moment, are so {{intrinsically}} organised and definite, it {{does not}} at first occur {{to us that the}} principles which organise and define them, rendering them intelligible, and consciously apprehensible, are and must be the spontaneous products of the mind's own action. We do not at first see, as careful reflection later brings us to see, with Kant, that the mental elements without which the apprehensible presence of the items of experience would be inconceivable and inexistent cannot possibly be derived from these, and thence applied to the mind. But this later penetrating reflection convinces us that what our experienced objects must have in order to be objects — to be perceived at all — must be brought by the mind itself to the very act of experience. What must be presupposed, if the objects are to be perceived at all, can by no conceivable means be explained as first coming to the mind from the objects, and must therefore, as the only alternative, be acknowledged to be contributions from the mind's pure self-activity. But when we have reached this conclusive conviction that the roots of our experience and our experimental knowledge are parts of our own spontaneous life, we then readily come to see, further, that the system of our several elements of consciousness a priori is precisely what we must really understand by our unifying or enwholing self, — is exactly what we try to express when we say we have a soul, and that this soul possesses real knowledge; that is, a hold upon eternal things. The realm of the eternal, in short, then becomes for us just the realm of our self-active intelligence; and this it is which, if we can show its reality in detail, will prove to be the clue to our immortal being. So the critical question is, How can the real existence of such a priori consciousness, such genuinely self-active intelligence, be conclusively made out? I have already in a few sentences indicated the general line of this proof, as we inherit it from Kant; but there is now required some fuller account of it, made intelligible and convincing by clear particulars.|$|R
60|$|And then, what blessed {{words are}} these from the Lord Jesus, which we {{read in the}} book of Revelation? 'And I will give to him that overcometh, a new name.' A new name for him that overcometh world, flesh, and devil; that shall be our portion in the world to come. A new name, perfect like the name of the Lord Jesus, which shall express and mean all that we are to do hereafter, and all that we have done well on earth. A name which shall declare to us our calling and work in God's Church triumphant, {{throughout}} all ages and worlds to come: and yet a name which no man knoweth saving he who receiveth it. Yes, if we may dare to guess at the meaning of those deep words, perhaps in that new name shall be recorded for each man all that went on, in the secret depths of the man's own heart, between himself and his God, unknown and unnoticed even by the wife of his bosom. The cup of cold water given in Christ's name; the little private acts of love, and kindness, and self-sacrifice, of which none but God knew; the secret prayers, the secret acts of contrition, the secret hungerings and thirstings after righteousness, the secret struggles and agonies of heart, which he could not, dare not, ought not to tell to any human being. All these, he shall find, will go to make up his character in the life to come, to determine what work he is to do for God in the world to come; as it is written, 'Be thou faithful over a few things, and I will make thee ruler over many things.' All these, perhaps, shall be expressed and declared in that new name, the full meaning of which none will know but the man himself, because none but he knows the secret experiences and struggles which went toward the making of it; none but he and God; for God will know all, He who is the Lord and Saviour of our souls, our persons, our very selves, and can preserve them utterly to the fulness of eternal life, because He knows them thoroughly and utterly; because He judges not according to appearance, but judges righteous judgment; because He sees us not merely as we seem to others to be, not even as we seem at times to ourselves to be;--but searches the heart, and can be touched with the feeling of its infirmities, seeing that He himself has been tempted even as we are, yet without sin; because, blessed thought! He can pierce through the very marrow of our being, and discern the thoughts and intents of our hearts, and see what we long to be, and what we ought to be; so that we can safely and hopefully commend our spirits to His hand, <b>day</b> <b>by</b> <b>day</b> and hour <b>by</b> hour, and can trust Him to cleanse us from our secret faults, and to renew and strengthen <b>our</b> very selves <b>day</b> <b>by</b> <b>day</b> with that eternal life which He gives to all who cast themselves utterly upon Him.|$|R
6000|$|In {{those first}} months of the war there was, we were told, in England and France a revival of [...] "religion," [...] and indeed many of the books then written gave {{evidence}} of having been composed in exalted, mystic moods. I remember one in particular, called [...] "En Campagne," [...] by a young French officer. And then, somehow, the note of mystic exaltation died away, to be succeeded by a period of realism. Read [...] "Le Feu," [...] which is most typical, which has sold in numberless editions. Here {{is a picture of}} that other aspect--the grimness, the monotony, and the frequent bestiality of trench life, the horror of slaughtering millions of men by highly specialized machinery. And yet, as an American, I strike inevitably the note of optimism once more. Even now the truer spiritual goal is glimpsed through the battle clouds, and has been hailed in world-reverberating phrases <b>by</b> <b>our</b> American President. <b>Day</b> <b>by</b> <b>day</b> the real issue is clearer, while the [...] "religion" [...] it implies embraces not one nation, wills not one patriotism, but humanity itself. I heard a Frenchwoman who had been deeply [...] "religious" [...] in the old sense exclaim: [...] "I no longer have any faith in God; he {{is on the side of}} the Germans." [...] When the war began there were many evidences of a survival of that faith that God fights for nations, interferes in behalf of the [...] "righteous" [...] cause. When General Joffre was in America he was asked by one of our countrywomen how the battle of the Marne was won. [...] "Madame," [...] he is reported to have said, [...] "it was won by me, by my generals and soldiers." [...] The tendency to regard this victory, which we hope saved France and the Western humanitarian civilization we cherish, as a special interposition of Providence, as a miracle, has given place to the realization that the battle was won by the resourcefulness, science, and coolness of the French commander-in-chief. Science preserves armies, since killing, if it has to be done, is now wholly within that realm; science heals the wounded, transports them rapidly to the hospitals, gives the shattered something still to live for; and, if we are able to abandon the sentimental view and look facts in the face--as many anointed chaplains in Europe are doing--science not only eliminates typhoid but is able to prevent those terrible diseases that devastate armies and nations. And science is no longer confined to the physical but has invaded the social kingdom, is able to weave a juster fabric into the government of peoples. On all sides we are beginning to embrace the religion of self-reliance, a faith that God is on the side of intelligence--intelligence with a broader meaning than the Germans have given it, for it includes charity.|$|R
