40|$|The habitat {{selection}} of the <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> Emberiza hortulana has been examined on multiple spatial scales. Habitat variables of territories and random points were measured in the field on a 25 m radius and from GIS layers on scales of 25 m, 100 m, 500 m and 1, 000 m radius. Habitat variables were analysed by a generalized linear model. The <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> was found on a 25 m radius in areas with a few black pines, with low grass and open patches within the herbaceous layer. On a 100 m radius scale, the probability of occurrence was highest in areas with meadows with large trees, permanent and partly overgrown meadows, and small areas of forests. On a 500 m radius scale, the occurrence of the <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> was negatively affected by urban areas and their infrastructure and by forests, and positively by partly overgrown meadows and permanent meadows with or without large trees. On a 1, 000 m radius, permanent meadows with or without large trees, {{and the absence of}} large urban areas and infrastructure positively affected the presence of the <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting.</b> In conclusion, factors influencing habitat selection by the <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> differ according to spatial scale. On the territorial level, its presence was only influenced by cover of open and partly overgrown meadows and by forest, while on larger scales it was also affected by the cover of urban areas. Factors influence habitat selection differently on different scales; a forest influences the probability of a territory positively on a small scale while negatively on larger scales. Factors influencing the habitat selection positively on a larger scale are becoming less common and therefore fewer suitable sites are available for the <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> in Kra...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} a marked decline in most <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> Emberiza hortulana populations in {{temperate}} Europe, with many regional populations now extinct or on the brink of extinction. In contrast, Mediterranean and, as far as we know, eastern European popula-tions seem to have remained relatively stable. The causes of decline remain unclear but include: habitat loss and degradation, and related reduction in prey availability; climate change on the breeding grounds; altered population dynamics; illegal captures during migration; and environmental change in wintering areas. We review the current knowledge of the biology of the <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> and discuss the proposed causes of decline in relation to the different population trends in temperate and Mediterranean Europe. We suggest new avenues of research to identify the factors limiting <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> populations. The main evidence-based conservation measure that is likely to enhance habitat quality is the creation of patches of bare ground to produce sparsely vegetated foraging grounds in invertebrate-rich grassy habitats close to breeding area...|$|E
40|$|Ortolan {{buntings}} Emberiza hotulana {{have undergone}} {{one of the}} most severe population declines of any European farmland bird over the last thirty years. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out which habitat features, including crop characteristics, <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> prefers in Estonia in breeding areas. This study compared currently occupied and unoccupied <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> territories. Occupied areas contained significantly more tall broadleaf trees, crop types, structural elements (trees, bushes, roads, overhead power lines and buildings) and spring wheat, but also had lower crop drilling densities. <b>Ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> territories were best described by a logistic regression model containing six variables: amount of structural point elements, length of power lines, amount of tall broadleaf trees and number of different crops had a positive effect, whereas crop density and area of autumn-sown crops had a negative effect. Based on the findings of this study, the following conservation measures can be recommended: lower crop densities; spring rather than autumn-sown crops; small-field systems containing a variety of crops; scattered scrub preserved or planted; habitat patches of permanent grasslands, hedges and tall broadleaf trees retained within the agricultural landscape...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> Emberiza hortulana {{is one of}} {{many species}} of passerines in great decline in most of Europe.

40|$|Buntings {{species are}} mainly {{associated}} to agricultural landscapes and constitute a high conservation concern because farmlands are ecosystems subject to rapid changes and may cause {{the loss of}} animal species {{in just a few}} years. We studied the occurrence of <b>Ortolan</b> <b>Bunting,</b> Cirl Bunting and Corn Bunting (Emberiza hortulana, Emberiza cirlus, Miliaria calandra) on farmlands of Central Italy, considering the landuse composition, crop typologies and several structural parameters of environment occupied by these species, as presence of power lines, road type and Shannon biodiversity index of landscape. Furthermore the geographical overlap among the three bunting species was studied, in order to find witch species show an habitat overlap. The study was carried out in central-eastern Italy, between the end of April and mid-July 2010, through 159 sampled sites, uniformly distributed on in the study area. Cirl Bunting is the most widespread species of Bunting in the farmlands that were studied. <b>Ortolan</b> <b>Bunting</b> and Corn Bunting are the two species with greater spatial habitat overlap, even though land-use composition in their territories was different. However, <b>Ortolan</b> <b>Bunting</b> can be found at a lower altitude range than Corn Bunting (less 550 m a. s. l.) and it is associated to territories with minor landscape heterogeneity. Preferences by crop types seem to be a possible cause of the spatial habitat overlap between Ortolan and Corn Bunting (both species had selected sugar beet, and coriander, avoiding mainly vegetables, vineyards and orchards). On the other hand, Cirl Bunting was less related to crop types...|$|E
40|$|Farmlands {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important habitats for several bird species in Europe, but during the last few decades, agricultural landscapes have been subject to a rapid and large-scale change, caused by the intensification and mechanization of agricultural activities, that is {{one of the}} main drivers of worldwide biodiversity decline. The high nature value farmlands (HNV) are characterized through three criteria: low-intensity farming, presence of residual semi-natural vegetation (hedgerows, uncultivated, shrubs, scattered trees, marginal uncultivated) and diversity of land cover mosaic; values that are often correlated with highest farmland bird diversity. In this work, we used Generalized Linear Models to evaluate the presence of different bunting species, typical of farmlands in Central Italy, as potential indicators of HNV of farmland and surrogates of landscape heterogeneity. Our results showed how the presence of bunting species is associated with markedly different environmental parameters. A species which could potentially be more useful for identifying HNV farmlands (more heterogeneous landscape, supporting also greater bird species richness) is the Cirl Bunting. The Corn Bunting and <b>Ortolan</b> <b>Bunting</b> were less predictive as indicators of farmland heterogeneity. <b>Ortolan</b> <b>Bunting</b> was unrelated to the complexity of farmlands and bird richness. This information is important for the planning of large-scale conservation policies and to increase our understanding of farmland bird indicators...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical models {{dealing with}} {{dispersal}} patterns are currently limited {{by a lack}} of empirical data, and existing data may be biased because of small spatial scale of many previous studies. We studied the whole known population of a small passerine bird, the <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza hortulana), in Norway. Males conducted extraordinary long-distance breeding dispersal of up to 45 km during their first years of life but showed high territory fidelity when older. Males that failed to attract a female in their first singing territory were especially likely to disperse, and their movements regularly occurred within a breeding season or until the next year (such movements were also defined as breeding dispersal). Breeding dispersal distances of males (median = 11. 9 km) were more than four times as long as their natal dispersal distances (median = 2. 7 km). These data contradict a classical view of dispersal in birds, namely, that the longest dispersal movements occur before the first territory is established (natal dispersal) and subsequent movements (breeding dispersal) are shorter. Thus, breeding dispersal plays a larger role than does natal dispersal in gene flow and population connectivity in the <b>ortolan</b> <b>bunting.</b> We suggest that short natal dispersal and subsequent long breeding dispersal within the breeding season may be an optimal dispersal strategy in ortolan buntings owing to their patchy distribution in our study area, and we predict that this may also be the case for other species with patchy or fragmented distribution.
