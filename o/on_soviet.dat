5|$|He {{spent much}} of his time writing {{articles}} in military journals <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> strategic operations and most notably, co-authored the six-volume work <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> involvement during World War II, The Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War (1941–1945). In August 1967, Bagramyan accompanied General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and Premier Alexei Kosygin to North Vietnam, where they met with Vietnamese leaders as he, serving in the role of a military expert, helped negotiate the transfer of logistics and arms to the country during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|According to a Soviet General Staff report, 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe raids <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> airfields in the Kursk {{sector in}} June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts were {{so successful that}} German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only a}} vast underestimation of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was {{in black and white}} as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} the inclusion of a short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess in the eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E

Over-winter {{hit-and-run}} attacks <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> Army supply routes were the unit's main focus and in spring, Trautmann {{was promoted to}} Unteroffizier (corporal). Gains were made in 1942, but the Soviet counter-offensive hit Trautmann's unit hard, {{and by the time}} it was withdrawn from the Eastern Front, only 300 of the original 1,000 men remained. Trautmann won five medals for his actions on the Eastern Front, including an Iron Cross First Class.|$|E
5|$|Richard H. Shultz {{received}} his PhD {{in political science}} from Miami University in 1976, and during the period 1977–1978 did post-doctoral work at the University of Michigan. Shultz became part of The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University as international politics professor in 1983, and rose to become director of the International Security Studies Program (ISSP). Shultz was the only non-government member of the Special Operations Policy Advisory Group for the United States Department of Defense.

5|$|Within {{the context}} of the battle itself, the failure of the Red Army to {{properly}} regroup during the prelude to the battle and the ability of the Germans to effectively collect intelligence <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> movements {{played an important role in}} the outcome. Poor Soviet performance in the north and equally poor intelligence-gathering at the hands of Stavka and front headquarters, also eventually spelled doom for the offensive. Nonetheless, despite this poor performance, it underscored a dedicated evolution of operations and tactics within the Red Army which borrowed and refined the pre-war theory, Soviet deep battle.|$|E

5|$|Back in Cuba, Castro feared a U.S.-backed coup; in 1959 {{his regime}} spent $120 million <b>on</b> <b>Soviet,</b> French, and Belgian {{weaponry}} and by early 1960 had doubled {{the size of}} Cuba's armed forces. Fearing counter-revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favorable to the revolution, training at least 50,000 civilians in combat techniques. In September 1960, they created the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighborhood spying to detect counter-revolutionary activities as well as organizing health and education campaigns, becoming a conduit for public complaints. By 1970, {{a third of the}} population would be involved in the CDR, and this would come to rise to 80%.|$|E
5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} positive effect <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the Ju 87s {{gave the}} German Army yet more {{valuable}} support. On 29 December 1941, the Soviet 44th Army {{landed on the}} Kerch Peninsula. The Luftwaffe was only able to dispatch meager reinforcements of four bomber groups (Kampfgruppen) and two dive bomber groups belonging to StG 77. With air superiority, the Ju 87s operated with impunity. In the first 10 days of the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, half the landing force was destroyed, while sea lanes were blocked by the Stukas inflicting heavy losses <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> shipping. The Ju 87's effectiveness against Soviet armour was not yet potent. Later versions of the T-34 tank could withstand Stuka attack in general, unless a direct hit was scored but the Soviet 44th Army had only obsolescent types with thin armour which were nearly all destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet Union, Soyuzmultfilm {{released}} a 16-minute stop-motion animation Adventures of Baron Munchausen in 1967, directed by Anatoly Karanovich. Another Soviet animated version was produced {{as a series}} of short films, Munchausen's Adventures, in 1973 and 1974. The French animator Jean Image filmed The Fabulous Adventures of the Legendary Baron Munchausen in 1979, and followed it with a 1984 sequel, Moon Madness. Oleg Yankovsky appeared as the Baron in the 1980 Russian television film That Same Munchausen, directed by Mark Zakharov from Grigori Gorin's play. The film, a commentary <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> censorship and social mores, imagines an ostracized Baron attempting to prove the truth of his adventures in a disbelieving and conformity-driven world.|$|E

A hard-fought 11 draw in the first leg at Parkhead did not bode well for the return match in Kiev. Oleh Blokhin's free-kick in the second leg gave the Soviet's an early lead, but Mark McGhee levelled the tie shortly after half-time. Dynamo regained the lead later on in the second half, but Celtic continued to press. A late third goal from Dynamo, however, saw them clinch the tie.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Vietnam War, Lê Duẩn took an {{aggressive}} posture. He saw attack {{as the key}} to victory. When the North finally won the war in 1975, Lê Duẩn and his associates were overly optimistic about the future. The Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1980) was a failure and left the Vietnamese economy in crisis. Vietnam was then headed by a gerontocracy (in which the rulers are much older than the average adult). Vietnam became internationally isolated during Lê Duẩn's rule. In 1979 the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted Pol Pot, fought a war with China and became dependent <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> economic aid. Lê Duẩn died in July 1986 and was succeeded by Trường Chinh.|$|E

5|$|For the German summer offensive, Fall Blau, the Luftwaffe had {{concentrated}} 1,800 aircraft into Luftflotte 4 {{making it}} {{the largest and most}} powerful air command in the world. The Stukawaffe strength stood at 151. During the Battle of Stalingrad, Stukas flew thousands of sorties against Soviet positions in the city. StG 1, 2 and 77 flew 320 sorties on 14 October 1942. As the German Sixth Army pushed the Soviets into a 1,000 metre enclave on {{the west bank of the}} Volga River, 1,208 Stuka sorties were flown against this small strip of land. The intense air attack, though causing horrific losses <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> units, failed to destroy them. The Luftwaffe's Stuka force made a maximum effort during this phase of the war. They flew an average of 500 sorties per day and caused heavy losses among Soviet forces, losing an average of only one Stuka per day. The Battle of Stalingrad marked the high point in the fortunes of the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. As the strength of the Soviet Air Forces grew, they gradually wrested control of the skies from the Luftwaffe. From this point onward, Stuka losses increased.|$|E
5|$|Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance}} units plotted Soviet troop concentration, supply dumps and airfields, {{and marked}} them down for destruction. Additional Luftwaffe attacks {{were carried out}} against Soviet command and control centers in order to disrupt the mobilization and organization of Soviet forces. In contrast, Soviet artillery observers based at the border area had been under the strictest instructions not to open fire on German aircraft prior to the invasion. One plausible reason given for the Soviet hesitation to return fire was Stalin's initial belief that the assault was launched without Hitler's authorization. Significant amounts of Soviet territory were lost along with Red Army forces as a result; it took several days before Stalin comprehended {{the magnitude of the}} calamity. The Luftwaffe reportedly destroyed 1,489 aircraft {{on the first day of}} the invasion and over 3,100 during the first three days. Hermann Göring, Minister of Aviation and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, distrusted the reports and ordered the figure checked. Luftwaffe staffs surveyed the wreckage <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> airfields, and their original figure proved conservative, as over 2,000 Soviet aircraft were estimated to have been destroyed on the first day of the invasion. In reality, Soviet losses were likely higher; a Soviet archival document recorded the loss of 3,922 Soviet aircraft in the first three days against an estimated loss of 78 German aircraft. The Luftwaffe reported the loss of only 35 aircraft on the first day of combat. A document from the German Federal Archives puts the Luftwaffe's loss at 63 aircraft for the first day.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February, Hausser's SS Panzer Corps {{was ordered}} to strike southwards, to provide a screen for the 4th Panzer Army's attack. Simultaneously, Army Detachment Hollidt {{was ordered to}} contain the {{continuing}} Soviet efforts to break through German lines. The 1st Panzer Army was ordered to drive north {{in an attempt to}} cut off and destroy Popov's Mobile Group, using accurate intelligence <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> strength which allowed the Wehrmacht to pick and choose their engagements and bring about tactical numerical superiority. The 1st and 4th Panzer Armies were also ordered to attack the overextended Soviet 6th Army and 1st Guards Army. Between 20–23 February, the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) cut through the 6th Army's flank, eliminating the Soviet threat to the Dnieper River and successfully surrounding and destroying a number of Red Army units south of the Samara River. The 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich advanced in a northeastern direction, while the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf was put into action on 22 February, advancing parallel to the Das Reich. These two divisions successfully cut the supply lines to the Soviet spearheads. First Panzer Army was able to surround and pocket Popov's Mobile Group by 24 February, although a sizable contingent of Soviet troops managed to escape north. On 22 February, alarmed by the success of the German counterattack, the Soviet Stavka ordered the Voronezh Front to shift the 3rd Tank Army and 69th Army south, in an effort to alleviate pressure on the Southwestern Front and destroy German forces in the Krasnograd area.|$|E

5|$|The Stuka {{was also}} heavily {{involved}} in Operation Citadel, the Battle of Kursk. The Luftwaffe committed I, II, III./St.G 1 and III./StG 3 {{under the command of}} Luftflotte 6. I., II, III. of StGs 2 and 3 were committed under the command of Hans Seidemann's Fliegerkorps VIII. Hauptmann Rudel's cannon-equipped Ju 87 Gs had a devastating effect <b>on</b> <b>Soviet</b> armour at Orel and Belgorod. The Ju 87s participated in a huge aerial counter-offensive lasting from 16–31 July against a Soviet offensive at Khotynets and saved two German armies from encirclement, reducing the attacking Soviet 11th Guards Army to just 33 tanks by 20 July. The Soviet offensive had been completely halted from the air although losses were considerable. Fliegerkorps VIII lost eight Ju 87s on 8 July, six on 9 July, six on 10 July and another eight on 11 July. The Stuka arm also lost eight of their Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross holders. StG 77 lost 24 Ju 87s in the period 5–31 July (StG had lost 23 in July–December 1942), while StG 2 lost another 30 aircraft in the same period. In September 1943, three of the Stuka units were re-equipped with the Fw 190F and G (ground attack versions) and began to be renamed Schlachtgeschwader (attack wings). In the face of overwhelming air opposition, the dive-bomber required heavy protection from German fighters to counter Soviet fighters. Some units like SG 2 Immelmann continued to operate with great success throughout 1943-45, operating the Ju 87 G variants equipped with 37mm cannons, which became tank killers, although in increasingly small numbers.|$|E
