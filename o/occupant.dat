5|$|After the rosters were announced, {{a second}} round of fan voting, the Monster All-Star Final Vote, was {{commenced}} to determine the <b>occupant</b> of the final roster spot for each team. This round lasted until July 5. Chris Young and Hideki Okajima were elected to represent the National League and American League, respectively, in the All-Star Game as first time All-Stars. All ten players included in the balloting were pitchers, a first for the event.|$|E
50|$|When {{the load}} factor is +1, all <b>occupants</b> of the {{aircraft}} feel that their weight is normal. When the load factor is greater than +1 all <b>occupants</b> feel heavier than usual. For example, in a 2 g maneuver all <b>occupants</b> feel that their weight is twice normal. When the load factor is zero, or very small, all <b>occupants</b> feel weightless. When the load factor is negative, all <b>occupants</b> feel they are upside down.|$|R
50|$|The report {{noted that}} the {{recommendations}} of the maximum number of <b>occupants</b> was based on assuming the average weight of the <b>occupants</b> would not exceed 75 kg, but that the <b>occupants</b> average weight was actually 95 kg.|$|R
40|$|Foreclosure {{properties}} sold at Japanese judicial auctions {{are delivered}} to buyers with an unclear title when <b>occupants</b> exist, because the foreclosure laws protect <b>occupants</b> from compulsory execution of auctions. The existence of <b>occupants</b> theoretically affects the auction price through two channels. First, {{it affects the}} reserve price, and this changes in auction price. Second, the number of bidders changes in response {{to changes in the}} reserve price that is controlled by <b>occupants,</b> and this changes the auction price. Using data from the Osaka District Court, we empirically find that the existence of <b>occupants</b> in properties reduces the auction price through two channels. ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the bout, the {{contestant}} {{with the}} higher score wins and either retains the Money Chair or replaces its current <b>occupant.</b> If the bout ends in a tie score, a tiebreaker question is asked; the contestant who locks in the correct answer first is the winner. If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a question is in play when the clock runs out, it is completed under the normal rules.|$|E

40|$|Data on 2520 <b>occupants</b> of cars {{involved}} in accidents were analysed {{in relation to}} injury and {{the severity of the}} crash to investigate the effect of rear seat passengers on injury to restrained and unrestrained front seat <b>occupants</b> and vice versa. Unrestrained front seat <b>occupants</b> showed a higher incidence of serious injury when there were rear seat passengers. The presence of a rear seat passenger did not affect significantly the overall incidence of injury among restrained front seat <b>occupants</b> within the range of crash severity considered. Unrestrained rear seat passengers behind unrestrained front seat <b>occupants</b> showed a higher incidence of moderate injury and a lower incidence of no injury than those behind restrained front seat <b>occupants.</b> It is concluded that legislation on seat belts has not greatly increased the risk of person to person injury...|$|R

However, only one study {{was found to}} provide evidence of this linkage. Therefore, future studies are necessary to test if <b>occupants</b> with higher perceived risk {{are more likely to}} form groups, or whether forming groups increases perceived risk.|$|R
5|$|In the mid-17th {{century the}} Guests' Hall was {{referred}} to as Mr Booth's Chamber, after the genealogist Jack Booth of Tremlowe, a cousin and family friend of the Moreton's and a regular <b>occupant.</b> Its substantial carved consoles, inserted not just for decorative effect but to support the weight of the Long Gallery above, have been dated to 1660. What is today known as the Prayer Room, above the Chapel, was originally the chamber of the first William Moreton's daughter Ann, whose maid occupied the adjoining room.|$|E
5|$|Middleton Hall on Town Street {{was built}} in the 18th century for the Brandlings but they chose to live mainly in Durham. Charles John Brandling of Gosforth House, the Member of Parliament for Newcastle between 1798 and 1812 and for Northumberland from 1820 until 1826, married Henrietta Armitage of Middleton. The Brandlings {{appointed}} John Blenkinsop to manage their collieries in Middleton and he was the hall's <b>occupant</b> in 1809. The hall was destroyed in a fire in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} food waste {{produced}} by a household and its occupants is affected by several factors; WRAP found the most impacting factors to be: firstly {{the size of the}} household, followed by the age of the individual occupants and finally the household composition (e.g. single <b>occupant</b> household). The other factors: job status, lifestage, ethnicity and occupation grouping of individuals were found to have less correlation between the amount of avoidable waste.|$|E
30|$|<b>Occupants</b> {{perceive}} high risks but do {{not think}} they have sufficient resources to engage into protective actions (e.g., mobility impaired <b>occupants</b> {{may not be able}} to use stairs for evacuation).

40|$|The {{severity}} of injuries sustained by 2577 car <b>occupants</b> in road traffic accidents in the catchment area of one district accident service during February 1982 to January 1984 inclusive {{was assessed using}} the injury severity score system. In the first 12 months the mean injury severity score for front seat <b>occupants</b> injured in a road traffic accident was 4. 94 {{and in the second}} 12 month period, after the implementation of the seat belt law, the mean injury severity score of all injured front seat <b>occupants</b> was 2. 80. These figures indicated a reduction in injury {{severity of}} front seat <b>occupants</b> of 53. 4 % on the previous 12 month figures. The severity of injury sustained by unbelted front seat <b>occupants</b> and back seat passengers showed no significant change over the two years. The number of front seat <b>occupants</b> killed or sustaining serious injuries (injury severity score greater than 12) showed a reduction of 54 % in the 12 months beginning February 1983. Front seat <b>occupants</b> requiring admission for injuries sustained showed a decline of 42 % in the 12 months after the introduction of the seat belt law, and deaths among front seat <b>occupants</b> fell by 27 % compared with the previous 12 months. After the implementation of seat belt legislation those front seat <b>occupants</b> killed or sustaining serious injuries included a significantly higher proportion of victims who were not wearing their seat belts or showed positive evidence of alcohol intake {{at the time of the}} accident. This series suggests that the incidence of serious injury or deaths among front seat <b>occupants</b> of cars has decreased substantially since the seat belt law became effective on 31 January 1983...|$|R
5|$|The {{authority}} of the Byzantine emperor as the legitimate Roman emperor was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Imperator Augustus by Pope Leo III in the year 800.

40|$|Copyright © 2007 SAE International Multiple {{datasets}} (crash, emergency department, inpatient discharge, {{and death}} certificate) were linked {{in order to}} (a) follow crash victims through the healthcare system, and (b) examine types and severities of injuries sustained by vehicle <b>occupants</b> in head-on, rear-end, angle, and rollover crashes occurring on Massachusetts roadways in 2002 and 2003. The crash-involved vehicles were classified by type (passenger car or light truck/van) and age (pre- 1995 or 2002 -newer). Moreover, the injury types, hospital charges, and length of stay of the crash-involved <b>occupants</b> were considered. Finally, logistic regression models were developed to compare the injury odds ratios {{for each of the}} four types of crashes. Some of the findings included the following: • New vehicles are more likely to be involved in property damage only crashes while old vehicles are more likely to be involved in all levels of injury crashes (fatal, incapacitating, non-incapacitating, and possible injury). • The highest emergency department charges are associated with rollover and head-on crashes. • For head-on crashes, the emergency department charges were significantly lower for <b>occupants</b> of new vehicles than <b>occupants</b> of old vehicles. • In angle crashes, <b>occupants</b> of new vehicles were less likely to suffer spine and back injuries or sprains and strains. <b>Occupants</b> of new vehicles were more likely to suffer extremity injuries, fractures, and superficial contusions. • In angle crashes, LTV <b>occupants</b> were more likely to suffer injuries to the spine and back area or sprains and strains than passenger car occupants; LTV <b>occupants</b> were less likely to suffer superficial contusions than passenger car <b>occupants...</b>|$|R
5|$|At Sutton Hoo (near Woodbridge, in Suffolk) is {{the site}} of two 6th-7th century Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, where it is {{believed}} that members of the Eorpwald's dynasty were entombed under large earth mounds. Several East Anglian kings, including Eorpwald, have been suggested as possible candidates for the <b>occupant</b> of the burial site under Mound 1, discovered in 1939. Martin Carver has speculated that historians could use regal lists and other sources of information to identify the occupants, whilst acknowledging that no material evidence exists to support the theory that Eorpwald or other members of his family are buried there. He has used Eorpwald's relationship as the son of Rædwald to place him in either Mound 1 or 2.|$|E
