5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of <b>orofacial</b> pain and, when severe, it is {{considered}} a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E

25|$|Several GI diseases, {{especially}} {{those associated with}} malabsorption, can cause recurrent mouth ulcers, atrophic glossitis, and angular cheilitis (e.g. Crohn's disease is sometimes termed <b>orofacial</b> granulomatosis when it involves the mouth alone).|$|E
25|$|Pathologically, {{the mouth}} {{represents}} a transition between the gastrointestinal tract and the skin, meaning that many gastrointestinal and cutaneous conditions can involve the mouth. Some conditions {{usually associated with}} the whole gastrointestinal tract may present only in the mouth, e.g., <b>orofacial</b> granulomatosis/oral Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|Buccofacial or <b>orofacial</b> apraxia: Non-verbal oral or buccofacial {{ideomotor apraxia}} {{resulting}} in difficulty carrying out {{movements of the}} face on demand. For example, an inability to lick one's lips or whistle. This is an ability to carry out any volitional movements of the tongue, cheeks, lips, pharynx, or larynx on command.|$|E
25|$|Cleft lip and cleft palate, {{also known}} as <b>orofacial</b> cleft, {{is a group of}} {{conditions}} that includes cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP), and both together (CLP). A cleft lip contains an opening in the upper lip that may extend into the nose. The opening may be on one side, both sides, or in the middle. A cleft palate is when the roof of the mouth contains an opening into the nose. These disorders can result in feeding problems, speech problems, hearing problems, and frequent ear infections. Less than half the time the condition is associated with other disorders.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{influences}} {{may also}} cause, or interact with genetics to produce, <b>orofacial</b> clefting. An {{example of how}} environmental factors might be linked to genetics comes from research on mutations in the gene PHF8 that cause cleft lip/palate (see above). It was found that PHF8 encodes for a histone lysine demethylase, and is involved in epigenetic regulation. The catalytic activity of PHF8 depends on molecular oxygen, a fact considered important with respect to reports on increased incidence of cleft lip/palate in mice that {{have been exposed to}} hypoxia early during pregnancy. In humans, fetal cleft lip and other congenital abnormalities have also been linked to maternal hypoxia, as caused by e.g. maternal smoking, maternal alcohol abuse or some forms of maternal hypertension treatment. Other environmental factors that have been studied include: seasonal causes (such as pesticide exposure); maternal diet and vitamin intake; retinoids— which are members of the vitamin A family; anticonvulsant drugs; nitrate compounds; organic solvents; parental exposure to lead; alcohol; cigarette use; {{and a number of other}} psychoactive drugs (e.g. cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin).|$|E

500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of toothache can be challenging, {{not only because}} the list of potential causes is extensive, but also because dental pain may be extremely variable, and pain can be referred to and from the teeth. Dental pain can simulate virtually any facial pain syndrome. However, the vast majority of toothache is caused by dental, rather than non-dental, sources. Consequently, the saying [...] "horses, not zebras" [...] has been applied to the differential {{diagnosis of}} <b>orofacial</b> pain. That is, everyday dental causes (such as pulpitis) should always be considered before unusual, non-dental causes (such as myocardial infarction). In the wider context of <b>orofacial</b> pain, all cases of <b>orofacial</b> pain may be considered as having a dental origin until proven otherwise. The diagnostic approach for toothache is generally carried out in the following sequence: history, followed by examination, and investigations. All this information is then collated and used to build a clinical picture, and a differential diagnosis can be carried out.|$|E
500|$|Primary <b>orofacial</b> herpes {{is readily}} {{identified}} by clinical examination {{of persons with}} no previous history of lesions and contact with an individual with known HSV-1 infection. The appearance and distribution of sores in these individuals typically presents as multiple, round, superficial oral ulcers, accompanied by acute gingivitis. Adults with atypical presentation {{are more difficult to}} diagnose. Prodromal symptoms that occur before the appearance of herpetic lesions help differentiate HSV symptoms from the similar symptoms of other disorders, such as allergic stomatitis. [...] When lesions do not appear inside the mouth, primary <b>orofacial</b> herpes is sometimes mistaken for impetigo, a bacterial infection. Common mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcer) also resemble intraoral herpes, but do not present a vesicular stage.|$|E
500|$|Antibodies {{that develop}} {{following}} an initial infection with {{a type of}} HSV prevents reinfection with the same virus type—a person {{with a history of}} <b>orofacial</b> infection caused by HSV-1 cannot contract herpes whitlow or a genital infection caused by HSV-1. [...] In a monogamous couple, a seronegative female runs a greater than 30% per year risk of contracting an HSV infection from a seropositive male partner. If an oral HSV-1 infection is contracted first, seroconversion will have occurred after 6 weeks to provide protective antibodies against a future genital HSV-1 infection. [...] Herpes simplex is a double-stranded DNA virus.|$|E
500|$|HSV {{infection}} causes several distinct medical disorders. [...] Common {{infection of}} the skin or mucosa may affect the face and mouth (<b>orofacial</b> herpes), genitalia (genital herpes), or hands (herpetic whitlow). [...] More serious disorders occur when the virus infects and damages the eye (herpes keratitis), or invades the central nervous system, damaging the brain (herpes encephalitis). [...] People with immature or suppressed immune systems, such as newborns, transplant recipients, or people with AIDS, [...] are prone to severe complications from HSV infections. HSV infection has also been associated with cognitive deficits of bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, although this is often dependent on the genetics of the infected person.|$|E

2500|$|Temporomandibular {{disorder}} (TMD, also termed [...] "temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome") is {{pain and}} dysfunction of the TMJ and {{the muscles of}} mastication (the muscles that move the jaw). TMD does not fit neatly into any one etiologic category since the pathophysiology is poorly understood and it represents a range of distinct disorders with multifactorial etiology. TMD accounts {{for the majority of}} pathology of the TMJ, and it is the second most frequent cause of <b>orofacial</b> pain after dental pain (i.e. toothache).|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of other {{diseases}} may cause mouth ulcers. Hematological causes include anemia, hematinic deficiencies, neutropenia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, other white cell dyscrasias, and gammopathies. Gastrointestinal causes include celiac disease, Crohn's disease (<b>orofacial</b> granulomatosis), and ulcerative colitis. [...] Dermatological causes include chronic ulcerative stomatitis, erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), angina bullosa haemorrhagica and lichen planus. Other examples of systemic disease capable of causing mouth ulcers include lupus erythematosus, Sweet syndrome, reactive arthritis, Behçet syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, periarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis, diabetes, glucagonoma, sarcoidosis and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis.|$|E
2500|$|Most specialists {{credit the}} Neanderthals with speech {{abilities}} not {{radically different from}} those of modern Homo sapiens. An indirect line of argument is that their tool-making and hunting tactics would have been difficult to learn or execute without some kind of speech. A recent extraction of DNA from Neanderthal bones indicates that Neanderthals had the same version of the FOXP2 gene as modern humans. This gene, once mistakenly described as the [...] "grammar gene", plays a role in controlling the <b>orofacial</b> movements which (in modern humans) are involved in speech.|$|E
2500|$|Measures {{to reduce}} facial trauma include laws {{enforcing}} seat belt use {{and public education}} to increase awareness {{about the importance of}} seat belts and motorcycle helmets. [...] Efforts to reduce drunk driving are other preventative measures; changes to laws and their enforcement have been proposed, as well as changes to societal attitudes toward the activity. Information obtained from biomechanics studies can be used to design automobiles with a view toward preventing facial injuries. [...] While seat belts reduce the number and severity of facial injuries that occur in crashes, airbags alone are not very effective at preventing the injuries. In sports, safety devices including helmets have been found {{to reduce the risk of}} severe facial injury. [...] Additional attachments such as face guards may be added to sports helmets to prevent <b>orofacial</b> injury (injury to the mouth or face); mouth guards also used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orofacial</b> pain is {{a general}} term {{covering}} any pain which is felt in the mouth, jaws and the face. <b>Orofacial</b> pain is a common symptom, {{and there are many}} causes. It is estimated that over 95% of cases of <b>orofacial</b> pain result from dental causes (i.e. toothache caused by pulpitis or a dental abscess). After dental pain, the second most common cause of <b>orofacial</b> pain is temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, pain-dysfunction syndrome). All other causes of <b>orofacial</b> pain are rare in comparison, although the full differential diagnosis is extensive.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Orofacial</b> granulomatosis is {{enlargement}} of lips {{due to the}} formation of non-caseating granulomatous inflammation, which obstruct lymphatic drainage of the <b>orofacial</b> soft tissues, causing lymphedema. Essentially, granulomatous cheilitis refers to the lip swelling that accompanies this condition. [...] "Median cheilitis" [...] may be seen, which is fissuring in the midline of the lips due to the {{enlargement of}} the lips. Angular cheilitis may also be associated with <b>orofacial</b> granulomatosis.|$|E
50|$|Also called myofunctional therapy, {{the basic}} {{treatment}} aims of <b>orofacial</b> myofunctional therapist is to reeducate {{the movement of}} muscles, restore correct swallowing patterns, and establish adequate labial-lingual postures. An interdisciplinary nature of treatment is always desirable to reach functional goals in terms of swallowing, speech, and other esthetic factors. A team approach {{has been shown to}} be effective in correcting <b>orofacial</b> myofunctional disorders. The teams include an orthodontist, dental hygienist, certified <b>orofacial</b> myologist, general dentist, otorhinolaryngologist, and a speech-language pathologist.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Orofacial</b> pain {{has been}} defined as [...] "pain {{localized}} to the region above the neck, in front of the ears and below the orbitomeatal line, as well as pain within the oral cavity; including pain of dental origin and temporomandibular disorders". However, some <b>orofacial</b> pain conditions may involve areas outside this region, e.g. temporal pain in TMD. Toothache, or odontalgia, is any pain perceived in the teeth or their supporting structures (i.e. the periodontium). Toothache is therefore a type of <b>orofacial</b> pain. Craniofacial pain is an overlapping topic which includes pain perceived in the head, face, and related structures, sometimes including neck pain.|$|E
