40|$|This paper {{deals with}} sales {{promotions}} {{in the form}} of consumer price discounts in fast-moving consumer goods. First, we show analytically that suboptimality is to be expected with respect {{to the size of the}} consumer price discount. This is due to the separate decision making of the retailer and the manufacturer. We then compute the impact of this suboptimality for a database of eighty-six sale promotions, and we find that it is substantial. On average, the actual profitability of the sales promotions is only about one fourth of its potential profitability. The suboptimality problem can be solved through specific arrangements between retailer and manufacturer, which have the purpose of better channel coordination. One of these is a proportional discount sharing arrangement, in which each party contributes to the consumer price discount in proportion to its <b>original</b> <b>margin</b> (without sales promotion). Several other winwin arrangements are possible also. Sales promotions;channel coordination;channels of distribution;consumer price discounts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Wounds in the nonglabrous skin of keloid-prone {{individuals}} tend {{to cause}} large disordered accumulations of collagen which {{extend beyond the}} <b>original</b> <b>margins</b> of the wound. In addition to abnormalities in keloid fibroblasts, comparison of dermal fibroblasts derived from nonwounded glabrous or nonglabrous skin revealed differences that {{may account for the}} observed location of keloids. Methods Fibroblast apoptosis and the cellular content of α-smooth-muscle actin, TGFβ 1 receptorII and ED-A fibronectin were estimated by FACS analysis. The effects of TGFβ 1 and serum were examined. Results In monolayer cultures non-glabrous fibroblasts were slower growing, had higher granularity and accumulated more α-smooth-muscle actin than fibroblasts from glabrous tissues. Keloid fibroblasts had the highest level of α-smooth-muscle actin in parallel with their expression level of ED-A fibronectin. TGFβ 1 positively regulated α-smooth-muscle actin expression in all fibroblast cultures, although its effects on apoptosis in fibroblasts from glabrous and non-glabrous tissues were found to differ. The presence of collagen I in the ECM resulted in reduction of α-smooth-muscle actin. A considerable percentage of the apoptotic fibroblasts in attached gels were α-smooth-muscle actin positive. The extent of apoptosis correlated positively with increased cell and matrix relaxation. TGFβ 1 was unable to overcome this apoptotic effect of matrix relaxation. Conclusion The presence of myofibroblasts and the apoptosis level can be regulated by both TGFβ 1 and by the extracellular matrix. However, reduction of tension in the matrix is the critical determinant. This predicts that the tension in the wound bed determines the type of scar at different body sites. </p...|$|R

Unlike normal scars, keloids {{extend beyond the}} <b>original</b> wound <b>margin</b> and rarely regress; instead, they tend to proliferate indefinitely. 1 - 4 These bulky scars can significantly impair function due to itching, pain, and decreased range of motion 5 and can negatively impact psychosocial well-being and overall quality of life. 5 - 7 Although many different therapeutic modalities exist, keloids are extremely resistant to treatment and have {{a high rate of}} recurrence. 1, 2, 8 - 10 Development of effective, targeted interventions has been limited due to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of keloid scarring.

40|$|Various {{methods of}} {{management}} of locally advanced breast cancer have been proposed, including combinations of chemotherapy, surgery. radiotherapy. immunotherapy and hormone manipulation. This retrospective study evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} chemotherapy {{in the management of}} locally advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women by examining the pathology of the mastectomy specimens. Sixteen women who on initial clinical examination had breast cancers measuring 5 cm or greater underwent chemotherapy prior to surgery. Four women were also treated with radiotherapy prior to surgery. All 16 women underwent msstectomy and axillary clearance. All specimens showed residual tumour in the mastectomy specimen or the regional lymph nodes. Chemotherapy is useful in reducing tumour burden to allow surgical resection, but does not produce centripetal shrinkage of tumour, nor sterilize the breast of cancer. In this small series. the addition of radiotherapy also failed to clear the patient of tumour. Wide surgical excision including the <b>original</b> tumour <b>margins</b> is thus required to achieve locoregional control. Until chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens can be proved to sterilize the breast of tumour, we caution against the use of any surgery less than total mastectomy if optimal local control is to be achieved for locally advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women.

40|$|It {{is common}} to test {{components}} after they are designed and redesign if necessary. The reduction of the uncertainty in the probability of failure that can occur after a test is usually not incorporated in reliability calculations at the design stage. This reduction in uncertainty is accomplished by additional knowledge provided by the test and by redesign when the test reveals that the component is unsafe or overly conservative. In this paper, a methodology is developed to estimate {{the effect of a}} single future thermal test followed by redesign and to model the effect of the resulting reduction of the uncertainty in the probability of failure. Using assumed distributions of computation and experimental errors and given redesign rules, possible outcomes of the future test and redesign throughMonte Carlo sampling are obtained to determinewhat changes in probability of failure, design, andweight will occur. In addition, Bayesian updating is used to gain accurate estimates of the probability of failure after a test. These methods are demonstrated through a future thermal test on an integrated thermal protection system. Performing redesign following a single future test can reduce the probability of failure by orders of magnitude, on average, when the objective of the redesign is to restore <b>original</b> safety <b>margins.</b> Redesign for a given reduced probability of failure allows additional weight reduction.

40|$|International audienceOrogens {{resulting}} from the closure of narrow oceans, such as the Alps or the Pyrenees, usually lack voluminous synsubduction and synorogenic magmatism. Such orogenies are essentially controlled by mechanical processes in which the initial architecture of the <b>original</b> rifted <b>margins</b> strongly controls {{the architecture of the}} orogen. In this paper we first provide a synthesis of the structure, dimensions, and lithology of hyperextended rift systems and oceans, based on recent seismic and petrologic data. We then investigate how rift-related inheritance influences crustal characteristics and mantle geochemistry of orogens related to the closure of narrow oceans, and compare them to orogens {{resulting from}} the closure of wide and/or mature oceans. Our results show that narrow oceans usually lack a mature spreading system forming Penrose-type oceanic crust (i. e., 6 – 7 -km-thick basaltic oceanic crust typical of steady-state spreading systems; see Anonymous, 1972), in contrast to wide oceans. However, there is statistically no difference in the structural and lithological architecture of their passive continental margins. Thus, the main difference between narrow and wide oceans is whether the margins are separated by a significant amount of oceanic crust and underlying depleted mantle. In addition, {{due to the lack of}} significant magmatism during the closure of narrow oceans, the mantle wedge is likely to remain relatively fertile compared to the wedge above long-lasting subduction of wide oceans. This difference in mantle composition may dictate the magmatic budget of subsequent orogenic collapse or rifting events...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCurrent {{understanding}} of reverberation chambers is firmly funded upon their being operated as overmoded cavities. A proper definition of this condition has been lacking {{for a long}} time, while being regarded as automatically satisfied {{as soon as a}} large (and unspecified) number of normal modes are set to resonate at the frequency of operation of the chamber. In a recent work, we have introduced in a formal way a proper definition of the overmoded condition, showing how, from a strict mathematical viewpoint, it is not related to any threshold frequency, but rather requiring a statistical framework. In this paper we revisit the most important results from our analysis, and show how our theory can straightforwardly explain the non-compliance often observed for field statistics in what are deemed to be overmoded cavities. Partial overlapping between the normal modes of the cavity are shown to lead to an alternative and more physically-based explanation for this phenomenon, without invoking the concept of an ineffective stirring technique, nor the presence of unstirred components. The proposed theory is finally applied for the assessment of the relationship existing between the actual confidence margin based on the ideal properties of a reverberation chamber and those predicted by our model, showing how there is non-negligible probability of having a large number of samples outside the <b>original</b> confidence <b>margin,</b> i. e., a potentially erroneous estimate of the true variability of a field-related quantity...|$|R

To exemplify the phenomenon of margin contraction during specimen preparation for histopathological analysis, we quantified the shrinkage of breast specimens {{as a result of}} formalin fixation. MethodsFifty consecutive mastectomy and wide excision specimens were prospectively appraised. The closest free margin and maximal tumour diameter of fresh, unprepared specimens were recorded. These measurements were compared with the corresponding parameters following tissue fixation. ResultsFollowing formalin fixation, the mean closest free margin of the specimens was found to have decreased from 10. 28 mm to 6. 78 mm (34 %).

40|$|The {{treatment}} of large bone defects still poses {{a major challenge}} in orthopaedic and cranio-maxillofacial surgery. One possible solution could be the development of personalized porous titanium-based implants {{that are designed to}} meet all mechanical needs with a minimum amount of titanium and maximum osteopromotive properties so that it could be combined with growth factor-loaded hydrogels or cell constructs to realize advanced bone tissue engineering strategies. Such implants could prove useful for mandibular reconstruction, spinal fusion, the {{treatment of}} extended long bone defects, or to fill in gaps created on autograft harvesting. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the mechanical properties and potential of bone formation of light weight implants generated by selective laser melting (SLM). We mainly focused on osteoconduction, as this is a key feature in bone healing and could serve as a back-up for osteoinduction and cell transplantation strategies. To that end, defined implants were produced by SLM, and their surfaces were left untreated, sandblasted, or sandblasted/acid etched. In vivo bone formation with the different implants was tested throughout calvarial defects in rabbits and compared with untreated defects. Analysis by micro computed tomography (μCT) and histomorphometry revealed that all generatively produced porous Ti structures were well osseointegrated into the surrounding bone. The histomorphometric analysis revealed that bone formation was significantly increased in all implant-treated groups compared with untreated defects and significantly increased in sand blasted implants compared with untreated ones. Bone bridging was significantly increased in sand blasted acid-etched scaffolds. Therefore, scaffolds manufactured by SLM should be surface treated. Bone augmentation beyond the <b>original</b> bone <b>margins</b> was only seen in implant-treated defects, indicating an osteoconductive potential of the implants that could be utilized clinically for bone augmentation purposes. Therefore, designed porous, lightweight structures have potential for bone regeneration and augmentation purposes, especially when complex and patient-specific geometries are essential...|$|R
