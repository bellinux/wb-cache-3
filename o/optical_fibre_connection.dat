5000|$|An MWA antenna {{comprises}} {{four by four}} regular grid of dual-polarisation dipole elements {{arranged on}} a 4m x 4m steel mesh ground plane. Each antenna (with its 16 dipoles) {{is known as a}} [...] "tile". Signals from each dipole pass through a low noise amplifier (LNA) and are combined in an analogue beamformer to produce tile beams on the sky. Beamformers sit next to the tiles in the field. The radio frequency (RF) signals for the tile-beams are transmitted to a receiver, each receiver being able to process the signals from a group of eight tiles. Receivers therefore sit in the field, close to groups of eight tiles; cables between receivers and beamformers carry data, power and control signals. Power for the receivers is provided from a central generator. The receiver contains analogue elements to condition the signals in preparation for sampling and digitisation. The frequency range 80-300 MHz is Nyquist-sampled at high precision. Digital elements in the receiver (after the digitiser) are used to transform the time-series data to the frequency domain with a 1.28 MHz resolution - 5 bits real and 5 bits imaginary for each resolution element. Sets of 1.28 MHz coarse frequency channels are transmitted via an <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>connection</b> to the correlator subsystem, located in the CSIRO Data Processing Facility near the MWA site. MWA shares the CSIRO facility with the ASKAP program.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the potential sensing applications of fibre Bragg gratings in polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibres.</b> Fibre Bragg gratings are fabricated in {{different kinds of}} polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibres,</b> including Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and TOPAS cyclic olefin copolymer based microstructured polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibres</b> and PMMA based step-index photosensitive polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre,</b> using the 325 nm continuous wave ultraviolet laser and phase mask technique. The thermal response of fabricated microstructured polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings has been characterized. The PMMA based single mode microstructured polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings exhibit negative non-linear Bragg wavelength shift with temperature, including a quasi-linear region. The thermal sensitivity of such Bragg gratings in the linear region is up to - 97 pm/°C. A permanent shift in the grating wavelength at room temperature is observed when such gratings are heated above a threshold temperature which can be extended by annealing the fibre before grating inscription. The largest positive Bragg wavelength shift with temperature in transmission is observed in TOPAS based few moded microstructured polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings and the measured temperature sensitivity is 250 ± 0. 5 pm/°C. Gluing method is developed to maintain stable optical coupling between PMMA based single mode step index polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings and single mode step index silica <b>optical</b> <b>fibre.</b> Being benefit from this success, polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings are able to be characterised for their temperature, humidity and strain sensitivity, which are - 48. 2 ± 1 pm/°C, 38. 3 ± 0. 5 pm per %RH and 1. 33 ± 0. 04 pm/µ??respectively. These sensitivities have been utilised to achieve several applications. The strain sensitivity of step index polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg grating devices has been exploited in the potential application of the strain condition monitoring of heavy textiles and when being attached to textile specimens with certain type of adhesives. These polymer fibre Bragg grating devices show better strain transfer and lower structure reinforcement than silica <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg grating devices.
