5|$|When war was {{declared}} in August 1914, the Liverpool Scottish mobilised {{and moved to}} Scotland {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-Colonel William Nicholl. Duplicate battalions were formed in Liverpool from personnel unable to volunteer for <b>overseas</b> <b>service.</b> The second-line battalion, designated as the 2/10th to distinguish it from the original, was organised in October, the third-line in May 1915. They became responsible for the training of recruits and provision of drafts for <b>overseas</b> <b>service.</b> The 2/10th, raised and organised by Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Adam Fairrie, was committed to the Western Front in 1917. The third-line remained in Britain {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a {{solicitor}} in Leicester before volunteering for <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> during the First World War. He was killed in July 1915 near Ypres on the Western Front, after {{being hit by a}} shell splinter while serving as a lieutenant in the 1/4th Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment. Tarr was one of 27 former England internationals killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|The militia {{garrison}} {{artillery and}} engineers were required throughout the war, however, to man the coastal defences. Despite {{the fact that}} after 1915 {{it was decided that}} only small garrisons were required on active service, the militia was ordered to maintain their readiness in case they were required to be called out and such was the importance placed upon their role that to a large extent they were barred from joining the AIF for <b>overseas</b> <b>service.</b> In February 1916 a large-scale effort by militia artillerymen to enlist in the artillery units that were being raised for the 3rd Division was prevented when they were called out to man the coastal defences due to the threat posed by a German commerce raider that was believed to be in the Pacific. This mobilisation lasted until April 1916, when the garrisons were again reduced and the ban on men serving in militia artillery and engineer units volunteering for <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> was lifted.|$|E

5|$|Built for <b>overseas</b> <b>service,</b> Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were {{assigned}} to the East Asia Squadron in 1909 and 1910, respectively. Both ships had brief careers; shortly before the outbreak of World War I, the ships departed the German colony at Tsingtao. On 1 November 1914, the ships destroyed a British force at the Battle of Coronel and inflicted upon the Royal Navy its first defeat since the Battle of Plattsburgh in 1814. The East Asia Squadron, including both Scharnhorst-class ships, was subsequently annihilated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December.|$|E
5|$|For two years, the 2nd East Lancashire Division (numbered the 66th Division in August 1915), {{provided}} trained {{replacements for}} its parent unit {{and carried out}} home defence duties in England. Elements of the division assembled near Southport in late 1914, then moved south to the Kent–Sussex area in May 1915 and to Essex in early 1916. In early 1915, the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers, a second-line battalion, was detached for <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> and joined the 51st (Highland) Division. The battalion was replaced by another duplicate battalion, the 3/5th Lancashire Fusiliers, which {{became one of the}} few third-line territorial battalions to see active service. One of the three companies of Royal Engineers, was sent to France in 1915 to join the 48th (South Midland) Division and during 1916, three of the four heavy and howitzer artillery batteries were withdrawn or broken up. Following the Military Service Act of January 1916, all Territorial soldiers were deemed to liable for <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> and in February 1917, the 66th Division was instructed to prepare for a move to continental Europe and received a new and experienced commander, Major-General Herbert Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|In all 416,806 Australians {{enlisted in}} the AIF {{during the war and}} 333,000 served overseas. 61,508 were killed and another 155,000 were wounded (a total {{casualty}} rate of 65%). The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly {{towards the end of the}} fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war.|$|E

5|$|On 20 September 1939 the Australian War Cabinet {{approved}} {{the formation of}} a RAAF Expeditionary Force for <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> which would have included a wing designated No. 1 Fighter Wing as well as two wings of bombers. Under the approved structure for the Expeditionary Force, No. 1 Fighter Wing was to command No.7 and No. 15 Squadrons. This plan proved short-lived as on 20 October the Government announced that the formation of the Expeditionary Force would not proceed, with the Empire Air Training Scheme instead being the RAAF's main contribution to overseas campaigns.|$|E

The force arrived on 7 December and was assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Cormoran {{was built}} by the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. Her keel was laid in 1890 and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 17 May 1892. Kaiser Wilhelm II attended the launching ceremony with the senior director of the Kaiserliche Werft. Work was completed by 25 July 1893, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy. Following her commissioning, she underwent two months of sea trials, which were completed on 22 September. Starting in 1894, Cormoran was assigned to <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> in Germany's colonial possessions. She was initially ordered on 2 October to the East Asia Station to replace the gunboat , but the rising tensions in South Africa led the Navy to send the new cruiser to German East Africa to secure German {{interests in the region}} instead.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which precluded sending the Militia outside of Australian territory to fight. While this force would draw from the military forces that already existed—the part-time Citizens Force and the Permanent Military Force—it would be largely be made up from recruits not currently serving. Known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), initially it was to consist of 20,000 men, comprising one infantry division and a light horse brigade. Recruitment for the first intake began on 10 August 1914, and the 7th Battalion was among the first units raised, forming less than a fortnight after the declaration of war.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, {{the decision was made to}} raise an all volunteer force outside of the existing Citizens Force units for <b>overseas</b> <b>service</b> known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). The 6th Battalion was completely recruited from Victoria, drawing from Melbourne and the surrounding suburbs to the north where four Citizens Force battalions—the 55th, 56th, 63rd and 64th Infantry—were headquartered. Raising was complete within a fortnight of {{the outbreak}} of the war in August 1914 and less than two months later the battalion embarked for overseas on the troop transport Suffolk, forming part of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division.|$|E

The 59th was a second-line Territorial Force division, formed from those Territorials and new volunteers who had not volunteered for <b>overseas</b> <b>service.</b> As a result, it was generally undermanned and underequipped, with priority given to equipping its first-line counterpart, and tasked mostly with home defence duties. The 177th Brigade had been formed as the duplicate of the 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade, with two second-line battalions of the Lincolnshire Regiment {{and two of the}} Leicestershire Regiment.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF {{was intended to be}} a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for <b>overseas</b> <b>service)</b> and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.|$|E

She served in this role until the night of 2526 January 1916, when she struck a mine off Cape Arkona. The Navy deemed Gazelle not worth repairing and reduced her to a mine storage hulk, a role she retained {{through the end of}} the war.
