5|$|Germany was {{dependent}} on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany's <b>oil</b> <b>supplies.</b> This forced Hitler to call off Fall Grün, originally planned for 1 October 1938. On 29 September Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Édouard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a one-day conference in Munich {{that led to the}} Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany.|$|E
5|$|German {{successes in}} Europe {{encouraged}} Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia. The Dutch government {{agreed to provide}} Japan some <b>oil</b> <b>supplies</b> from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941. In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo. At the same time, Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East, intending to capitalize off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.|$|E
30|$|Figure  4 {{reveals a}} {{noticeable}} {{difference in the}} effect of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates across various quantiles. The sequence of the estimated coefficients can express the structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates. Panel A reveals the shock structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> on <b>oil</b> exporting countries. The structure of shock tends to be inverse S-shaped. Unlike the median quantile, in the lower and upper quantiles, the estimated coefficient on the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock variables tends to be statistically distinguishable from zero. This implies that for significant US dollar depreciations, the shock is mostly negative, whereas for significant US dollar appreciations it is mostly positive. This pattern is clearly apparent for Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. However, for Mexico, the shock structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> tends to be inverse U-shaped. In both the lower and upper quantiles, the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have negative and statistically significant impacts on its real exchange rate. The structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates in oil-importing countries {{is shown in the}} Panel B. These shock structures tend to be U-shaped in most cases. At the lower quantiles, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have positive and statistically significant effects on both Japan and the European Union. However, at the upper quantiles, only for Japan are the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks positive and statistically significant. Overall, the effects of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates have heterogeneous impacts on different countries and across various quantiles. In particular, for significant US dollar depreciation and appreciation, the impact of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on exchange rates is significantly distinguishable from zero.|$|R
40|$|World <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> {{disruptions}} lead to U. S. economic losses. Because oil is fungible in {{an integrated}} world oil market, increased oil consumption, whether from domestic or imported sources, increases the economic losses associated with <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions. Nevertheless, increased U. S. oil production expands stable <b>supplies</b> and dampens <b>oil</b> price shocks, whereas increased U. S. oil imports boosts the share of world <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> that comes from unstable producers and exacerbates oil price shocks. Some of the economic losses associated with <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions—gross domestic product losses and some transfers abroad—are externalities that can be quantified as oil security premiums. To estimate such premiums for domestic and imported oil, we take into account projected world oil market conditions, probable <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions, the market response to <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions, and the resulting U. S. economic losses. Our estimates quantify the security externalities associated with increased oil use, which derive from the expected U. S. economic losses resulting from potential disruptions in world <b>oil</b> <b>supply.</b> <b>oil</b> markets, energy security, oil prices, economic activity...|$|R
30|$|For a {{significant}} US dollar depreciation (at lower quantiles), the extreme impacts of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> and demand shocks on exchange rates {{are shown in}} Table  4. For oil-exporting countries, the estimated coefficients on <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock variables are negative and statistically significant for Canada, Mexico and the UK at the 0.01 quantile, and for Norway at the 0.05 quantile. While for oil-importing countries, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks only have positive and significant impacts on exchange rate returns in the EU. These results can be easily explained. The <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks possibly reflect the discovery of new oil fields, better extraction technologies or a decline in OPEC’s control over the <b>oil</b> <b>supply.</b> Following an <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock that alters the oil balance, the real exchange rate moves to ensure an offsetting adjustment in the non-oil trade balance in order to stabilize net foreign assets. Therefore, a positive <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock has negative impacts (US dollar depreciation) on exchange rate returns in oil-exporting countries while having positive impacts (US dollar appreciation) in oil-importing countries.|$|R
5|$|Governor Rick Perry {{activated}} the National Guard and mobilized emergency personnel {{to the region}} expected {{to be affected by}} the storm. Erin was expected to bring flooding to the region, which had already been declared a disaster area on August 7, 2007 due to widespread flooding on the Nueces River basin; this area remained flooded as of August 15, 2007. On August 15, oil futures rose to $74.01 (USD), due to fears of Erin disrupting <b>oil</b> <b>supplies</b> produced on Texan coasts, combined with low oil inventories. As a result of the threat from the storm, Shell Oil Company evacuated 188workers on oil platforms in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch pipelines, are {{petroleum}} pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, petroleum products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the <b>oil</b> <b>supplies</b> to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, championed the pipeline project {{as a way of}} transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{numerical}} model is {{developed for the}} complete <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> system of a scroll com-pressor. The system includes oil sump, pickup tube, oil gallery, bearings, and associated oil feed holes, vent, and port. There are two fluids, oil and gas, inside the system. The flow is numerically simulated as a heterogeneous Eulerian–Eulerian turbulent multi-phase flow. The investigation covers the entire working process of the scroll compressor from dry-start to steady state. Two design parameters, initial oil sump depth and viscosity, are studied comparatively. The detailed oil–gas flow inside the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> system {{is characterized by the}} field quantities. The physical mechanisms controlling <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> rate are defined. The <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> rate and the bearing prime time (the time after which oil is flowing through a bearing) are obtained. The results can be used to design and optimize the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> system to improve the reliability and efficiency of scroll compressors...|$|R
5|$|The {{third and}} final stage of the {{campaign}} was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of Borneo. This operation had been opposed by Blamey, who {{believed that it was}} unnecessary, but went ahead on the orders of MacArthur. After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7thDivision landed near the town on 1July. Balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21July but mopping up continued {{until the end of the}} war as isolated pockets of Japanese resistance remained. The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World WarII. Although the Borneo campaign was criticised in Australia at the time, and in subsequent years, as pointless or a waste of soldiers' lives, it did achieve a number of objectives, such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the NEI, capturing major <b>oil</b> <b>supplies</b> and freeing Allied prisoners of war, who were being held in deteriorating conditions.|$|E

30|$|The {{identifying}} restrictions underlying Eq. (3) first {{imply that}} the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> does not respond to oil demand or oil price shocks contemporaneously. This can be interpreted this way for the following reason: {{because of the high}} costs of changing production in the short run, oil producers are reluctant to change their output immediately following changes in demand. Secondly, oil demand changes in impact following an <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock but not an oil price shock. This restriction is in line with the sluggish adjustment of global real economic activity due to movements in oil prices. Finally, the real oil price is assumed to respond to <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> and demand shocks within the month. This assumption is plausible, as any exogenous changes in crude <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> or the real economy are immediately reflected in oil prices.|$|R
