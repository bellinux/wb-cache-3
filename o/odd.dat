5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of <b>odd</b> order (having an <b>odd</b> number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an <b>odd</b> number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this <b>odd</b> number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of <b>odd</b> degree. Finally, the even number of <b>odd</b> vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
5|$|For example, all {{complete}} graphs Kn and all <b>odd</b> cycles (cycle graphs of <b>odd</b> length) are cores.|$|E
5|$|The <b>odd</b> girth is, equivalently, the {{smallest}} <b>odd</b> number g {{for which there}} exists a homomorphism from the cycle graph on g vertices to G. For this reason, if G → H, then the <b>odd</b> girth of G is {{greater than or equal}} to the <b>odd</b> girth of H.|$|E

5|$|A {{configuration}} in Rule 90 can be partitioned {{into two}} subsets of cells {{that do not}} interact with each other. One of these two subsets consists of the cells in even positions at even time steps and the cells in <b>odd</b> positions in <b>odd</b> time steps. The other subset consists of the cells in even positions at <b>odd</b> time steps and the cells in <b>odd</b> positions at even time steps. Each of these two subsets {{can be viewed as}} a cellular automaton with only its half of the cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes then follow whose exact {{sequence}} is unclear. <b>Odd</b> goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While <b>Odd</b> is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks <b>Odd</b> to meet him there inside the secure zone. <b>Odd</b> goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} have <b>odd</b> atomic numbers; hence, their {{isotopes}} must be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are <b>odd)</b> or odd–even (proton number is <b>odd,</b> but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have <b>odd</b> mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, {{and are therefore more}} strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E

5|$|Los Angeles hip hop {{collective}} <b>Odd</b> Future; {{who they}} were known for their frequent collaborations, releasing mixtapes together in the past, such as Radical and the original <b>Odd</b> Future Tape.

5|$|The OF Tape Vol. 2 is {{the debut}} studio album by American hip hop {{collective}} <b>Odd</b> Future, released March 20, 2012, on <b>Odd</b> Future Records and RED Distribution.

The album features appearances from <b>Odd</b> Future members Hodgy Beats, Tyler, The Creator, Domo Genesis, Frank Ocean, Mike G, The Internet, Taco, Jasper Dolphin, Left Brain and L-Boy, {{as well as an}} uncredited appearance from Earl Sweatshirt. Production on the album was primarily handled by Left Brain and Tyler, The Creator, with Frank Ocean, Hal Williams and Matt Martians also receiving production credits. Lyrically the album ranges from being serious to being satirical, with some tracks offering an overly absurdist take on rap.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} her {{graduate work}} in 1971, Godwin spent two {{months at the}} Yaddo artist's colony in Upstate New York in 1972. There she wrote 100 pages of a novel called The Villain, which was never published. The work was scrapped, but ended up {{being part of the}} basis for The <b>Odd</b> Woman. According to author Jane Hill, it was while working on The <b>Odd</b> Women that Godwin transitioned from linear narratives to more complex structures where the plot interweaves past and present events.|$|E

5|$|By 1976 Godwin was a {{successful}} writer and novelist who had published three books: The Perfectionists, Glass People, and The <b>Odd</b> Woman. The <b>Odd</b> Woman was the longest and most widely recognized of the three. Several short stories by Godwin were published in prominent magazines like Harper's Esquire, Ms. and the Paris Review, where she was often featured on the cover. Godwin was awarded grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (1975–76) and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1975–76).|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the great}} rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the {{primordial}} isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given <b>odd</b> mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since {{there is not a}} difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an <b>odd</b> number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an <b>odd</b> atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.|$|E

5|$|In graph theory, a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose {{vertices}} are {{split into two}} colors, such that neighboring vertices have different colors. If a connected graph has no <b>odd</b> cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or <b>odd.</b> Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base vertex is colored differently from its neighbors, which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E
