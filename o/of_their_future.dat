5|$|Agatha is {{reconnected}} to the PreCrime system. While {{attempting to}} comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains {{that as he}} {{could not afford to}} let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>future,</b> they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.|$|E
5|$|Stage directors, unaided by {{post-production}} {{effects and}} camera tricks, have used other methods {{to depict the}} ghost. In the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by Henry Irving employed {{a wide variety of}} approaches for this task. In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear {{in the middle of the}} scene, and then again from the midst of the audience. In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> through palmistry); he used Macbeth's shadow as the ghost. In 1936 Orson Welles directed the Federal Theatre Project production of the play, with an African-American cast that included Canada Lee in the role of Banquo.|$|E

5|$|Martin Varno's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Cormans {{eventually}} led him to take them into formal arbitration proceedings. Although Varno was {{not a member of}} the Writers Guild of America when he wrote the Blood Beast script, he was encouraged by actor Jay Jostyn to discuss the matter with them. According to Varno, Jostyn claimed several actors and writers had similar problems with the Cormans in the past, but were not taking action because the Cormans provided them continued work in their films. After meeting with the Writers Guild, Varno became a member and filed arbitration papers against the Cormans for not paying him enough. Roger Corman was in the process of editing the film when he received the arbitration notice, and he became so angry he started screaming and throwing things in the cutting room. Varno claims one of the film crew members approached him (Varno) and promised that the Cormans would hire Varno to work on many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> films if he dropped the matter, but Varno refused.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the {{proportional}} decrease in public funding to the higher education sector {{in countries such as}} the UK, Australia and New Zealand have seen universities become increasingly entrepreneurial in raising revenue, especially in the international education market. This has dramatically increased the number of international students attending Western universities and the delivery of courses overseas. Despite rhetoric concerning internationalisation of the curriculum changes mainly focus on inducting international students into the Western educational system and little {{attention has been paid to}} developing curricula to meet the future needs of all students as global citizens. The views of students themselves on <b>their</b> <b>futures</b> and the education they require to live those futures has rarely been sought. This paper introduces the voices of students from all campuses of a large Australian university with eight campuses, two of them ‘offshore’. Interviews with students investigated <b>their</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>futures</b> and <b>their</b> experience <b>of</b> internationalisation of curriculum at the university. Despite their diverse backgrounds and locations the students held similar visions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>futures</b> and saw the need for their education to be relevant to those futures. However, what this meant in practice was complex and informed by identity and geographic location. While some students accepted uncritically what the university offered others experienced their education as a colonialist enterprise. This study highlights the need for universities to know their students and to involve them in curricular planning and in building a new critical pedagogy responsive to the rich diversity of needs of our current student cohorts...|$|R
25|$|Adolf Hitler {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the psychological tactics of warfare the British had employed during WWI, and attributed the defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers.

Hitler also coupled this with the resonating projections of his orations for effect.|$|E
25|$|Reception to the Nintendo 2DS was mixed; while Nintendo {{was praised}} for how it priced and {{positioned}} the 2DS alongside its higher-end counterparts, {{much of its}} criticism was directed towards its regressions {{in comparison to the}} 3DS, such as a design that some considered less appealing than that of the 3DS, its lower sound quality, and its battery life. However, the 2DS's design was praised by some critics for being more robust and comfortable to hold than the 3DS, especially for its target market. Some critics also felt that the lack of 3D support was an admission by Nintendo that the concept was a fad; however, Nintendo has since stated that autostereoscopic 3D would remain a part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> plans.|$|E
25|$|In November 1917, the Scots Greys saw {{a glimpse}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> {{when they moved}} to support the {{armoured}} attack at the Battle of Cambrai. Initially intended {{to be part of}} the exploitation force, as at the Battle of the Somme, the plan failed to develop the type of break through which could be exploited by the cavalry. As the fighting bogged down, the Scots Greys once again found themselves fighting on foot in an infantry role. Interestingly, part of the reason that the Scots Greys were unable to advance as cavalry was because the bridge that was crucial to the advance was accidentally destroyed when the tank crossing it proved to be too heavy. Unable to advance mounted, the Scots Greys were committed as infantry to the battle.|$|E
