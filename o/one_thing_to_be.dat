500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Bianculli, {{writing in}} the New York Daily News, stated {{that the idea of}} putting Monk in New York [...] "sound great" [...] on paper but it did not take {{advantage}} of what could be [...] "a delightful study in contrasts." [...] Bianculli called it a [...] "misstep", criticizing its premise and how it was not able to keep the balance between comedy and drama that made it [...] "too outrageous." [...] A review for The Beaver County Times considered it a [...] "stunt episode" [...] and its humor [...] "uncharacteristically forced", saying it [...] "really doesn't do justice to the show's considerable charms." [...] Steve Johnson of Chicago Tribune affirmed that while the premise is funny, [...] "the writers {{go out of their way}} to play the city against his condition." [...] He continued by saying it [...] "wouldn't be so bad" [...] if he went to solve crimes [...] "but Friday's first case is a real stretch." [...] Although excited for the episode's premise prior its broadcast, Austin Smith of the New York Post was very critical of it. Smith said in this episode [...] "the producers have him [...] crossing that fine line between genius and insanity, transforming our hero into a full-blown mental patient." [...] He also criticized the [...] "Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York" [...] scenes as they do not further the episode's plot. Smith co-worker, Linda Stasi also panned the episode, considering Monk's reactions [...] "caricature". Stasi wrote, [...] "It's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an obsessive/compulsive ex-detective who lines up the pins on the murder map and it's another to act like you've got a pin in your brain." [...] As Smith, Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the jokes [...] "predictable" [...] and said [...] "If you aren't a Monk fan, these devices may strike you as altogether shopworn." ...|$|E
2500|$|A compatibilist {{interpretation}} of Aquinas's view is defended thus: [...] "Free-will {{is the cause}} of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Neal {{became a}} free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic {{basketball}} team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the Orlando Sentinel published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning. 82% answered [...] "no". O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill. He said the team [...] "just didn't respect [...]" [...] Another question in the poll asked, [...] "Is Shaq worth $115million?" [...] in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer. 91.3% of the response was [...] "no". O'Neal's Olympic teammates rode him hard over the poll. He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry. O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to [...] "feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond." [...] O'Neal also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him. On the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, it was announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121million contract. He insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money. [...] "I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money", O'Neal said after the signing. [...] "I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok", he added, referring to a couple of his product endorsements. The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season. O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games. In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: [...] "It's one thing to talk tough and <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tough." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Now, captain,” Stephen said, as {{they spent}} a day in {{absolute}} rest after their labours, “there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> more <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{say that}} I do," [...] replied that {{energetic}} person, who was flying about {{the kitchen with}} a speed that made Chester's head dizzy trying to follow her with his eyes. [...] "All I can see is freckles and bones--but if you're satisfied, I am. For law's sake, don't fluster me, Salome. There's a hundred and <b>one</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done out of hand. This frolic has clean dundered the whole forenoon's work." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was beautifully put. There was but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done--I kissed him. And {{there was}} but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said. I asked at what time {{we might expect}} to receive Miss Jillgall. [...] "She is staying, Helena, at a small hotel in the town. I have already sent {{to say that we}} are waiting to see her. Perhaps you will look at the spare bedroom?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{saw one of}} her husband's eyes rise visibly. Stephen did so hate <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confounded with another.|$|E
60|$|She {{did not see}} him; and {{he could}} only think of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, which was to shout her name.|$|E
50|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> note <b>is</b> that Perl DBI {{requires}} one {{to set the}} TaintIn {{attribute of}} a database handle as well as enabling taint mode to check one's SQL strings.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> plain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen, Anne," [...] said Marilla, [...] "and that is {{that your}} fall off the Barry roof hasn't injured your tongue at all." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do next <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{drive back}} to my unhappy daughter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said of it,' Louisa {{repeated}} in her former curious tone; 'it {{will be getting}} away from home. Yes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said of it,' {{returned}} Tom, {{pushing his}} chair from him, and standing up; 'it {{will be getting}} away from home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Done?" [...] {{said the}} Principal One. [...] "There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, {{and that is}} to wash her. There can be no doubt about that." ...|$|E
60|$|Guy {{turned on}} his heel and left the house. There <b>was</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> left <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, {{although}} he hated doing it. He went {{to the office of}} a private detective.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> queer <b>thing,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure," [...] {{admitted}} the captain, with a misgiving of the voice; [...] "that about the sherry. Damned if I {{caught on to}} that. Say, Herrick, you didn't give me away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland {{swung his}} arm up, and {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pointing {{in front of}} him. [...] "You're going to. Go on slow, but <b>be</b> ready <b>to</b> run {{when you see a}} twinkle. The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> remember <b>is</b> that you have a rifle." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CICELY. Oh, I see you're {{one of the}} Idealists--the Impossibilists! We have them, too, occasionally, in our world. There's only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{done with}} them.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was evident}} {{there was only}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. Mrs. Bunting said as much. [...] "The only thing," [...] said she, [...] "is to carry her indoors." ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{done was}} to watch her. I {{was at least}} sly enough {{to take up a}} book, and pretend to be reading it. How contemptible! ...|$|E
60|$|I ran till I got {{a stitch}} in my side, and then slowed {{down to a}} dog-trot. The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get a long way ahead of my pursuers, for surely at the outset they would stick like hounds to my trail.|$|R
50|$|The scene {{starts with}} Kai-Feng {{watching}} television at night. There is {{a documentary about}} bringing the dead back to life as a ghost, with <b>one</b> important <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remembered: the ghost cannot be self-aware {{that he or she}} is a ghost.|$|R
3000|$|We are now {{focused on}} the quasiboundedness of the {{operator}} T instead of that of the operator C.

6000|$|... "Dot, I {{agree with}} you; it's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kissed, and {{quite another to}} have your beauty spoiled," [...] replied Helen, presently. [...] "Who was this {{particular}} savage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see much}} opening," [...] she answered. [...] "If you ask my advice, I should {{say there is}} only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done in Rhodesia just now--turn farmer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done," [...] said Flambeau, [...] "whether {{it belongs}} to this world or the other. I must go {{down and talk to}} my friend." ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Nicholl frankly {{admitted}} {{that in this}} uncharted ocean he {{had no knowledge of}} any near land. The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do <b>was</b> <b>to</b> run for more clement climate, which we accordingly did, setting our small sail and steering quartering before the fresh wind to the north-east.|$|R
50|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> point up <b>is</b> {{that the}} complex adverbs {{are derived from}} verbs or {{nominals}} by the processes of reduplication or semi-reduplication.|$|R

6000|$|... "When the Roman {{purple and}} a princely title are but masks {{to cover a}} swindler, there is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. This swindler must be exposed and punished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, I'm sure, Danny. But {{if this is}} so, there's only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. You must go {{straight}} to Mr. Walters and tell him all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thankful for," [...] said Dick, as they rested from their labors. [...] "That trunk {{might have gone}} through our sides or bottom and sunk us." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{album of}} out-takes and in-studio jams, {{similar to the}} second disc of Present, called ALT was {{released}} in June 2012. Hammill has stated that he has enjoyed the current reunion, as [...] "the activity has reinvigorated me. Going from <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> another <b>is</b> an energizing thing." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>One</b> {{important}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> note <b>is</b> that ORFC encompasses RFC as {{a particular}} case whenever the parameter α <b>is</b> set <b>to</b> zero.|$|R
30|$|So in conditional, all {{estimates}} <b>are</b> constrained <b>to</b> baseline {{estimates and}} changes <b>are</b> made <b>to</b> respective trade policy variable and multilateral resistance terms. <b>One</b> important <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mentioned here <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> obtain conditional GE indexes, expenditures and outputs have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remained constant in this step.|$|R
