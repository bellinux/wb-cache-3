5|$|A {{number of}} other causes may produce similar {{symptoms}} including appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic or ruptured <b>ovarian</b> cysts, <b>ovarian</b> torsion, and endometriosis and gastroenteritis, peritonitis, and bacterial vaginosis among others.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring <b>ovarian</b> hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the <b>ovarian</b> hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of <b>ovarian</b> hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the <b>ovarian</b> or uterine cycle. The <b>ovarian</b> cycle describes changes {{that occur in the}} follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The <b>ovarian</b> cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E
5|$|Brosnan's {{daughter}} Charlotte died on 28 June 2013 of <b>ovarian</b> cancer, {{the same}} illness that claimed her mother's life.|$|E
5|$|His {{third wife}} was actress Gilda Radner, {{with whom he}} starred in three films, the last two of which he also directed. Her 1989 death from <b>ovarian</b> cancer led to his active {{involvement}} in promoting cancer awareness and treatment, helping found the Gilda Radner <b>Ovarian</b> Cancer Detection Center in Los Angeles and co-founding Gilda's Club.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from <b>ovarian</b> cancer, while her grandmother died from <b>ovarian</b> cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early <b>ovarian</b> cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing <b>ovarian</b> cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.|$|E
5|$|The {{follicular}} {{phase is}} {{the first part of}} the <b>ovarian</b> cycle. During this phase, the <b>ovarian</b> follicles mature and get ready to release an egg. The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.|$|E
5|$|Women {{may have}} acute {{low back pain}} from medical {{conditions}} affecting the female reproductive system, including endometriosis, <b>ovarian</b> cysts, <b>ovarian</b> cancer, or uterine fibroids. Nearly half of all pregnant women report pain in the lower back or sacral area during pregnancy, due to changes in their posture and center of gravity causing muscle and ligament strain.|$|E
5|$|Allogamy (outcrossing) on {{the whole}} is {{enforced}} through a late-acting (<b>ovarian)</b> self-incompatibility system, but some species such as N. dubius and N. longispathus are self-compatible producing mixtures of selfed and outcrossed seeds.|$|E
5|$|Doxil (see below) is used {{primarily}} {{for the treatment of}} <b>ovarian</b> cancer where the disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy, or for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} <b>ovarian,</b> Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of <b>ovarian</b> cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the <b>ovarian</b> cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the <b>ovarian</b> follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} levels of <b>ovarian</b> hormones {{at different stages of}} the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these <b>ovarian</b> hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, five of 100 {{women with}} a first-degree {{relative}} with <b>ovarian</b> cancer will eventually get <b>ovarian</b> cancer themselves, placing those with affected family members at triple the risk of women with unaffected family members. Seven of 100 women with two or more relatives with <b>ovarian</b> cancer will eventually get <b>ovarian</b> cancer. In general, 5–10% of <b>ovarian</b> cancer cases have a genetic cause. BRCA mutations are associated with high-grade serous nonmucinous epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|There may an {{association}} of developing <b>ovarian</b> cancer and <b>ovarian</b> stimulation during infertility treatments. Endometriosis {{has been linked to}} <b>ovarian</b> cancers. Human papillomavirus infection, smoking, and talc have not been identified as increasing the risk for developing <b>ovarian</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{epithelial}}-stromal tumour, {{also known}} as <b>ovarian</b> epithelial carcinoma, {{is the most common}} type of <b>ovarian</b> cancer, representing approximately 90% of <b>ovarian</b> cancers. It includes serous tumour, endometrioid tumor, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Less common tumors are malignant Brenner tumor and transitional cell carcinoma of the ovary. Epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancers develop from the epithelium, a layer of cells that covers the ovary.|$|E
25|$|In <b>ovarian</b> cancers, 75% of low {{malignancy}} tumors and 65% of invasive <b>ovarian</b> carcinomas are H19 RNA positive.|$|E
25|$|Radner's death {{helped raise}} {{awareness}} of early detection of <b>ovarian</b> cancer and the connection to familial epidemiology. The media attention {{in the two years}} after Radner's death led to registry of 450 families with familial <b>ovarian</b> cancer at the Familial <b>Ovarian</b> Cancer Registry, a research database registry at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York. The registry was later renamed the Gilda Radner Familial <b>Ovarian</b> Cancer Registry (GRFOCR). In 1996, Gene Wilder and Registry founder Steven Piver, one of Radner's medical consultants, published Gilda's Disease: Sharing Personal Experiences and a Medical Perspective on <b>Ovarian</b> Cancer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ovarian</b> {{hyperstimulation}} is {{the stimulation}} to induce development of multiple follicles of the ovaries. It should start with response prediction by e.g. age, antral follicle count {{and level of}} anti-Müllerian hormone. The resulting prediction of e.g. poor or hyper-response to <b>ovarian</b> hyperstimulation determines the protocol and dosage for <b>ovarian</b> hyperstimulation.|$|E
25|$|In the US, the {{incidence}} rate in women over 50 is approximately 33 per 100,000. The rate of <b>ovarian</b> cancer between 1993 and 2008 decreased in {{women of the}} 40–49 age cohort and in the 50–64 age cohort. <b>Ovarian</b> cancer is most commonly diagnosed after menopause, {{between the ages of}} 60 and 64. Ninety percent of <b>ovarian</b> cancer occurs in women over the age of 45 and 80% in women over 50. Older {{women are more likely to}} present with advanced <b>ovarian</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|HSP90 beta {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the autoantigenic biomarkers and targets involved in human <b>ovarian</b> autoimmune disease leading to <b>ovarian</b> failure and thereby infertility.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} that cause similar symptoms include: miscarriage, <b>ovarian</b> torsion, and acute appendicitis, ruptured <b>ovarian</b> cyst, kidney stone, and pelvic inflammatory disease, among others.|$|E
25|$|From the 1940s {{until the}} late 1980s, DES was FDA-approved as {{estrogen}}-replacement therapy for estrogen deficiency states such as <b>ovarian</b> dysgenesis, premature <b>ovarian</b> failure, and after oophorectomy.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound {{measurement}} of <b>ovarian</b> volume. Lass and Brinsden (1999) {{report that the}} correlation between <b>ovarian</b> volume and follicular density appears to only hold in women ≥ 35 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Small-cell <b>ovarian</b> {{carcinoma}} is {{rare and}} aggressive, with two main subtypes: hypercalcemic and pulmonary. It is typically fatal within 2 years of diagnosis. Hypercalcemic small cell <b>ovarian</b> carcinoma overwhelmingly affects {{those in their}} 20s, causes high blood calcium levels, and affects one ovary. Pulmonary small cell <b>ovarian</b> cancer usually affects both ovaries of older women and looks like oat-cell carcinoma of the lung.|$|E
25|$|Special {{indications}} {{include several}} {{groups of women}} with substantially increased risk of <b>ovarian</b> cancer, such as high-risk BRCA mutation carriers and women with endometriosis who also suffer from frequent <b>ovarian</b> cysts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ovarian</b> cysts are {{considered}} large {{when they are}} over 5cm and giant when they are over 15cm. In children, <b>ovarian</b> cysts reaching above {{the level of the}} umbilicus {{are considered}} giant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ovarian</b> cysts {{increase}} the risk for <b>ovarian</b> torsion; cysts larger than 4cm are associated with approximately 17% risk. The torsion can cause obstruction of blood flow and lead to infarction.|$|E
25|$|Decreased inhibin {{feedback}} after hysterectomy is {{hypothesized to}} contribute to increased <b>ovarian</b> stimulation and earlier menopause. Hastened <b>ovarian</b> aging has been observed after endometrial ablation. While {{it is difficult to}} prove that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the endometrium may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the <b>ovarian</b> stimulation. Elimination of this factors contributes to faster depletion of the <b>ovarian</b> reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur as a consequence of hysterectomy and uterine artery embolisation has been hypothesized {{to contribute to}} this effect.|$|E
25|$|In {{juvenile}} hypothyroidism multicystic ovaries {{are present}} in about 75% of cases, while large <b>ovarian</b> cysts and elevated <b>ovarian</b> tumor marks {{are one of the}} symptoms of the Van Wyk and Grumbach syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Industrialized nations, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Japan, have high rates of epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer, which may be due to diet in those countries. Caucasian are at a 30–40% higher risk for <b>ovarian</b> cancer when compared to Black and Hispanic people, likely due to socioeconomic factors; white women tend to have fewer children and different rates of gynecologic surgeries that affect risk for <b>ovarian</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{family history}} of <b>ovarian</b> cancer is {{a risk factor for}} <b>ovarian</b> cancer. People with {{hereditary}} nonpolyposis colon cancer (Lynch Syndrome), and those with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genetic abnormalities are at increased risk.|$|E
25|$|A {{strong family}} history of endometrial cancer, colon cancer, or other {{gastrointestinal}} cancers may indicate {{the presence of a}} syndrome known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (also known as Lynch syndrome), which confers a higher risk for developing a number of cancers, including <b>ovarian</b> cancer. Lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in mismatch repair genes, including MSH2, MLH1, MLH6, PMS1, and PMS2. The risk of <b>ovarian</b> cancer for an individual with Lynch syndrome is between 10 and 12 percent. People of Icelandic descent, European Jewish descent/Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and Hungarian descent are at higher risk for epithelial <b>ovarian</b> cancer. Estrogen receptor beta gene (ESR2) seems to be a key to pathogenesis and response to therapy. Other genes that have been associated with <b>ovarian</b> cancer are BRIP1, MSH6, RAD51C and RAD51D. CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2 and RAD50 have also been associated with <b>ovarian</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|The risk of <b>ovarian</b> cancer {{increases}} {{in women who}} have ovulated more over their lifetime. This includes those who have never had children, those who begin ovulation {{at a younger age}} or reach menopause at an older age. Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause, fertility medication, and obesity. Factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control, tubal ligation, and breast feeding. About 10% of cases are related to inherited genetic risk; women with mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 have about a 50% chance of developing the disease. The most common type of <b>ovarian</b> cancer, comprising more than 95% of cases, is <b>ovarian</b> carcinoma. There are five main subtypes of <b>ovarian</b> carcinoma, of which high-grade serous carcinoma is the most common. These tumors are believed to start in the cells covering the ovaries, though some may form at the Fallopian tubes. Less common types of <b>ovarian</b> cancer include germ cell tumors and sex cord stromal tumors. A diagnosis of <b>ovarian</b> cancer is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue, usually removed during surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{risks from}} {{developing}} {{specific types of}} <b>ovarian</b> cancer varies. Germ cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors are less common than epithelial tumors. The number of new cases {{a year in the}} US is 0.4 per 100,000 women and 0.2 per 100,000 women, respectively. In young people, sex-cord stromal tumors and germ cell tumors total 1% of overall <b>ovarian</b> cancer. <b>Ovarian</b> cancer represents approximately 4% of cancers diagnosed in women.|$|E
25|$|Suppression of ovulation, {{which would}} {{otherwise}} cause {{damage to the}} <b>ovarian</b> epithelium and, consequently, inflammation, is generally protective. This effect {{can be achieved by}} having children, taking combined oral contraceptives, and breast feeding, all of which are protective factors. A longer period of breastfeeding correlates with a larger decrease in the risk of <b>ovarian</b> cancer. Each birth decreases risk of <b>ovarian</b> cancer more, and this effect is seen with up to five births. Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of <b>ovarian</b> cancer by up to 50%, and the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives can last 25–30 years after they are discontinued. Regular use of aspirin or acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be associated with a lower risk of <b>ovarian</b> cancer; other NSAIDs do not seem to have a similar protective effect.|$|E
