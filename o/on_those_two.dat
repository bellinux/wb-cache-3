Epstein made an attempt at classifying them this way by dividing the breeds into 14 types based <b>on</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> factors. However, in 2002, further genetic analysis revealed that there are only four distinct varieties of Ethiopian sheep: short-fat-tailed, long-fat-tailed, fat-rumped, and thin-tailed.|$|E

This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work <b>on</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E

25|$|Ghostface {{is rarely}} {{depicted}} as speaking while physically on screen, {{in order to}} aid in concealing {{the identity of the}} character behind the mask. Exceptions to this are grunts and groans when injured, which are dubbed into the film during the editing phase by Jackson. Ghostface only speaks physically on screen on two occasions in the series; <b>on</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> occasions, it is just before his true identity is revealed. The voice given to the character, provided by Jackson, is used when talking to another character over the phone or to display the use of the voice changer when the killer reveals himself. Despite being portrayed by different characters in each film, Ghostface displays similar personality and physical attributes regardless of who is wearing the costume or speaking to a target.|$|E
25|$|Rain damaged {{both the}} first and the second day at The County Ground, Hove, and only 93 overs were {{possible}} in two days. Yet, 18 wickets fell <b>on</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> days, 14 of which on the second day. Sussex resumed play on the second day with an overnight score of 97 for 4, and immediately lost two wickets to swing bowler Jon Lewis, who ended with four for 62. However, a quick blast of four fours, one six and one single from Jason Lewry lifted Sussex to 191 all out. The Gloucestershire reply never got off the mark, as seven batsmen were out in single figures and the highest partnership was 33. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan got good output with the ball, however, taking four for 26 as Gloucestershire ended on 142.|$|E
25|$|Others, {{especially}} Isaac Hirsch Weiss, {{object that}} many tosafot— {{particularly those of}} Isaiah di Trani— have no reference to Rashi. Weiss, followed by other scholars, asserts that tosafot means additions to the Talmud, that is to say, they are an extension {{and development of the}} Talmud. For just as the Gemara is a critical and analytical commentary on the Mishnah, so are the Tosafot critical and analytical glosses <b>on</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> parts of the Talmud. Further, the term tosafot was not applied {{for the first time to}} the glosses of Rashi's continuators, but to the Tosefta, the additions to the Mishnah compiled by Judah ha-Nasi I. Tosefta is a Babylonian term, which in Jerusalem writings is replaced by tosafot. The Tosafot resemble the Gemara in other respects also, for just as the latter is the work of different schools carried on through a long period, so the former were written at different times and by different schools, and gathered later into one body.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, {{businessman}} {{and chairman of}} The Press, George Gould, proposed a variety of measures to relieve traffic congestion in Colombo Street and Cathedral Square, including a new bridge over the Avon River connecting Oxford Terrace with Durham Street south, and a new diagonal street from the Armagh Street / Manchester Street intersection to Gloucester Street near its intersection with Colombo Street. The latter proposal would have required the demolition of the Colosseum. Gould suggested this diagonal street be called Little High Street, {{in reference to the}} diagonal High Street further south in the central city. Only two weeks after Gould's proposal, a group of businessman led by Arthur Francis Stacey put a proposal for a new street with a Spanish theme to Christchurch City Council's town planning committee. The group had secured options on the Colosseum and <b>on</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> properties that separated the Colosseum from access onto Armagh Street. The plans had been drawn by Francis Willis, who had previously been employed by Christchurch City Council as their architect, but who had since 1924 been self-employed. Stacey and his business partners had formed a company called Regent Street Limited in 1929; other company directors were David Manson, Alexander Hamilton Forbes, and John Joseph Dougall. By February 1930, the project had been approved in principle by Christchurch City Council. The concept of a number of small shops all built as a comprehensive development was advanced for its time, and can be regarded as the forerunner of modern shopping malls.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the firm}} did not release the poll results before the election. The {{day after the}} election, when Giron had been {{recalled}} by 12 points, they released the poll and company director Tom Jensen explained why they had not initially done so, citing numerous unusual results. These included the district supporting her recall by such a wide margin, despite having been carried by 20 points by Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 election; and voters saying they supported universal background checks by 68% to 27% and being split 47% to 47% on limiting high-capacity ammunition magazines to 15 bullets. Jensen opined that [...] "if voters were really making their recall votes based <b>on</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> laws, that doesn't point to recalling Giron by a 12 point margin" [...] and that the NRA had done a [...] "good job of turning the election more broadly into 'do you support gun rights or are you opposed to them.'"

500|$|Will & Grace creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan based {{the show}} on their own lives. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, based the {{relationship}} between Will and Grace on his real-life relationship with a woman named Janet. Originally, Mutchnick and Kohan first went to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), who told them to create a television series about a new young love story, as Mad About You was going off the air. The character of Will {{was part of a}} sitcom Mutchnick and Kohan first pitched to NBC executives in 1997. The original concept was an ensemble comedy featuring three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman. Warren Littlefield, the executive vice president of NBC at the time, was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted {{to learn more about the}} gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan was sent to create a pilot script centering <b>on</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> characters. NBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show. Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, [...] "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before." [...] The filming of the pilot began in March 1998. The actors who played Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last on television. McCormack said, [...] "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and looking at each other and I said, ‘We’re gonna be on this set for a while.’ And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn’t want to say anything beyond that and jinx it." ...|$|E
