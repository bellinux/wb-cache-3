These timber framed dwellings which date from the 17th century have <b>oversailing</b> upper stories, a common feature of the period, which had the advantage of increasing the space of a small land site.|$|E
500|$|At {{the centre}} of the Expo was the Festival Plaza. Tange {{conceived}} that this plaza (with its <b>oversailing</b> space frame roof) would connect the display spaces and create a setting for a [...] "festival". The plaza divided the site into a northern zone for pavilions and a southern zone for administration facilities. The zones were interconnected with moving pathways.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital has {{occupied}} {{two buildings}} of markedly different architectural character. [...] Thomas Lainson's Queen Anne Revival-style building of 1880–81 in the Montpelier district was distinguished by its Dutch gables and much use of terracotta and red brick. [...] Clayton & Black added a colonnade {{and other parts}} in 1906, and a major extension (again with prominent gables) was undertaken in 1927 by W.H. Overton. It closed in 2007 after its replacement opened next to the RSCH, and has been redeveloped for housing. [...] Lainson's building has been retained but the other parts were demolished in 2012. The new hospital was designed by Building Design Partnership (scheme architect Ben Zucchi) in 2004–07. [...] Its [...] "boat-like form [...] evocative of Noah's Ark" [...] as it rises dramatically above the other RSCH buildings. [...] Features include low, child-height windows, a multicolour-panelled curved façade and an <b>oversailing</b> roof. It cost £36 million, has three times {{the capacity of the}} old building and won a design award in 2008.|$|E
50|$|The line on {{the ground}} under {{the outer edge of}} the eaves is the eavesdrip, or dripline, and in typical {{building}} planning regulations defines the extent of the building and cannot <b>oversail</b> the property boundary.|$|R
50|$|The present mill {{is built}} over four storeys and is brick built with {{weatherboard}} cladding. The east elevation has three bays with gables. There is a timber lucam (covered sack hoist) of shiplap {{construction on the}} top floor of the middle bay which <b>oversails</b> the road below.|$|R
50|$|A {{complicated}} {{system of}} stalactites underline {{a line of}} archivolt, infilling the space of an arched niche. Golden glaze is sparingly interspersed with ornamental patterns of the portal, which is not met {{in the area of}} the mausoleum anymore. Thanks to the deep niches in sides of a central square, the burial vault of the mausoleum has taken the form of an equal-ended cross. It was covered with mirrored groin vault. Walls are encased with two rows of thoroughly drafted stone plates over which <b>oversails</b> brick placement of cushions. The upper chamber is a straight 12 edged dimension of <b>oversailed</b> proportions. Rectangular niches on the walls are framed by more narrow equilateral niches. Top of the 12 edged trunk is surrounded by two-layered stalactite corbel, used as a crossover to the inner cupola, which is folded by stone blocks.|$|R
5000|$|As it stands, the {{hospital}} has ten bays separated by wooden posts, carrying half-fan vaulting supporting an <b>oversailing</b> upper storey. The top floor has three distinctive windows with straight sides but pointed heads. [...] It {{was made a}} listed building in 1961 and is currently listed at grade II*.|$|E

50|$|The {{circular}} {{tower is}} made from bricks and cement rendered from the outside. It is capped by an <b>oversailing</b> bluestone platform at 12 ft above ground levels, supported by shaped bluestone corbels. The platform {{is surrounded by a}} handrail of metal standards and rails. It is topped by the domed lantern housing the optical apparatus, a fourth order catadioptric.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{house has}} three storeys and a circular stair tower. This tower is corbelled out {{heavily in the}} re-entrant angle from the second floor. It is topped with an <b>oversail</b> {{from the roof of}} the south wing. There are angle turrets with conical caps on the top storey. [...] Variations of cable moulding in diminishing courses terminating as foliated stop decorate the corbelling.|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built {{sometime}} in the 16th Century in the half-timbered style typical of the period with plaster infilling. The ground floor and <b>oversailed</b> first floor have leaded casement windows flush with the plaster.The interior of the house has original exposed timber framing and extensive remains of wall paintings can also be seen; however the house is not normally open to the public. It was listed in 1950 and has undergone some restoration work.|$|R
50|$|Owned by Harveys, a brewery in Lewes, since February 2002, the pub {{has existed}} {{in its current}} form for at least 300 years. Built as a Wealden hall house in about 1400, in {{traditional}} Wealden timber frame, it is Grade II* Listed, Shown with image here. It was altered in the 16th century, and re-faced in the 19th century, and has a recessed centre, with curved timber brackets supporting the eaves.

50|$|The {{circular}} {{tower is}} capped by an <b>oversailing</b> bluestone platform supported by shaped bluestone corbels. It {{can be reached}} by a metal stair from the concrete slab which forms the ground floor and foundation for the buildings. The tower walls of stone bricks taper off from a thickness of 19 in at the base to 14 in at the top.|$|E
50|$|A jetty is {{an upper}} floor {{that depends on}} a {{cantilever}} system in which a horizontal beam, the jetty bressummer, supports the wall above and projects forward beyond the floor below (a technique also called <b>oversailing).</b> The bressummer (or breastsummer) itself rests {{on the ends of}} a row of jetty beams or joists which are supported by jetty plates. Jetty joists in their turn were slotted sideways into the diagonal dragon beams at angle of 45° by means of mortise and tenon joints.|$|E
50|$|Trams (from 1901) and trolleybuses {{used to run}} in Brighton. The Lewes Road Bus Garage was {{originally}} the Brighton Corporation Tramways depot; it retains windows etched with this name. Wooden tram shelters survive on Dyke Road, Ditchling Road and Queen's Park Road. They have been turned into bus shelters, and the same has happened in Old Steine {{with a series of}} trolleybus shelters designed in 1939 by Borough Surveyor David Edwards. The cream-coloured structures have curved windows and flat roofs with similarly curved ends which <b>oversail</b> the shelter itself. Their style is Streamline Moderne.|$|R

5000|$|Top of the minarets {{are heavily}} demolished. Narrow spiral stairs built of simple tablet bricks (20x20x5) wave within the minarets. There are saved remains of imposts of arches {{and found out}} {{multiple}} remains of walls in different levels of masonries of the mausoleum’s minarets. There was a significantly bigger portal {{in the place of}} existing one, about which evidence fragments of masonry, which <b>oversails</b> the bay between minarets. Glaze with mosaic patterns yields to glaze of the minarets and mausoleum in quality and its background is black. Glaze is covered with grid of capillary cracks and weakly connected to a crock. Motifs of ornaments of the mausoleum’s decoration aren’t met in decors of the minarets’ portal. Remains of an inscription written in neskh indicates about an order of construction of the mausoleum and name “…Jehan Gudi-khatun”. Perhaps, there is mentioned Kufi-khatun, one of the wives of Hulaku khan, mother of Tekuder - Sultan Ahmad.|$|R

5000|$|The {{tower is}} very similar in design to the other four lighthouses. It is circular, 6 ft in {{diameter}} (internally), with walls tapering from 19 in at the bottom to 14 in at the top. The tower is constructed of stone, and cement rendered, and painted white. On {{top of the tower}} there is an <b>oversailing</b> bluestone platform, supported at by twelve bluestone corbels, at about 12 ft above the ground. The platform can be reached by an iron stair inside the tower. Around the perimeter of the platform is a metal handrail. The platform is topped by the simple metal dome which houses the optical apparatus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tower is}} 40 ft {{from the ground}} to the lantern, made of mass concrete. Its {{external}} plan is round, a unique feature as the later two lighthouses of the same series, at Smoky Cape and Green Cape, used an octagonal profile. The internal well is 40 ft in diameter. The walls taper from 4 ft at the base to 2 ft at the top. The tower is topped by a concrete <b>oversailing</b> cornice which is capped by the gallery itself, made of sixteen basalt blocks, each weighing , which were shipped from Melbourne. The gallery {{is surrounded by a}} gunmetal handrail. Three levels of cast iron stairs lead to the lantern room on top of the tower. Attached to the tower is a stores [...]|$|E
50|$|The lowset {{weatherboard}} lock-up, {{of standard}} government design, {{consists of two}} cells, an <b>oversail</b> veranda enclosed by a steel grill, and a galvanized corrugated steel roof with lead head nails. The lock- up stands on concrete stumps. The cells have steel doors and observation ports, with barred windows above the doors, and barred rear windows, and are lined with horizontal, unpainted boards with steel tongue inserts between them. The exterior is painted a standard government colour. Judging from its construction {{it is possible that}} it pre-dates 1934, and that it was relocated to the Pomona site.The court house is highset and clad in weatherboard, standing on concrete perimeter stumps and tubular steel centre stumps. It has timber framed window hoods clad with corrugated steel, over glass louvres, and casement windows, which have been painted white for privacy. It has vented gable ends, front and rear, with fixed louvres at the apex. Its eves are unlined, with a ventilation gap {{at the top of the}} walls. It has a wooden access ramp leading to the office at the rear of the court house, and a front veranda. Its interior is clad in vertical board, and the courtroom contains the original wooden magistrates bench, witness stand and dock. A small storage room is at the back of the courtroom.|$|R
