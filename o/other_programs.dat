5|$|Between 1947 and 1950, Moore {{began to}} make {{tentative}} steps into the new medium as a panelist and guest host on quiz and musical shows. On June 26, 1950, he was rewarded with his own 30-minute CBS early-evening talk-variety TV program, The Garry Moore Show, which was a shorter version of his radio show. Until September 1950, it was also simulcast on radio. During 1950 and 1951, he hosted prime-time variety hour summer replacements for Arthur Godfrey and his Friends.

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Guy Lombardo {{and the decline of}} the Royal Canadians' special, New Year's Rockin' Eve grew in popularity, and became {{ingrained}} in pop culture—even prompting Clark himself to make appearances on <b>other</b> <b>programs</b> in parody of his role. To this day, New Year's Rockin' Eve has consistently remained the highest-rated New Year's Eve special broadcast by the United States' major television networks; its 2012 edition peaked at 22.6 million home viewers—not including viewers watching from public locations, which were historically not measured by Nielsen. Dick Clark hosted New Year's Rockin' Eve annually from 1973 through 2004, and served as a Times Square correspondent alongside Peter Jennings for ABC News's special coverage of year 2000 celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study and <b>other</b> <b>programs</b> increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to be close to 15,000.|$|E

5|$|In 1995 a {{longitudinal}} study was conducted at the University of Kansas, the first large-scale evaluation of Sesame Street's cognitive effects in over twenty years. Its findings supported those of previous studies: early viewing of educational children's television appeared to contribute to children's school readiness. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds learned as much as advantaged children per hour of viewing, {{but they did not}} watch enough to gain the program's maximum benefit. In comparing the effects of watching Sesame Street with <b>other</b> <b>programs,</b> commercial entertainment and cartoons had a negative effect; watching Sesame Street daily did not increase children's viewing of other categories of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other educational activities.|$|E

In order to spend time with his wife and his newborn son Caleb, Harvey did not announce the last season of Family Double Dare in 1992. He was replaced as announcer by Doc Holliday, an Orlando-area radio host on WXXL's Doc & Johnny in the Morning. Harvey made a cameo appearance on the final episode of the season and the series.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{applications}} were envisaged for the Gemini spacecraft {{at various stages}} before, during, and after the two years {{in which it was}} used by NASA for manned spaceflight. Although none of these proposals ever made it into operation, many were considered seriously, and in some cases flight hardware was constructed prior to cancellation. In the case of the Manned Orbital Laboratory, a Gemini spacecraft was launched on a suborbital demonstration flight in support of the program. In some cases technology developed in the Advanced Gemini program has been reintegrated into <b>other</b> <b>programs,</b> such as components from the Titan IIIM, which was to have launched MOL, being used to upgrade other Titan rockets.|$|E
