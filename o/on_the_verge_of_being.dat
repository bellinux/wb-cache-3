5|$|For Arsenal, defender Tony Adams {{was ruled}} out with injury, as was Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars, and goalkeeper David Seaman. Anelka did not partake, given his {{transfer}} to Real Madrid was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> completed. New signings Oleh Luzhny and Sylvinho were both {{named in the}} squad, but whereas Sylvinho started the game, Luzhny was selected as a substitute. Arsenal, like United, lined up in a 4–4–2 formation. Up front, Fredrik Ljungberg was paired with the club's only available recognised striker, Nwankwo Kanu.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, {{the owners}} were {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, {{and that the}} league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their {{assigned}} position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance reconnaissance patrol, which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence on rail and communications connections and potentially disturb them, {{as well as}} report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. If the situation allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who broke through to the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and {{they were unable to}} get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to seek medical attention. During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to buy new clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught in civilian clothes by French forces.|$|E

25|$|On 19 June, the {{transitional}} parliament speaker Sheikh Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe asked {{the international community}} to send foreign troops to Somalia within the following 24 hours. He stated that the government's power is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> defeated by Islamist forces in the Somali capital. The Cabinet {{declared a state of emergency}} and Somalia asked for help from neighbors Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Yemen. Ethiopia refused saying intervention needs an international mandate.

25|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the combat ability of Zaporozhia was greatly reduced, {{especially}} after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and the Russian annexation of Crimea, when {{the need for the}} Host to guard the borders was removed. At the same time, the Zaporozhian's other enemy, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was also weakened and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> partitioned. This meant that militarily the Zaporozhian Sich was becoming increasingly superfluous, {{but at the same time}} their existence caused friction with Imperial Russian authorities who wanted to colonise the newly acquired lands that the Cossacks inhabited. After a number of Cossack attacks on Serbian colonies and with Cossack support offered to Yemelyan Pugachev, the Russian Empress Catherine the Great issued an order to General Pyotr Tekeli to end the troublesome Sich.|$|E
25|$|During the {{remainder}} of February and March the Australians drove the Japanese north past Soraken Plantation. Eventually, the approximately 1,800 Japanese fell back to a strong defensive line across {{the neck of the}} Bonis Peninsula. Because the 11th Brigade was exhausted from three weeks of jungle combat, frontal assaults were ruled out and an attempt was made to outflank the Japanese positions with an amphibious landing on 8 June. However, the landing force found itself pinned down and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> exterminated. Although Japanese losses were probably higher in the resulting Battle of Porton Plantation, the defenders received a boost in morale and the Australian command called off offensive operations in this sector for the time being. It was instead decided to contain the Japanese along the Ratsua front while resources were diverted to the southern sector for the drive towards Buin.|$|E

25|$|The defense's {{position}} weakened when, on November 28, Darrow {{was accused}} of orchestrating to bribe a prospective juror. The juror reported the offer to police, who set up a sting and observed the defense team's chief investigator, Bert Franklin, delivering $4,000 to the juror two blocks away from Darrow's office. After making payment, Franklin walked one block {{in the direction of}} Darrow's office before being arrested right in front of Darrow himself, who had just walked to that very intersection after receiving a phone call in his office. With Darrow himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> discredited, the defense's hope for a simple plea agreement ended. On December 1, 1911, the McNamara brothers changed their pleas to guilty, in open court. The plea bargain Darrow helped arrange earned John fifteen years and James life imprisonment. Despite sparing the brothers the death penalty, Darrow was accused by many in organized labor of selling the movement out.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{side was}} able to achieve a decisive {{advantage}} during {{the first years of}} the war; the Empress came to control the south-west of England and much of the Thames Valley, while Stephen remained in control of the south-east. The castles of the period were easily defensible, and much of the fighting was attritional in character, comprising sieges, raiding and skirmishing between armies of knights and footsoldiers, many of them mercenaries. In 1141 Stephen was captured following the Battle of Lincoln, causing a collapse in his authority over most of the country. However, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> crowned queen, Empress Matilda was forced to retreat from London by hostile crowds; shortly afterwards, Robert of Gloucester was captured at the rout of Winchester and the two sides agreed to swap their respective captives. Stephen then almost seized Matilda in 1142 during the siege of Oxford, but the Empress escaped from Oxford Castle across the frozen River Thames to safety.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} Spanish from {{reaching}} the ship bridge and encircling from the West, Maurice then ordered the piercing of the dikes near Gameren thus flooding the countryside there. Soon after Sir Francis Vere, crossed the river with 6,000 men, and after doing so then made a successful attack on a Spanish position which they called Durango. The position was stormed {{and as a result}} the Spanish were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> totally cut off. This was too much for the dejected Spanish; morale slumped and Mendoza and his second in command openly clashed over the leadership of the army. Soldiers went unpaid and underfed and many were poorly armed. Desertion rates increased daily and there were rumours of potential mutiny. Mendoza's problems were adding and he saw that Zaltbbommel was becoming an impossibility to take and ordered a retreat from Bommelwaart itself. When the Dutch and English learned of the Spanish retreat, a sortie was made on the former Spanish positions around Zaltbommel, who then looted the abandoned Spanish camp. They captured weapons, women and children and sick prisoners but most were soon released.|$|E
