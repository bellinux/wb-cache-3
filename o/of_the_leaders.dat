We show that if <b>the</b> adjacent graph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system is connected, with the proposed control law, all the followers can track <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> eventually. At last, we generalize the result to the higher dimension case for some special system matrix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader.</b> Key Words: Multi-agent systems, leader-follower, decentralized control, observer...|$|R

40|$|Most coordinated control {{strategies}} for mobile robots {{that have been}} reported in the literature can be classified as either leader-following schemes or behavioral schemes. The most common approach to leader-following is to reduce the problem to trajectory tracking: <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> tracks a pre-defined trajectory and the following robots track transformed coordinates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary disadvantages <b>of</b> this approach is that <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> is independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> followers; i. e., if the followers are unable to track <b>the</b> transformed coordinates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader,</b> there is no feedback mechanism that modifies <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader.</b> Behavioral schemes incorporate "group feedback" via behaviors that depend on <b>the</b> relative coordinates <b>of</b> neighboring robots.
