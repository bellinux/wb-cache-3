5000|$|On 3 May 2013, a Fairchild AFB, WA {{air crew}} flying a McConnell AFB, KS (USAF) KC-135R, 63-8877, crashed about 8 minutes after {{taking off from}} Manas Airbase in Kyrgyzstan, killing three crew members. The {{aircraft}} was at cruise altitude about 200 km west of Bishkek when it lost altitude and crashed in a mountainous area {{near the village of}} Chorgolu, close to the border between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Videotape evidence seems to indicate that the fuselage was in flames as it descended from the clouds overhead, although the tail and some wreckage (left wing, vertical stabilizer, one engine, boom and boom drogue adapter) were not blackened by fire and landed some distance away. This may indicate an inflight explosion or structural failure, possibly related to thunderstorms in the area. [...] Ultimately, the mishap board determined that a rudder system malfunction contributed to development of <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability,</b> known as [...] "Dutch roll." [...] The inexperienced aircrew did not adequately diagnose the problem and, by using rudder to maintain course, contributed to structural failure of the aircraft. Although one of the last -135 aircraft built, this airframe was 48 years and 10 months old {{at the time of its}} loss.|$|E

In this study, the linear stability was studied analytically in order to investigate the viscoelastic effects of saturated liquids on the onset conditions in connection with <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instabilities</b> at the threshold of stationary convection. It is suggested that the resulting <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instabilities</b> occur at lower values of Darcy-Rayleigh number than the critical value for the stationary convection.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the contingency ranking methodology of large interconnected power system for low frequency <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability</b> problems. The <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability</b> leading to blackout is often triggered by contingencies, such as line outage. In literatures, {{so far there}} is no such methodology presented for contingency ranking related to low frequency <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability.</b> Two methodologies, namely, Hopf Bifurcation (HB) and Improved Hopf Bifurcation Indices, are proposed in this paper for contingency ranking. Hopf bifurcation, which describes the onset of an oscillatory problem, is detected by calculating minimum singular value of modified reduced system state or extended system matrices. The normalized minimum singular value or linearized minimum singular value is then used to rank the contingencies. The effectiveness of the methodology is tested and validated on 16 machine 68 bus test system...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an isothermal finite liquid bridge under zero-gravity. A sinusoidal interfacial shear stress drives a nonparallel {{flow in the}} bridge. The linear stability of this flow to three-dimensional disturbances (which may deform the cylindrical gas-liquid interface) is determined numerically by solving an elliptic eigenvalue problem. Previous results on shear stabilization of capillary break-up of axially unbounded cylindrical interfaces containing a parallel flow are hereby extended to a nonparallel flow. The turning flow regions influence the stability significantly. However, for the particular cases considered, a small area in parameter space remains where the capillary instability is suppressed through interfacial shear. Second, non-axisymmetric <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instabilities</b> are found which originate from an interaction of the interface deformation and the basic flow. These instabilities may be the isothermal limit of the <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instabilities</b> observed in float-zone crystal growth...|$|R

30|$|The {{results in}} Sect.  3.1 show that {{transmission}} delays do not destabilize standing wave front. In contrast, nonlocal feedback delays may destabilize standing wave front for certain delays resulting to oscillatory activity. The corresponding analytical {{conditions for a}} single delay hold for feedback connections in class (C), i.e., for local inhibition–lateral excitation interactions. Since such synaptic couplings as well as feedback delays are omnipresent in the brain, oscillatory standing wave front may occur frequently in real neural structures.

40|$|In a {{one-dimensional}} domain, {{the stability}} of localized spike patterns is analyzed for two closely related singularly per-turbed reaction-diffusion (RD) systems with Brusselator kinetics. For the first system, {{where there is no}} influx of the inhibitor on the domain boundary, asymptotic analysis is used to derive a nonlocal eigenvalue problem (NLEP) whose spectrum deter-mines the linear stability of a multi-spike steady-state solution. Similar to previous NLEP stability analyses of spike patterns for other RD systems, such as the Gierer-Meinhardt (GM) and Gray-Scott (GS) models, a multi-spike steady-state solution can become unstable to either a competition or an <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability</b> depending on the parameter regime. An explicit result for the threshold value for the initiation of a competition instability, which triggers the annihilation of spikes in a multi-spike pattern, is derived. Alternatively, in the parameter regime when a Hopf bifurcation occurs, it is shown from a numerical study of the NLEP that an asynchronous, rather than synchronous, <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability</b> of the spike amplitudes can be the dominant instability. The existence of robust asynchronous temporal oscillations of the spike amplitudes has not been predicted from NLEP stability studies of other RD systems. For the second system, where there is an influx of inhibitor from the domain boundaries, an NLEP stability analysis of a quasi-steady-state two-spike pattern reveals the possibility of dynamic bifurcations leading to either a competition or an <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability</b> of the spike amplitudes depending on the parameter regime. It is shown that the novel asynchronous <b>oscillatory</b> <b>instability</b> mode can again be the dominant instability.
