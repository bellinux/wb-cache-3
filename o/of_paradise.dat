5|$|Baker {{was also}} the {{inspiration}} for literary works. In 1913 F. Scott Fitzgerald enrolled at Princeton as a freshman, when Baker was a senior. Though he only spoke to Baker once during their time at Princeton, Fitzgerald idolized him. His first novel, This Side <b>of</b> <b>Paradise,</b> has several references to Baker: the main character is named Amory Blaine after Baker's middle name, and the minor character Allenby is Baker himself. Mark Goodman's 1985 novel Hurrah for the Next Man Who Dies is a fictionalized account of Baker's life.|$|E

In 1921, Princeton named its new hockey arena the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the governing body of college sports in the United States, introduced the Hobey Baker Award in 1980; it is awarded annually to the best collegiate hockey player.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates <b>of</b> <b>Paradise,</b> gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura were to {{have a profound effect on}} younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E

The underside of the dome feature frescoes depicting trees in pairs, pitchers of wine, and platters of fruit, which are an allusion to the Islamic concept <b>of</b> <b>Paradise.</b>|$|E

5|$|Written by P.J. Hammond, {{the story}} was {{commissioned}} as End of Term on 10 February 1986 {{as a replacement for}} Pinacotheca for episodes 9 - 12. It involved the Doctor investigating the resort <b>of</b> <b>Paradise</b> Five, while Mel goes undercover as a hostess. When this script too failed, it was replaced in turn by Pip & Jane Baker's Terror of the Vervoids. It was later adapted as Paradise 5 by Andy Lane for Big Finish as part of their The Lost Stories series in March 2010.|$|E
5|$|Yama, as Lord of Justice, {{is called}} Dharma-raja.

5|$|At {{the time}} of his sudden death in 1940, Scott {{believed}} himself a failure, and Zelda's death in 1948 was little noted. However, interest in the Fitzgeralds surged in the years following their deaths. In 1950, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who knew the couple from his Hollywood years, wrote The Disenchanted, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he awash with alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side <b>of</b> <b>Paradise,</b> a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, then one of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work investigates the use <b>of</b> neat <b>paradise</b> tree {{oil in a}} 4 -stroke natural aspirated direct injection compression ignition engine assisted {{with the help of}} super-heated hydrogen (hydrogen in gaseous state or above its saturation temperature) as a combustion improver. The high calorific gaseous fuel hydrogen gas was used as a combustion improver and admitted into the engine during the suction stroke. A 4 -stroke single cylinder Diesel engine was chosen and its operating parameters were suitably modified. Neat paradise tree oil was admitted through standard injector of the engine and hydrogen was admitted through induction manifold. Inducted super-heated hydrogen was initiated the intermediate compounds combustion <b>of</b> neat <b>paradise</b> tree oil. This process offers higher temperature combustion and results in complete combustion of heavier molecules <b>of</b> neat <b>paradise</b> tree oil within shorter duration. The results of the experiment reveal that 40 % higher NOx, 20 % lower smoke, 5 % lower CO, and 45 % lower HC than that <b>of</b> neat <b>paradise</b> tree oil fuel operation and the admission of superheated hydrogen has improved the combustion characteristics <b>of</b> neat <b>paradise</b> tree oil. The investigation successfully proved that the application <b>of</b> neat <b>paradise</b> tree oil with 15 % of hydrogen improver is possible under a regular Diesel engine with minimal engine modification...|$|R

5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys <b>of</b> <b>Paradise.</b> Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E
5|$|The first {{historical}} {{mention of}} the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, grains <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|E
5|$|When a {{new type}} of film {{allowing}} the photographing of faster moving action was introduced in 1931, Cronjager was one of the cinematographers who participated in the ASC's field testing of the product. In 1932 Cronjager worked with two other well-known cinematographers, Lucien Andriot and Clyde De Vinna, on King Vidor's film, Bird <b>of</b> <b>Paradise.</b> The individual results of the three photographers was very high quality, but the integration of their work, all with very different styles, proved less than desirable to critics. Cronjager worked with Dix again in 1933, on the film The Lost Squadron, which also starred Mary Astor, and was directed by George Archainbaud.|$|E
