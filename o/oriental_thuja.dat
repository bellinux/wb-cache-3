50|$|Platycladus is a {{distinct}} genus of evergreen coniferous tree in the cypress family Cupressaceae, containing only one species, Platycladus orientalis, also known as Chinese thuja, Oriental arborvitae, Chinese arborvitae, biota or <b>oriental</b> <b>thuja.</b> It is native to northwestern China, Korea, and the Russian Far East (Amur + Khabarovsk). It is also now naturalised as an introduced species elsewhere in Asia: eastward to Japan; southward to northern India; and westward to northern Iran.|$|E
50|$|The flora of {{the area}} is {{generally}} composed of middle aged and old forest trees. In the forest section of the nature park, vegetation is found like oriental plane (Platanus orientalis), black pine (Pinus nigra), silver linden (Tilia argentea), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), alder (Alnus glutinosa), blackberry (Rubus) and tree heath (Erica arborea). Plants seen around the coffeehouse and the activity area are <b>oriental</b> <b>thuja</b> (Platycladus orientalis), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), evergreen spindle (Euonymus japonicus), Chinese photinia (Photinia serratifolia), bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), Australian laurel (Pittosporum tobira), goat willow (Salix caprea), butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), wild privet, (Ligustrum vulgare), common lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), purple dead-nettle (Lamium purpureum) and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale).|$|E
40|$|The old {{calendar}} of pollens {{did not reflect}} current pollen distribution and concentrations that can be influenced by changes of weather and environment of each region in South Korea. A new pollen {{calendar of}} allergenic pollens was made based on the data on pollen concentrations obtained in eight regions nationwide between 1997 and 2009. The distribution of pollen was assessed every day at 8 areas (Seoul, Guri, Busan, Daegu, Jeonju, Kwangju, Kangneung, and Jeju) for 12 years between July 1, 1997 and June 30, 2009. Pollens were collected by using Burkard 7 -day sampler (Burkard Manufacturing Co Ltd, UK). Pollens which were stained with Calberla's fuchsin staining solution were identified and counted. Pine became the highest pollen in May, and the pollen concentrations of oak and birch also became high. Ragweed appeared {{in the middle of}} August and showed the highest pollen concentration in the middles of September. Japanese hop showed a high concentration between the middle of August and the end of September, and mugwort appeared in the middles of August and its concentration increased up until early September. In Kangneung, birch appeared earlier, pine showed a higher pollen concentration than in the other areas. In Daegu, <b>Oriental</b> <b>thuja</b> and alder produced a large concentration of pollens. Pine produced a large concentration of pollens between the middle of April and the end of May. Weeds showed higher concentrations in September and mugwort appeared earlier than ragweed. In Busan the time of flowering is relatively early, and alder and <b>Oriental</b> <b>thuja</b> appeared earliest among all areas. In Kwangju, <b>Oriental</b> <b>thuja</b> and hazelnut appeared in early February. Japanese cedar showed the highest pollen concentration in March in Jeju. In conclusion, update information on pollen calendar in South Korea should be provided for allergic patients through the website to manage and prevent the pollinosis...|$|E

40|$|Digitization note: pgs. 62 & 91 {{missing from}} paper copy and not {{available}} for rescanning. Effects of three levels of irrigation frequency; five levels of increasing NaCl (max 8000 ppm) in the irrigation water; and, two different soil types on the growth and survival of Italian Cypress Cupressus sempervirens, <b>Oriental</b> Arborvitae <b>Thuja</b> orientalis, and She-Oak Casuarina equisetifolia tree seedings were studied under greenhouse conditions. There were {{significant differences between the}} species throughout the stress period with regard to the evaluated parameters. Height, diameter growth, and leaf water potential in all species were reduced by increasing water and salt stress throughout the stress period. Reductions in total, shoot and root dry weight by water and salt stress were significant. Higher reductions were associated with higher water or salinity stress level. However, the species differed in their response to the stress treatments. Thuja had the lowest reductions in all measured growth parameters, followed by Casuarina and Cupressus. Water and salt stress treatments affected foliage tissue ion concentrations in all seedlings. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, and Cl decreased as water stress level increased (except for, Na and Cl in Brazito soil). However, Ca, Mg, Na and Cl ion concentrations increased as the salinity level in the irrigation water increased. N and P decreased with increasing salinity and K was selectively accumulated. The seedlings' health declined with increasing stress treatment level. NaCl treatments caused foliar injury, which increased as the concentration of NaCl in the irrigation water increased. Thuja showed the least injury followed by Casuarina. Mortality was limited to Cupressus seedlings on both soil types. More mortality was noted with the increase in irrigation frequency and salinity level of the irrigation water. Thuja and Casuarina seedlings survived to the highest salinity level (8000 ppm NaCl), but with visible injury. Soil types affected all seedlings morphological parameters, total water potential, and foliage ion concentrations, except for P and Ca. All seedlings (except for Casuarina root dry weight) planted in Pima soil maintained higher growth and better overall health condition than on Brazito soil. Also, total water potential reached lower values in all species planted in Brazito soil rather than on Pima soil. Foliage Na and Cl concentrations on Brazito soil exceeded those on Pima soil. Survival of Cupressus seedlings was less on Brazito soil than on Pima soil. Overall, Cupressus growth was reduced the most on Brazito soil as compared with Pima soil. Growth of Casuarina was the least adversely affected on Brazito soil...|$|R
