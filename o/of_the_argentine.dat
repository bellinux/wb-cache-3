5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, their parties, {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country.

The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Argentine</b> Industrial Union. Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full dollarization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Argentine</b> economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a devaluation. Although it was initially expected to make a 40% devaluation, the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar, a 200% devaluation. The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at the cost of a higher cost of living.|$|E
