50|$|In 1819, two priests were <b>officially</b> <b>authorised</b> by the British {{government}} {{to minister to}} the Catholics of the Australian colony.

50|$|Fox-Davies's {{emphasis}} on practical and <b>officially</b> <b>authorised</b> heraldry {{caused him to}} showcase mostly recent grants of arms.

50|$|In 1841, when Tauchnitz {{started his}} English-language editions, {{there were no}} {{copyright}} treaties between England or the United States and Continental countries. Although Tauchnitz's <b>editions</b> were <b>authorised,</b> they were not protected from copyright infringement and he could offer none to the authors he paid. A few years later, various Continental States formed copyright treaties with Britain: Prussia and Saxony in 1846, France in 1852, and successively nearly all European states. In these countries, the Tauchnitz <b>Authorised</b> <b>Edition</b> became the Copyright Edition. Finally, the Berne Convention of 1886 conferred copyright upon authors in its fullest form over {{the greater part of}} the developed world. Tauchnitz editions were the only <b>authorised</b> <b>editions</b> of works by American authors on the Continent of Europe until 1891, when, by the Copyright Treaty with the United States of America, they too became copyright editions.|$|R
60|$|A {{complete}} bibliography {{including all}} the foreign translations and American piracies would make a book of itself {{much larger than the}} present one. In order that Wilde collectors (and there are many, I believe) may know the <b>authorised</b> <b>editions</b> and authentic writings from the spurious, Mr. Stuart Mason, whose work on this edition I have already acknowledged, has supplied a list which contains every genuine and <b>authorised</b> English <b>edition.</b> This of course does not preclude the chance that some of the American <b>editions</b> are <b>authorised,</b> and that some of Wilde's genuine works even are included in the pirated editions.|$|R
50|$|This {{situation}} {{remained unchanged}} in France {{until the late}} 1970s, when the deaf community began to militate for greater recognition of sign language and for a bilingual education system. In 1991 the National Assembly passed the Fabius law, <b>officially</b> <b>authorising</b> the use of LSF {{for the education of}} deaf children. A law was passed in 2005 fully recognising LSF as a language in its own right.|$|R

5000|$|This [...] "informal", on-the-spot type of {{discipline}} was typically not {{recorded in the}} official punishment register, as it was not seen as sufficiently serious to be classified as real corporal punishment. Also, it could be administered by staff who were not <b>officially</b> <b>authorised</b> to administer formal corporal punishment, so {{were not allowed to}} use the cane. In fact, though, it could sometimes be just as painful as the officially recorded punishment.|$|R
50|$|The EUROPEAN International School Ho Chi Minh City {{follows the}} International Baccalaureate (IB) {{curriculum}} {{and is an}} <b>officially</b> <b>authorised</b> IB World School with the Middle Years Programme (MYP) being {{the first of the}} school’s programmes to have been authorised.

50|$|For instance, the 1856 10 kopek stamp from Finland was {{reprinted in}} 1862 {{by the same}} method as the {{original}} (typography) and from the original steel die. In 1892 the Russian Director of Posts and Telegraphs ordered the stamp to be printed again, however, the original die was not available and the stamp was therefore reproduced using lithography, making it a new print. Had the later stamp not been <b>officially</b> <b>authorised</b> it would be classed as a forgery.|$|R

5000|$|According to a 2012 Routledge Studies in Peace and Conflict Resolution publication, [...] "the {{relative}} importance of diversion or misuse of <b>officially</b> <b>authorised</b> transfers, compared to international entirely illegal black market trafficking has been thoroughly confirmed." [...] The authors go on to elaborate that..."For most developing or fragile states, a combination of weak domestic regulation of authorised firearms possession with theft, loss or corrupt sale from official holdings {{tends to be a}} bigger source of weapons concern than illicit trafficking across borders." ...|$|R

50|$|The person <b>officially</b> <b>authorised</b> {{to execute}} either the civil or the {{criminal}} judgment {{of a court}} commits no crime in so doing. This exemption does not extend to {{cases in which the}} court has no jurisdiction. If officials of the court act beyond their jurisdiction, their actions are unlawful, but they may escape liability if they genuinely believe that they are acting lawfully. In S v Madihlaba, it was held that the court-authority exemption will not apply to a situation in which a court had no jurisdiction.|$|R
