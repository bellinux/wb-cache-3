40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} effect of {{lycopene}} on the expression of pain-related molecules in spinal cord <b>of</b> <b>model</b> rats with neuropathic pain. Methods: A total of 30 healthy female SD rats were collected to establish neuropathic pain models according to the literatures, including 10 in sham operation group, 10 in model control group and 10 in model treatment group. Rats were executed to obtain L 2 -L 6 segment of spinal cord, and then serum levels of painrelated indicators as well as gene and protein expression in it were detected. Results: Serum IL- 17, HMGB- 1, Aβ, Tau and C 3 levels of sham operation group were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group and model treatment group while CGRP level was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group and model treatment group, and serum IL- 17, HMGB- 1, Aβ, Tau and C 3 levels <b>of</b> <b>model</b> treatment group were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group while CGRP level was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group; ERK, CREB, BDNF, NMDA, AMPA and c-fos mRNA expression levels of sham operation group were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group and model treatment group, and ERK, CREB, BDNF, NMDA, AMPA and c-fos mRNA expression levels <b>of</b> <b>model</b> treatment group were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group; TRPV 1, NF-kB, NOS, GFAP, ERK and CREB protein expression levels of sham operation group were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group and model treatment group while Reg expression level was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group and model treatment group, and TRPV 1, NF-kB, NOS, GFAP, ERK and CREB protein expression levels <b>of</b> <b>model</b> treatment group were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group while Reg expression level was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>model</b> control group.
