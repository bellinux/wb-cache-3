5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>basketball</b> <b>operations,</b> {{stated in}} the final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season.

He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 2013, Sims {{signed with}} the Boston Celtics.
