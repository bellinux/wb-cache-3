5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several satellite experts questioned the analysis <b>of</b> <b>satellite</b> pings made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours).

The Malaysian government released the satellite data three weeks later.|$|E

Moreover, newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002.

After the 1974 Super Outbreak, Dr. Ted Fujita studied many films of tornadoes from that day. Included in his review was damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes. Fujita concluded that multiple vortices, highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds, are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses. The phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>satellite</b> tornadoes, where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado, can also lead to gaps in damage between the two tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Only four known {{systems were}} {{observed}} during the 1953 season. This was below the average at that time, which was six. Furthermore, {{the season was}} well below the 1949-2006average of 13named storms and had the fewest number of storms in the hurricane database. Only two tropical cyclones reached hurricane status, compared to the modern-day average of seven. Furthermore, 1953 {{is also one of}} the few seasons without a major hurricane. This season was part of a decade-long absence of major hurricanes; from 1950–56, no major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) were reported in the Eastern Pacific basin. However, it is possible that some storms were missed due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>satellite</b> coverage in the region in addition to the lack of Hurricane Hunter data, which did not become available until the following year.|$|E
5|$|Radar {{was also}} {{employed}} {{to determine the}} size of the hurricane's eye, stated to be roughly 13mi (20km) in diameter, following a 6-mile (10km) decrease due to the strengthening. Light wind shear surrounding the hurricane allowed further strengthening to take place. Late on August2, the system attained winds of 135mph (215km/h), making it a Category4 storm. During the afternoon of August3, Guillermo nearly attained Category5 intensity as it reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) along with a barometric pressure estimated at 925mbar (hPa; 27.32inHg). A brief period of weakening took place later that day before further strengthening ensued. Late on August4, Guillermo intensified into a Category5 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h). Operational analysis <b>of</b> <b>satellite</b> information indicated a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg); however, post-storm studies stated that the pressure was more likely around 919mbar (hPa; 27.14inHg).|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Christine {{originated}} from a tropical wave over Africa in late-August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned a tropical depression at 14.0°W, {{over the country}} of Guinea, on August25. The formation of this depression was farther east than any other tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic hurricane basin, although storms may have gone undetected {{prior to the start}} <b>of</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery in the 1960s. This record would not be approached by any other storm until Hurricane Jeanne in 1998, which formed at 17.4°W. This was unlike most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles over water before spawning a depression. Tracking nearly due west, the depression moved over water several hours later and bypassed the Cape Verde Islands on August 27.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{considered}} dissipated, a re-analysis <b>of</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery indicated {{the circulation of}} Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf turned toward the east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf turned toward the north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (115km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the United States Weather Bureau began issuing {{tropical}} cyclone warnings as a collaborative observation network for cities along the U.S. coastline, and {{the season was}} defined between June 15 and November 15.

After Tropical Storm Ana formed in May 2015, former American Meteorological Society president Marshall Shepherd used Twitter to question whether the season should begin earlier.

The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E
