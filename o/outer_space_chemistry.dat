40|$|CISSM Working PaperThe {{beginning}} of the space age was {{seen by many as}} the inauguration of a new era with great potential for the betterment of mankind, as well as an opening for a vast new area for future military uses and conflict. The global public interest in <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> was recognized by the international community with the conclusion of the 1967 <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty, which had been negotiated through the United Nations" Committee on the Peaceful Uses of <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> (COPUOS). The Treaty has been ratified or signed by 125 States. It is widely considered to be the constitution of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> and the foundation of the international legal regime governing all <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities. Some of the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty"s provisions have been further elaborated in four separate agreements. In addition to a few other important law-making treaties, these collectively form the current international regime governing <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> and space activities. The legal principles of current international space law, especially the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty, recognize the inclusive interest of the international community " that is, the global public interest " in <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> by assuring all States the right of free access to <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> without discrimination of any kind. This paper analyses the current international legal regime regulating space activities and the contemporary challenges to the most fundamental principles of space law. It begins by examining the scope and nature of global public interest as primarily established under the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty and as it applies to the exploration and use of <b>outer</b> <b>space...</b>|$|R

However, the Kármán line, at {{an altitude}} of [...] above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was established by the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.|$|R
40|$|Since {{long-term}} {{sustainability of}} <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities {{is an extension}} concept of sustainable development {{in the field of}} <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> law,there are not only some connections but also a few differences between them. According to the juridical status of the principle of sustainable development,the principle of long-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities should be an important principle in the law of outer space,and contains the following aspects:inter-generation fair; within-generation fair; long-term sustainable use,integration between environment and activities in the <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> In the case of the existing outer environment worsening,emphasizing and practicing principle of long-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities has important practical significance. Now the challenges related to the long-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities include the issues of space debris; the increasing decrease in geostationary orbit resources; space pollution. The international community is working on the guidelines of thelong-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activity guidelines which {{plays a key role in}} solving the above problems. More importantly,the principle of long-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities should be put into the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty or developed to be a generally accepted rule of customary international law so that it can play the role of legal norms. 外空活動長期可持續性是可持續發展概念在外空領域的延伸,所以它與可持續發展概念既有聯系也有區別。對比可持續發展原則,外空活動長期可持續性原則應是外空法的一項重要原則,其內涵包括代際公平、代內公平、長期可持續利用和外空環境與外空活動一體化等四個方面。在現有外層環境日益惡化的情形下,強調并踐行外空活動長期可持續性原則具有重要的現實意義。目前,外空活動長期可持續性所面臨的問題包括空間碎片問題、地球靜止軌道問題和空間環境污染問題。國際社會正在制定《外空活動長期可持續性準則》,這對解決上述問題發揮很大的作用,但更為重要的是把這一原則規定到《外空條約》中來,或有意推動使其成為一項公認的國際習慣法規則,使其發揮法律規范的作用...|$|R
40|$|Principle of {{the peace}} full uses of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> {{is one of the}} basic {{principle}} of international law. It is currently the only legal obstacle for placement and use of the weapons in <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> Today the international community is faced with the shift from the currently passive use of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> to active military use of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> of a destructive nature. Therefore, the principle of peaceful uses of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> should be examined from the standpoint of contemporary international law. Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of <b>Outer</b> <b>Space,</b> including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies is considered to be the most significant instrument which establish the principle of peaceful uses of <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> Beside this Treaty, there are other significant multilateral and bilateral instruments which supplement and develop the principle of peaceful uses in various ways. In this paper, the historical development of the principle {{of the peace}}ful uses of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> will be introduced, and various multilateral and bilateral treaties from this area will be examined. Since the <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> law is the part of the international law, application of the UN Charter should also be examined. Finally, current state of the development of the principle of peaceful uses of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> and future courses of the principle will be considered...|$|R
40|$|LLM (Environmental Law and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Since {{the start}} of the space race in the 1950 ‟s the <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> {{environment}} has significantly changed due to human expansion and the subsequent by-products known as <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> pollution/debris. As <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> rapidly evolved from a military high-ground into a commercialised asset exploited by private and state owned enterprises, the treaties negotiated in the 1960 ‟s and 1970 ‟s quickly became out-dated. As a result <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> especially the orbits around the Earth are occupied by countless masses of non-functional manmade objects, some expected to remain for millions of years. This dissertation argues that the current national and international legal framework will be inadequate {{to address the problem of}} <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> pollution and that legal and political action will be necessary on a global scale. With the planned developments as set out in the National Space Policy, South Africa is set on becoming a leading provider of <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> services on the African continent and will, as a consequence, have a progressively bigger impact on the <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> environment. With a growing dependence on <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> technologies, developed and developing economies around the world cannot ignore the immense negative consequences that <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> debris could pose to their development. This study will thus, by examining the international and national legal framework regarding <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> pollution, provide legal recommendations pertaining to the principles and obligations that the South African legal framework will have to make provision for, in order to minimise the negative effect on the <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> environment.

5000|$|After {{ten years}} of {{negotiations}} between nearly 100 nations, the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty opened for signature on January 27, 1966. It entered into force as the constitution for <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> on October 10, 1967. The <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty was well received; it was ratified by ninety-six nations and signed by an additional twenty-seven states. The outcome {{has been that the}} basic foundation of international space law consists of five (arguably four) international space treaties, along with various written resolutions and declarations. The main international treaty is the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty of 1967; it is generally viewed as the “Constitution" [...] for <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> By ratifying the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty of 1967, ninety-eight nations agreed that <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> would belong to the “province of mankind”, that all nations would have the freedom to “use” and “explore” <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> and that both these provisions must be done in a way to “benefit all mankind.” The province of mankind principle and the other key terms have not yet been specifically defined (Jasentuliyana, 1992). Critics have complained that the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty is vague. Yet, international space law has worked well and has served space commercial industries and interests for many decades. The taking away and extraction of Moon rocks, for example, has been treated as being legally permissible.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{was written}} to {{identify}} strategies for discouraging or containing warfare {{in the region}} of <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> Accepting that the notion of warfare in <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> appears melodramatic, and noting previous research has been focused on the 20 th century, Chapter 1 considers warfare across more than 12 millennia, identifying long-term trends and illustrating the manner in which those trends migrated into activities affecting the <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> region. Chapters 2 and 3 examine technological and related prerequisites for weapons to function in <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> review the implications of launching radioactive payloads into Earth-centric orbits, disclose capacities to attack spacecraft using nuclear or kinetic weapons, and evaluate the destructive potential of directed energy weapons and other spacecraft-disabling technologies. Evolving defences available to spacecraft are identified. Chapter 4 examines the international law of warfare, particularly as it applies to <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> revealing numerous inadequacies. The potential for the Antarctic region to serve as a template for a zone of peace is considered. Chapter 5 proposes a framework for analysing the motivations of nation States in conducting their external affairs. Formative influences and constraints leading to <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> policies adopted by spacefaring States are revealed. Chapter 6 identifies prominent strategies adopted by powerful spacefaring States with significant influence over the <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> region, then considers options open to other spacefaring and non-spacefaring States to either reduce the potential for warfare in <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> or, if warfare occurs in that region, to minimise its terrestrial consequences. Strategies and tactics with potential global appeal, aimed at promoting security in <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> are also identified. International law does not recognise the location of a boundary separating <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> from the dense terrestrial atmosphere. The thesis therefore includes argument leading to a scientifically and legally supportable boundary concept, proposing <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> begin at a linear altitude of 80 km above the datum Earth Gravitational Model 2008.

Although the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty expressly precludes the ‘sovereign appropriation’ of the Moon and Other Celestial bodies, it remains unclear till today whether these exclusions extend to private ‘non-governmental’ entities. More importantly, the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty fails to establish any positive property rights regime on the use of extra-celestial land or minerals in <b>Outer</b> <b>Space.</b> As the existing property rights regime on the Moon and other celestial bodies remains clouded by great uncertainty and ambiguity, there is an urgent need for reform.

40|$|The {{monopoly}} on human spaceflight {{has been held}} {{by a handful of}} governments and their space programs for over the last fifty years. With the successful launch of Scaled Composite’s SpaceShipOne, corporations may soon be {{able to take advantage of}} new launch vehicle technologies and end governmental monopoly of human spaceflight. Private human spaceflight will enable corporations to expand their reach beyond Earth, entering a new economic era with as much uncertainty as ever in the expanding commercial frontier of <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> However, legal challenges will present the major obstacle to corporations operating in <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>space</b> is a high risk environment and given the dangerousness of such economic activity corporations will not be allowed to operate without some rules or regulation. Moreover, without the ability to profit, corporations will lose their incentive to engage in <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> commerce. Therefore, <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> law must balance corporate and public interests to ensure safety, equity and market efficiency. In turn, the shape of future civilization in <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> will depend on how national and international law develops over time in response to the pressures of corporate expansion. This paper thus seeks to perform two tasks: first, to critically review the major legal challenges facing corporate expansion into <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> particularly United States and international space law; and second, provide an evaluation of “laissez-faire ” proposals for human expansion into <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> and their impact on future space society.

50|$|Varying {{degrees of}} {{criticism}} exist regarding international space law. Some critics accept the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty, but reject the Moon Agreement. Therefore, {{it is important}} to note that even the Moon Agreement with its common heritage of mankind clause, allows space mining, extraction, private property rights and exclusive ownership rights over natural <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> resources, if removed from their natural place. The <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty and the Moon Agreement allow private property rights for <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> natural resources once removed from the surface, subsurface or subsoil of the moon and other celestial bodies in <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> Thus, international space law is capable of managing newly emerging space mining activities, private space transportation, commercial spaceports and commercial space stations/habitats/settlements. Space mining involving the extraction and removal of natural resources from their natural location is without question allowable under the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty and the Moon Agreement. Once removed, those natural resources can be reduced to possession, sold, traded and explored or used for scientific purposes. International space law allows space mining, specifically the extraction of natural resources. It is generally understood within the space law authorities that extracting space resources is allowable, even by private companies for profit. However, international space law prohibits property rights over territories and <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> land.|$|R
