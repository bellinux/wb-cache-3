5|$|After {{the loss}} of these two railway {{executive}} positions, Beauregard spent time briefly {{at a variety of}} companies and civil engineering pursuits, but his personal wealth became assured when he was recruited as a supervisor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Louisiana</b> Lottery in 1877.

5|$|At {{the time}} Devers took command, the Armored Force had two {{operational}} armored divisions: the 1st Armored Division at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Knox, and one independent tank battalion, the 70th Tank Battalion at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Both divisions {{participated in the}} large-scale war games <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Louisiana</b> Maneuvers in August and September 1941, and the Carolina Maneuvers in November 1941. Despite some successes, the maneuvers revealed armored unit and equipment operational deficiencies, plus {{a general lack of}} combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor performance to poorly-trained junior and staff officers, but also saw doctrinal deficiencies that hampered the coordination of tanks, infantry and artillery.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1850s, St. Louis hosted annual {{agricultural}} and mechanical fairs at Fairground Park {{to connect with}} regional manufacturers and growers. By the 1880s, the connection to agriculture had declined, and in 1883, a new St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall was built to house industrial exhibits. In 1890, St. Louis attempted to host the World's Columbian Exposition, but the project was awarded to Chicago, which hosted the exposition in 1893. In 1899, delegates from states that had been part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Louisiana</b> Purchase met in St. Louis, selecting it {{as the site of}} a world's fair celebrating the centennial of the purchase in 1904.|$|E

5|$|François-René de Chateaubriand {{depicted}} the massacre in his 1827 epic Les Natchez, incorporating his earlier best-selling novellas Atala and René into a longer narrative that greatly embellished {{the history of}} the French and the Natchez in Louisiana.

Chateaubriand saw the Natchez Massacre as the defining moment in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Louisiana</b> colony, a position consistent with the views of other 18th-century historians, such as Le Page du Pratz and Dumont de Montigny.|$|E
5|$|His {{influence}} over Confederate strategy was lessened by his poor professional relationships with President Jefferson Davis and other senior generals and officials. In April 1865, Beauregard and his commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, convinced Davis {{and the remaining}} cabinet members that the war needed to end. Johnston surrendered {{most of the remaining}} armies of the Confederacy, including Beauregard and his men, to Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Following his military career, Beauregard returned to Louisiana, where he served as a railroad executive, and became wealthy as a promoter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Louisiana</b> Lottery.|$|E
