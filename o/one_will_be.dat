Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but Paul says that no <b>one</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe.

This indicates that the default state of the X chromosome in females is inactivation, but one X chromosome is always selected to remain active.|$|E
