Rosecroft could not fill up a 12-race card for its opening night during the 1996 season. An estimated $80 million in wagering was lost in 1996 from the effect of Delaware's casinos.

25|$|The {{selection}} of the <b>OR</b> <b>table</b> depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables.

For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used.|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{relational}} learning (SRL) algorithms learn {{statistical models}} from relational data, {{such as that}} stored in a relational database. Last year saw the definition of view learning for SRL, in which the view of a relational database can be automatically modified, yielding more accurate statistical models. The present paper advances beyond the initial view learning approach in two ways. First, it learns views that introduce new relational tables, rather than merely new fields for an existing table of the database. Second, new <b>tables</b> <b>or</b> new fields {{are not limited to}} being approximations to some target concept; instead, the new approach performs a type of predicate invention. The new approach avoids the classical problem with predicate invention, of learning many useless predicates, by keeping only new fields <b>or</b> <b>tables</b> (i. e., new predicates) that immediately improve the performance of the statistical model. Retained fields <b>or</b> <b>tables</b> can then be used in the definitions of further new fields <b>or</b> <b>tables...</b>|$|R

25|$|Some {{surgeons}} do {{not only}} verify {{the placement of}} complex endografts intraoperatively, they also use their angiography system and the applications it offers for planning the procedure. As anatomy changes between a preoperative CT and intraoperative fluoroscopy because of patient positioning and the insertion of stiff material, a much more precise planning is possible if the surgeon performs an intraoperative rotational angiography, takes an automatic segmentation of the aorta, places markers for the renal arteries and other landmarks in 3D and then overlays the contours on 2D fluoroscopy. This guidance is updated with any change in C-Arm angulation/position <b>or</b> <b>table</b> position.|$|E

25|$|There are, however, {{objective}} {{factors that}} prevent the illusion from succeeding completely: (1) the canvas is two-dimensional while reality is three-dimensional, (2) {{the uniqueness of}} the view-point (humans have two eyes). Metzinger compensates for the missing spatiality in his two-dimensional representation by giving other cues for depth, in addition to relative size: shading and shadows, source of light, occlusion (e.g., the stage <b>or</b> <b>table</b> upon which the woman dances cuts 'in front' of the woman sitting at the table). Metzinger represents a subjective effect objectively on the canvas, imitating subjective phenomena (of vision) objectively. Henri Poincaré, in Science and Hypothesis, 1902, discusses 'representative' space (visual, tactile and motor space) versus 'geometrical' space.|$|E
25|$|In general, two {{different}} light sources {{are needed in}} an operating room: the surgical (operating) lights used for open procedures and the ambient lighting for interventional procedures. Particular attention should {{be paid to the}} possibility to dim the lights. This is frequently needed during fluoroscopy or endoscopy. For the surgical lights it is most important that they cover the complete area across the operating room table. Moreover, they must not interfere with head heights and collision paths of other equipment. The most frequent mounting position of OR-lights is centrally above the <b>OR</b> <b>table.</b> If a different position is chosen, the lights usually are swivelled in from an area outside the <b>OR</b> <b>table.</b> Because one central axis per light head is necessary, this may lead to at least two central axes and mounting points in order to ensure sufficient illumination of the surgical field. The movement range of the angiography system determines the positioning of the OR lights. Central axes must be outside of moving path and swivel range. This is especially important as devices have defined room height requirements that must be met. In this case, head clearance height for the OR-light may be an issue. This makes lights a critical item in the planning and design process. Other aspects in the planning process of OR lights include avoidance of glare and reflections. Modern OR lights may have additional features, like build in camera and video capabilities. For the illumination of the wound area, a double-arm OR-light system is required. Sometimes even a third light may be required, in cases where more than one surgical activity takes place at the same time, e.g. vein stripping of the legs.|$|E

In Ashkenazi synagogues, the Torah was read on a reader's table located in the center of the room, while the leader of the prayer service, the hazzan, stood at his own lectern <b>or</b> <b>table,</b> facing the Ark. In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite side of the room from the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table.|$|E
