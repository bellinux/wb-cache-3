5|$|Fey's corporation, Feyline Productions, {{coordinated with}} his {{production}} company, TTS, {{to manage the}} videotaping. Director Gavin Taylor and producer Malcolm Gerrie were selected as director and production associate, respectively. It was Taylor's {{first visit to the}} United States, {{and it was the first}} time he filmed a major outdoor rock concert. Local producers Rick Wurpel and Doug Stewart were also on the staff. Taylor's and McGuinness' original plans were to feature the video <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tube,</b> but trade unions objected to their limited representation on the concert crew. However, a compromise was reached, allowing 15 minutes of the concert to be broadcast <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tube.</b>|$|E
5|$|The spores are oval to {{ellipsoid}} in shape, smooth, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 7–11 by 3.5–5μm. The basidia are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 15–24 by 6–7.5μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> faces) are irregularly club-shaped, with dimensions of 20–36 by 7–10μm, while cheilocystidia (found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> edge) are club-shaped, rare, occur singly, and measure 18–32 by 7–9μm. Although rare, {{there are also}} caulocystidia (occurring on the stem) that are arranged in groups, and which measure individually 24–30 by 6–9μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of T.alboater.|$|E

5|$|The {{color of}} the spore print is pale yellow. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have {{dimensions}} of 8–10 by 5–6µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped, two- to four-spored, and measure 24–30 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the inner walls of the tubes) are light yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm.

5|$|The {{original}} DR {{station was}} rebuilt {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, initially as a single-storey structure. An office building was built above it later.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of the orientations and positions of tubular fullerene molecules (C 90, [...] ., C 200) encapsulated in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), a series of so-called fullerene nanopeapods. We find that increasing <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> radius leads to the following succession of energetically stable regimes: (1) lying molecules positioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube's</b> long axis; (2) tilted molecules <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube's</b> long axis; and (3)  lying molecules shifted away from <b>the</b> <b>tube's</b> long axis. As opposed to C 70 and C 80 molecules encapsulated in a SWCNT, standing orientations do not develop. Our results are relevant for the possible application of molecular-orientation-dependent electronic properties of fullerene nanopeapods, and also for the interpretation of future experiments on double-walled carbon nanotube formation by annealing fullerene peapod systems.

5|$|The {{spore print}} has been {{reported}} as ranging in color from pinkish, to pinkish-brown, to rosy brown, to vinaceous-fawn. The variation in spore print color results in part from differences in moisture content when recorded. Spores are roughly oblong to oval, smooth, hyaline (translucent) to pale brown, and measure 11–17 by 4–5.5µm. They are covered in a gelatinous sheath. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, two- and four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 25–35 by 10–14µm. Pleurocystidia (found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> walls) are roughly cylindrical to fuse-shaped with rounded tips, and measure 37–50 by 5–8µm. Cheilocystidia (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> edges) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and measure 23–40 by 6–8µm. Caulocystidia {{at the top of}} the stipe have various shapes and dimensions of 25–45 by 10–15µm; at the stipe base, the caulocystidia are 30–40 by 7–23µm and are mostly club-shaped to roughly spherical to tear-shaped. The cap cuticle comprises a single layer of tangled hyphae that are 4–6µm thick.|$|E
5|$|Another very {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tube</b> even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can be driven {{up and down the}} branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1890s {{the station}} {{entrance}} had {{been incorporated into}} a larger building. In 1922, a new entrance and canopy was designed for the Bridge Street entrance by Charles Holden and, in 1924, he designed a plainly rendered replacement elevation for the eastern entrance on to the Embankment. These were {{the first of many}} projects by the architect for the London Electric Railway (the main forerunner of London Transport and Transport for London). The station platforms were also refurbished with new wall tiling in the green, blue, black and white tiling scheme used later by Holden on many stations of the period and still visible at neighbouring St James's Park station. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> map as the Circle line.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} three ticket halls: {{one for the}} Circle and District lines above the {{platforms}} of the sub-surface station, one below ground for the Bakerloo line station and one under the mainline station. The sub-surface station and the deep-level station ticket halls are linked via the ticket hall under the mainline station, but not to each other directly. Entrances are on Praed Street and from within the mainline station. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> map the station is shown jointly with the other separate Underground station and passenger usage data for both is combined. Interchange with the other station is through the mainline station concourse without extra charge if the change is made within the permitted time.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in the campaign, {{transport}} {{remained a}} major issue. David Cameron's deferral in December 2015 {{of a decision}} on plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport {{until after the election}} was interpreted as an attempt to avoid a clash with Goldsmith, his party's candidate, on the issue. Caroline Pidgeon and Siân Berry both promised changes to the fares system to reduce commuter costs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tube,</b> while Khan and incumbent Conservative mayor Boris Johnson clashed over planned Tube strikes. An early January 2016 poll gave Khan a 10-point lead over Goldsmith, with bookmakers and pundits all favouring a Khan victory, though most agreed that the race was still open. Towards the end of January, provisional English Democrats candidate Winston McKenzie appeared on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother, quickly being voted off and causing over 400 complaints to Ofcom following his negative comments about homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help confirm the identify of the mushroom: a drop of dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution will turn <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> pale red whereas nitric acid (HNO3) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> produces orange-yellow; a solution of Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) applied to the flesh results in a pale grey color.|$|R
50|$|Aerodynamic drag is a {{significant}} factor in both road and track racing. Frames are often constructed of moulded carbon fiber, for a lightweight design. More recently, track (and road) bikes have employed airfoil designs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> of <b>the</b> frame to reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|R
40|$|In this {{preliminary}} effort, {{we use a}} commercially available and chemically modified tube to selectively capture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the blood stream by immobilizing human anti-EpCAM antibodies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube's</b> interior surface. We describe the requisite and critical steps required to modify a tube into a cancer cell-capturing device. Using these sim-ple modifications, {{we were able to}} capture or entrap about 85 % of cancer cells from suspen-sion and 44 % of cancer cells from spiked whole blood. We also found that the percentage of cells captured was dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube's</b> length and also the number of cancer cells pres-ent. It is our strong belief that with the utilization of appropriate tube lengths and procedures, we can ensure capture and removal of nearly the entire CTC population in whole blood. Importantly after a patient’s entire blood volume has circulated through <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> can then be trypsinized to release the captured live CTCs for further analysis and testing...|$|R
5|$|In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route {{was given}} its own {{identity}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> map as the Circle line. In June 1957, the reversing bay track {{was taken out}} of use and the track bed was later filled to connect the two island platforms. The eastbound MR platform (Number 1) and westbound DR platform (Number 4) were taken out of use in January 1966 and March 1969 respectively. The tracks for these platforms were also removed and platform 4 was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s to allow escalators to be provided to the Piccadilly line. The widened island platform is now served by the District and Circle lines in both directions. Following the closure of platforms 1 and 4, platform 3 was renumbered as 1. The current arrangement has trains running in opposite directions to the original layout. During service disruption or engineering works, trains can also run Eastbound from Platform 1. The arcaded station entrance and shops, the brick retaining walls to the sub-surface platforms and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed structures.|$|E
5|$|Stevie {{is one of}} four {{characters}} who has an official profile on social networking site Twitter, where it is revealed that the character is living in Albert Square before the series starts, staying with her boyfriend Olly. Further posts show that he went out on their anniversary and she hoped to make the relationship work but he hinted that he would end it. Stevie also appears in additional video content on the official E20 website. In the first video, she performs a rap about Olly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> after leaving the party in episode 2. In another, Stevie and Naz have a picnic in the park, and Naz makes a video of Stevie, hoping to make Olly jealous, but Stevie ends up with cake on her face. The four friends play a drinking game in the café in another video, and another scene features Stevie and Naz talking about kissing.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive-brown. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped in face view, and inequilateral in profile view. They have a smooth surface, a tiny apical pore, and dimensions of 11–15 by 4–5.5μm, with walls about 0.2μm thick. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 8–12μm thick. Pleurocystidia (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> walls) are 28–42 by 6–11μm with a 3–μm neck, whereas the cheilocystidia (on the pore edges) are narrowly club-shaped and slightly smaller, measuring 26–38 by 4–8μm. Pleurocystidia tend to not protrude further than sporulating basidia. The cap cuticle comprises a 150μm-thick layer of narrow hyphae measuring 3–5μm {{more or less}} arranged in a trichodermium (wherein the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface). These hyphae stain red when mounted in Melzer's reagent and yellow in potassium hydroxide. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
