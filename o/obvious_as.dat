5|$|Lemurs are unusual {{since they}} have great {{variability}} in their social structure, yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and canine tooth morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of true lemur (genus Eulemur), the gray-headed lemur (E. albocollaris) and the red lemur (E. rufus), exhibit size differences in canine teeth. True lemurs show sexual dichromatism (sexual differences in fur coloration), but {{the difference between the}} genders varies from strikingly <b>obvious,</b> <b>as</b> in the blue-eyed black lemur (E. macaco), to nearly imperceptible {{in the case of the}} common brown lemur (E. fulvus).|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|The era of Abba-El I's successors {{is poorly}} documented, {{and by the}} time of Yarim-Lim III in the mid-17th century BC, the power of Yamhad {{declined}} due to internal dissent. Yarim-Lim III ruled a weakened kingdom, and although he imposed Yamhadite hegemony over Qatna, the weakening was <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> Alalakh had become all but independent under the self-declared king Ammitakum. In spite of this regression, the king of Yamhad remained the strongest king of the Syrian states, as he was referred to as a Great King by the Hittites, the diplomatic equal of the Hittite king.|$|E

5|$|The {{second season}} further {{developed}} into {{the plot of}} the fear of company downsizing, along with the introduction of new characters and developing some of the minor ones‚Äîespecially that of Dwight. As Michael starts a relationship with his boss Jan Levenson (Melora Hardin), Pam and Jim‚Äôs relationship become one of the focal points of the season. Their compatibility becomes more <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> Jim‚Äôs feelings for Pam continue to grow, while she struggles with her relationship with the warehouse worker Roy Anderson (David Denman).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{accounts}} of the Irish annals, English and Scandinavian writers appear to see Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray: this is clear from their descriptions of the meeting with Cnut in 1027, before the death of Malcolm mac M√°il Brigti. Malcolm was followed as king or earl by his brother Gillecomgan, husband of Gruoch, a granddaughter of King Kenneth III. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad {{was responsible for the}} killing of Gille Coemg√°in in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had a cause for feud in the killing of his father in 1020, Malcolm too had reason to see Gille Coemg√°in dead. Not only had Gillecomgan's ancestors killed many of Malcolm's kin, but Gillecomgan and his son Lulach might be rivals for the throne. Malcolm had no living sons, and the threat to his plans for the succession was <b>obvious.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the following year Gruoch's brother or nephew, who might have eventually become king, was killed by Malcolm.|$|E
25|$|In biology {{organs are}} defined as {{confined}} functional units within an organism.

25|$|The {{unit cell}} of a ccp {{arrangement}} of atoms is the face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cell. This is not immediately <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> the closely packed layers are {{parallel to the}} {111} planes of the fcc unit cell.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of jungle {{also resulted in}} the {{appearance of}} the junglist subculture, which, while not nearly as distinctive, alienated, ideological or <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> other youth subcultures, and having many similarities with hip hop styles and behaviour, does function distinctively within the drum and bass listening community. Many drum and bass listeners would and do refer to themselves as junglists, regardless of their attitude on whether jungle differs from drum and bass (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{injury to}} Simon Jones became {{somewhat}} <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> the pacers struggled {{to capture the}} magic that Jones had created the previous day that had forced Australia to follow on. Despite this, the Australian run rate remained low as both sides stared each other down. Mistakes by Geraint Jones and Kevin Pietersen were quickly nullified by the dismissal of Warne for45 and Kasprowicz for19, {{and after a few}} overs' resistance Tait was bowled middle stump for4, leaving 129 for the English to chase after tea.|$|E

25|$|In the Atari 8bit {{version of}} Ultima IV {{one of the}} floppy disks had an {{unformatted}} track. In its absence the player would lose on every fight, which would not be <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> a copy protection effect right away as one could assume {{that this was just}} due to either lack of experience or proper equipment. The protection mechanism was subtle enough to be overlooked by the German distributor which originally delivered Atari 8bit packages with floppies that were formatted regularly, and thus these paid copies acted like unlicensed copies, causing players to lose every battle.|$|E
25|$|The Journal of the United States Artillery {{was founded}} at Fort Monroe in 1892 by First Lieutenant (later General) John Wilson Ruckman {{and four other}} {{officers}} of the Artillery School. Ruckman served as {{the editor of the}} Journal for four years (July 1892 to January 1896) and published several articles therein afterward. One publication by West Point notes Ruckman's ‚Äúguidance‚Äù and ‚Äúfirst-rate quality‚Äù work were <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> the Journal ‚Äúrose to high rank among the service papers of the world‚Äù. The Journal was renamed the Coast Artillery Journal in 1922 and the Antiaircraft Journal in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Caste {{can only}} be {{determined}} by ovary examination and insemination data. Queen wasps were determined {{by the amount of}} sperm they had in their spermatheca (inseminated or not). Intermediate females were defined as females with some ovarian development, and workers have no ovarian development. Intermediate is not considered its own caste, though. Many females had fully developed ovaries but were not inseminated. There seemed to be little difference between these females and queens other than insemination. However, when non-inseminated females were more common, inseminated females had more developed oocytes. In some colonies, queens were slightly bigger than workers in several characteristics, but in others they were smaller. In most of the colonies, intermediates did not differ in size from queens and were usually a bit larger than workers. Caste differences seem to be more <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> the colony ages. The differences in P. fraternus castes vary according to colony cycle. In a pre-emergence colony and one of the two worker-producing colonies, queens were larger in body size than workers, while smaller in one of the two male-producing colonies. Females can potentially become either queens (reproductives) or workers (non-reproductives) according to intracolony and environmental factors.|$|E

25|$|N-alkanes {{are also}} known to {{preserve}} detailed information of source material. Li et al. studied oils from the marine-derived Upper Cretaceous Second White Speckled Shale and found strong depleted signal around -180‚Ä∞ in C12-C18. The low Œ¥D of this marine samples was {{explained by the}} discharge of a large high latitude river. Schimmelmann et al. found that the Œ¥D of the oil sampled from coaly facies of the Crayfish group reaches down to -230‚Ä∞ where as those sampled from algal facies of the same group are around -100‚Ä∞. Such huge variation is hard to be explained by any other causes than Australia splitting from the Antarctic continent during late Cretaceous. Another special case reported by xiong et al. studied Ordovician carbonates from Bohai Bay Basin. They found big differences between Œ¥D of n-alkanes exists, reflecting that the original signal is preserved rather than being homogenized. The result is not <b>obvious</b> <b>as</b> the sample is very mature(inferred vitrinite reflectance R0 up to 2.3). Thus this is a strong evidence that carbonate systems have much lower catalytic efficiency of hydrogen exchange on hydrocarbons. Strong enrichment(~40‚Ä∞) in odd carbon numbered alkanes to even carbon numbered alkanes {{is also found in}} some subset of samples and the reason is unclear at this point. This odd-even effect is also observed in immature clastic sediments.|$|E
