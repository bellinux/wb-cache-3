5|$|By 1972 the United States and the Soviet Union {{were focused}} on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant their {{military}} situation in regards to Israel would remain at a disadvantage. Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused on taking decisive military action. A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make the solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> conflict a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E

5|$|In China, {{nationalist}} and communist forces resumed {{the civil}} war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E

5|$|Jennings was {{determined}} to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the intricacies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict, including {{the rise of the}} Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{point to}} European influence, {{including}} that of the Nazis (see below), {{and the establishment of}} Israel as the root causes for antisemitism. Norman Stillman explains that increased European commercial, missionary and imperialist activities during the 19th and 20th centuries brought antisemitic ideas to the Muslim world. Initially these prejudices only found a reception among Arab Christians and were too foreign for any widespread acceptance among Muslims. However, with the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict, European antisemitism began to gain acceptance in modern literature.|$|E
25|$|While {{there were}} antisemitic {{incidents}} before the twentieth century, antisemitism increased dramatically {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Palestinian exodus, {{the creation of the}} state of Israel, and Israeli victories during the wars of 1956 and 1967 were a severe humiliation to Israel's opponents—primarily Egypt, Syria and Iraq. However, by the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews had left Arab and Muslim countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States. The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} the dual claims of both Judaism and Islam, {{it is one of}} the most contested {{religious}} sites in the world. Since the Crusades, the Muslim community of Jerusalem has managed the site as a Waqf, without interruption. As the site is part of the Old City, controlled by Israel since 1967, both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim sovereignty over it, and it remains a major focal point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict. In an attempt to keep the status quo, the Israeli government enforces a controversial ban on prayer by non-Muslims.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, Saudi Arabia {{has changed}} its {{viewpoint}} concerning {{the validity of}} negotiating with Israel. It calls for Israel's withdrawal from territory occupied in June 1967 in order for peace with the Arab states; then-Crown Prince Abdullah extended a multilateral peace proposal based on withdrawal in 2002. At that time, Israel {{did not respond to}} the offer. In 2007 Saudi Arabia again officially supported a resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> conflict which supported a full right of Palestinian refugees to move to Israel, which generated more official negative reactions from Israeli authorities.|$|E
25|$|The {{tensions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict {{were also}} {{a factor in the}} rise of animosity to Jews all over the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled as refugees, the main waves being soon after the 1948 and 1956 wars. In reaction to the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of Jewish communities of Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today.|$|E
