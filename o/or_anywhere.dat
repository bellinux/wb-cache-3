5|$|Although {{the current}} owner Charles Spencer professes to have never {{witnessed}} a ghost at Althorp <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> else, {{over the years}} numerous ghostly sightings {{have been reported in}} the mansion. In the mid 19th century the Dean of Lincoln was invited to stay at the property by Fredrick, 4th Earl Spencer. He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be the ghost of the deceased servant of the 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles and checking that they were snuffed out around the bed. Margaret Douglas-Home professed to being aware of a ghost of a girl with grey slippers in the gallery.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, Polotsk {{resident}} Francysk Skaryna {{translated the}} Bible into Belarusian. It {{was published in}} Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature {{began in the late}} 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk.|$|E
5|$|On August29, an area {{of weather}} {{developed}} directly into a tropical storm, skipping the tropical depression stage. Katrina steadily intensified as it headed west-northwest, gradually turning to the northwest. It peaked in intensity on September3 as a Category4 hurricane with winds of , the second highest of the season. Katrina then headed westward and rapidly weakened. It was downgraded into a tropical storm on September5 and a depression on September6. The last advisory was issued on September7 when Katrina dissipated. Although the hurricane brought Category3-equivalent winds to Socorro Island on September2, no damage was reported there <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> else.|$|E

5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E
5|$|In early 1965, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon {{wrote to}} President Lyndon Johnson, {{opposing}} the dollar and {{pointing out that}} the coins would be unlikely to circulate in Montana <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, the coins would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator that things would be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams hoped to avoid striking the silver dollars, but wanted to keep the $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} {{argue that the}} United Nations has condoned antisemitism.

25|$|The {{earliest}} Résistance organisations had {{no contact}} with the western Allies, and received no material aid from London <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> else. Consequently, most focused on generating nationalist propaganda through the distribution of underground newspapers. Many of the major movements, such as Défense de la France, were centred around their newspapers. Even after they became more intensively activist, propaganda and the cultivation of positive morale remained, {{until the very end}} of the war, their most important concerns.|$|E
60|$|It must {{be owned}} that Mr. Warrington {{continued}} to be witty the next morning. He sent a note to Mr. Will begging to know whether he was for a ride to town <b>or</b> <b>anywheres</b> else. If he was for London, that he would friten the highwaymen on Hounslow Heath, and look a very genteel figar at the Chocolate House. Which letter, I fear, Mr. Will received with his usual violence, requesting the writer to go to some place--not Hounslow.|$|R

25|$|As far as Lange is concerned, he was {{the biggest}} murderer I have ever known. To {{write a book about}} him would {{definitely}} not be enough. As he is dead, it is no use talking about him. I would, however, mention {{that he was one of}} the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> else.|$|E
25|$|The game {{incorporates}} a player-controlled camera {{system that can}} be rotated and zoomed at will; this allows the player to view the world from above, from the ground, <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> in between. Combat units (both ground units and aircraft) have inertia incorporated into their physics programming, although it lacks polygon-level collision detection for every object. The player can make their units to move anywhere in the map, given that Fire and Darkness is not designed using a grid-like system like other contemporary games such as Warcraft II.|$|E
25|$|Several years later, he parted {{ways with}} the Delaware General Assembly which had passed a {{resolution}} asking Delaware's congressmen to vote against any extension of slavery. Horsey did not feel U.S. Congress {{had the right to}} prohibit slavery in Missouri, <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> else in the Louisiana Purchase, and so supported the Missouri Compromise. Understanding the unpopularity of this position he did not seek reelection when his term ended. During the 16th Congress, he served as Chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia.|$|E

There is no direct {{passenger}} service {{along the entire}} original Trans-Manchurian route (i.e., from Moscow <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> in Russia, west of Manchuria, to Vladivostok via Harbin), due to the obvious administrative and technical (gauge break) inconveniences of crossing the border twice. However, assuming sufficient patience and possession of appropriate visas, {{it is still possible}} to travel all the way along the original route, with a few stopovers (e.g. in Harbin, Grodekovo and Ussuriysk).|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} test of West's {{political}} outlook was the Bolshevik Revolution. Many {{on the left}} saw it {{as the beginning of}} a new, better world, {{and the end of the}} crimes of capitalism. West regarded herself as a member of the left, having attending Fabian socialist summer schools as a girl. But to West, both the Revolution and the revolutionaries were suspect. Even before the Bolsheviks took power in October 1917, West expressed her doubts that events in Russia could serve as a model for socialists in Britain <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> else.|$|E

As long as fuel was available to make steam, the Chaplin distiller offered a potential economic benefit in that the space and weight previously set aside for larger water tanks could be used more productively to carry additional cargo.|$|E
