60|$|In the {{solitude}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> I {{was able to}} look my position fairly in the face.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a little}} after five o'clock when I once more turned {{the key in the}} outer door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> in the Rue Daunou.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it possible, sir,' said Mr Dorrit, {{reddening}} excessively, 'that you have--ha--had {{the audacity}} to place one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> at the disposition of any other person?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are like}} me," [...] she said. [...] "I keep most <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> {{shut up and}} live in my den. A lonely person needs so much atmosphere." ...|$|R
60|$|WIRTHIN. So {{well that}} I've never been out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> since, till I heard your train come in.|$|E
60|$|I {{drew her}} {{gently in the}} {{direction}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> persuaded that I had quieted for a time her moody fears.|$|E
60|$|June 17th.--Just as my {{hand was}} on the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> I heard Sir Percival's voice calling to me from below.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} is very hard-hearted. But then, that may be because I am behind in my payment. He {{threatened}} to put me out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> if I didn't pay when he called again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Devon, I'm {{surprised}} at you! By no means; {{it would be}} the ruin <b>of</b> <b>my</b> establishment; not a girl would remain, and the character <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> would be lost for ever," [...] replied Mrs. King, goaded on by the relentless Cotton.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{accept the}} charge as a privilege," [...] he assented. [...] "We are {{within a few}} yards <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> now. I promise you that I will look after Captain Graham and advise him as to the proper course for him to pursue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't it {{make you}} uncomfortable if I went and hanged myself because I'd been turned out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> as I couldn't pay the rent?" ...|$|E
60|$|In a dim corner <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{for longer}} than my fancy thinks A {{beautiful}} and silent Sphinx has watched me through the shifting gloom.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was awakened}} at about nine o'clock {{the next morning}} by a loud and {{persistent}} {{knocking at the door}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b> I sat up in bed and shouted, ...|$|E
60|$|I went up-stairs, {{and found}} {{everything}} {{very much as}} it was below. Nothing seemed to have been injured except the chimney and the porches. I thanked my stars that I had used hard wood instead of mortar for the ceilings <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have come}} at last, then," [...] she said, gaily enough. [...] "Now you must {{let me give you}} some tea and {{afterwards}} you must {{tell me what you think}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>Of</b> course, I haven't finished furnishing yet, but they're nice, aren't they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} has," [...] said Marianne. [...] "But, mamma, I am afraid {{to begin to}} depend much on plants for the beauty <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> for fear I should not have your gift,--and, of all forlorn and hopeless things in a room, ill-kept plants are the most so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are {{you doing}} the honours <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> Guy?' said Philip, raising {{his head from}} the pillow, with a {{becoming}} shade of his ceremonious courtesy. 'Give her a chair.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Something {{tapped on}} the pane <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> [...] When {{there was never a}} trace Of wind or rain, and I saw in the gloom [...] My weary Beloved's face.|$|E
6000|$|... "The doors <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> only," [...] the Captain replied, {{a little}} shortly. [...] "It was Brown you saw, of course. He was {{standing}} {{exactly where you}} thought you saw Craig." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] she continued, drearily, [...] "that it all {{has very}} little to do with the case. I meant to keep it to myself, because, of course, apart from {{anything}} else, apart from Brian's meeting him coming out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> it supplies an additional cause for anger on Brian's part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are really}} the most amazing people, Leonard," [...] she declared. [...] "You {{stumbled}} into my life once before when I was {{on the point of}} being turned out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms.</b> You've come into it again and you find me once more homeless. Don't spend too much money upon our dinner, for I warn you that I am going to borrow from you." ...|$|R
60|$|When all {{was quiet}} in the house, I stole out into the passage and listened at the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>room.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{to think}} of that, I don't know," [...] replied Slone, blankly. [...] "I started back to fetch my things out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b> That's {{as far as my}} muddled {{thoughts}} got." ...|$|E
60|$|Before I was up {{the next}} morning I was {{informed}} that Fritz was waiting outside the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b> I had him shown in, and he stood respectfully by my bedside.|$|E
60|$|DE LEVIS. Yes. But I tried {{her pretty}} high the other day; and she's in the Cambridgeshire. I was only out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{a quarter of}} an hour, and I locked my door.|$|E
6000|$|... "November 27th.--Fairweather Vale Villas.--The Declaration {{has been}} made, {{with all the}} {{necessary}} formalities. And I have taken possession, in <b>my</b> widow's costume, <b>of</b> <b>my</b> new <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He got up. I {{thought he}} was going. No. More talk, more time for the {{development}} <b>of</b> infectious influences--in <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> too--remember that, in <b>my</b> <b>room!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--no," [...] said mine host, [...] "there is {{a secret}} about one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> on which I feel {{disposed}} to try an experiment. So, gentlemen, none of you shall know who has the haunted chamber, until circumstances reveal it. I will not even know it myself, but will leave it to chance and the allotment of the housekeeper. At the same time, if it will be any satisfaction to you, I will observe, for the honor <b>of</b> <b>my</b> paternal mansion, that there's scarcely a chamber in it but is well worthy of being haunted." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, no," [...] she {{interposed}} hastily, [...] "not before I am out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b> I {{shall be}} down to breakfast with Marian. I {{am not so}} ungrateful, not so forgetful {{of the past three}} months----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't know {{half the}} {{resources}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> miles <b>of</b> bookshelves," [...] he said, [...] "or {{you would never}} have thought of going to London for {{what you can get}} from me. A whole side <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> upstairs is devoted to periodical literature. I have reviews, magazines, and three weekly newspapers, bound, in each case, from the first number; and, what is just now more to your purpose, I have the Times for the last fifteen years in huge half-yearly volumes. Give me the date to-night, and you shall have the volume you want by two o'clock to-morrow afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, I {{cannot be}} put off in that way. You {{were going to say}} that you thought I should have {{distributed}} my stores long ago, or that I ought to have sent for them {{for the use of the}} hospital. I really ought to have done so. It would have been only fair, but in fact the idea never occurred to me.
