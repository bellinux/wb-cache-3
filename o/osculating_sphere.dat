40|$|In {{this work}} we furnish {{characterizations}} of spherical and plane curves using rotation minimizing frames. Due to their minimal twist, in many contexts these frames are preferable over the usual Frenet one, {{such as in}} motion design, sweep surface modeling, computer visualization, and in geometric considerations as well. Here, we first furnish an alternative proof for the characterization of spherical curves by using osculating spheres {{described in terms of}} a rotation minimizing frame. In addition, we show how to find the angle between the principal normal and a rotation minimizing vector for a spherical curve. This is done by conveniently writing the curvature and torsion for a curve on a sphere. Later, we extend these expressions for the curvature and torsion of a generic curve by studying its behavior near an <b>osculating</b> <b>sphere,</b> i. e., we describe them in terms of spherical analogs. Finally, we also address in this work the problem of characterizing those curves whose position vector, up to a translation, lies on a (moving) plane spanned by the unit tangent and a rotation minimizing vector field and prove that they are precisely the plane curves. Comment: 12 pages and new title. This version is an improvement/correction of the first one. Unhappily, there was a mistake and we are no longer able to exactly compute RM frames for a generic curve. Now, the discussion about spherical curves and the description of generic curves in terms of spherical analogs were expanded.

40|$|International audienceThe {{detection}} of Global Navigation Satellite Sys-tem (GNSS) signals that are reflected off the surface, {{along with the}} reception of direct GNSS signals, offers {{a unique opportunity to}} monitor water level variations over land and ocean. The time delay between the reception of the direct and reflected signals gives access to the altitude of the re-ceiver over the reflecting surface. The field of view of the receiver is highly dependent on both the orbits of the GNSS satellites and the configuration of the study site geometries. A simulator has been developed to determine the location of the reflection points on the surface accurately by modeling the trajectories of GNSS electromagnetic waves that are re-flected by the surface of the Earth. Only the geometric prob-lem was considered using a specular reflection assumption. The orbit of the GNSS constellation satellites (mainly GPS, GLONASS and Galileo), and the position of a fixed receiver, are used as inputs. Four different simulation modes are pro-posed, depending on the choice of the Earth surface model (local plane, <b>osculating</b> <b>sphere</b> or ellipsoid) and the consider-ation of topography likely to cause masking effects. Angular refraction effects derived from adaptive mapping functions are also taken into account. This simulator was developed to determine where the GNSS-R receivers should be located to monitor a given study area efficiently. In this study, two test sites were considered: the first one {{at the top of the}} 65 m Cor-douan lighthouse in the Gironde estuary, France, and the sec-ond one on the shore of Lake Geneva (50 m above the reflect-ing surface), at the border between France and Switzerland. This site is hidden by mountains in the south (orthometric altitude up to 2000 m), and overlooking the lake in the north (orthometric altitude of 370 m). For this second test site con-figuration, reflections occur until 560 m from the receiver. The planimetric (arc length) differences (or altimetric differ-ence as WGS 84 ellipsoid height) between the positions of the specular reflection points obtained considering the Earth's surface as an <b>osculating</b> <b>sphere</b> or as an ellipsoid were found to be on average 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite el-evation angles greater than 10 •, and 13. 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles between 5 and 10 •. The altimetric and planimetric differences between the plane and sphere approximations are on average below 1. 4 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles greater than 10 • and below 6. 2 cm (or 2. 4 mm) for satellite elevation angles be-tween 5 and 10 •. These results are the means of the differ-ences obtained during a 24 h simulation with a complete GPS and GLONASS constellation, and thus depend on how the satellite elevation angle is sampled over the day of simula-tion. The simulations highlight the importance of the dig-ital elevation model (DEM) integration: average planimet-ric differences (or altimetric) with and without integrating the DEM (with respect to the ellipsoid approximation) were found to be about 6. 3 m (or 1. 74 m), with the minimum el-evation angle equal to 5 •. The correction of the angular re-fraction due to troposphere on the signal leads to planimet-ric (or altimetric) differences of an approximately 18 m (or 6 cm) maximum for a 50 m receiver height above the reflect-ing surface, whereas the maximum is 2. 9 m (or 7 mm) for a 5 m receiver height above the reflecting surface. These errors Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 2262 N. Roussel et al. : GNSS-R simulations increase deeply with the receiver height above the reflecting surface. By setting it to 300 m, the planimetric errors reach 116 m, and the altimetric errors reach 32 cm for satellite el-evation angles lower than 10 •. The tests performed with the simulator presented in this paper highlight the importance of the choice of the Earth's representation and also the non-negligible effect of angular refraction due to the troposphere on the specular reflection point positions.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the study of cyclides osculating general surfaces. We show that generically, at any point of a surface, one has a one-parameter family of cyclides tangent to a surface curve of order three and among them just one is tangent to this curve of order four. This one will be called the osculating cyclide here. Directions of this {{tangency}} of higher order form a line filed on the surface and its integral curves will be called Dupin lines on the surface under consideration. Our Dupin lines are analogous to classical lines of curvature corresponding in the same to the eigenvectors of the Weingarten (shape) operator of a surface, that is to the directions of tangency of order two of its <b>osculating</b> <b>spheres.</b> Each point of a generic surface meets two orthogonal lines of curvature but only one Dupin line. Our main result shows that a large class of foliations of open planar domains can be realized as Dupin foliations, that is foliations by Dupin lines, on several surfaces.

40|$|The evolute of {{a smooth}} curve in an m-dimensional Euclidean space is {{the locus of}} centers of its <b>osculating</b> <b>spheres,</b> and the evolute of a spatial polygon is the polygon whose {{consecutive}} vertices are the centers of the spheres through the consecutive (m+ 1) -tuples of vertices of the original polygon. We study the iterations of these evolute transformations. This work continues the recent study of similar problems in dimension two, see arXiv: 1510. 07742. Here is a sampler of our results. The set of n-gons with fixed directions of the sides, considered up to parallel translation, is an (n-m) -dimensional vector space, and the second evolute transformation is a linear map of this space. If n=m+ 2, then the second evolute is homothetic to the original polygon, and if n=m+ 3, then {{the first and the}} third evolutes are homothetic. In general, each eigenvalue of the second evolute map has double multiplicity. We also study curves, with cusps, in 3 -dimensional Euclidean space and their evolutes. We provide continuous analogs of the results obtained for polygons, and present a class of curves which are homothetic to their second evolutes; these curves are spatial analogs of the classical hypocycloids.

40|$|In {{this work}} we are {{interested}} in the differential geometry of curves in simply isotropic and semi-isotropic 3 -spaces. These are examples of Cayley-Klein geometries whose absolute figure is given by a plane at infinity and a degenerate quadric. Motivated by the success of rotation minimizing (RM) frames in Euclidean and Lorentz-Minkowski geometries, here we show how to build RM frames in isotropic geometries and apply them in the study of spherical curves. Indeed, through a convenient manipulation of <b>osculating</b> <b>spheres</b> described in terms of RM frames, we show {{that it is possible to}} characterize spherical curves via a linear equation involving the curvatures that dictate the RM frame motion. For the case of semi-isotropic space, we also discuss on the distinct approaches for the absolute figure in the framework of a Cayley-Klein geometry and prove that they are all equivalent approaches through the use of hyperbolic (or double) numbers, a complex-like system where the square of the imaginary unit is $+ 1 $. Finally, we also show how to relate isotropic RM and Frenet frames through the use of Galilean trigonometric functions and dual numbers, a complex-like system where the square of the imaginary unit is zero.

40|$|For {{applications}} like segmentation, {{feature extraction}} and classification of point sets {{it is essential}} to know the principal curvatures and the corresponding principal directions.

On the other hand, distance measures for fitting these objects into point sets can be handled in a linear way, leading to efficient algorithms. In this paper we use conformal geometric algebra advantageously in order to locally compute continuous curvatures as well as principal curvatures of point sets without the need of costly pre-processing of raw data. We show results on artificial and real data. Numerical verification on artificial data shows the accuracy of our approach. ...|$|R
