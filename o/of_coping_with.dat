5|$|With {{insensitive}} or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, {{an infant}} may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> fearfulness {{such as the}} maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as {{the development of an}} internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.|$|E
5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E

5|$|Operational {{experience}} with the Nclass prototype demonstrated that it was capable <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> peacetime passenger and freight traffic on the mainline between London and Ramsgate, but Maunsell anticipated an increase in traffic that would require a more powerful locomotive capable of hauling longer trains. The use of larger engines was prevented by low permitted axle loadings on parts of the SECR network, caused by economies in track construction by using flint beach pebbles as track ballast; this material failed to hold the track in place when under strain and could not support heavy locomotives. In the meantime Maunsell settled upon producing a 3-cylinder version of the Nclass 2-6-0, which provided the opportunity to test {{a variant of the}} Gresley conjugated valve gear developed by his assistant, Harold Holcroft.|$|E

Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al.

In addition, the equations provided by the standards cannot accurately reflect the failure mode of the specimens observed in the tests. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the connection behavior, such as the stress distribution in the web near the periphery of the clip angles and the failure mechanism of the connection, an analytical study of the block shear capacity <b>of</b> <b>coped</b> beams <b>with</b> welded clip angles was carried out using the finite element method.

25|$|They {{are found}} in quiet, shallow waters with soft bottoms that can {{sometimes}} be heavily polluted by clouds of disturbed mud from the bottom, but it also inhabits running waters. In its native habitat, it inhabits waters with a temperature range of 25 Â°C to 28 Â°C (77 Â°F to 82 Â°F), pH 6.0â8.0, and hardness 5 to 19 DGH. Like {{most members of the}} Corydoras genus, these catfish have a unique method <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the low oxygen content that prevails in such environments. In addition to utilizing their gills like any other fish, they rapidly come {{to the surface of the}} water and draw air in through their mouth. This air is then absorbed through the wall of the intestine and any surplus air is expelled through the vent. It typically stays in schools of 20 to 30 individuals.

25|$|The Mantram Handbook was {{the primary}} {{instructional}} text in several research studies on mantram repetition conducted through the Veterans Administration in San Diego, California, by Jill Bormann and her colleagues. Randomized trials that she led have reported benefits from mantram repetition that include higher quality of life, increased use of positive strategies <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> stress, gains in faith/assurance and spiritual connectedness, and reductions in psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, and anger. Additional research findings offered evidence linking mantram use with reduced stress, anxiety, anger, and PTSD symptoms, as well as increased {{quality of life and}} spiritual well-being, and documenting that study participants found mantram repetition useful for managing stress, emotions, sleep/insomnia, and unwanted thoughts. The Mantram Handbook was also cited as a main source in developing a mantram-centered intervention for nurses in Korea. The intervention was found to reduce burnout, and to enhance well-being, spiritual integrity, and leadership practice.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} {{is reported}} to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} study of inelastic lateral torsional buckling <b>of</b> <b>coped</b> beams <b>with</b> simply supported ends is presented in this paper. Six full scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted. The test parameters include the aspect ratio <b>of</b> <b>cope</b> length to beam depth at coped region {{as well as the}} ratio <b>of</b> <b>cope</b> depth to beam depth. The results of tests were compared with finite element model results. The test results showed that a reduction in the inelastic buckling load due to coping could reach more than 60 % of the uncoped buckling capacity. A group of twelve finite element models for steel coped beams are investigated. The study takes into consideration variable parameters such as cope depth and length. A comparison between uncoped models and models with different geometrical parameters, is performed. The finite element results showed that both the cope length and cope depth have a significant influence on the lateral torsional buckling capacity. A parametric study <b>of</b> <b>coped</b> beams <b>with</b> stiffeners at <b>coped</b> region is reported in this paper.
