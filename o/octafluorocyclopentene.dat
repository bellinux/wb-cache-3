Novel 'one-pot' routes {{to a variety of}} bis(trifluoromethyl) substituted furan and arene derivatives were discovered, along with the synthesis of the novel diene, bis(trifluoromethyl) cyclopentadiene (46), from cyclopentadiene. 2) A variety of nucleophiles were successfully reacted with (10), the products of which were identical to those that have been, or would be expected to be, formed from the reaction of the same nucleophile with (4). A novel route to a fluorinated quinoline derivative was also discovered. 3) Perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene (74) was used as a 'bulking agent' to replace the hydrocarbon solvent used in halogen exchange reactions for the preparation of <b>octafluorocyclopentene</b> (3), chlorofluoro -pyridine, -pyrimidine, and -benzene derivatives. New 'one-pot' syntheses of hexafluorobut- 2 -yne (4), octafluorobut- 2 -ene (6) and hexafluorocyclobutene (2) were also discovered. 4) Various routes were explored in an attempt to improve the present literature preparations of tetrafluoropropyne (79), including pyrolysis and elimination methods.

It was established that the diadducts of HFP with diethyl ether and with oxolane form by two different processes, the former with a surprising degree of stereocontrol. Additions of polyethers to fluoroalkenes were performed and, using the information gained from the model compounds, approximate structures for the new materials were derived. These materials have interesting properties and were shown to migrate to the air interface in acetone solutions of poly(methyl methacrylate) and also in paint by ESCA. Cyclic analogues of these materials (derived from crown ethers) were also synthesised, and evidence for the formation of corresponding alkali metal complexes was obtained by mass spectrometry, though the complexes could not be isolated.

40|$|Ionisation {{processes}} in gas-phase polyatomic molecules {{have been studied}} using threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence and selected ion flow tube techniques for cations and an electron attachment mass spectrometer for anions. Cation formation has been studied for fluoroform (CHF_ 3), octafluorocyclobutane (c-C_ 4 F_ 8), <b>octafluorocyclopentene</b> (c-C_ 5 F_ 8), monochloroethene (C_ 2 H_ 3 Cl), the three isomers of dichloroethene (C_ 2 H_ 2 Cl_ 2) (i. e. 1, 1 -dichloroethene, (Z) - 1, 2 -dichloroethene and (E) - 1, 2 -dichloroethene), trichloroethene (C_ 2 HCl_ 3) and tetrachloroethene (C_ 2 Cl_ 4). Comparison between {{the data from the}} photoionisation and the ion-molecule reactions show that the dominant charge-transfer mechanism is long-range in nature. Detailed studies of the reactions of cations with the three dichloroethenes have been performed to look for evidence of isomeric effects. Major differences are seen when the reactant ion is CF_ 3 ^+; when 1, 1 -dichloroethene is the neutral reactant the only ionic product is C_ 2 H_ 2 Cl^+, but if the neutral is 1, 2 -dichloroethene then the only product is CHCl_ 2 ^+. Only minor differences are seen with other reagent ions. For the reactions of all six chloroethenes with CF_ 3 ^+, product ions are observed which can only be formed by extensive rearrangement across the carbon-carbon double bond. Mechanisms are suggested involving bridged trigonal intermediates to explain the production of the different channels. Studies have been performed on several perfluorocarbons, CHF_ 3, c-C_ 4 F_ 8 and c-C_ 5 F_ 8, due to their potential for use in industry. They are all excellent at etching substrates and have a lower global warming potential than the currently used gases. CHF_ 3 shows signs of non-statistical dissociation following photoionisation, and is shown to react via a largely long-range charge transfer mechanism in the ion-molecule reactions studied. For c-C_ 5 F_ 8 the ground electronic state of the ion is found to be very weak under threshold conditions whilst being much more intense when He(I) photons are used. The existing electron attachment mass spectrometer is described, and also extensive modifications which have been made to this apparatus. The use of new electronics and acquisition system give excellent results in the new equipment. The new arrangement has been extensively characterised by studying attachment to seven molecules, including several perfluorocarbon molecules (e. g. the isomers of C_ 4 F_ 8). Some isomeric effects on the measured rate coefficients are observed in the data. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of the perfluoro effect to the X-ray spectra (300 – 800 eV) of unsaturated organic molecules is explored. The C 1 s and F 1 s (and Ols where appropriate) oscillator strength spectra of five fluoroethylenes, <b>octafluorocyclopentene,</b> formyi fluoride, carbonyl fluoride, hexa-fluorobutadiene, trifluoroacetic acid, hexafluorobutyne- 2, hexafluoroacetone, and octafluorona-phthalene were derived from electron impact energy loss spectra recorded under electric-dipole scattering conditions. These spectra are analyzed and {{compared with those of}} their perhydro analogs, several of which (naphthalene, acetic acid, butyne- 2) are reported for the first time. In unsaturated systems in which all the atoms lie in the molecular plane, such as ethylene, formaldehyde, benzene, etc., perfluorination results in approximately 10 eV shifts of the inner-shell energy loss spectra to higher energies, yet the term values for the C 1 s→ 1 π* excitations are shifted by only 1 eV and often less. In direct contrast, the term values for the equivalent C 1 s→ 1 π* excitations in unsaturated systems having atoms out of the molecular plane, such as butene- 2 and acetone, are shifted upward by up to 3 eV upon perfluorination. These different spectral behaviors of planar and nonplanar systems on fluorination quantitatively parallel those which were observed earlier for valence-level ionization potentials (10 – 20 eV) and attributed to the perfluoro effect. It is observed {{for the first time that}} the C 1 s→ 1 π* excitation energies in planar hydrocarbons are only very weakly dependent on the spatial extent of the π-electron system. An explanation involving a localized C 1 s hole is proposed to rationalize this behavior. The perfluoro effect also predicts that excitations to σ* MO's will become relatively low-lying in highly fluorinated planar systems. Such low-lying inner-shell excitations induced by fluorination are observed in the fluoroethylene series and in the fluorocarbonyls. When the negative-ion spectra of the fluoroethylenes are assigned in a self-consistent manner, a σ* MO is found to drop into the vicinity of 1 π* upon fluorination. A similar intrusion of the lowest σ MO among the π* MO's is also observed upon fluorinating benzene, while evidence for this in the case of naphthalene is less clear, on account of the complex pattern of multiple C 1 s→nπ* transitions in this molecule. Inner-shell oscillator strength distributions are reported for all the spectra considered herein. In general, perfluorination increases the oscillator strengths of C 1 s→ 1 π* transitions by up to a factor of two. Variation of the C 1 s→ 1 π* and O 1 s→ 17 π* oscillator strengths in the series H 2 CO, HFCO, F 2 CO shows clearly how the 17 π* MO becomes more polarized toward C as fluorination proceeds. In some cases, C 1 s→σ* (C-F) oscillator strengths exceed those for C 1 s→ 1 π* transitions...|$|E
40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry is currently {{faced with the}} problem of the use and emissions of strong global warming compounds, known as perfluorocompounds (PFCs) for dielectric etch applications. The release of global warming compounds from this and other sources is suspected to result in changes in the earth's climate and weather patterns. Quantitative targets for emissions reduction set by the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) makes it urgent to find a solution to this issue. A long-term means of approaching this problem is to find and develop alternative chemistries that are more environmentally benign without sacrificing performance. Several classes of chemistries have been investigated to date, including hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), iodofluorocarbons (IFCs), and NF 3 /hydrocarbons. One class of chemistries that have shown considerable promise is the unsaturated fluorocarbons (UFCs). The research documented herein uses the UFCs to assess etch process and emissions performance. Not only are these novel chemistries tested on conventional silicon dioxide films, but also on new low-k dielectrics that are likely candidates for future generation process flows. Emissions and process performance are reported for each of the different gases. The prospects for integration of some of these chemistries to next generation processes are good from both a process and emissions standpoint. The UFCs are not strong greenhouse gases {{as a result of their}} short atmospheric lifetimes (typically less than a day). Unlike many of the previous alternative chemistries studied, the emissions from UFCs are due to reformation of reactive products into strong global warming gases, specifically PFCs and HFCs, in the plasma environment. In this work, the formation of plasma effluents has been studied. (cont.) In this work, the formation of plasma effluents has been studied. These reformation products are not only a result of the reformation of reactive species from the breakup of the feed gas, but also a result of the interaction of the plasma with surfaces in the etch chamber, including the wafer being etched. Process performance has been assessed by performing cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Emissions data have been collected using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In-situ process monitoring methods such as optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and residual gas analysis (RGA) have been used in some experiments. Ex-situ studies of fluorocarbon deposited films have been performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Screening experiments performed on an Applied Materials HDP high-density etch chamber showed that all of the UFCs in addition to a fluorinated ether were capable of process performance comparable to PFC based processes, such as C 3 F 8. These studies showed that <b>octafluorocyclopentene</b> and hexafluoropropene processes result in greater than 70 % emissions reduction compared to a C 3 F 8 -based reference process. Three isomers of C 4 F 6 performed even better, with greater than 80 % emissions reduction.
