5|$|At the trial, Archibald Macdonald, {{representing}} the prosecution, argued that Paine's work served only to inflame the populace and distribute radical ideas to those without {{the experience to}} understand them in context. Erskine's reply opened with a defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> lawyers to represent whichever clients came to them, and followed with an exposition of his views on the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the press—arguing that the publication of radical tracts served only to improve the government by highlighting its weaknesses, {{and could not be}} seditious if published in good faith. Despite Erskine's speech later receiving a rapturous response, Paine was found guilty before Macdonald replied. The verdict was seen by the government as legitimising their repression of radicalism, and {{paved the way for the}} 1794 Treason Trials, in which Erskine played a prominent role.|$|E

The statue {{was designed and}} made by the Dutch sculptor Frederik Engel Jeltsema. The unveiling in The Hague on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by Queen Wilhelmina, with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close {{to the place where}} De Witt and his brother Cornelis were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which – in translation – reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the seas, caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician.
