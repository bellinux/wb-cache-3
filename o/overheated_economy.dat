50|$|The {{economy in}} the Baltic states had been among the fastest growing in the European Area {{following}} {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union as well as the recession due to 1998 Russian financial crisis. To minimize its dependence on Russia, the Baltic states opted to integrate closer to the Western Europe. By early 2000, the Baltic states' economy had begun to grow, to some extent higher than some of its Euro Area counterparts. Following the EU accession of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 2004, the period in between 2005 and 2007 witnessed an <b>overheated</b> <b>economy</b> of the three Baltic states. A combination of growth above potential, high inflation and far widening of the current account deficit were singled out as causes behind the overheating {{economy in the}} Baltic states. A credit boom in addition to bullish real estate investment spurred by foreign banks (predominantly Scandinavian Banks) worsened the scenario. All these factors led to a housing bubble in the Baltic states, piloting the real estate sector beyond sustainable.|$|E
5000|$|Fiscal policy: In Estonia, {{the biggest}} issue lay on the current account deficit which was contributed by the rapid credit growth, which in return stimulated demands for imports The deficit was largely financed by a {{combination}} of FDI inflows, excessive borrowing by domestic bank from foreign parent banks, and an increase access to EU funds. On the positive side, Estonia was running on a surplus to enable the government to repay debts. In order for Estonia accession to the EU, Estonia had largely maintained a surplus till before the crisis, to fulfil the Maastricht Criteria of a budget deficit below 3% of the GDP. Thus, Estonia maintained the position as having the most stable public finances during the crisis. The situation in Latvia was far more worrying than its two neighbouring countries. By 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a caution to Latvia in order to minimize the economic risk from overheating. Latvia only responded by 2007 by clamping down on the credit market when inflation had skyrocketed to double digits. The scenario was further worsened due to its budgetary policy always having a deficit due to the incorrect assumption that the economy would always perform stronger than expected. In Lithuania, certain government policies caused much controversy in clamping down on the <b>overheated</b> <b>economy.</b> For instance, income tax incentives for individuals taking housing loans and an absence of a property tax appeared to lend support to credit and housing price growth. [...] "Red tape" [...] among the highly bureaucratic central and municipal governments distorted the market supply and demand [...] for housing. During the economic overheating, the ruling democratic coalition reduced tax and increased government spending on social programmes. [...] The wages for the public sector also stoked up the inflation rate, besides worsening the current account deficit.|$|E

50|$|Since gaining {{independence}} from the Soviet Union in 1991, the economy growth in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania {{has been among the}} fastest in EU-25 region. The average GDP growth in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from 2000 to 2004 was 7.56%, 7.42%, and 7.00%, respectively. Unemployment rate in Estonia has gone down from as high as 13.9% in 2000 to 8.5% in 2004. Elsewhere Latvia and Lithuania also saw the unemployment rate declined from 13.3% and 16.1%, respectively in 2001 to 10.3% and 11.4%. Strong integration with the EU bloc partly helps in accelerating the economic growth in the Baltic States, as the Baltic States were rebuilding the nation economy from the post-{{independence from}} the Soviet Union as well as 1998 Russian financial crisis. By December 18, 2002, EU summit in Copenhagen formally invite Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to join the bloc. Referendum carried out in 2003 showed that majority Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian supported the move to integrate closer to the EU bloc. Subsequently, on May 1, 2004, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined other new states into EU.Strong integration with the EU benefits the Baltic States economy as foreign direct investment inflow helps to accelerate the economy especially the financial intermediaries and manufacturing sectors. Following a sharp inflow of cheap foreign credit, banks has been more willing to lend to corporate and household for real estate related activities. In fact, total loans approved for the purpose of housing purchase have been increasing in the Baltic States over the period in between 2000 and 2004. By 2004, the ratio of housing loans to total loans approved in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were 79.8%, 76.3% and 62.9%, respectively. Consequently, housing prices in the Baltic States began to boom in this period.The gross wage in Baltic States generally has improved since 2000, reflecting improvements in the Baltic States economy. Gross wage in Estonia has gone up 32% in 2004 compared to 2001, Latvia up by 11% and Lithuania up by 22%. However, many Latvian and Lithuanian have opted to work in the Western Europe (especially United Kingdom and Ireland) due to higher wages.

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of productivity growth {{during the latter}} half of the 1990 s was both the defining economic event of the decade and a major topic of debate among Federal Reserve policymakers. A key aspect of the debate was the conflict between incoming aggregate data, which initially suggested little productivity gain, and anecdotal firm-level evidence which hinted at an acceleration. Some FOMC members feared an <b>overheating</b> <b>economy</b> and higher inflation; others, including the Chairman, argued that revolutionary increases in productivity were occurring and the Committee should not prematurely forgo significant future gains in real income by tightening policy. We review the difficulty of measuring productivity during periods of rapid quality change, the large magnitude of subsequent data revisions during the 1990 s, and, from FOMC transcripts, the contemporary monetary policy debate within the FOMC as the decade*s data evolved.

40|$|China's {{economic}} reforms succeeded in decentralizing decision making power {{down to the}} local and enterprise level. This decentralization has permitted a vibrant non-state sector to emerge alongside the state sector. Growing {{out of the state}} plan accounts for much of China's spectacular economic growth. However, productivity in the state sector has experienced little improvement. One can trace recurrent macroeconomic imbalances and inflation to the state policy to provide cheap credit to cover the huge losses sustained by state-owned enterprises. Attempts to reimpose controls to cool down an <b>overheated</b> <b>economy</b> repeatedly have halted the momentum for economic reform. Failure to introduce banking and financial reforms threatens future growth of the non-state sector. The success of such reforms depends critically on efforts to restructure and privatize state-owned enterprises. Growing out of the state plan requires officials to adopt an explicit policy to stop supporting the losses in the state owned enterprises.

In 1986, losses increased another 78. 7 percent to 7. 42 billion yuan, and in 1987 they increased another 16. 9 percent to reach 8. 47 billion yuan. These losses not only marked the most serious increase in enterprise losses since 1982, when enterprises had racked up 5. 58 billion yuan in losses, but their pattern did not follow the pattern of past debt peaks. Previously, debt peaks had been associated with the slow downs that occurred periodically in China's industrial growth rate as authorities adopted tight monetary and credit policies to cool off an <b>overheated</b> <b>economy.</b> This pattern held in 1986, as the industrial growth rate slowed from 18 percent to 9. 2 percent.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we read Keynes’s “General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” {{from the point}} of view of the main causes of the {{economic}} crisis in general and particularly the present world economic crisis. We compare Keynes’s approach to the crisis with the work of contemporary distinguished economists. We conclude that a drop of marginal efficiency of capital is the main cause of the economic crisis and depression, and that such a drop is an unavoidable consequence of functioning of a market capitalist economy. Such a view differs significantly from the deliberations of many economists who hold insufficient demand as the main cause of the crisis. We think that insufficient demand appears on the surface as a cause of the crisis. However, insufficient demand is just a consequence of a previously <b>overheated</b> <b>economy</b> faced with the drop of MEC. Consequently, a crisis cannot be prevented by expansive financial policy. Therefore it should come as a surprise that Keynes in the last year of his life retreated from his ideas expressed in “General Theory” and declared himself as not Keynesian any more (Hutchison, 1981).

By the second half of 1951 the overseas sterling area was importing from North America at double the 1950 rate. By 1951 inflation was beginning to increase, the government budget surplus had disappeared, and in another sign of an <b>overheating</b> <b>economy</b> unemployment was down to 1945 levels.

In our view, a sensible political economy. whose objectives are the rapid mobilization of underemployed Asian labor and the accumulation of an efficient capital stock, is the source of current imba!ances. The mechanism that regulates the mobilization is a cross-border transfer, through excess returns to foreign direct investment, to countries like the United States that are willing to restructure their labor markets to accommodate the restructuring of labor markets in Asia.
