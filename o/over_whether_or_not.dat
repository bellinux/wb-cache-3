Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 {{plans were}} {{announced}} {{for a film}} adaptation of the series. Miramax Films was named as purchasing the film rights, with Lawrence Guterman signed to direct. In 2003 Colfer stated that a screenplay had been finalized and that casting was due to start the same year, but expressed scepticism <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> this would come to pass. The film remained in development and {{was assumed to be}} in development hell until 2011, when it was reported that Jim Sheridan was interested in directing the movie. In July 2013, it was announced that Disney and Harvey Weinstein are developing a project based on the first and second installment of the Artemis Fowl series. Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal will be the executive producers.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU {{leadership}} was divided <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to defend pro-Nazi {{speech in the}} United States; pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis. Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups. The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped. The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.|$|E

At Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is engaging in sexual activity with Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), while his wife, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is estranged. In the next room, Meredith begins arguing with her husband, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> he should report the chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.)'s alcoholism to Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), the hospital's president.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E

When insurance is actuarially fair, the insurance and consumption decisions are separable. With loaded premiums, and alternatively without insurance, optimal consumption is dynamically related to {{the growth rate of}} the loss probability, and a growing loss probability generates precautionary saving. With loaded premiums, less than full insurance is demanded at each instant, and optimal cover varies <b>over</b> time, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the loss probability is constant. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1108, Ranulf {{was dragged}} {{into the middle of}} the ongoing dispute between Archbishop Anselm and the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of York, Thomas <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> Thomas should profess obedience to Anselm. Because Anselm refused to consecrate Thomas without a profession, and Thomas refused to profess, Thomas was unable to consecrate bishops himself. Ranulf wrote to Anselm, asking that he might act as Thomas' surrogate and consecrate Thurgot as Bishop of St Andrew's. In September 1108, Anselm wrote to Ranulf forbidding anyone but Thomas or Anselm himself to consecrate Thurgot or any other bishops. Later, Ranulf tried to bribe King Henry to take Thomas' side. Thurgot had been prior of the cathedral chapter at Durham, but had disagreed with Ranulf, who arranged for him to be elected to St Andrew's as a solution to the quarrel.|$|E
5|$|The creators' {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Monica was comedian Janeane Garofalo. Cox had {{originally}} been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston, Cox's co-star to whom the role of Monica had originally been offered. Before Friends aired, Monica's characterization was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with a man on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's existing storyline. The character's struggles with childhood obesity, challenges with romantic relationships and complicated relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.|$|E

40|$|Using an {{approach}} based on Thornberry’s interactional theory, this paper focuses on testing <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> {{the theory is}} valid in explaining racial differences. This paper focuses on two variables of the theory, which previous studies indicate {{are more likely to}} explain race differences in delinquency than the others: commitment to school and peer delinquency. In accordance with interactional theory, this paper intends {{to examine the relationship between}} each set of variables and how they influence one another <b>over</b> time, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> these relationships are similar across racial groups, expanding on findings that use general theories such as social control and social learning to explain racial differences in offending, and, ultimately, implications regarding the application of theories to explain racial differences in offending.

50|$|At the Rialla, {{most of the}} {{discussion}} is <b>over</b> Masul, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> he is Roelstra's heir, and <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> it even matters. As the Princes debate the issue, Segev continues to drug Hollis, who in turn draws away from Maarken. Then, Andrade claims that she can show {{the events of the}} past by using sorcery from the scrolls. Gleeful at the turn of events, Segev uses sorcery during her conjuring in order to kill her. Andry becomes Lord of Goddess Keep. Though saddened by Andrade's death, the debate of Masul continues; her conjure proved nothing. At last a duel is proposed between Masul and Pol. Maarken, first cousin to Pol, fights in Pol's place as Pol has yet to be knighted. During the battle, Segev uses sorcery against Maarken. Seeing Maarken in pain snaps Hollis out of her drugged state, and she kills Segev. Masul nearly kills Maarken, but at the last minute, Rohan intervenes and kills him with a pair of thrown daggers.|$|R

5000|$|The main mode {{of play in}} AirMech is Player versus Player or PvP, which pits {{one side}} against another (there are always only two sides or teams). Players may elect to play 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 on maps of varying shapes and sizes. The main {{objective}} of players in this mode is to destroy the enemy fortress while keeping their fortress intact. Players may capture initially neutral outposts {{in order to help}} accomplish this goal, or they can initiate direct attacks on the enemy fortress. Outposts provide map control, additional income, additional upkeep, and a place to heal units and recharge. The game ends when one fortress is destroyed.

40|$|Social {{media has}} been {{considered}} as a data source for tracking disease. However, most analyses are based on models that prioritize strong correlation with population-level disease rates <b>over</b> determining <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> specific individual users are actually sick. Taking a different approach, we develop a novel system for social-media based disease detection {{at the individual level}} using a sample of professionally diagnosed individuals. Specifically, we develop a system for making an accurate influenza diagnosis based on an individual's publicly available Twitter data. We find that about half (17 / 35 = 48. 57 %) of the users in our sample that were sick explicitly discuss their disease on Twitter. By developing a meta classifier that combines text analysis, anomaly detection, and social network analysis, we are able to diagnose an individual with greater than 99 % accuracy even if she does not discuss her health.

40|$|We present three {{families}} of pairs of geometrically non-isomorphic curves whose Jacobians are isomorphic {{to one another}} as unpolarized abelian varieties. Each family is parametrized by an open subset of P^ 1. The first family consists of pairs of genus- 2 curves whose equations are given by simple expressions in the parameter; the curves in this family have reducible Jacobians. The second family also consists of pairs of genus- 2 curves, but generically the curves in this family have absolutely simple Jacobians. The third family consists of pairs of genus- 3 curves, one member of each pair being a hyperelliptic curve {{and the other a}} plane quartic. Examples from these families show that in general it is impossible to tell from the Jacobian of a genus- 2 curve <b>over</b> Q <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the curve has rational points [...] <b>or</b> indeed <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> it has real points.
