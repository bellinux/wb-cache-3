40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{possibility}} of obtaining iron and titanium-vanadium concentrates with highest contents of iron and titanium, respectively, through hydrometallurgical processing of the titanomagnetite ores of the Chineisk deposit. We varied two key parameters to determine {{the efficiency of the}} process: (a) concentration of leaching solution (ammonium fluoride); and (b) acidity of solution. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentration was varied from 0. 08 mol/L to 4. 2 mol/L with the other fixed parameters. It was shown that optimum <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentration for leaching the ore is 0. 42 mol/L; at these concentrations iron and titanium contents are about 62. 8 wt % and 3. 5 wt % in solid phase, respectively. The acidity of solution was changed by adding of hydrofluoric acid with varied concentration (from 0. 86 mol/L to 4. 07 mol/L) to <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> solution with fixed concentration of 0. 42 mol/L. The best results (degree of titanium extraction = 63. 7 %) were obtained when using a solution of hydrofluoric acid with concentration 4. 07 mol/L. In this case, the addition of acid makes it possible to increase the Fe/Ti ratio by 3. 4 times in comparison with the original ore. Thus, we conclude that acidity and the concentration of <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> solution significantly influences the selectivity of the hydrometallurgical process...|$|R

40|$|Subject of Study. The paper {{deals with}} {{preparation}} processes of ultradisperse, homogeneous powder Sr 1 -хNdхF 2 +х (х= 0. 003 - 0. 2), {{with use of}} <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> as the fluorinating agent taken over 114 - 120 % from stoichiometry. Method. Nitrate of strontium, neodymium nitrate hexahydrate, with the content equal to 99. 99 % of the basic substance and <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> were used {{as the source of}} substances. Activated powders of strontium fluoride were obtained by the method of deposition from aqueous solutions by washing the precipitate with a solution of <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> taken over 114 - 120 % from stoichiometry. The washed precipitate was centrifuged for 5 - 7 min, dried in the air at 30 - 350 C. Heat treatment of the dried precipitate was carried out in two stages: the first stage at the temperature of 200 - 2500 C for 0. 5 - 1 hour, the second one at 550 - 6000 C for 2 - 3 hours. X-ray analysis of the synthesized samples was carried out on a Bruker D 8 Advance diffractometer, radiation Cu K. The size and shape measuring of the particles of activated strontium fluoride was carried out by means of electron microscope Carl Zeiss NVision 40. The content of neodymium in activated powders of strontium fluoride was determined by the method of spectral emission analysis on the device LEA - S 500. Chemical analysis for determination of ammonium ion (NH 4 +) content in the obtained samples was performed by the method of Kjeldahl. Calculations of lattice parameters, size of coherent scattering regions and the values of micro-deformations were carried out by TOPAS program. Main Results. Preparation processes of ultradisperse, homogeneous powder Sr 1 -хNdхF 2 +х (х= 0. 003 - 0. 2), with use of <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> as the fluorinating agent taken over 114 - 120 % from stoichiometry, provides obtaining the firm solution Sr 1 -x-yNdx(NH 4) yF 2 +x-y of the cubic fluorite structure. It has been found out that the morphology and size of the resulting product depend on the quantity of excess <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride.</b> The changes in the morphology of the particles from nano – and microcubes to a plate shape were made clear by varying the quantity of excess <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> from 114 % to 120 %. The particle size significantly decreased with increasing excess of <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> from 114 % to 120 %. After heat treatment of the obtained powders agglomeration of cubic morphology particles to a size equal to 50 - 350 nm without changing their shape occurred. The plate-like particles have got a rounded shape after heat treatment with size between 50 and 200 nm. Practical Relevance.
