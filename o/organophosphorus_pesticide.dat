40|$|Introduction. Insecticides are toxines {{by which}} we destroy harmful insects. The most {{frequent}} insecticides which are used today are <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides.</b> This group of compounds make substances whose activity mechanism {{is based on the}} inhibition of acetylcho­linesterase in nerve synapsis, thus producing holynergic syndrome, resulting from the accumulation of acetylcholine which developed due to the absence of decomposition under the influence of cholinesterase. In the clinical picture of acute toxication by cholinesterase inhibitors there is a clear difference between muscarinic and nicotine effects. The basic aim {{of the study was to}} establish the effects of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> present in blood and breast milk of mothers on newborns morbidity. Material and methods. The study group consisted of 18 newborns whose mothers had isolated <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> in their blood and breast­milk on the third day after delivery, and the control group consisted of 84 newborns whose mothers did not have isolated <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> in their blood and breastmilk. Results. Morbidity is three times greater, often in combination with some disorders of the central nervous system, and the relative risk for its appearance is eight time greater in newborns exposed to <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Disscusion. Disorders that appear in newborns exposed to pesticides are mutagenic, cancerogenic and neurotoxic and some agenses could disturb the immune system which is reflected in morbidity increase, primarly of the central nervous system. Conclusion. The presence of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> in blood and breast milk has negative effects on newborns.

40|$|Abstract The {{frequent}} {{occurrence of}} pesticide residues in herbal materials was indicated by previous studies. In this study, {{the concentration of}} some of the <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> including parathion, malathion, diazinon and pirimiphos methyl in different kinds of medicinal plants were determined. The samples were collected randomly from ten local markets of different areas of Iran. At the detection limit of 0. 5 [*]ng[*]g - 1, parathion and pirimiphos methyl were not detected in any of the samples. Some amounts of malathion and diazinon were found in Zataria, Matricaria chamomile, Spearmint and Cumin Seed samples while, the concentrations of target <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> in Borage samples were below the detection limits of the methods which could be a result of intensive transformation of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> by Borage.

5000|$|A study {{published}} by the National Research Council in 1993 determined that for infants and children, {{the major source of}} exposure to pesticides is through diet. A {{study published}} in 2006 by Lu et al. measured the levels of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> exposure in 23 school children before and after replacing their diet with organic food. In this study it was found that levels of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> exposure dropped from negligible levels to undetectable levels when the children switched to an organic diet, the authors presented this reduction as a significant reduction in risk. [...] The conclusions presented in Lu et al. were criticized in the literature as a case of bad scientific communication.|$|E
50|$|The main {{threat to}} the species is over-grazing and {{trampling}} of shrub-lands and tussock grasslands by feral herbivores and domestic stock. Habitat clearing, fragmentation, landscape degradation, and fires which occur too frequently and extensively, are also threats to the stripe-faced dunnarts habitat. Predation by feral cats and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) also directly impacts the species population. Removal of fallen timber also threatens the species as it relies on it for shelter form the heat and predator, as well forages for invertebrates that may live in or under woody debris. The dunnarts are very sensitives to the <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> fenitrothion which at sub-lethal intoxication can cause lethargy and temporary immobilisation, increasing the risk of predation. The pesticide is used by local landholders to control locusts.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{the authors}} have {{experienced}} the autopsy of a female victim who died of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> intoxication. Therefore, {{for the purpose of}} clarifying the dead cause, we carried out the separation and identification of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> from the specimens such as the stomach contents, cardiac blood and urine of this cadaver and further the measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity in the blood. The results were as follows. 1. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the serum and erythrocytes. The serum and erythrocytes were separated by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm and subjected to the assay of acetylcholinesterase activity on the basis of Pilz's method. Acetylcholinesterase activities were 0. 312 μAq in the erythrocytes and 0. 078 μAq in the serum, respectively. These values abruptly lowered in comparison with those in the serum and erythrocytes of healthy human adults and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity was clearly observed. 2. Separation and identification of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> Unknown <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> was first extracted from the stomach contents, cardiac blood and urine with ethanol according to Stas-Ott's method and then the crude materials purified by use of both the silicagel column and thin-layer chromatographies.

30|$|The {{results of}} this study have {{provided}} an insight into the levels of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues contamination in soils of cocoa farms and drinking water sources in and around cocoa farms in the Dormaa West District of Ghana. From the study, four <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues (diazinon, chlorpyrifos, pirimiphos-methyl and profenofos) were detected in the soil and water samples analysed. Chlorpyrifos was the most detected organophosphorus residue in soil and water samples. The presence of organophosphorus pesticides suggests the use of the pesticides by cocoa farmers in the study area and that could be attributed to {{the fact that most of}} these pesticides were registered for use in Ghana for agricultural purposes (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2009).|$|E
40|$|A simple {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} catalytic kinetic spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} trace amount of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> has been proposed. The method {{is based on the}} catalytic effect of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> (malathion, dimethoate and phorate) on the oxidation of LCV (leuco crystal violet) by potassium iodate in hydrochloric acid medium to give a violet colored dye. The dye shows maximum absorption at 592 nm. The fixed-time method was used for 15 min. The system obeys Beers law in the range of 0. 02 - 0. 2, 0. 032 - 0. 32 and 0. 03 - 0. 3 µg mL- 1, for malathion, dimethoate, and phorate, respectively. Important analytical parameters such as time, temperature, reagent concentration, acidity etc, have been optimized for complete color reaction. Sandells sensitivity and molar absorptivity for the system were found to be 0. 0002, 0. 0004, 0. 0004 µg cm- 2 and 1. 2 × 10 (6), 5. 21 × 10 (5), 6. 3 × 10 (5) L mol- 1 cm- 1, respectively.

30|$|The {{present study}} has {{revealed}} that out of 40 water samples none of the water sample from Saturia Upazila was contaminated with pesticides although a trace amount of carbaryl was identified but was below the detection limit. It is also found that, <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> are being used excessively in Nagarpur Upazila. Lacorte et al. (1995) observed a total of ten organophosphates including malathion, diazinon and some other pesticides which disappeared within 2  weeks. Since, <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> are degraded very quickly and the samples have been collected randomly, the concentration of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> (prior to the collection) {{may be more than}} the detected value. The presence of these suspected pesticide residues are an alarming result for the people living in this area. With the increasing population along with increasing demand of food, the uses of pesticides have been increased a lot in the third world countries like Bangladesh. The prolonged consumption of these pesticides through food can be stored in the lipid of human body and may cause severe health hazards.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rapid and {{sensitive}} detection methods are in urgent {{demand for the}} screening of extensively used <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> and highly toxic nerve agents for their neurotoxicity. In this study, we developed a novel Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) peroxidase mimetic-based colorimetric method for the rapid detection of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> and nerve agents. The detection assay is composed of MNPs, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and choline oxidase (CHO). The enzymes AChE and CHO catalyze the formation of H 2 O 2 {{in the presence of}} acetylcholine, which then activates MNPs to catalyze the oxidation of colorimetric substrates to produce a color reaction. After incubation with the organophosphorus neurotoxins, the enzymatic activity of AChE was inhibited and produced less H 2 O 2, resulting in a decreased catalytic oxidation of colorimetric substrates over MNP peroxidase mimetics, accompanied by a drop in color intensity. Three organophosphorus compounds were tested on the assay: acephate and methyl-paraoxon as representative <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> and the nerve agent Sarin.
