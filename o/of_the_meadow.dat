5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a {{sequence}} of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill.

5|$|The {{agriculture}} of {{the parish}} is chiefly confined to grazing, and would be more materially benefited by draining; but the tax upon brick, a most essential article in this process, {{has been a very}} great hindrance to it.

5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E

2500|$|In 1935, the site, now planned as [...] "Flushing Meadow Park", was {{selected}} for {{what would become the}} 1939 World's Fair. In addition to the ash dumps and undeveloped meadows, houses in Corona east of 111th Street, adjacent to the dumps, were condemned and added to the site, displacing residents. The plans were drafted by Parks Department landscape architect Gilmore David Clarke and his partner Michael Rapuano, designed in Beaux-Arts style. Work on the World's Fair site began on June 16, 1936. The project primarily involved leveling the ash mounds, with the leftover material used to fill other areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meadow.</b> Two sites were excavated to create Meadow and Willow Lake, while much of the Flushing River was diverted into underground culverts. A floodgate was built to prevent tidal flow from flooding the lakes. In addition to recreation, the lakes would serve as repositories for excess storm runoff. The dirt from the lake sites was used as additional topsoil for the park. The project was a 24-hour-a-day job, with 450 workers operating on three daily shifts. Workers had to combat the effects of high tide, and dust storms created by the ash. The work significantly changed the topography of the meadows, differing from that created by glaciation. Thousands of trees were transplanted to the fair site {{in order to create a}} natural landscape. Meanwhile, thousands of [...] Douglas fir timbers were driven into the ground to create the foundations for fair structures. The pedestrian plan called for numerous wide tree-lined pathways, including a central [...] "Cascade Mall" [...] leading to the Trylon and Perisphere, many of which would be retained for the park.|$|E
