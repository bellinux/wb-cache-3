Potential student Allan Bakke, a qualified white applicant, challenged the practice after he {{was rejected by the}} school. In an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the court ruled against racial quotas at the school while allowing minority status to remain <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> criteria in the admissions process.|$|E
