5|$|The pre-battle {{sacrifice}} {{is incompatible with}} {{the first and second}} boons, but the cults have their own explanations. The self-sacrifice prior to the war is incompatible with dying a heroic death during the war and both are incompatible with living to see the full duration of the war. The Kuttantavar cult resolves the first dilemma, holding that Aravan's body reconfigured itself after the sacrifice and that Aravan went on to die a heroic death on the eighth day of the war. The Kuttantavar cult are not <b>overly</b> <b>concerned</b> about the second boon of Aravan's continued observation of the war. On the other hand, the Draupadi cult are not <b>overly</b> <b>concerned</b> about the first boon of the heroic death; they resolve the second dilemma, regarding Aravan's continued observation of the war, holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through the eyes of his severed head. A third view harmonizes all the boons, holding that Aravan's body reconstituted after the sacrifice; he then fought heroically until being decapitated on the eighth day, observing the remainder of the war through the eyes of his severed head.|$|E

A method is devised to estimate “the productivity prospects”: a series that captures the effects of news shocks on economic decisions. The estimated series rises during the boom, falls during the recession and helps forecast future productivity shocks at several horizons. The model's predictions for sample paths of hours worked, output, investment, consumption, wages and stock prices are largely in conformity with U. S. data.

Transparency and Trustexamines the effects of transparency on trust in a government organisation. By using an experimental method this study moves beyond normative or correlational research on transparency. In doing so, causal inferences regarding the relation between transparency and trust are allowed. Several objects of transparency and dimensions of information are being put to the test in three experiments. The experiments show that transparency is merely a ‘hygiene factor’: it does not contribute to higher levels of trust and it can even lead to lower levels of trust if people are disappointed with the degree to which government is transparent.

We also explore a treatment in which the third party may also choose to reward a sender who has received a low net payoff {{as a result of the}} responder’s action. We find a strong and significant effect of third-party punishment, in both punishment regimes, as the amount sent by the first mover is more than 60 % higher when there is the possibility of third-party punishment. We also find that responders return a higher proportion of the amount sent to them when there is the possibility of punishment, with this proportion slightly higher when reward is not feasible. Finally, third parties punish less when reward is feasible, but nevertheless spend more on the combination of reward and punishment when these are both permitted than on punishment when this is the only choice for redressing material outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the result}} of a practice-led research exploration of how creative writing practice may be expanded and developed with particular application to the writing of what I refer to as socio-humanitarian drama. I have developed this notion to promote discussion and consideration of specific issues of social justice and human rights within playwriting. While this practice-led research enlisted reflective practice in the task of developing and extending my own writing practice, this dissertation does also outline specific, practical modes of creative process, or exercises, that could be applied more broadly for others who may seek to develop their creative writing practice in the field of issue based theatre. The particular socio-humanitarian concern with which this research is engaged is those behaviours, attitudes and beliefs that perpetuate the acceptance, normalisation and enacting of sexual violence, termed in this research as ‘rape culture’. The research identifies modes and methods of the works of a select community of socio-humanitarian theatre-makers, including the work of Caryl Churchill, version 1. 0, Patricia Cornelius and Timberlake Wertenbaker, and experiments with the application of these modes and methods to the writing and development of dramatic writing that draws attention to issues relating to ‘rape culture’. This research also considers what, if any, development of my own creative practice these writing experiments facilitated. The final chapter includes an unproduced play-text that attempts to pull these writing experiments together as a cohesive whole. This research discusses certain works from what I refer to as the community of socio-humanitarian dramatic practice, and identifies methods, constructs and concepts that were employed to develop this form of theatre without resulting in a performance text that was <b>overly</b> didactic. The <b>concern</b> being that issue based dramatic writing that is overly prescriptive with meaning may serve to disaffect and disengage audience reception of an issue, as well as result in a performance work that is artistically limited...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Data Broadcast (WDB) {{is known}} as a highly {{efficient}} information delivery mechanism of nearly unlimited scalability. Over the last few years, due to the appealing properties and a wide area of possible application, a large number of new solutions and ideas related to WDB have been proposed. However, most of those solutions employ <b>overly</b> simplified assumptions <b>concerning</b> the system operation and user behaviour, and therefore fail to provide a broader insight into the nature and performance of WDB as found in the real world. The work presented in this thesis aims to overcome the main limitations of the previous published research works on WDB. In particular, the following contributions are made. (1) We propose a new model of TDM-based single-cell WDB systems, which extends over both broadcast and unicast data retrieval principles, and assumes realistic-impatient user behaviour patterns. Based on this model, we define and derive exact mathematical expressions for several performance measures that seem most appropriate for the analysis of WDB systems. Consequently, we prove that there exists a single broadcast scheduling scheme (Soptimal), which can ensure the optimal system performance with respect to all of the measures at once, as well as the system's throughput, QoS and GoS. (2) The actual search for Soptimal, both in WDB systems of uniform and variable user mobilities, {{turns out to be a}} complex non-linear double inequality-constrained optimization problem, without a tractable closed-form solution. However, by exploiting some mathematical properties of the main cost function, we prove that the given optimization problem can be considerably simplified. Based on this simplification, we derive a closed form approximate expression for Soptimal and, consequently, we propose an algorithm for fast, CPU conserving estimation of Soptimal. Experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm requires minimum computation, while providing performance almost identical to Soptimal obtained through numerical estimation. (3) For the completeness of our discussion on single-cell WDB systems, we also consider the possibility of frequency-division-multiplexing (FDM) WDB. We prove that for any given FDM-based broadcast schedule there exists a TDM-based broadcast schedule that results in a better overall system performance. With this proof, we ultimately justify our initial decision to make TDM-WDB the main focus of this work. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
