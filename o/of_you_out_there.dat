2500|$|PlayStation Official Magazine {{gave the}} game an above-average 7 out of 10, complimenting the core {{shooting}} and production values, but criticizing its repetitive nature: [...] "A Star Wars-themed 3D shooter with some optional bounty hunting. Good fun, but it promised more." [...] IGN awarded the GameCube {{version of the}} game 8.3 out of 10, and the PS2 version 8.2. Praising the graphics, sound, length and level designs, they criticized {{the implementation of the}} bounty hunting system; [...] "The whole process is pretty clunky, and there should have been a way to streamline this to make it more fluid - especially in the heat of a battle when your mark is mixed in with four or five other opponents. It works the way it is for sure, but it certainly could have been fixed to be more intuitive than it currently is." [...] In the end, however, they found the game {{to be one of the}} better Star Wars tie-in games; [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter is a solid, if not technically challenged third-person action/adventure. Successfully combining our favorite aspects of the Star Wars universe with a clever stage design and a fantastic presentation, LucasArts has done a great job in suppressing the myth that games based on the Skywalker universe aren't any fun. A definite recommendation for Star Wars fans, Bounty Hunter isn't necessarily built for everyone, but for those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who just can't get enough of this stuff, it's one of your better choices for this or any holiday season." ...|$|E

5000|$|There is no {{definite}} {{explanation for}} {{the origin of the}} name. It has been speculated that it may have been called the Forty Foot after the 42nd Highland Regiment of Foot (now known as the Black Watch), a regiment of the British Army, which {{is said to have been}} stationed here. Other suggestions forwarded include the depth of the water (actually less than 40 feet) and the width of the road leading to the bathing place, while others still suggest it may be related to the amount <b>of</b> fun <b>you</b> have <b>out</b> <b>there..</b> as in [...] "this much fun". Another recent explanation of the etymology of the Forty Foot, is that many times people would converge upon the bathing place in groups of approximately 20 people, (or 40 feet).|$|R

The accompanying post read: [...]For all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> being bullied <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> This is me.

500|$|According to Rod Roddewig, a {{contemporary}} of Wilt's, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain {{went to bed}} with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a 10-day period, there were 23 checks in the book, {{which would be a}} rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence. In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later emphasized that [...] "the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's the reason why I was single." [...] In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate {{at the time of his}} escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: [...] "With all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> men <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." [...] Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children. However, in 2015 a man named Aaron Levi came forward claiming to be Chamberlain's son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain's sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi's claim is not conclusive.|$|R
