However, the nutrition {{of children in the}} region as a whole has degraded {{for the past ten years}} due to the increasing portion of underweight children in three populous nations - Iraq, Sudan, and Yemen. Forty six percent of all children in Yemen are underweight, a percentage that has worsened by 4% since 1990. In Yemen, 53% of children under five are stunted and 32% are born at low birth weight. Sudan has an underweight prevalence of 41%, and the highest proportion of wasted children in the region at 16%. One percent of households in Sudan consume iodized salt. Iraq has also seen an increase in child underweight since 1990. Djibouti, Jordan, the <b>Occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory</b> (<b>OPT),</b> Oman, the Syrian Arab Republic and Tunisia are all projected to meet minimum nutrition goals, with OPT, Syrian AR, and Tunisia the fastest improving regions.

The report also states that indiscriminate rocket attacks, as well as ill-treatment and extrajudicial execution of detainees by Palestinian armed groups, constitute violations of laws of war.

Finally, there are some internal policy-related factors that relate to the economic and social policies adopted by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). In general, we can argue that irregular migration is not evident as a phenomenon within the oPt, rather it characterizes displaced Palestinians.

30|$|The {{subjects}} {{of the present study}} are humanitarian workers working in an area referred variably to as the State of Palestine or the <b>occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territories</b> (<b>oPt).</b> As a modern political entity, the statehood of Palestine was first asserted in 1988, following decades of contestation following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire following World War I. Statehood was more recently re-enforced in 2012 as it was granted “non-member observer state” status by the United National General Assembly (United Nations, 2012). Since 1967, however, the discontinuous geographic areas of Palestine (including the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem) have been under military occupation or control by Israel. In January 2015, the State of Palestine accepted the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and, accordingly, ICC jurisdiction. Although beyond the immediate scope of the paper, the humanitarian and legal implications of defining the occupation and obligations under international law have been presented in a variety of forms (e.g., Cohen and Arieli 2005; Droege 2007; Gross 2007; Darcy and Reynolds 2010; Kretzmer 2012; Greenblatt 2014). Throughout the present paper, therefore, the term “Palestine” will be utilized in reference to the most recent United Nations and International Criminal Court recognized designations of the <b>occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territories</b> (Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem).|$|R

Methods: Based on a conceptual framework rooted in the Anderson behavioural model, we conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with purposely selected women and seven key informant interviews in three purposely selected villages in Ramallah district. Results: Our findings indicate that women delay seeking professional care, use self-prescribed medications and home treatment, and do not use preventive and educational health services. Their health seeking behaviour {{is the result of the}} interplay of several factors: their gendered socio-cultural role; their health beliefs; financial affordability and geographical accessibility; their perceptions of the quality of care; and their perceived health needs.

Nevertheless, political pressure by Western donor governments serves to constrain an approach to child protection that is more preventative in nature, that addresses more explicitly Israeli violations of international law, and that reflects the experience and aspirations of Palestinian children themselves. Ultimately, therefore, the failure to protect Palestinian children must be seen not only as a result of humanitarian miscalculation but also as a consequence of political strategy...|$|E
30|$|After 1967, when Israel assumed {{its control}} over the water {{resources}} in the <b>occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territories</b> (<b>OPT),</b> military orders were implemented rather than state legislation.

One of the main military orders in connection with water quality is the quota system which was implemented to prevent the groundwater deterioration caused by over exploitation. The inhabitants of the OPT suffered from the high demand but low supply of water. It is important to point out that, regardless of the attempts of Israel to control water, the legislation lead indirectly to protect the quantity of groundwater resources in the OPT. The Israeli authority redefined the concept of water pollution by adding to the Jordanian definition of pollutions caused by radiation and organic infection. They also maintained and upgraded the scientific-based laws generated during the British Mandate period. Moreover, they defined the activities that can lead to pollution and connected these activities to the appropriate legislation and punishment regulations.|$|R

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Paris Protocol on Economic Relations between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (1995) established the main features of the Palestinian economic policy framework and the economic policy instruments available to Palestinian decision makers upon the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA). As a result, the Paris Protocol has shaped the growth pattern of the <b>occupied</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territory</b> (<b>OPT),</b> polarizing the economic structure around the service sectors and further concentrating trade on one main trading partner (Israel). It has also served to increase the Palestinian economy's vulnerability by aggravating deep-seated structural weaknesses arising from occupation. Intensified movement restrictions by Israel in the OPT since September 2000 have further aggravated the Palestinian economy’s weakness and contributed to a prolonged economic crisis.

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP) {{has come to a}} deadlock. Recent turns within peace research towards critical approaches to peacebuilding, as opposed to the liberal peace paradigm, acknowledge the failure of state-oriented practices and advocate for, more or less sophisticated, attempts to capture the local dimension of peacebuilding.

It then looks at the EU’s involvement in the conflict and presents the tools that the EU uses in its support for civil society. Moving on, it analyses the impact and effectiveness of Israeli and Palestinian civil societies (with a view on CSO typologies and activities) and suggests why the effectiveness of civil society has remained limited.
