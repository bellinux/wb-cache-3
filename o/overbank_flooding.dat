40|$|International audienceThe need {{of models}} for {{heterogeneous}} reservoirs has stimulated {{the development of}} new models both process-based and stochastics. Such a model of fluvial meandering systems, developed at the school of Mines, is a comprehensive one. It comprises a realistic migration pattern of the channel centerline, (based on hydraulic studies) and reproduces event processes such as <b>overbank</b> <b>floods,</b> levee breaches, crevasse splays and avulsions. Various architectures are to be produced by changing frequency and intensity of <b>overbank</b> <b>floods</b> or avulsions, or by constraining the aggradation rate by an equilibrium profile. The number of parameters which rule the model has been kept limited: channel parameters, floodplain slope, frequency and intensity of other elements such as <b>overbank</b> <b>floods</b> and avulsions. In order to address the potential of such a modelling to field data, a study has been conducted on the Miocene Loranca formation (central Spain). This meandering succession is around 100 m thick. Channel depth is based on measurement of point-bar and channel-fill thicknesses, giving a mean value of 3. 5 m. The complex pattern of a meandering system makes difficult the estimation of the channel width from the outcrop. The channel width is thus estimated by using a classic hydraulic formula, (d= 24. 6 h 1. 45). The aggradation rate is controlled by <b>overbank</b> <b>floods</b> and avulsions. Evaluation of overbank intensity is based on the levee thicknesses (0. 43 m), characteristics of sheet flood deposits that show little decrease in thickness and grain size away from the channel. Levee breaches are attested by regular crevasse-splays. The rate of successful avulsions is taken at 2000 years, based on paleosol maturity stage and lateral extent of the point bars. Amongst the needed parameters, erodibility coefficient, floodplain slope and <b>overbank</b> <b>flood</b> frequency could not be directly inferred from the field. Erodibility coefficient and slope value are taken by default at 2 10 - 8 and 0. 001, respectively. Overbank frequency is adjusted to reproduce the N to G that varies between 16 and 37 % along the studied interval. These ratios could easily be obtained by changing the frequency of the <b>overbank</b> <b>floods</b> (from 190 to 600 iterations), while keeping the other parameters constant. Thus, the simulated 3 D block and the outcrop display similar sand bodies and facies distribution. A further step in the potential of the model is demonstrated through a conditional simulation, run with the on conditional parameters and using measured sections as wells. The number of iterations is very {{similar to that of the}} non conditional simulations, indicating that processes were respected during the conditional simulation, despite a 10 % relative increase in the N to G.

40|$|The channel {{boundary}} conditions along the Lower Yellow River (LYR) have been altered significantly since the 1950 s with the continual reinforcement {{and construction of}} both main and secondary dykes and river training works. To evaluate how the confined complex channel-floodplain system of the LYR responds to floods, this study presents a detailed investigation {{of the relationship between}} the tempo-spatial distribution of sedimentation/erosion and <b>overbank</b> <b>floods</b> occurred in the LYR. For large <b>overbank</b> <b>floods,</b> we found that when the sediment transport coefficient (ratio of sediment concentration of flow to flow discharge) is less than 0. 034, the bankfull channel is subject to significant erosion, while the main and secondary floodplains both accumulate sediment. The amount of sediment deposited on the main and secondary floodplains is closely related to the ratio ofpeak discharge to bankfull discharge, volume of water flowing over the floodplains and sediment concentration of overbank flow, while the degree of erosion in the bankfull channel is related to the amount of sediment deposited on the main and secondary floodplains, water volume and sediment load in flood season. The significant increase in erosion in the bankfull channel is due to the construction of the main and secondary dykes and river training works, which are largely in a wide and narrow alternated pattern along the LYR such that the water flowing over wider floodplains returns to the channel downstream after it drops sediment. For small <b>overbank</b> <b>floods,</b> the bankfull channel is subject to erosion when the sediment transport coefficient is less than 0. 028, while the amount of sediment deposited on the secondary floodplain is associated closely with the sediment concentration of flow. Over the entire length of the LYR, the situation of erosion in the bankfull channel and sediment deposition on the main and secondary floodplains occurred mainly in the upper reach of the LYR, in which a channel wandering in planform has been well developed...|$|R

Glacial lakes form when terminal moraines block water from escaping the newly carved valley from glacial erosion. As the glacier melts, the valley fills with melt water that creates a glacial lake.

40|$|The present paper aims to {{reconstruct}} the Lower Tagus Valley flooding history for the last ca. 6500 a, to explore the suitability of pollen-based local vegetation development in supporting the reconstruction of flooding history, and to explain fluvial activity changes in terms of allogenic (climate, human impact) and autogenic (system intrinsic) processes. The flooding history has been determined by cored sedimentary records located - 18 -km apart in distal, low-energy backswamps {{on both sides of}} the Tagus channel. In these low-energy backswamps, fine-grained sediment layers deposited from suspended load of <b>overbank</b> <b>flood</b> water reflect periods with multiple <b>overbank</b> <b>floods.</b> By means of a multi-proxy approach (sedimentology, magnetic susceptibility, grain size, loss-on-ignition, carbonate content and pollen), sedimentary and environmental changes were identified. At both sites, synchronous lithological intervals accumulated, suggesting a common origin for the changes in fluvial activity since ca. 6500 -cal. a BP. Based on lithological changes, three phases of high fluvial activity (6500 - 5500, 4900 - 3500 and 1000 - 0 -cal. a BP) and two phases of low fluvial activity (5500 - 4900 and 3500 - 1000 -cal. a BP) were identified. Two periods with dominant allogenic controls on fluvial activity in the Lower Tagus Valley were identified: relative sea level (6500 - 5500 -cal. a BP) and human impact (1000 - 0 -cal. a BP). During the intermediate period, changes in fluvial activity may have been caused by climate (5500 - 1000 -cal. BP), but unambiguous correlations are difficult to make. This is due to the way allogenic controls are translated through the fluvial system, the geomorphological differences between upstream and downstream studies and autogenic processes. The comparison of local vegetation development and flooding phases as reconstructed using sedimentology shows a limited added value of using local palynology as a proxy for fluvial activity. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

Campbell dam, which impounds nearly all river-borne sediment entering the reservoir (Tobin Lake) and modifies natural discharge fluctuations such that normally high spring and summer flows are significantly diminished. [...] Removal of sediment outflow by impoundment has caused enlargement of channels downstream of the dam and reduction of sediment-borne nutrients to the delta ecosystem. In addition, suppression of annual discharge peaks has reduced the frequency of <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding</b> and, consequently, the frequency at which water and nutrients are replenished in the delta wetlands. Reduction of peak flows to the delta is exacerbated by the Gardiner dam on the South Saskatchewan River whose impoundment, Lake Diefenbaker, is nearly five {{times larger than the}} Tobin Lake reservoir, with a commensurately larger influence on flow patterns in the SRD.

The Banducci family grew hay and flowers on a 170 acre parcel 1/2 mile upstream from the lagoon, and constructed levees along the right banks in 1948-1949 to prevent <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding.</b> These historical actions created an artificially-straight, constrained stream with relatively little habitat heterogeneity, nicknamed the “Bowling Alley” reach. The NPS acquired this property in 1980, with an agreement allowing the Banduccis to continue farming until 1995.

In 1967, Wheelwright donated the Muir Beach area to the California State Parks who built a large parking lot in the current location by the beach.

40|$|Restoration of {{floodplain}} ecosystems {{through the}} reinstatement of floods is often hampered by insufficient {{water as a}} result of competing human demands. An emerging alternative approach relies on floodplain infrastructure - such as levees, weirs, regulators, and pumps - to control water levels within floodplains without requiring landscape-scale <b>overbank</b> <b>floods.</b> This technique, albeit water efficient and capable of achieving some ecological targets, does not mimic the hydraulics, hydrodynamics, and lateral connectivity of natural floods. Engineering approaches like this may risk detrimental ecological outcomes, including reductions in biotic connectivity, river-floodplain productivity, and water quality, and thus may fail to support the range of ecological processes required to sustain healthy river-floodplain systems.

40|$|To restore lateral {{connectivity}} {{in highly}} regulated river-floodplain systems, {{it has become}} necessary to implement localized, "managed" connection flows, made possible using floodplain irrigation infrastructure. These managed flows contrast with "natural", large-scale, <b>overbank</b> <b>flood</b> pulses. We compared {{the effects of a}} managed and a natural connection event on (i) the composition of the large-bodied fish community and (ii) the structure of an endangered catfish population of a large floodplain lake. The change in community composition following the managed connection was not greater than that exhibited between seasons or years during disconnection. By contrast, the change in fish community structure following the natural connection was much larger than that attributed to background, within-and between-year variability during disconnection. Catfish population structure only changed significantly following the natural flood. While the natural flood increased various population rates of native fishes, it also increased those of non-native carp, a pest species. To have a positive influence on native biodiversity, environmental flows may need to be delivered to floodplains in a way that simulates the properties of natural flood pulses. A challenge, however, will be managing river-floodplain connectivity to benefit native more than non-native species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Forest {{vegetation}} patterns {{alongside the}} Poerua River, south Westland, were studied {{to determine whether}} a distinct riparian community could be defined either immediately adjacent to the river, or out to the limit of <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding.</b> Ten randomly located 100 m transects were established perpendicular to the river at each of two sites. Ground cover of alluvial sediment indicated that annual <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding</b> occurred up to 20 m into the forest (the flood zone). No significant difference in vascular plant species richness was found between the flood zone and non-flood zone at either site, however a significant difference in species richness was found between sites, and this was attributed to recent disturbance at the edge of one site. Detrended correspondence analysis separated plots by site and indicated a gradient of species change from the river’s edge {{to the ends of the}} transects. There were inconsistent differences in the densities and/or basal areas of trees and shrubs between sites and zones. No distinct band of vegetation was recognizable as a riparian zone alongside the Poerua River.

The Labasa basin is commercially important for sugarcane farming, which provides much revenue and sustains {{the economy in the}} greater Labasa area. Alluvium was sampled at three riverbank sites in vertical increments of 30 mm. Measured net vertical accretion rates, based on analysis of depth-profiles of 137 Cs activity, ranged from 10 mm yr− 1 at a low-lying site near a tributary confluence with the main river, to 60 mm yr− 1 on a levée that was elevated slightly above the adjacent floodplain. These rates of accretion are high, but in general agreement with rates recorded using similar methods in other tropical Pacific island river systems.

50|$|The {{landscape}} of Kilnwick owes much to its history as an Estate, having been described, {{at the time}} of its sale in 1951, as 'one of the finest shoots in Yorkshire'. The 1951 sales brochure drew attention particularly to the ‘bag’ of game that had been got over the six years since the end of the Second World War. Because of its history, it is exceptionally well endowed with woodland, which stems from the use of coverts for rearing game birds. Within a mile of the village centre, there are six sizeable linear plantations: Wedding Wood, West Belt, High Wood, East Belt, Low Wood and Stonybroke, each of which serve to give the impression of a well-wooded landscape. Given its low-lying position, and its diminutive church tower, Kilnwick is not easy to spot until a visitor is within the ring of woodland that surrounds it, and the density of trees is in stark contrast to the oft-treeless arable land of the Wolds to the north and west and Holderness to the east. Unlike Lockington, which lies directly alongside its beck (much to its cost in the floods of July 2007), Kilnwick sits on a low river terrace and so avoids <b>overbank</b> <b>floods</b> that emanate from its own highly regulated beck.

40|$|Accounting for {{groundwater}} recharge from <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding</b> {{is required to}} reduce uncertainty and error in river loss terms and groundwater sustainable yield calculations. However, continental and global scale models of surface water–groundwater interactions rarely include an explicit process to account for overbank flood recharge (OFR). This paper upscales previously derived analytical equations to a continental scale using national soil atlas data and satellite imagery of flood inundation, resulting in recharge maps for seven hydrologically distinct Australian catchments. Recharge for three of the catchments was validated against independent recharge estimates from bore hydrograph responses and one catchment was additionally validated against point scale recharge modelling and catchment scale change in groundwater storage. Flood recharge was predicted for four of the seven catchments modelled, {{but there was also}} unexplained recharge present from the satellite flood inundation mapping data. At a catchment scale, recharge from <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding</b> was somewhat under predicted using the analytical equations, but there was good confidence in the spatial patterns of flood recharge produced. Due to the scale of the input data, there were no significant relationships found when compared at a point scale. Satellite derived flood inundation data and uncertainty in soil maps were the key limitations to the accuracy of the modelled recharge. Use of this method to model OFR was found to be appropriate at a catchment to continental scale, given appropriate data sources. The proportion of OFR was found to be at least 4 % of total change in groundwater storage in one of the catchments for the period modelled, and at least 15 % of the riparian recharge. Accounting for OFR is an important, and often overlooked, requirement for closing water balances in both the surface water and groundwater domains...|$|E
40|$|Spring pulse {{releases}} for {{the benefit}} of the endangered pallid sturgeon were planned for March and May 2009 to mimic historic natural spring rises that occurred on the Missouri River before the closure of the main stem dams. The March spring pulse from Gavins Point Dam was not released in 2009 due to high downstream flows and the possibility of flow-limit violations. A 6. 1 -kcfs May spring pulse was released in 2009. The May spring pulse was monitored at 44 sites along the Missouri River. Nineteen of these were interior-drainage sites that were monitored for possible socioeconomic impacts to landowners. Socioeconomic impacts include gate closures, pumping, and <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding.</b> To help identify socioeconomic impacts, berm and field elevations were surveyed near the installed gages in March 2009 to better characterize possible <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding.</b> The location of the created spring pulse in the record was determined through the use of travel times from Gavins Point Dam. The 2009 May spring pulse created no socioeconomic impacts at any of the monitored sites. A flow attenuation rate was estimated for the May 2009 spring pulse using observed flow records at eight main stem gages along the Missouri River. The 6. 1 -kcfs spring pulse was estimated to attenuate at a rate of 1. 1 kcfs for every 100 river miles in May 2009. The observed May 2009 spring pulse was 1. 5 kcfs at Kansas City, MO and is estimated to have attenuated by 77 %. Similar results were determined for the 4. 5 -kcfs March 2008 spring pulse in the 2008 monitoring report. The March 2008 spring pulse attenuated at a rate of 1. 1 kcfs for every 100 river miles and was not distinguishable by Kansas City, MO. A stage attenuation rate was also estimated for the May 2009 spring pulse. In general, the 1. 8 -ft May 2009 spring pulse attenuated at an approximate rate of 0. 4 ft for every 100 river miles. This analysis was also completed for the March 2008 and May 2006 spring pulses. The 1. 5 -ft March 2008 spring pulse attenuated at a rate of 0. 4 ft for every 100 river miles, and the 2. 7 -ft May 2006 spring pulse attenuated at a rate of 0. 3 ft for every 100 river miles. Flow reductions were made from dams tributary to the Missouri River to eliminate the created spring rise below Kansas City, MO. This reduction lowered the stage of the created spring rise. A stage change due to the created spring rise is still visible below Kansas City, MO, but the created spring rise is effectively reduced in elevation. The effects of additional natural-spring rises were monitored at each site to help quantify flows that would result in landowner impacts. Where socioeconomic impacts (i. e. gate closures, pumping, and <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding)</b> did occur due to these flows, the duration of the impacts and impact-flow thresholds were estimated. Impact-flow thresholds are flows in the Missouri River at the river mile of the impacted site when the stage over the sensor of the gage becomes high enough to cause gate closures, pumping, or <b>overbank</b> <b>flooding</b> at a site. The durations of high flows in the Missouri River in 2009 were much shorter than they were in 2008. The 2008 record experienced a long duration large rise that began in late May and continued through mid-June or early July depending on the river location. In contrast, the 2009 record experienced several shorter duration rises scattered throughout the record. Table 1 summarizes the results for the 2006, 2008, and 2009 monitoring periods. Natural spring rise results are not shown for 2006 because only the spring pulse was monitored that year. Figure E 1 shows the sites impacted by natural spring rises in 2009 and 2008 plotted by their RM locations along the Missouri River and the estimated flows in the Missouri River at the sites that resulted in gage closures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExchanges between {{surface water}} (SW) and {{groundwater}} (GW) are of considerable importance to flood- plain ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Flood events {{in particular are}} important for riparian water budget and element exchanges and processing. However SW-GW exchanges present complex spatial and temporal patterns and modelling can provide useful knowledge about the processes involved at {{the scale of the}} reach and its adjacent floodplain. This study used a physically-based, spatially-distributed mod- elling approach for studying SW-GW exchanges. The modelling in this study is based on the MOHID Land model, combining the modelling of surface water flow in 2 D with the Saint-Venant equation and the modelling of unsaturated groundwater flow in 3 D with the Richards’ equation. Overbank flow dur- ing floods was also integrated, as well as water exchanges between the two domains across the entire floodplain. Conservative transport simulations were also performed to study and validate the simulation of the mixing between surface water and groundwater. The model was applied to the well-monitored study site of Monbéqui (6. 6 km ²) in the Garonne floodplain (south-west France) for a five-month period and was able to represent the hydrology of the study area. Infiltration (SW to GW) and exfiltration (SW to GW) were characterised over the five-month period. Results showed that infiltration and exfiltration exhibited strong spatiotemporal variations, and infiltration from overbank flow accounted for 88 % of the total simulated infiltration, corresponding to large flood periods. The results confirmed that <b>overbank</b> <b>flood</b> events played a determinant role in floodplain water budget and SW-GW exchanges compared to smaller (below bankfull) flood events. The impact of floods on water budget appeared to be similar for flood events exceeding a threshold corresponding to the five-year return period event due to the study area’s topography. Simulation of <b>overbank</b> flow during <b>flood</b> events was an important feature in the ac- curate assessment of exchanges between surface water and groundwater in floodplain areas, especially when considering large flood events...|$|R
40|$|A multi-proxy {{approach}} {{was used to}} examine the geomorphic dynamics and environmental history of an upper deltaic floodplain tract in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta, California. Three long cores were collected from the McCormack– Williamson Tract (MWT) and these cores were analyzed for bulk density, loss-on-ignition, fine (clay and silt) content, Al concentration, magnetic susceptibility, pollen, and charcoal. Radiocarbon dates obtained for the cores were converted into calendar years and an age–depth model was constructed. Long-term vertical accretion and sedimentation rates were estimated from the age–depth model. Cross-core relations show that coarse sediment generally accumulates more rapidly and has greater magnetic susceptibility compared to fine sediment. Percentage fine and LOI data show a strong linear relationship that indicates flooding is the primary mechanism for the deposition of particular organic matter on the floodplain and that landscape wash load has contributed a highly consistent fraction of persistent organic matter averaging 5 · 5 per cent to the site. Down-core grain size profiles show two hydrological domains in the cores, namely millennial fine–coarse fluctuations superimposed on general up-core fining. Coarse sediment is viewed as channel or near-channel overbank deposits, whereas fine deposits are considered to be distal <b>overbank</b> <b>flood</b> deposits. The coarse–fine fluctuations are indicative of changing depositional settings as channels migrated laterally across MWT, whereas the upward fining trend reflects a combination of self-limiting overbank deposition as floodplain elevation increased and decreasing competence as sea-level rise reduce...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Palaeochannels have {{numerous}} {{deleterious effects}} on coal mining including {{the formation of}} 'washouts', and their detection and delineation in the subsurface is of paramount importance. A palaeochannel system in {{the roof of the}} High Hazles Coal (Westphalian B) at Gedling Colliery, Nottinghamshire, is described. The roof strata of this seam are interpreted as the deposits of a lacustrine delta complex formed on an upper delta plain, with the palaeochannels constituting minor deltaic distributaries. The lacustrine delta front deposits consist of a coarsening-upwards sequence of siltstones and sandstones, which form a sheet-like body of coalescing distributary mouth bars that were laid down by friction-dominated effluents. The distributary channels were filled by a variety of processes, giving rise to complex channel deposits. Bedload deposition of sand on bars, collapse and sloughing of channel banks, and deposition of silts and muds from suspension were important mechanisms. The nature of the deposits reflects the mode of channel abandonment, rather than equilibrium channel processes. <b>Overbank</b> <b>flood</b> deposits and prodelta/lacustrine mudstones are also described from the High Hazles roof. Based on this study, criteria are suggested that may enable the successful detection and delineation of palaeochannels in mine workings elsewhere. Palaeochannels are features of many coal-bearing sequences that may have adverse effects on mining. Coal companies world-wide recognize the risks imposed by palaeochannels, and thus take steps to delineate their positions in order to minimize their effects on coal mining (e. g. Clarke 1963...|$|R
