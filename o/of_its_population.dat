5|$|Extinction is {{the result}} of the {{elimination}} of the geographic range of a species with a reduction <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> size down to zero.

5|$|At the 2011 census, Manitoba had a {{population}} of 1,208,268, {{more than half of}} which is in the Winnipeg Capital Region; Winnipeg is Canada's eighth-largest Census Metropolitan Area, with {{a population}} of 730,018 (2011 Census). Although initial colonization of the province revolved mostly around homesteading, the last century has seen a shift towards urbanization; Manitoba is the only Canadian province with over fifty-five percent <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> located in a single city.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, {{the canal}} running through Rosendale had closed. On July5, 1911, the Jacob Rutsen house {{was hit by}} {{lightning}} and destroyed in a severe storm. The increased industrial use of Portland cement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was detrimental to Rosendale's economy, and the village lost almost 70percent <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> between 1900 and 1920; only one cement factory remained open after 1920. In April 1923, the Rosendale railroad depot and its freight house were destroyed in a fire.|$|E
5|$|Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is {{the largest}} {{surviving}} single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population)</b> within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, {{followed}} {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E

5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the {{peppered}} maskray is a bottom-dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter {{sizes of}} one to three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the peppered maskray is a frequent bycatch of bottom trawl fisheries, it is still common and significant portions <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Jifna {{experienced}} {{a wave of}} emigration, with about half <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> leaving the town to pursue better livelihoods elsewhere. The first census carried by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) shows that Jifna had a population of 961, of whom 623 (64.8%) were classified as refugees in 1997. The gender distribution was 465 males (48.4%) and 494 females (51.6%). The age distribution was: Under 15, 330 (34%); 15–29, 275 (29%); 30–65, 304 (32%); Over 65, 50 (5%).|$|E
5|$|In 2011 (the {{last year}} for which {{information}} is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole. While the United States had 13.3% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> over the age of 65, Phoenix's percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45–64 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results in 73% of Phoenix's population being 44 or younger, as compared to the national percentage of 60.|$|E

5000|$|Europe has had {{a number}} of {{languages}} that were considered linguae francae over some ranges for some periods according to some historians. Typically in the rise of a national language the new language becomes a lingua franca to peoples in the range of the future nation until the consolidation and unification phases. If the nation becomes internationally influential, its language may become a lingua franca among nations that speak their own national languages. Europe has had no lingua franca ranging over its entire territory spoken by all or most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>populations</b> during any historical period.

5|$|Lewisville's {{consistently}} warm {{climate and}} proximity to Lewisville Lake {{have made it}} a recreational hub of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The city's municipal government, led by a nonpartisan city council, focuses its recreational and cultural investments on facilities such as Toyota of Lewisville Park and the MCL Grand Theater. The area's transportation infrastructure has evolved around the I-35 Corridor along Interstate 35E. The diversity <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> and industry has created a stable economic climate. Lewisville Independent School District provides most of the area's public education programs.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's cuisine {{reflects}} the multi-ethnic makeup <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population.</b> Many cultures {{from within the}} country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, {{largely due to the}} country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.|$|E

50|$|Symphyotrichum depauperatum is {{classified}} {{by the state}} of Pennsylvania as a threatened species because its range is restricted to a few limited areas, and the majority <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>populations</b> occur on sites threatened by quarrying, housing and industrial development.|$|R

25|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of this species}} is controversial; it may include B. leucurus and B. moojeni, and some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>populations</b> are sometimes said to be separate species. B. asper was formerly included in this species, but most authorities now consider it distinct.|$|R
5|$|Perhaps 10 {{per cent}} of the {{population}} lived in the burghs that {{had grown up in}} the later medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. They perhaps had an average population of 2,000, but many were much smaller than 1,000, and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} period. Edinburgh doubled in size in the century after 1540, particularly after the plague of 1580, with most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> probably coming from a growing reservoir in the surrounding countryside. It also expanded beyond the city walls in suburbs at Cowgate, Bristo and Westport and by 1750, with its suburbs, it had reached a population of 57,000. The only other towns above 10,000 by the end of the period were Glasgow with 32,000, Aberdeen with around 16,000 and Dundee with 12,000. By 1600 Scotland had a higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> living in larger towns than contemporaneous Scandinavia, Switzerland and most of Eastern Europe: by 1750 in Europe, only Italy, the Low Countries and England were more urbanised than Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the alpine}} pika has been rated {{a species of}} least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it is widespread, with no known {{population}} decline. Despite the lack of data relating to its current population state, it {{is thought to have}} a stable trend, with some isolated populations exhibiting some variation. It has been regionally red-listed in China and Mongolia as a species of least concern, and about 12% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> in Mongolia is found in protected areas.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the status}} of the Ethiopian hare has beendata {{deficient}} on theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is because even though it is widespread species, very little is known about its status and ecology. The current state <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>population</b> trend is unclear. There are no known threats to the species. It occurs in the Abijatta-Shalla National Park and the Gambela National Park. It has also been found in the Baroye Controlled Hunting Area.|$|E
