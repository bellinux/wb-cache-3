The possibility of using a constant temperature underground geothermal water source, which flows naturally, has been studied as an economic option to solve these problems.

The results of tests carried out during 3 years are presented. These results are really promising, taking into account the high benefit/cost relation of the design and the availability of similar geothermal resources in many farms of this region.

40|$|Abstract. Rural {{populations in}} Australia are in decline and rural farm {{businesses}} now endure chronic labour shortages. Livestock enterprises traditionally requiremore labour than their cropping counterparts and this threatens future increases in their intensity and scale. The influence that labour scarcity {{has on the}} profitability of mixed-farming systems in the Central Wheatbelt of Western Australia is investigated in this study. When labour supply {{is assumed to be}} non-limiting, perennial plants are profitable where their <b>out-of-season</b> <b>production</b> sustains a sizeable breeding flock in a prime-lamb enterprise. However, when labour supply is limited and labour demand is defined as a function of enterprise mix, cropping activity increases and livestock production decreases. In addition, the proportion of the farm plantedwith perennial pasture declines. This has implications for natural resource management, with perennial pasture helping to prevent soil erosion, decrease waterlogging, and reduce recharge to saline watertables. Efforts to improve the labour efficiency of livestock production are therefore highly pertinent if perennial pastures are to offset land degradation on a broader scale...|$|E

In fact, sheep and goat milk production in the Mediterranean basin is mostly based on pasture utilization and thus follows the pasture availability pattern. This causes a strong seasonal pattern to the amount of milk processed by cheese processes plants, with the peak being in the spring, a marked reduction in early summer and nil or low availability of milk from August to October–November (autumn). In this paper, the reproduction cycles and managerial tech- niques that can be applied in the Mediterranean environment to reduce or eliminate the seasonality of milk production are discussed. The use of the “ram effect” {{at the end of the}} anoestrous season and light treatment can be effective and simple tools to maintain milk yield in the summer period. However, even if sheep and goats are considered to be among the most heat-tolerant species, the exposure to high ambient temperatures has a detri- mental impact on their production and reproductive performances, immune function and udder health. The use of effective nutritional strategies, the provision of shaded areas and adequate housing density could then reduce the heat stress...|$|R
40|$|In Atlantic salmon, the {{preadaptation}} to {{a marine}} life, i. e., parr-smolt transformation, and melatonin {{production in the}} pineal gland are regulated by the photoperiod. However, the clock genes have never been studied in the pineal gland of this species. The aim {{of the present study}} was to describe the diurnal expression of clock genes (Per 1 -like, Cry 2, and Clock) in the pineal gland and brain of Atlantic salmon parr and smolts in freshwater, as well as plasma levels of melatonin and cortisol. By employing an <b>out-of-season</b> smolt <b>production</b> model, the parr-smolt transformation was induced by subjecting triplicate groups of parr to 6 wks (wks 0 to 6) under a 12 h: 12 h light-dark (LD) regime followed by 6 wks (wks 6 to 12) of continuous light (LL). The measured clock genes in both pineal gland and brain and the plasma levels of melato-nin and cortisol showed significant daily variations in parr under LD in wk 6, whereas these rhythms were abolished in smolts under LL in wk 12. In parr, the pineal Per 1 -like and Cry 2 expression peaked in the dark phase, whereas the pineal Clock expression was elevated during the light phase. Although this study presents novel findings on the clock gene system in the teleost pineal gland, the role of this system in the regulation of smoltification needs to be studied in more detail.

40|$|Herbage {{production}} and utilization on Irish dairy farms is well below its potential. A {{number of factors}} influence herbage {{production and}} utilization, not least the level of annual reseeding (introduction of a new grass ley) on the farm. The potential farm performance is reduced by old permanent pasture due to the combined effects of reduced <b>out-of-season</b> herbage <b>production</b> and lower overall herbage yield when compared to perennial ryegrass. Based on the sales of grass seed, {{it is estimated that}} approximately 2 % of the land area on dairy farms in Ireland is reseeded annually. This has created a situation where the overall percentage of perennial ryegrass in sward is low. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the economic benefits of reseeding through simulating the consequences of reseeding different proportions of the farm on an annual basis. Four levels of an annual reseeding programme were evaluated: 1 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % of the farm reseeded annually; evaluated at three milk prices (20 c/L, 27 c/L and 33 c/L). Increasing the level of reseeding resulted in an increase in total and seasonal herbage production and, when accompanied by an increased stocking rate, increased herbage utilization. At a milk price of 27 c/L, farm profitability was € 20 764, € 24 794, € 30 073 and € 33 515 on a 40 ha farm when 1 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 %, respectively, of the farm was reseeded annually. Irrespective of milk price, increasing the level of reseeding had a positive effect on profitability and the highest gain was achieved at the highest milk price. Sensitivity analysis showed that sward persistency and, to a lesser extent, herbage utilization had significant effects on the benefit from reseeding. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate ewe and lamb performance in an accelerated lamb production system, and to compare the performance and lamb output between a conventional and an accelerated lamb production system. In the “Conventional” system, ewes were bred in March to lamb in August. The “Accelerated” system was based on the “STAR” system (Lewis et al., 1996), in which there were five breeding periods within each year. In the current experiment these were 14 th January, 28 th March, 9 th June, 21 st August and 2 nd November. Progesterone was used to synchronise the breeding periods and during the non-breeding season, eCG was used to induce reproductive activity. Lambing began on each of these dates and weaning was 73 days later, coinciding with the next breeding period. The experiment ran over a three-year period beginning with breeding in March 2003 and was complete with the weaning of lambs from the January 2006 -bred ewes. This resulted in 15 lambing and breeding periods over the three years in the Accelerated system and three lambing and breeding periods in the Conventional system. Average pregnancy rates were lower in the Accelerated system than in the Conventional system. Lamb growth rates were similar between the two systems, although lamb live weights at weaning were lower in the Accelerated system due to the age of the lambs at weaning (average = 69 vs 96 days). More lambs were born and weaned, resulting in more kilograms of lamb weaned in the Accelerated system relative to the Conventional system over the experimental period (26, 200 vs 24, 300 kg). Labour input was 35 % higher in the Accelerated system, or 13 % higher per lamb weaned. Average annual ewe energy requirements were 6 % higher in the Accelerated system. Ewe energy requirements per kilogram of lamb weaned was lower (6 %) in the Accelerated system due to more breeding and lambing periods per ewe per year. Laparoscopic observation of ewes’ ovaries at each breeding period revealed that most ewes had active ovaries and were therefore capable of successfully producing a viable foetus. In a subsequent experiment, blood samples were collected for analysis of progesterone concentrations from ewes bred during the spring and autumn breeding periods. Observations of data indicated that a small number of ewes conceived and lost their conceptus, or had abnormal corpora lutea. Results suggested that pregnancies were failing due to a lack of an appropriate signal from the embryo to the dam/uterus. Exposing Romney ewes to an artificial lighting regimen was unsuccessful for inducing reproductive activity during spring. In another experiment, melatonin implants administered to Romney ewes in spring and used in conjunction with eCG and progesterone, resulted in 61 % more lambs born per ewe treated, compared to eCG and progesterone alone. This result indicated that melatonin implants, used with eCG and progesterone may be a suitable method for improving reproductive performance in sheep bred out of season in New Zealand. Delaying weaning of lambs and breeding lactating ewes can be used to obtain heavier lamb weaning weights in the Accelerated system. Spring-bred ewes had lambs weaned at either 69 days post partum or 90 days post partum. Reproductive performance was similar between the two groups of ewes, and lamb live weights in the later weaned group were heavier when lambs were 90 and 120 days of age. This research has shown that accelerated or <b>out-of-season</b> lamb <b>production</b> is an option for some New Zealand sheep farmers. However, the mechanisms associated with reproductive seasonality and methods of successfully circumventing this seasonality require further attention in order to achieve optimum reproductive performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate <b>out-of-season</b> lamb <b>production</b> in the lower North Island of New Zealand. Ewes representing three crosses (Border Leicester x Romney (BR), Poll Dorset x BR (PBR) and Suffolk x BR (SBR)) and three birth years were reared, under commercial farming conditions, to enter an out-of-season lambing experiment. Suffolk x BR hoggets had significantly (P < 0. 01) heavier 1 6 month liveweights than PBR or BR hoggets. There were inconsistent differences in liveweight between PBR and BR ewe hoggets. Border Leicester x Romney hoggets produced more (P < 0. 01) greasy wool at the yearling shearing than PBR or SBR hoggets. The same sheep were then assigned to one of two lambing policies (June or August) at their 2 -year-old mating and remained within that policy while they were evaluated for their 2 -year-old (1987, 1988, 1989) and 3 -year-old (1988, 1989, 1990) lambing performance. Lambing policy did not influence the proportion of mated ewes that lambed but there were more (P < 0. 05) multiple births in the August-lambing ewes. Birth weights and weaning weights of the June-born lambs were significantly (P < 0. 00 1) lower than those of their August-born counterparts. June-lambing ewes produced more (P < 0. 00 1) wool (on average by 0. 5 kg) than August-lambing ewes. Border Leicester x Romney ewes produced more (P < 0. 00 1) greasy wool per year (by 0. 7 to 1. 2 kg) than PBR ewes while PBR ewes outperformed SBR ewes (by 0. 3 to 0. 5 kg) for annual greasy wool production. Reproductive differences between the ewe crosses were small and non-significant, although PBR ewes reared the heaviest lambs. In an attempt to determine when the extra wool growth occurred in June-lambing compared to August-lambing ewes, six-weekly midside patch wool growth measurements were taken throughout a 1 2 -month period on a sample of the same three ewe crosses described earlier. lt was found that the seasonal decline in wool growth rate that normally occurs over the winter months in August lambing ewes was minimised in June-lambing ewes. Associated with this effect was a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in mean fibre diameter and an increase in staple strength at the following October shearing in June-lambing ewes. The next experiment was designed to determine the relationships between sward surface height, intake and production for lactating June-lambing ewes. The organic matter intake (OMI) of June-lambing ewes was not influenced by a range (2. 6 - 7. 8 cm) of sward surface heights (SSH) during week 3 of lactation. Between weeks 4 and 7 of lactation, ewe OMI increased up to a SSH of 7. 8 cm while in week 8 of lactation there was no increase in OMI between ewes grazing 4. 4 or 7. 8 cm swards. Sward surface height had no effect on ewe midside wool growth, mean fibre diameter or lamb growth but ewes on the 2. 6 cm sward lost 8 - 1 0 kg more liveweight during lactation than those on the 4. 4 and 7. 8 cm swards. These results suggest that June-lambing ewes in good condition can maintain lamb growth at low (2 - 3 cm) SSH but at the expense of ewe l iveweight loss. The final trial investigated the effect of SSH on ewe intake and performance during the last month of pregnancy in June- and August-lambing ewes. Ewe OMI, condition score and liveweight gain increased as SSH increased from 2. 0 to 8. 0 cm. There was no effect of SSH on ewe m idside wool growth, mean fibre diameter or lamb birth weights. June-born lambs were significantly (P < 0. 05) lighter at birth than August-born lambs across all SSH treatments. At the same SSH, Junelambing pregnant ewes achieved similar OMI to those of August-lambing ewes. The results of these studies are discussed in the context of the development of out-of-season lambing systems for the lower North Island of New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|A {{long-established}} Asian {{system of}} agricultural production offers solutions {{to two of}} Africa's most intractable problems: decline in per capital food production and declining soil fertility. It is the integration of crop, livestock and fish production; agro-pisciculture. The various forms {{of the system and}} their application in African conditions was the subject of an international seminar in May that was organized by CTA and the Belgian Royal Academy of Overseas Sciences with the collaboration of the FAO. The Brussels venue attracted participants from China, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, all countries with many years (sometimes centuries) of experience of fish farming practices, and from African countries where pisciculture is a more recent introduction and where good progress is being made. Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, C 4 te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe were all able to share experiences and there were experts from several EU countries, and from the International Centre for Living Aquatic Resource Management (ICLARM). Fish is a popular food almost everywhere in Africa but marine catches are falling while production from inland waters has reached, and perhaps passed, its peak of production. FAO estimates that by 2000 demand for fish will outstrip supply in Africa by 1. 7 million tonnes annually. It is apparent that farmed fish cannot be expected to make good the shortage, yet agro-pisciculture offers many benefits, some of which may well exceed the simple value of the fish harvested. The water stored in farm ponds can be used to extend crop production into dry seasons, thereby increasing total production and attracting premium prices for <b>out-of-season</b> produce; increased <b>production</b> also provides by-products for feeding livestock; livestock manures added to ponds feed aquatic plants and animals that in turn feed the fish; and finally, the mud that accumulates in ponds can be used to provide fertility to crop land, particularly for fruits and vegetables. Just as the integration of trees into crop and livestock production on farms (agroforestry) has provided benefits that reflect a synergy between the various elements, similarly agro-pisciculture can be seen to offer farmers more than just fish as an extra farm crop. Fish farming was introduced to several African countries in the 1950 s and early 1960 s, but after a short period it failed. If agro-pisciculture is to succeed now, it must avoid the omissions and mistakes of the past, which include too great an emphasis on fish production and expectation of high yields of fish; the lack of assured fingerling supplies for farmers to restock ponds; ineffective training of farmers in the integration of fish ponds into their existing farming systems and other socio-economic errors. Now, FAO is actively promoting agro-pisciculture in the SADC countries through the Aquaculture for Local Community (ALCOM) development programme while CIRAD is active in much of francophone Africa and ICLARM in Ghana and Malawi. Many West African countries (anglophone and francophone) are also benefiting from the demonstration and teaching of integrated agro-pisciculture at the Songhai Centre, Porto Novo, Benin. The Songhai Centre is an African NGO and has two sites where the system is part of a range of sustainable, low-input food production techniques developed, in or modified for, African conditions. What is remarkable about agro-pisciculture is not that it produces large amounts of fish: in fact, the yield of fish may be quite modest. Much greater benefits come from the contribution that the pond water and mud make to maintaining soil fertility and increasing yields. Also, the increased consumption of fish, fruit and vegetables improves the quality of diets and can also add to incomes if surplus production is sold. The proceedings of the seminar will be published in due course and their availability will be announced in Spore. international seminar in May 1994 in Brussels that was organized by CTA and the Belgian Royal Academy of Overseas Sciences with the collaboration of the FA...|$|R
40|$|A major {{operation}} to promote out-of-season crops {{was established in}} 1984 in Niger to help people overcome {{the worst of the}} drought It generated considerable popular support: many government agencies and departments, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and agricultural officials all coordinated their efforts in order that the most appropriate sites for such crops could be identified and used. Foreign aid, such as that from UNICEF, the World Bank, the European Development Fund, the French Cooperation Ministry, and the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique, helped to finance the operation, notably for the necessary inputs such as seeds and the improvement of water sources for irrigation. At the same time, other drought-stricken countries in the Sahel also launched intensive programmes to develop out-of-season crops. Such cultivation is now considered to be the best way of exploiting groundwater sources whose often hidden potential has only lately been recognized. After operating for two years, a preliminary evaluation can now be made of this approach. When first launched in Niger, its promoters not only saw it as a means to deal with the immediate crisis but also as part of a long-term development process. But with the return of more or less ~ normal rainfall patterns, have these crops been abandoned as emergency measures that are no longer necessary ? Or have they been integrated as part of the permanent farming practices in the regions concerned ? Although this type of out-of-season cultivation is often associated by many with Niger, it is not restricted to this country. In Senegal, market gardens flourish even in the dry season. In Mali, government programmes have strived for years to diminish climatic risks by promoting <b>out-of-season</b> vegetable <b>production.</b> But in Niger the 'renaissance' of this kind of cultivation was particularly innovative and well organized. At the same time, the drought {{over the past few years}} also tended to bring to the fore a form of traditional cultivation, practised mostly by women, that had never been given much importance. Over the last two years, the amount of land used for out-of-season crops increased by between two and three fold in some of these countries. In Niger, for example, it is estimated that 62, 000 ha were under out-ofseason crops in 1985 as opposed to only 29, 000 ha in 1983. It is still too soon to say whether such crops will be maintained or whether they will regress, despite the improved climatic conditions. It seems clear, however, that integrating an emergency measure into the normal farming routine raises several questions that must be addressed if out-of-season cropping is to continue. Out-of-season crops were launched during a crisis when emergency conditions overruled normal economic and technological considerations. Now regarded as a long-term option under normal conditions, these crops are no longer cost-effective. Once seen as miracle solutions during the drought, out-ofseason crops must now be evaluated under more objective economic, social and technological conditions. In Niger, the cost of the operation begun in 1984 reached $US 2. 4 million for a production between 30 - 40, 000 tonnes. One of the major operating costs was that for water supply which, although variable, was always significant. For the moment, the contribution to producers' income is moderate. If intensified, modernized and extended, these crops could in the long term show their worth and justify the investment that they now demand. For they are not only a solution to replace unreliable rain-fed cereal crops but also a source of supplementary income. Coming as they do during the dry season, which is generally a period of low agricultural activity in the Sahel, they prolong the working season. Out-ofseason production, an important source of supplementary food, thus generates income during a period when other sources have dried up. Even if the sale of such produce rarely generates significant income (except for those who specialize in export crops or in supplying cities from peri-urban areas), such revenue becomes important because of its timing. It provides much needed cash during the off-season and enables farmers to have a more regular source of income. Many were very interested in this aspect and asked the appropriate agencies to help them develop such crops. Certain individuals even took the initiative themselves to dig deep wells and to improve their plots, more or less successfully. But with other people, there was some reluctance to adopt a practice being promoted by a government agency. This shows the need for extension and community development work so that out-of-season cultivation can become a community-based initiative rather than a government project. Among the reasons for hesitation insofar as subsistence cultivators are concerned, is the resistance to change food habits. In the absence of millet, people are obliged to incorporate leafy green vegetables, carrots, radishes and tomatoes in their diet. But when there is no shortage of millet, what can be done to encourage the continued consumption of these complementary foodstuffs ? Nutritionists believe western vegetables improve the local diet, but more promotional work is needed to deal with resistance caused by lack of familiarity. A movement currently underway, however, tends to favour the distribution of seeds for local crops, such as cowpeas, cassava, onions and sorghum, which can also be grown under irrigation during the dry season. As for out-of-season cash crops, they are much more difficult to develop. One cannot transform a subsistence garden plot into a commercial operation without overcoming many barriers. In order to sell produce, there must be a market. But such a market does not yet exist for such products. The gardens produce the same supplies that already swamp the markets. Another problem is the lack of infrastructure for the transportation and distribution of such perishable products: certain markets are undersupplied while others are oversupplied. Because they are isolated and poorly informed about market conditions, market gardeners are unable to gear their production to demand. Information flow should be improved to avoid wastage and to ensure that they benefit as much as possible from their work. An intermediary solution to this problem would be to store, dry, preserve and process such products on-site. Research in this field has already produced some results: most of this produce can be dried, primarily with solar enerav. The process consists of extracting the water from the product in order to block degradation caused by enzyme action and oxidation and to stop decomposition by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and moulds. Small local projects have already produced appropriate solutions, such as the solar dryer which is very simple, inexpensive, has a large capacity and can be constructed with a standard bed, matting, thatch and mosquito netting. The surplus vegetables produced out of season that cannot be sold in the markets can thus be kept from one year to the next. While there may be losses of vitamins during the drying process, most of the nutritional value of such foodstuffs is maintained. It is thus a promising approach insofar as the producers are unable to control the post-harvest cycle of their produce and have no guaranteed markets when they plant their crops. But this still requires that producers learn such techniques and that consumers adopt the habit of buying dried vegetables. Some dried products, such as potatoes and onions, have already become accepted but it is much more difficult for green vegetables such as lettuce and green beans. However, solutions to the technical and organizational problems of marketing such products represent only one of the ways of encouraging out-of-season crops, which remain a difficult agricultural activity that demands considerable attention and investment. The emergency efforts have shown the problems that could be posed by the supply of inputs, notably seeds, especially those adapted to tropical conditions. The supply of hybrid corn seed, for example, was a failure. Without knowing that hybrid seeds cannot regenerate, farmers kept some of their harvest to sow the next season, not realizing that this traditional practice was useless in this case. European vegetable varieties also proved to be poorly adapted to the ecological and phytopathological conditions of the Sahel. Thus a first priority is the development of adapted seeds that can produce and be distributed throughout the country. Such production of good, local seeds implies the development of better nurseries, the selection of appropriate varieties and the improvement of seed storage techniques. It is also necessary to improve growing techniques for out of season crops, by improving, for example, water extraction. On average, a square metre plot requires at least 20 litres per day. With only simple watering utensils and a 5 m well, one must draw water all day and all night in order do get the 5 cubic metres needed to irrigate a 250 square metre plot. With a Kutasa, or Chadouf, a balance well common throughout the tropics, it takes only three hours. Better still is the oxen-powered Dellou system which reduces the time to one hour and requires little human exertion. Thus the method of water extraction chosen for out-of-season cropping is clearly very important. Significant improvements can be made in irrigation techniques: more accurate spraying and better channelling and holding systems, can when ~ scientifically >> designed increase production with minimal water consumption. Agricultural extension workers can help in all of these tasks provided they receive additional training. Out-of-season crops are all too often ignored in agricultural courses because they are not considered to be important. However, now that they have begun to make a contribution to the national economy, they will no doubt receive more attention from trainina institutions. More widespread and better understood and organized, out-of-season crops whether seen as a dubious investment or a crisis solution can become an important development tool. The word ''mobilization' has often been used with reason to describe operations undertaken to combat the drought in the Sahel. In order to avoid a 'demobilization', these crops can continue to play an important role in both local agricultural practices and the national economy.
