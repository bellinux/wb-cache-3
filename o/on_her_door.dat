25|$|Mandy, Whitworth's step-mother, {{reported}} the Police knocking <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>door</b> to inform her {{they had found}} Daniel's body. She says she was led to believe Daniel had overdosed on drugs, despite no investigation having taken place. Police didn't treat the death as suspicious, despite bruising found under Daniel's arms, {{which led to a}} coroner reporting that third-party involvement could not be ruled out. The Police took the fake suicide note left by Port with Daniel's body at face-value. They sent a small fragment of the letter to Mandy and Daniel's father, Adam, asking them to verify if it was Daniel's penmanship. They looked at the writing on the note and compared it with Daniel's writing from Birthday cards and other mementos. They reported back to the Police saying they were unsure if it was Daniel's writing, as they didn't often see his handwriting and they couldn't say for certain. Mandy reported that Dagenham Police had told her they had experts who can analyse the writing and determine whether it is Daniel's or not, and Mandy assumed this is what the Police would do. It is later shown at trial that Dagenham Police documented that Mandy and Adam had confirmed the handwriting was Daniel's, despite them telling the Police they were unsure. It came to light that handwriting professionals had not investigated the note, but that untrained Police Officers had 'taken a look' at the note themselves. Mandy maintains that if specialists had looked further into this note, they could have found Port earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Ende's Jim {{refuses to}} learn to read or write, harking back to Ende's own {{experience}} with Nazi education and indoctrination, which he regarded with horror. Said Ende, [...] "I didn't want to learn, at least not what they endeavored to teach us there." [...] Voss explains that subjects like German, history and geography took a back seat to biology, where the need for racial purity was drummed into pupils on official order. Quoting from Nazi literature, Voss writes, [...] "no boy or girl should leave school without having been led to the ultimate cognition of the imperative need [...] and essence of racial purity."

She declined the offer and left, which made him much disappointed.
