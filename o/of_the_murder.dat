5|$|Interest in {{the case}} did not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn existed in various {{anonymous}} versions; it was a sensational hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra apertures for their viewers when exhibiting their shows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b> The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as a cold-blooded monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other fathers were airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> in his magazine All the Year Round after initially rejecting it because he felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E

While the film was never marketed as being based on a true story, numerous comparisons between the murder and the film were made, and many viewers believed it to be a factual account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b>|$|E
