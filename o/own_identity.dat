5|$|On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle {{service was}} {{shortened}} to terminate at Earl's Court, and, on 31 December 1908, the Outer Circle service was {{withdrawn from the}} DR tracks. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> on the tube map as the Circle line.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} DR {{station was}} rebuilt {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, initially as a single-storey structure. An office building was built above it later. The line was electrified in 1905. In 1949, the Inner Circle route was given its <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> on the tube map as the Circle line.|$|E
5|$|John Doggett (Robert Patrick) awakens {{inside an}} {{abandoned}} warehouse {{to find a}} man stealing one of his shoes. Doggett chases the man outside, where he summons two Mexican police officers. One of the policemen hits the man with his nightstick, while the other demands his identification. When Doggett finds he has no papers, the officer asks him his name. Doggett is shocked to realize he can't remember his <b>own</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Saguna meditation, that is {{qualified}} and with attributes, {{is for those}} who need a concrete symbol such as a Murti, or a visualization aid. They should think of the identity of their lotus heart having eight petals with the highest self visualized as Vasudeva, Narayana or Purushottama. The meditation should concentrate on one's <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> with this image of imperishable highest self. This is {{the path to the}} state of Vaishvanara, or qualified Dhyana.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{loosely based}} on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon by Shadowrun co-creator Robert N. Charrette and set in the year 2050. The player takes on the role of Jake Armitage, a man {{suffering}} from amnesia after having been critically wounded by assassins. The plot then follows Jake as he attempts to uncover his <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> and the identity of the mysterious figure who wants him dead, and eventually complete his mission. Harebrained Schemes' 2013 Shadowrun Returns links the stories of this game and of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis.|$|E
5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her <b>own</b> <b>identity,</b> and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of poetry slam into the U. K. in the mid- 1990 ’s offers an intriguing {{window into the}} development of the art worlds and identities of slam participants, as these poets strive to reconcile the {{introduction of}} this new, potentially lucrative, foreign art with their <b>own</b> <b>identities</b> as authentic British artists. This paper explores how slam prompts participants in the U. K. performance poetry scene to reassess definitions of performance art, as well as their <b>own</b> <b>identities</b> as artists...|$|R
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|After {{the mixed}} {{reception}} to the 2003 film Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired {{the rights to}} the character. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay in order to distance itself from the 2003 film and establish its <b>own</b> <b>identity,</b> although he would go uncredited for his writing. Filming mostly took place in Toronto, Ontario, from July to November 2007. Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of motion capture and computer-generated imagery to complete the film.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1890s {{the station}} {{entrance}} had {{been incorporated into}} a larger building. In 1922, a new entrance and canopy was designed for the Bridge Street entrance by Charles Holden and, in 1924, he designed a plainly rendered replacement elevation for the eastern entrance on to the Embankment. These were {{the first of many}} projects by the architect for the London Electric Railway (the main forerunner of London Transport and Transport for London). The station platforms were also refurbished with new wall tiling in the green, blue, black and white tiling scheme used later by Holden on many stations of the period and still visible at neighbouring St James's Park station. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> on the tube map as the Circle line.|$|E

500|$|Another {{theme in}} the series {{is the use of}} {{identical}} people {{as a result of the}} characters travelling to parallel worlds where they find alternative versions of people they met before. Despite sharing the same physical appearances, these identical versions have been through different experiences earning their <b>own</b> <b>identities.</b> Syaoran also has his own doppelgänger commonly referred as [...] "The Other Syaoran" [...] who at the same time shares the same identity as the protagonist from xxxHolic, Kimihiro Watanuki. Across the series, these character are developed and choose their own paths to earn their <b>own</b> <b>identities.</b>|$|R

5|$|In this episode, the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) has a near-death {{experience}} and {{is sent to}} the Klingon version of Hell known as Gre'thor. There she encounters her Klingon mother Miral (Karen Austin), who is damned because of Torres' refusal to fully accept her <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> as a Klingon. After being resuscitated by the Voyager crew, Torres becomes intent on revisiting Gre'thor to save her mother. The episode also guest stars Eric Pierpoint as Kortar, who ferries the souls of the dishonored on the Barge of the Dead, and Sherman Augustus as the dead Klingon Hij'Qa.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found to show that he was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic links that existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his reign, as well as aspects of his <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> and rule.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes food {{not found}} in its {{original}} culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malay dishes. Food from one culture is sometimes also cooked using styles taken from another culture, For example, sambal belacan (shrimp paste) are commonly used as ingredients by Chinese restaurants to create the stir fried water spinach (kangkung belacan). This means that although much of Malaysian food {{can be traced back}} to a certain culture, they have their <b>own</b> <b>identity.</b> Rice is popular in many dishes. Chili is commonly found in local cuisine, although this does not necessarily make them spicy.|$|E
50|$|The two yeomanry regiments {{retained}} their <b>own</b> <b>identities</b> and badges {{within the}} amalgamated unit, with each providing two batteries. The Berkshire Yeomanry formed 395 (Berkshire Yeomanry) Battery at Reading and 396 (Berkshire Yeomanry) Battery at Newbury.|$|R

5|$|From its {{inception}} in 1973 until 1984, the restaurant was co-owned by Byron and Virginia Hardin. Their son, Mike Hardin, became co-owner when his father died in 1984. He assumed greater responsibility with business partner Terry Rhodes when his mother died in 1989. Mike Hardin was called a local icon by Discover San Diego and the San Diego Union-Tribune.Mike Hardin died on February 5, 2015, having {{suffered a heart attack}} and a makeshift memorial for was created by the community in front of the Ocean Beach restaurant. The restaurant closed during February 6th and 7th to honor both him and another employee, and was reopened on February 9. Hundreds of people attended a public memorial ceremony in late March at the Petco's Park location, including Guy Fieri. His son Shane and daughter Lexi became co-owners of the restaurant chain in 2015. In an interview with SD News, Shane discussed the pressures of taking over the business as well as both modeling his behavior after his father and establishing his <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> as its owner.|$|E
5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its <b>own</b> <b>identity,</b> and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, the Metropolitan Police Service {{built a new}} station {{house on}} the site of No.33–34. This did not include the Bow Street Runners, who {{retained}} their <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> until the organisation disbanded in 1839. A new magistrates' court was designed by John Taylor at a cost of £38,400 (now £) and constructed between 1879–81. Oscar Wilde {{was arrested and charged with}} gross indecency at the court in 1895; following an overnight stay on remand, he ordered tea, toast and eggs from the nearby Tavistock Hotel, who delivered them to his cell. In 1961, Bertrand Russell, then aged 89, was brought to the court after demonstrating as part of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He later spent a week at Brixton Prison. The courts closed in July 2006 as its Grade II listing meant it was not economical to update it to modern standards. The building is planned to be converted into a boutique hotel.|$|E
50|$|Several {{independent}} Christian kingdoms {{and mostly}} independent political entities (Asturias, León, Galicia, Castile, Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia) were formed {{by their own}} inhabitants' efforts under aristocratic leadership, coexisting with the Muslim Iberian states and having their <b>own</b> <b>identities</b> and borders.|$|R
50|$|The two yeomanry regiments {{retained}} their <b>own</b> <b>identities</b> and badges {{within the}} amalgamated unit, with each providing two batteries.

50|$|Art after 1830 in Belgium and the Netherlands follow {{separate}} paths as {{the countries}} further develop their <b>own</b> <b>identities.</b> James Ensor {{is an important}} figure from Belgium, while Vincent van Gogh, from the Netherlands, posthumously reached the level of modern superstar painter.|$|R
5|$|In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route {{was given}} its <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> {{on the tube}} map as the Circle line. In June 1957, the {{reversing}} bay track {{was taken out of}} use and the track bed was later filled to connect the two island platforms. The eastbound MR platform (Number 1) and westbound DR platform (Number 4) were taken out of use in January 1966 and March 1969 respectively. The tracks for these platforms were also removed and platform 4 was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s to allow escalators to be provided to the Piccadilly line. The widened island platform is now served by the District and Circle lines in both directions. Following the closure of platforms 1 and 4, platform 3 was renumbered as 1. The current arrangement has trains running in opposite directions to the original layout. During service disruption or engineering works, trains can also run Eastbound from Platform 1. The arcaded station entrance and shops, the brick retaining walls to the sub-surface platforms and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed structures.|$|E
5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, Italian {{fishermen}} rescue {{an unconscious}} American (Matt Damon) floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, {{and when the}} man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative amnesia. He has no memory of his <b>own</b> <b>identity,</b> while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a safe deposit box in Zürich. Upon landing in Imperia (Italy), the man heads to the bank in Switzerland to investigate the deposit box. He finds it contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use {{the name on the}} American passport, Jason Bourne.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 2013, the South African Press Association {{reported}} that five opposition parties, namely COPE, the IFP, the African Christian Democratic Party, the United Christian Democratic Party and the Freedom Front Plus, {{had formed a}} coalition with 20 specific priorities. The parties in the coalition, named the Collective for Democracy (CD) and chaired by COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota, will retain their <b>own</b> <b>identity</b> and contest the election individually. The IFP denied {{being part of the}} coalition, saying they were wary of forming such alliances given the confusion it had caused for their supporters in previous elections. Three days later, the 20th, COSATU's largest affiliate National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) announced that they would not endorse the ANC or any other political party in 2014. NUMSA planned to establish a new working class collective {{along the lines of the}} defunct United Democratic Front, with the ultimate goal of forming a socialist party that will contest the 2019 general election. An opposing COSATU faction has obtained a legal opinion on removing NUMSA from COSATU, with significant implications for the country's labour and political landscape.|$|E
