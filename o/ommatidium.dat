25|$|The {{compound}} eye of {{the fruit}} fly contains 760 unit eyes or ommatidia, and {{are one of the}} most advanced among insects. Each <b>ommatidium</b> contains eight photoreceptor cells (R1-8), support cells, pigment cells, and a cornea. Wild-type flies have reddish pigment cells, which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly is not blinded by ambient light.|$|E
25|$|Apposition eyes work by {{gathering}} {{a number}} of images, one from each eye, and combining them in the brain, with each eye typically contributing a single point of information. The typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom, while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the <b>ommatidium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Derivation by affix greatly expands a speaker's vocabulary, {{sometimes}} {{beyond what}} they know in their native language. For instance, the English word <b>ommatidium</b> (a single lens of a compound eye) is rather obscure, but a child {{would be able to}} coin an Esperanto equivalent, okulero, from okulo 'an eye' (or perhaps, more precisely, okularero, by first coining okularo for 'a compound eye'). In this way the Esperanto root vid- (see) regularly corresponds to some two dozen English words: see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for some of these concepts.|$|E
25|$|Most insects {{have one}} pair of large, {{prominent}} compound eyes composed of units called ommatidia (<b>ommatidium,</b> singular), possibly up to 30,000 in a single compound eye. This type of eye gives less resolution than eyes found in vertebrates, but it gives acute perception of movement. There can also be an additional two or three ocelli, which help detect low light or small changes in light intensity. The image perceived {{is a combination of}} inputs from the numerous ommatidia, located on a convex surface, thus pointing in slightly different directions. Compared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess very large view angles, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarization of light.|$|E
25|$|The proneural protein Atonal (Ato) is {{responsible}} for the development of Drosophila’s R8 photoreceptors. However, it does not act alone, since it dimerizes with a second identical protein, ‘’Daughterless (Da)’’ that reinforces its expression. The coexpression of ‘’Ato’’ and ‘’Da’’ is important for the migration of the different cell types of an <b>ommatidium</b> and for the repression of atonal in the inter-cluster spaces, functioning as inhibitory signals that regulate both the number and position of the nascent R8 cells. Moreover, this expression leads to the activation of the kinase MAPK that is important for the cellular recruitment and the repressor effect, once, when this kinase is inactive the expression of ‘’Ato’’ is detected in every cell. In an initial state, Hedgehog (‘’Hh’’) and Decapentaplegic are responsible for the activation of ‘’ato’’ in small cellular clusters, leading to the activation of MAPK. First, Hedgehog induces ‘’ato’’ expression in more than just the cells that ultimately become photoreceptor cells, so its expression has to be refined and restricted to a single presumptive R8 cell. Hedgehog signaling is also required to repress ‘’atonal’’ expression between the nascent proneural clusters, which reveals a dual role crucial to building precision and geometry into the adult retina. Therefore, the regulation of ‘’ato’’ expression depends on the levels of Hedgehog: at low levels (that is far from the source) this pronuclear gene is activated and at high levels (close to the source) it is repressed. Combining lateral inhibition with the dual role played by Hedgehog, one can imagine how the hexagonal array of R8 cells can be patterned.|$|E
2500|$|A {{compound}} eye may {{consist of}} thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia (<b>ommatidium,</b> singular). The image perceived {{is a combination of}} inputs from the numerous ommatidia (individual [...] "eye units"), which are located on a convex surface, thus pointing in slightly different directions. Compared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess a very large view angle, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarisation of light. Because the individual lenses are so small, the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained (assuming that they do not function as phased arrays). This can only be countered by increasing lens size and number. To see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes, humans would require very large compound eyes, around [...] in radius.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the unusual}} {{morphology}} of the eye, each compound eye sees {{a region of}} space extending over more than a hemisphere in all directions. [...] Thus, extensive binocular overlap occurs, with about 70% of the ommatidia of each eye having a binocular partner <b>ommatidium</b> in the opposite eye which views in the same direction. The binocular field is most extensive in the frontoventral quadrant, where it reaches over 135°, and is smallest in the dorsal region. [...] The behavior of stalk-eyed flies is very much determined by vision. [...] During the day, temporary territories may be defended by threatening behavior. [...] At dusk, the animals gather in small groups on selected thread-like structures, returning to the same site each day. [...] When males of about equal size encounter one another within such a group, they may engage in ritualized fights (or occasionally contact fights). Competitors are driven away by the dominant male. [...] Conspecifics {{are most likely to}} elicit a threat or flight reaction when they are at a distance of about 50mm, and reactions to model flies and reflections in a mirror also occur at about this distance.|$|E
5000|$|The inner 90% of the <b>ommatidium</b> {{contains}} 6 to 9 (depending on the species) {{long and}} thin photoreceptor {{cells in the}} case of some butterflies often abbreviated [...] "R cells" [...] in literature and often numbered, e.g. R1 through R9. These [...] "R cells" [...] tightly pack the <b>ommatidium.</b> The portion of the R cells at the central axis of the <b>ommatidium</b> collectively form a light guide, a transparent tube, called the rhabdom.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} eyes of arthropods like insects, crustaceans and millipedes {{are composed}} of units called ommatidia (singular: <b>ommatidium).</b> An <b>ommatidium</b> contains a cluster of photoreceptor cells surrounded by support cells and pigment cells. The outer part of the <b>ommatidium</b> is overlaid with a transparent cornea. Each <b>ommatidium</b> is innervated by one axon bundle (usually consisting of 6-9 axons, depending {{on the number of}} rhabdomeres) and provides the brain with one picture element. The brain forms an image from these independent picture elements. The number of ommatidia in the eye depends upon the type of insect and ranges from just a handful in the primitive Zygentoma to around 30 thousand in larger Anisoptera dragonflies and in some Sphingidae moths.|$|E
50|$|Controversy exists {{over whether}} Trogidae {{is a family}} of its own or a {{subfamily}} of Scarabaeidae. One major reason for the dispute between classifications is the possible evolution of the <b>ommatidium</b> in the eyes. Different environmental pressures and predators {{may have led to}} the adaptation of <b>ommatidium</b> structures within this family. For example, the more advanced and numerous the <b>ommatidium,</b> the more present the larger the ability of the insect to escape and elude predators. The Trogidae may have evolved in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Sclerites {{that should}} {{correspond}} to rhabdoms in 'eye theory' are interstitial to the hexagons, not at centre {{as would be}} expected for individual <b>ommatidium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since {{an image}} from the {{compound}} eye is created from the independent picture elements produced by ommatidia, {{it is important for}} the ommatidia to react only to that part of the scene directly in front of them. To prevent light entering at an angle from being detected by the <b>ommatidium</b> it entered, or by any of the neighboring ommatidia, six pigment cells are present. The pigment cells line the outside of each <b>ommatidium.</b> Each pigment cell is situated at the apex of the hexagons and thus lines the outside of three ommatidia. Light entering at an angle passes through the thin cross-section of the photoreceptor cell, with only a tiny chance of exciting it, and is absorbed by the pigment cell, before it can enter a neighboring <b>ommatidium.</b> In many species, in low-light situations, the pigment is withdrawn, so that light entering the eye might be detected by any of several ommatidia. This enhances light detection but lowers resolution.|$|E

50|$|Ommatidia are {{typically}} hexagonal {{in cross section}} and approximately ten times longer than wide. The diameter is largest at the surface, tapering toward the inner end. At the outer surface there is a cornea, below which is a pseudocone that acts to further focus the light. The cornea and pseudocone form the outer {{ten percent of the}} length of the <b>ommatidium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sevenless (sev) is a gene in Drosophila melanogaster that encodes a {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} protein essential {{to the development of}} R7 cells in the Drosophila embryonic eye. The drosophila <b>ommatidium</b> contains 8 distinct retinula or R cells, each of which has a different spectral sensitivity. The R7 photo receptor, located in each of several <b>ommatidium</b> in the fly's compound eye, is used to detect ultraviolet light. The R8 photo receptor contains an activator of the RTK ({{receptor tyrosine kinase}}) for on a precursor R7 cell, called the bride of sevenless (BOSS). The binding of BOSS to sevenless stimulates a complex series of reactions involving the RTK (sevenless), MAP kinases, Ras and many more molecules to differentiate that precursor R7 photo receptor to a fully functional R7 photo receptor that can see UV light. Much of this knowledge was gained by examining flies with a mutant sevenless which still produced a fully functional R7 photoreceptor when a dominant Ras was injected into the mutant R7 precursor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{retinula}} (literally, [...] "small retina") {{cells of}} the <b>ommatidium</b> of the compound eye contain areas from which membranous organelles of conceivable size (rhabdomeres) extend. Rhabdomeres have tiny microvilli (tiny tubes extending out of the retinula) that interlock with neighboring retinular cells. This forms the rhabdom, which contains the dendrite of the eccentric cell, and may also contribute some microvilli. The only other species with an eccentric cell is the silkworm moth. Microvilli are composed of a double layer, 7 nm each and with 3.5 nm space of two electron-deficient boundaries in between. Where the microvilli meet, these outer borders fuse and yield five membranes about 15 nm thick. In all arthropods, {{there is always a}} rhabdom below a crystalline cone, on or {{near the center of the}} <b>ommatidium,</b> and always aligned with the path of light. At right angles to the length of the rhabdome are the length of the microvilli, which are in line with each other. The microvilli are about 40-150 nm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|The infraorder Cucujiformia {{includes}} {{the vast majority}} of phytophagous (plant-eating) beetles, united by cryptonephric Malpighian tubules of the normal type, a cone <b>ommatidium</b> with open rhabdom, and lack of functional spiracles on the eighth abdominal segment. Constituent superfamilies of Cucujiformia are Cleroidea, Cucujoidea, Tenebrionoidea, Chrysomeloidea, and Curculionoidea. Evidently adoption of a phytophagous lifestyle correlates with taxon diversity in beetles, with Cucujiformia, especially weevils (Curculionoidea), forming a major radiation.|$|E
50|$|The gene was {{so named}} because the Sos protein that it encoded was found to operate {{downstream}} of the sevenless gene in Drosophila melanogaster in a Ras/MAP kinase pathway. When sevenless is mutated or otherwise dysfunctional during development of the fly's ultraviolet light-sensitive compound eye, the seventh, central photoreceptor (R7) of each <b>ommatidium</b> fails to form. Similarly, the mammalian orthologues of Sos, SOS1 and SOS2, function downstream of many growth factor and adhesion receptors.|$|E
50|$|In true flies, the rhabdom has {{separated}} into seven independent rhabdomeres (there are actually eight, {{but the two}} central rhabdomeres responsible for color vision sit one atop the other), such that a small inverted 7-pixel image is formed in each <b>ommatidium.</b> Simultaneously, the rhabdomeres in adjacent ommatidia are aligned such that {{the field of view}} within an <b>ommatidium</b> is the same as that between ommatidia. The advantage of this arrangement is that the same visual axis is sampled from a larger area of the eye, thereby increasing sensitivity by a factor of seven, without increasing the size of the eye or reducing its acuity. Achieving this has also required the rewiring of the eye such that the axon bundles are twisted through 180 degrees (re-inverted), and each rhabdomere is united with those from the six adjacent ommatidia that share the same visual axis. Thus, {{at the level of the}} lamina - the first optical processing center of the insect brain - the signals are input in exactly the same manner as in the case of a normal apposition compound eye, but the image is enhanced. This visual arrangement is known as neural superposition.|$|E
5000|$|Butterflies receive {{ultraviolet}} {{signals by}} utilizing a special photoreceptor pigment in the butterfly eye. The butterfly eye {{is similar to}} the average insect eye in that it is composed of numerous ommatidia. Each butterfly <b>ommatidium</b> contains nine photoreceptors with generally each photoreceptor utilizing a single visual pigment. [...] A UV sensitive visual pigment is responsible for a butterfly’s ability to detect UV light and responds maximally to ultraviolet light at approximately 350 nm. Therefore, a visual pigment that responds to ultraviolet light is the mechanism behind ultraviolet light perception.|$|E

50|$|H1 {{exhibits}} {{very specific}} and predictable responses to directional stimuli, characteristics that are greatly beneficial {{for exploring the}} neural code because they allow for confident correlations between neural activity and stimuli. H1 neurons are known as Horizontally Sensitive (HS) cell, meaning HS cells depolarize most strongly in response to horizontal stimuli, and hyperpolarize when the direction of motion is opposite. HS cells, and their counterpart Vertically Sensitive (VS) cells, respond to a fixed direction regardless of the color or contrast of the background or the stimulus, making these neuronal systems ideal for testing. H1 exhibits {{a response to the}} stimulation of a single <b>ommatidium,</b> and can discriminate between translational motion of 2-3˚ in the visual field.|$|E

50|$|Each {{compound}} eye {{is composed}} of about 1000 receptors called ommatidia, complex structures consisting of upwards of 300 cells. The ommatidia are somewhat messily arranged, not falling into the ordered hexagonal pattern seen in more derived arthropods. Each <b>ommatidium</b> feeds into a single nerve fiber. Furthermore, the nerves are large and relatively accessible. This {{made it possible for}} electrophysiologists to record the nervous response to light stimulation easily, and to observe visual phenomena such as lateral inhibition working at the cellular level. More recently, behavioral experiments have investigated the functions of visual perception in Limulus. Habituation and classical conditioning to light stimuli have been demonstrated, as has the use of brightness and shape information by males when recognizing potential mates.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956, Hartline {{revisited}} {{this concept}} of lateral inhibition in horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) eyes, during an experiment conducted {{with the aid of}} Henry G Wagner and Floyd Ratliff. Hartline explored the anatomy of ommatidia in the horseshoe crab because of their similar function and physiological anatomy to photoreceptors in the human eye. Also, they are much larger than photoreceptors in humans, which would make them much easier to observe and record. Hartline contrasted the response signal of the <b>ommatidium</b> when a single concentrated beam of light was directed at one receptor unit as opposed to three surrounding units. [...] He further supported his theory of lateral inhibition as the response signal of one unit was stronger when the surrounding units were not exposed to light.|$|E
50|$|Compound eyes {{consist of}} fifteen to several {{thousand}} independent ommatidia, columns {{that are usually}} hexagonal in cross section. Each <b>ommatidium</b> is an independent sensor, with its own light-sensitive cells and often with its own lens and cornea. Compound eyes have a wide field of view, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarization of light. On the other hand, the relatively large size of ommatidia makes the images rather coarse, and compound eyes are shorter-sighted than those of birds and mammals - although {{this is not a}} severe disadvantage, as objects and events within 20 cm are most important to most arthropods. Several arthropods have color vision, and that of some insects has been studied in detail; for example, the ommatidia of bees contain receptors for both green and ultra-violet.|$|E

50|$|Like most of {{the mobile}} Sternorrhyncha, adult Aleyrodidae have {{well-developed}} antennae, which in most species in this family are seven-segmented. As in many Hemiptera, there are two ocelli, which generally in the Aleyrodidae are placed at the anterior margins of the compound eyes. The compound eyes themselves however, are rather remarkable; there are many examples in entomology in which {{the upper and lower}} regions of the compound eye differ both functionally and anatomically, and in some families that are adapted to living on water surfaces, such as the Gyrinidae, they even may be divided into upper and lower eyes for vision in air and under water. However, although it is not clear why Aleyrodidae should need any such adaptation, many have a distinct constriction between the upper and lower halves of the compound eyes in both sexes. In some species there is a complete separation. The degree of separation is useful in recognising the species; for instance, one way to tell adult Bemisia from Trialeurodes is that the upper and lower parts of the compound eyes are connected by a single <b>ommatidium</b> in Bemisia, while in Trialeurodes they are completely separate.|$|E
5000|$|Horseshoe crabs {{have two}} large {{compound}} {{eyes on the}} sides of its head. An additional simple eye is positioned at the rear of each of these structures. [...] In addition to these obvious structures, it also has two smaller ocelli situated in the middle-front of its carapace, which may superficially be mistaken for nostrils. [...] A further simple eye is located beneath these, {{on the underside of the}} carapace. [...] A further pair of simple eyes are positioned just in front of the mouth. [...] The simple eyes are probably important during the embryonic or larval stages of the organism, with the compound eyes and median ocelli becoming the dominant sight organs during adulthood. These ocelli are less complex, and probably less derived, than those of the mandibulata. [...] Unlike the trilobites', the compound eyes of horseshoe crabs are triangular in shape; they also have a generative region at their base, but this elongates with time.

40|$|In the {{compound}} lateral eye of Limulus each <b>ommatidium</b> {{functions as a}} single receptor unit in the discharge of impulses in the optic nerve. Impulses originate in the eccentric cell of each <b>ommatidium</b> and are conducted in its axon, which runs without interruption through an extensive plexus of nerve fibers to become a fiber of the optic nerve. The plexus makes interconnections among the ommatidia, but its exact organization is not understood. The ability of an <b>ommatidium</b> to discharge impulses in the axon of its eccentric cell is reduced by illumination of other ommatidia in its neighborhood: the threshold to light is raised, the number of impulses discharged {{in response to a}} suprathreshold flash of light is diminished, and the frequency with which impulses are discharged during steady illumination is decreased. Also, the activity that can be elicited under certain conditions when an <b>ommatidium</b> is in darkness can be inhibited similarly. There is no evidence for the spread of excitatory influences in the eye of Limulus. The inhibitory influence exerted upon an <b>ommatidium</b> that is discharging impulses at a steady rate begins, shortly after the onset of the illumination on neighboring ommatidia, with a sudden deep minimum in the frequency of discharge. After partial recovery, the frequency is maintained at a depressed level until the illumination on the neighboring receptors is turned off, following which there is prompt, though not instantaneous recovery to the original frequency. The inhibition is exerted directly upon the sensitive structure within the ommatidium: it has been observed when the impulses were recorded by a microelectrode thrust into an <b>ommatidium,</b> as well as when they were recorded more proximally in single fibers dissected from the optic nerve. Receptor units of the eye often inhibit one another mutually. This has been observed by recording the activity of two optic nerve fibers simultaneously. The mediation of the inhibitory influence appears to depend upon the integrity of nervous interconnections in the plexus: cutting the lateral connections to an <b>ommatidium</b> abolishes the inhibition exerted upon it. The nature of the influence that is mediated by the plexus and the mechanism whereby it exerts its inhibitory action on the receptor units are not known. The depression of the frequency of the discharge of nerve impulses from an <b>ommatidium</b> increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the intensity of illumination on receptors in its vicinity. Inhibition of the discharge from an <b>ommatidium</b> is greater the larger the area of the eye illuminated in its vicinity. However, equal increments of area become less effective as the total area is increased. The response of an <b>ommatidium</b> is most effectively inhibited by the illumination of ommatidia that are close to it; the effectiveness diminishes with increasing distance, but may extend for several millimeters. Illumination of a fixed region of the eye at constant intensity produces a depression of the frequency of discharge of impulses from a nearby <b>ommatidium</b> that is approximately constant, irrespective of the level of excitation of the <b>ommatidium.</b> The inhibitory interaction in the eye of Limulus is an integrative process that is important in determining the patterns of nervous activity in the visual system. It is analogous to the inhibitory component of the interaction that takes place in the vertebrate retina. Inhibitory interaction results in the exaggeration of differences in sensory activity from different regions of the eye illuminated at different intensities, thus enhancing visual contrast...|$|E
40|$|In each {{compound}} {{eye of the}} fly about 3200 ommatidia {{are arranged}} in a peculiarly distorted hexagonal array.

40|$|Background Insect {{compound}} {{eyes are}} composed of ommatidia, which contain photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light defined by the specific rhodopsin proteins that they express. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has several different <b>ommatidium</b> types that can be localised to specific retinal regions, such as the dorsal rim area (DRA), or distributed stochastically in a mosaic across the retina, like the ‘pale’ and ‘yellow’ types. Variation in these ommatidia patterns very likely {{has important implications for}} the vision of insects and could underlie behavioural and environmental adaptations. However, despite the detailed understanding of ommatidia specification in D. melanogaster, {{the extent to which the}} frequency and distribution of the different <b>ommatidium</b> types vary between sexes, strains and species of Drosophila is not known. Results We investigated the frequency and distribution of <b>ommatidium</b> types based on rhodopsin protein expression, and the expression levels of rhodopsin transcripts in the eyes of both sexes of different strains of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana. We found that while the number of DRA ommatidia was invariant, Rh 3 expressing ommatidia were more frequent in the larger eyes of females compared to the males of all species analysed. The frequency and distribution of <b>ommatidium</b> types also differed between strains and species. The D. simulans strain ZOM 4 has the highest frequency of Rh 3 expressing ommatidia, which is associated with a non-stochastic patch of pale and odd-coupled ommatidia in the dorsal-posterior of their eyes. Conclusions Our results show that there is striking variation in the frequency and distribution of <b>ommatidium</b> types between sexes, strains and species of Drosophila. This suggests that evolutionary changes in the underlying regulatory mechanisms can alter the distribution of <b>ommatidium</b> types to promote or restrict their expression in specific regions of the eye within and between species, and that this could cause differences in vision among these flies...|$|E
