50|$|Binding and {{mutagenesis}} {{studies of}} several PilZ domain proteins {{have shown that}} c-di-GMP binding depends on residues in RxxxR and D/NxSxxG sequence-motifs. The crystal structure, at 1.7 A, of a PilZ domain::c-di-GMP complex from Vibrio cholerae shows c-di-GMP contacting seven of nine strongly conserved residues. Binding of c-di-GMP causes a conformational switch whereby the C- and N-terminal domains are brought into close <b>opposition</b> <b>forming</b> a new allosteric interaction surface that spans these domains and the c-di-GMP at their interface.|$|R

Michel Foucault referred to this creation of identities, through creating discourse surrounding the ideal, as reverse discourse. This antagonistic relationship between identities is the basis for gender policing. Deviation from normative expression, of either gender or sexuality, is often met with varying degrees violence.|$|R
