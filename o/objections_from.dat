40|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{think that}} dispositions are necessarily intrinsic. However, {{there are no}} good positive arguments for this view. Furthermore, many properties (such as weight, visibility, and vulnerability) are dispositional but are not necessarily shared by perfect duplicates. So, some dispositions are extrinsic. I consider three main objections {{to the possibility of}} extrinsic dispositions: the <b>Objection</b> <b>from</b> Relationally Specified Properties, the <b>Objection</b> <b>from</b> Underlying Intrinsic Properties, and the <b>Objection</b> <b>from</b> Natural Properties. These objections ultimately fail...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{defends the}} {{structural}} concept of representation, defined by homomorphisms, against the main objections {{that have been}} raised against it: Logical <b>objections,</b> the <b>objection</b> <b>from</b> misrepresentation, the <b>objection</b> <b>from</b> failing necessity, and the copy theory objection. Homomorphic representations are not necessarily ‘copies’ of their representanda, and thus can convey scientific insight...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2008 global {{financial}} crisis, an important conceptual battleground for democratic theorists ought to be, it would seem, the capitalist firm. We are now painfully aware that the typical model of government in so-called investor-owned companies remains profoundly oligarchic, hierarchical, and unequal. Renewing with the literature of the 1970 s and 1980 s on workplace democracy, a few political theorists have started to advocate democratic reforms of the workplace by relying on an analogy between firm and state. To the extent that a firm is an organization comparable to the state, it too ought to be ruled along democratic lines. Our paper tests the robustness of the analogy between firm and state by considering six major objections to it: (1) the <b>objection</b> <b>from</b> a difference in ends, (2) the <b>objection</b> <b>from</b> shareholders’ property rights, (3) the <b>objection</b> <b>from</b> worker’s consent, (4) the <b>objection</b> <b>from</b> workers’ exit opportunities, (5) the <b>objection</b> <b>from</b> workers’ (lack of) expertise, and (6) the <b>objection</b> <b>from</b> the fragility of firms. We find all of these objections wanting. While the paper does not ambition to settle the issue of workplace democracy at once, our goal is {{to pave the way for}} a more in-depth study of the ways in which firms and states can be compared and the possible implications this may have for our understanding of the nature of managerial authority and the governance of firms...|$|R

5|$|The B {{bill was}} again {{examined}} by a joint committee under Lord Windsor. The GN bill was examined by a separate committee under Lord Ribblesdale. The B's eastward extension to Holborn {{to connect to}} the GN was permitted, but the extension to Parsons Green was rejected following <b>objections</b> <b>from</b> hospitals in the Fulham Road, which were concerned that vibrations from trains might affect their patients. The B link from Piccadilly Circus to Charing Cross was rejected {{on the grounds that}} it involved sharp turns and steep gradients to avoid public buildings in the area. The merger with the GN and name change were permitted. The GN's extension to Temple was rejected following <b>objections</b> <b>from</b> the Duke of Norfolk who owned the land under which it would have run.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several <b>objections</b> <b>from</b> the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. It was felt that, as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was the first Indian army officer to be promoted to the rank.|$|E
