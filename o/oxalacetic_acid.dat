40|$|Methods are {{described}} for the in vitro cultivation of the excised lupin embryo on a synthetic medium. The postulate that asparagine synthesis is not conditioned {{primarily by the}} presence of excess free ammonia and hence is not a detoxication mechanism has been experimentally confirmed in the lupin. Isolated embryos, when supplied with adequate carbohydrate and nitrogen in the medium, are unable to absorb and convert succinic, malic, pyruvic, lactic, and glyceric acids, and glycerol and succinmonamide to asparagine. Under similar conditions of carbohydrate and nitrogen supply fumaric, maleic, aspartic, exalacetic, and glutamic acids, and succindiamide are effective in stimulating the synthesis of asparagine. Of these compounds; glutamic adid is the most effective. Metabolic products of glutamic acid such as ketoglutaric, glutaric, and succinic acids are not effective. Combinations of glutamic acid with aspartic and <b>oxalacetic</b> <b>acids</b> in the absence of ammonia are likewise not effective in the stimulation of asparagine synthesis. An extract of embryo tissue is able to oxidize glutamic acid in the presence of boiled yeast juice. Amide formation has been demonstrated in such an extract to which was added glutamic and aspartic acids and ammonia. An attempt has been made to unify the above observations, and to explain the role of glutamate as an energy source in asparagine synthesis, with the energy transfer possibly taking place through the intermediation of a pyridine coenzyme. The unsatisfactory status of the postulated conversion of aspartic acid to asparagine has been pointed out and a scheme proposed to explain the introduction of energy into the system. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the fate of staphylococci and {{tubercle}} bacilli resuspended in aqueous media at slightly acid reactions. The tests were carried out at several acid reactions in balanced ionic media containing 0. 5 per cent serum albumin. These experimental conditions were selected in order to approximate those which are probably encountered by pathogenic agents in inflammatory areas and in the intracellular environment of the leucocytes after phagocytosis. The viability of the microorganisms at a given pH was markedly influenced by the composition of the medium, being decreased by addition to the latter of lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, and increased by the addition of certain ketone bodies such as dihydroxyacetone and pyruvic, β-hydroxybutyric, α-ketoglutaric, and <b>oxalacetic</b> <b>acids.</b> The presence of ketone bodies in the medium afforded to the microorganisms some protection against the bactericidal effect of lactic and acetic acids at acid reactions. The minimum and the optimum pH for growth were found to be dependent on the composition of the medium. Both were higher in the presence of lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids than in the media without organic acids added. In contrast, the addition of ketone bodies to the medium allowed microbial multiplication even in acid media (approximately at pH 5. 3 or even lower).

It was suggested that the bacterial cells may have been impermeable to the substrates which had not supported growth, rather than that the cells lacked the specific enzymes. Additional data on the oxidation of the inter-mediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle by virulent tubercle bacilli have been obtained by showing the effect of these compounds on the respiration of whole cells, and upon enzyme preparations obtained by altering whole cells by acetone drying.

Elimination of the respiratory electron chain by depleting the entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA, rho 0 cells) has therefore one of the most severe impacts on the energy metabolism in eukaryotic cells. In this study, proteomic data sets including the post transcriptional modifications (PTMs) phosphorylation and ubiquitination were integrated with metabolomic data sets and selected enzyme activities in the osteosarcoma cell line 143 B. TK. A shotgun based SILAC LC-MS proteomics and a targeted metabolomics approach was applied to elucidate the consequences of the rho 0 state. Pathway and protein protein interaction (PPI) network analyses revealed a non-uniform down-regulation of the respiratory electron chain, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the pyruvate metabolism in rho 0 cells. Metabolites of the TCA cycle were dysregulated, such as a reduction of citric acid and cis-aconitic acid (6 - and 2. 5 -fold), and an increase of lactic acid, <b>oxalacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (both 2 -fold), and succinic acid (5 -fold) in rho 0 cells. Signaling pathways such as GPCR, EGFR, G 12 / 13 alpha and Rho GTPases were up-regulated in rho 0 cells, which could be indicative for the mitochondrial retrograde response, a pathway of communication from mitochondria to the nucleus. This was supported by our phosphoproteome data, which revealed two main processes, GTPase-related signal transduction and cytoskeleton organization. Furthermore, a general de-ubiquitination in rho 0 cells was observed, for example, 80 S ribosomal proteins were in average 3 -fold and SLC amino acid transporters 5 -fold de-ubiquitinated. The latter might cause the observed significant increase of amino acids levels in rho 0 cells. We conclude that an elimination of the respiratory electron chain, e. g. mtDNA depletion, not only leads to an uneven down-regulation of mitochondrial energy pathways, but also triggers the retrograde response...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} proposed bioassay {{procedure that}} is based on the substrate induced quenching (SIQ) of an indicator fluorescence for the measurement of analyte concentrations is evaluated. In this type of assay a enzynatic reaction and a fluorescence quenching interaction are coupled together. Typically, an appropriate dehydrogenase enzyme reduces or oxidises the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor. The change in the concentration of NADH results in variations in the excited fluorophore population as observed through fluorescence intensity. This latter aspect is used to monitor substrate (analyte) concentrations. Results on the investigation of the substrate induced quenching bioassay method and possibilities of using it as the basis of (i) a novel enzyme bioassay technique and (ii) a novel bioprobe format are presented. Ethanol was chosen as the model analyte, and a new assay procedure for its measurement was developed. A generic theoretical relation is discussed for the observed assay kinetics of substrate induced quenching (SIQ) and a model is described that includes the effects due to dynamic/static quenching of the fluorophore by either the enzyme substrate or product. The validity of the derived model is shown by comparison with experimental results for a SIQ based ethanol assay. The option of running the dehydrogenase reaction so as to consume NADH rather than generate it is also investigated. In order to demonstrate this approach acetaldehyde was chosen as the model analyte, and a assay procedure for its measurement was developed. The potential of the SIQ technique for incorporation into biosensor based upon a 'reservoir' format was demonstrated through the development of custom optical instrumentation and resevoir flowcell. Applicability of the SIQ technique to other biosensor formats such as flow-injection analysis and 'dry reagent' technology is discussed. The overall applicability of the SIQ technique is assessed through the generation of a number of SIQ assays on the following substrates: ethanol, glucose, glucose- 6 - phosphate, L-glutamic acid, isocitric acid, acetaldehyde, pyruvic acid, ot-ketoglutaric acid, and <b>oxalacetic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|E
40|$|Disinfection {{may cause}} a dilemma for {{drinking}} water treatment plants using chlorine {{for the maintenance}} of a disinfectant residual in distribution systems. On one hand the chlorine residual should ensure microbially safe drinking water, {{but on the other hand}} harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs) can be formed from the reaction of natural organic matter (NOM) with chlorine. ^ Many utilities are looking to the combined use of ozonation for primary disinfection, followed by chlorine or chloramines as a means of minimizing DBP formation while maintaining a stable disinfectant residual. However, these combinations may lead to a new spectrum of by-products that differs from that produced when a single disinfectant is used. The formation of mixed ozonation/chlorination and ozonation/chloramination by-products is the subject of this dissertation. ^ A diverse collection of precursor compounds that produce a large amount of “unknown” total organic halides (TOX) was identified by performing bench scale tests to simulate chlorination of known ozonation by-products. Simple mono- and di-carboxylic acids were not found to react with chlorine. Di-aldehydes, α-keto-acids, and α-hydroxy-acids are oxidized by chlorine but do not show TOX formation. However, chlorine does become incorporated in β-diketones. <b>Oxalacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> 3 -methyl- 2, 4 -pentanedione, acetonedicarboxylic acid, and malic acid were found to form more “unknown TOX” than common chlorination by-products. Usually, the chlorine demand as well as the TOX increase with decreasing pH and increasing chlorination time. ^ The identification of “unknown TOX” was the second major goal of this work. Quenched samples from the model compound studies were derivatized with pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine (PFBHA), extracted with methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MtBE), and silylated with bis-(trimethylsilyl) -triflouroacetamine (BSTFA). Malic and acetonedicarboxylic acids were each found to produce a previously-unknown byproduct after reacting with chlorine. The identity of this and other new by-products was suggested based on the mass spectra. Surprisingly, mono-chlorinated species were found to be more abundant than di-chlorinated species in all cases. ^ The third phase of this research showed that a substantial amount of “unknown TOX” is also formed in distribution systems where chlorine is used as final disinfectant. The “unknown TOX” ranged between 60 % and 80 % of the measured TOX. ...|$|E
40|$|In Cyanobakterien wird das Signaltransduktionsprotein PII in Abhängigkeit der Kohlenstoff- und Stickstoffversorgung der Zellen durch eine Kinase phosphoryliert und durch eine Mg 2 +-abhängige Phosphatase dephosphoryliert. Zunächst wurde die beteiligte Phosphatase in einem teilgereinigten Extrakt aus Synechococcus PCC 7942 biochemisch charakterisiert. Dabei zeigte sich bereits eine synergistische Hemmwirkung durch ATP und 2 -Oxoglutarat. Das Inhibitionsmuster und die Mg 2 +-Abhängigkeit ließen eine Phosphatase eukaryontischen Typs, eine PP 2 C-Phosphatase vermuten. Die angestrebte Darstellung der PII-P Phosphatase aus Synechococcus PCC 7942 Zellen gelang aufgrund zu geringer Ausgangsmengen nicht. Mittels {{reverser}} Genetik gelang es jedoch im komplett sequenzierten Genom von Synechocystis PCC 6803, eines nahen Verwandten von Synechococcus PCC 7942 das Gen der PII-P Phosphatase zu identifizieren. Die Inaktivierung des offenen Leserahmens sll 1771 (pphA) führte zu der PII-P Phosphatase defizienten Mutante MPphA. MPphA besitzt ein hochphosphoryliertes PII-Protein und ist in der Dephosphorylierung von PII-P gehemmt. PphA ist somit die einzige spezifische PII-P Phosphatase. Phänotypisch weist MPphA bei Wachstum mit Nitrat einen leicht reduzierten Gehalt an Phycobiliproteinen auf, scheidet hohe Mengen an Nitrit aus und unterscheidet sich aber ansonsten nicht vom Wildtyp. Untersuchungen zur Nitrataufnahme wiesen darauf hin, daß phosphoryliertes und ligandiertes PII-Protein für die Nitrataufnahme notwendig ist. Unter CO 2 -limitierenden Bedingungen unterliegt MPphA einer Kohlenstoffchlorose. Die mögliche Ursache könnte die Inaktivierung oder die fehlende Aktivierung eines hochaffinen Ci-Transportsystems, evt. cmpABCD durch das phosphoryliert-vorliegende PII-Protein sein. Die biochemische Analyse von PphA zeigte, daß PphA als Substrate außer PII-P auch an Serin/Threoninresten phosphoryliertes P-Casein, P-Histon, sowie synthetische Oligopeptide und p-NPP annimmt. Auch ein an einem Tyrosinrest phosphoryliertes Oligopeptid wird dephosphoryliert. Die Aktivität von PphA wird in Anwesenheit von ATP durch 2 -Oxoglutarat vollständig und durch Oxalacetat, Succinat und weitere Metaboliten des C- und N- Stoffwechsels intermediär gehemmt. ATP, ADP und GTP alleine hemmen bereits partiell. Diese Hemmeffekt werden über die Ligandierung des PII-Proteins mit diesen Metaboliten vermittelt und stellen eine metabolische Regulation der PII Phosphorylierung dar. Die Stammbaumanalyse zeigte, daß PphA zur Gruppe I bakterieller PP 2 C-Phosphatasen gehört. PphA stellt in dieser Gruppe die erste Phosphatase dar, deren Funktion und Substrat in vivo identifiziert sind. The {{signal transduction}} protein PII of Cyanobacteria is phosphorylated by a kinase and dephosphorylated by a Mg 2 + dependent phosphatase in {{dependence of the}} carbon and nitrogen supply. For initial biochemical characterization of the PII specific phosphatase a partly purified extract from Synechococcus PCC 7942 was used. As a result, a synergistic inhibition by ATP and 2 -oxoglutarate was apparent. The pattern of phosphatase specific inhibitors and the Mg 2 + dependence indicated similarities between PII-P phosphatase and eukaryotic type PP 2 C-phosphatases. Due to the low abundance of the PII-P phosphatase in Synechococcus PCC 7942 cells microchemical analysis was not succesfull. In contrast, sequence analysis and reverse genetics led to {{the identification of the}} gene of PII-P phosphatase of Synechocystis PCC 6803 a closed relative of Synechococcus PCC 7942. The inactivation of the open reading frame sll 1771 (pphA) resulted in the PII-P phosphatase deficient mutant MPphA. MPphA has a highly phosphorylated PII protein and is severly impaired in the dephosphorylation of PII-P. PphA is therefore the only specific PII-P phosphatase. Nitrate grown MPphA is phenotypically indifferent to the wildtype {{with the exception of a}} slightly reduced amount of phycobiliproteins combined with the excretion of high quantities of nitrite. Investigations concerning the uptake of nitrate suggest that a phosphorylated and liganded PII-protein is necessary for nitrate uptake. Under CO 2 -limiting conditions, MPphA undergoes a carbon chlorosis. A possible reason could be the inactivation or the missing activation of a high-affinity Ci- transport system like cmpABCD by the phosphorylated PII-protein. Biochemical analysis of PphA revealed that in addition to PII-P other serine/threonine phosphorylated proteins such as P-casein, P-histones, p-NPP and synthetic oligopeptides serve as substrates. An oligopeptide phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue becomes also dephosphorylated. The activity of PphA is completely inhibited by 2 -oxoglutarate in the presence of ATP. A partly inhibition is observed in the presence of ATP by <b>oxalacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> succinate and other metabolites of the N- and C-metabolism. ATP, ADP and GTP alone are able to a partly inhibition. These inhibitory effects are mediated by the ligandation of the PII protein with these metabolites and represent a metabolic regulation of PII phosphorylation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PphA belongs to group I of bacterial PP 2 C-phosphatases. PphA is the first phosphatase of this group whose in vivo substrate and function are identified...|$|E
40|$|I. L-Ascorbic acid (AA) showsan {{oxidation}} wave at pH {{less than}} 8 {{and two in}} a more alkaline range. After standing of AA in alkaline solution, the third oxidation wave has been observed. Dehydro-L-ascorbic acid (DAA) has been also tested in alkaline solution. The mechanism of the electrode oxidation of AA and its decomposition in alkaline solution are discussed. The reduction wave of DAA has been obtained in pH 2. 2 to 5. 0, in which the half-wave potential (π_) varies from - 0. 35 to - 0. 48 V. (vs N. C. E.) The wave height is about 1 / 1000 of its expected diffusion current at room temperature. The wave has all the typical characteristics of the kinetic current. The shape of the wave is strongly deformed by adding small amounts of surfaceactive substance such as gelatin. The reduction product of DAA at the dropping mercury electrode has been polarographically proved to be AA. Discussions are made on {{the configuration of the}} inactive form of DAA and the reversibility of AA and DAA system. II. Alloxan, dehydro-reductic acid (DRA), and mesoxalaldehyde (MOA) show reduction waves which are similar to that of DAA. π_ s of alloxan, DRA, DAA and MOA in pH 3. 5 are - 0. 05, - 0. 27, - 0. 42 and - 0. 35 V, respectively. Of these four substances, the lower the height of the reduction wave, the greater both the shift of the π_ of the anodic wave of the corresponding reduced form from the standard oxidation-reduction potential (π_ 0 ') of the system, and the temperature coefficient of the height of the reduction wave. Alloxan has been proved to be polarographically reversible by the controlled potential electrolysis, and the π_ of the reduction wave coincides with that of the oxidation wave of dialuric acid, while no such observations have been made with other three. III. The polarographic behavior of DAA, DRA, alloxan, MOA and 2, 3 -diketogulonic acid (DGA) in acid buffer solutions containing o-phenylenediamine (OPD), has been investigated. DAA shows three diffusion controlled reduction waves, whose π_ s at pH 3. 60 are - 0. 26, - 0. 44 and - 0. 67 V, respectively. The limiting currents of the three waves depend on the time after the addition of OPD, the concentration of OPD, pH and the temperature. When the electrolytic solution contains both AA and DAA, the oxidation wave of AA can be obtained independently of the three waves for DAA in one polarogram. DGA shows two reduction waves whose π_ s at pH 3. 44 are - 0. 27 and - 0. 40 V., respectively. Alloxan and DRA show single well denned reduction waves, whose π_ s at pH 3. 60 are - 0. 32 and - 0. 19 V, respectively. MOA shows no well denned reduction wave in acid media. Since the linear relationship between the limiting current and concentration has been obtained for DAA (the third wave), DRA and alloxan, these polarographic phenomena have been applied to the simultaneous determination of AA and DAA, and to that of RA and DRA and further to that of AA and RA. The method is also applicable to the determination of alloxan, but not to those of MOA (or triose-reductone) and DGA, none of which, however, seriously interfere with the determination of DAA (or AA) by this polarographic OPD method. IV. The pH-dependence of the limiting currents of mesoxalic acid, dihydroxytartaric acid, phenylglyoxylic acid, trimethylpyruvic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, <b>oxalacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> pyruvic acid and α-ketoglutaric acid has been investigated. The limiting currents of the first reduction waves of these acids have their maximum values in pH near 4, and in pH below 4 they show appreciable decreases with decreasing pH. Some of the acids show a reincrease of the limiting current in pH below 1. This characteristic behavior has been accounted for by hydration of carbonyl group and in some cases by enolization besides hydration, comparing polarographic results with spectrophotometric measurements. A solw establishment of the keto-enol tautomeric equilibria can be followed in the case of phenylpyruvic acid either polarographically or spectrophotometrically. The reaction rate constants of ketonization and enolization of the acid have been obtained to be k_ = 6. 52 × 10 ^ sec. ^ and k_ = 7. 4 × 10 ^ sec. ^ in 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid aqueous solution containing 196 alcohol at 25 ℃. It is pointed out that the rate constants of dissociation and recombination of the above mentioned acids previously reported by other authors, should be reinvestigated. The question whether the enol-form participates in the polarographic behavior of pyruvic acid is still open. V. The limiting current of trimethylpyruvic acid and its UV-absorption spectra have been studied in relation with hydration of carbonyl group of undissociated acid. pK_a Value for the apparent dissociation constant of trimethylpyruvic acid has been spectrophotometrically obtained to be 1. 52 at 25 ℃. Hydration constant of the undissociated acid (K^η_h=[AH_]/[AH]) has been kinetically obtained to be 0. 46 at 25 ℃. The rate constant of dehydration of hydrated trimethylpyruvic acid in buffer solution of pH about 5 was 2. 8 × 10 ^ sec. ^ at 25 ℃. From the temperature dependence of the hydration constant, the heat of hydration of the acid {{has been found to be}} - 8. 2 kcal. A quantitative interpretation of the pH-dependence of the limiting current has been attempted by deriving the equation involving the hydration and dissociation factors. The agreement of the theoretical curve with the experimental is good, except for the pH range less than 0. 5, where acid catalyzed dehydration should be taken into consideration. The rate constants of the dissociation and recombination of trimethylpyruvic acid have been found to be k_d= 6. 0 × 10 ^ 5 sec. ^ and k_r= 1. 4 × 10 ^ 7 l. mol. ^ sec. ^<- 1...|$|E
