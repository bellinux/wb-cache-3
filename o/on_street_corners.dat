5|$|About 200 free {{wireless}} access points {{were set up}} around the city to aid with the city's goal of increasing access to the internet. US Internet paid $500,000 up front and agreed to pay five percent of its yearly revenues for seven years to maintain them, totaling about $10 million. By 2010, 44 such points {{had been set up}} at community centers around Minneapolis, {{out of a total of}} 117 which had also gone up in parks and <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> around the city.

5|$|Early {{members of}} the group often proselytized <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> for hours, and Clarence13X's assistants led classes about the group's teachings, {{strictly}} enforcing study habits. He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters. Once they did so, they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths. These lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.|$|E

5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Few {{other details}} are {{known about the}} singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a {{powerful}} singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> with a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Coloureds {{were placed}} on a {{separate}} voters' roll. They could elect four whites to represent them in the House of Assembly.

25|$|In general, {{junction}} {{designs that}} favour higher-speed turning, weaving and merging movements by motorists {{tend to be}} hostile for cyclists. Free-flowing arrangements can be hazardous for cyclists and should be avoided. Features such as large entry curvature, slip-roads and high flow roundabouts are associated with increased risk of car–cyclist collisions. Cycling advocates argue for modifications and alternative junction types that resolve these issues such as reducing kerb radii <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners,</b> eliminating slip roads and replacing large roundabouts with signalized intersections.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{estimates that}} up to 12,000 {{people have been killed}} in the violence, with many more dying from disease and malnutrition as a direct result of the conflict. Nearly two million civilians have been forced to flee their homes, living in internally displaced person (IDP) camps and within the safety of larger settlements, sleeping <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> and in other public spaces. The problems of the camps have been expatiated by the government ordering villagers into the camps on pain of being classified as rebels and on occasion shelling those villages who refused to relocate.|$|E
25|$|When Johnson {{arrived in}} a new town, he would play for tips <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> or {{in front of the}} local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical {{associates}} have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day– and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{received}} some funds from Jews in New York, the journal's financial survival was precarious from the start. However, many volunteers helped by selling the paper <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> and in workshops. During this time, Rocker was especially concerned with combating {{the influence of}} Marxism and historical materialism in London's Jewish labor movement. In all, the Arbeter Fraint published twenty-five essays by Rocker on the topic, the first ever critical examination of Marxism in Yiddish, according to William J. Fishman. Arbeter Fraints unsound financial footing also meant Rocker rarely received the small salary promised {{to him when he}} took over the journal and he depended financially on Witkop. Despite Rocker's sacrifices, however, the paper was forced to cease publication for lack of funds. In November 1899, the prominent American anarchist Emma Goldman visited London and Rocker met her for the first time. After hearing of the Arbeter Fraints situation she held three lectures to raise funds, but that was not enough.|$|E
25|$|During the Edo period (1603–1868) {{there was}} a flourishing of the visual and {{performance}} arts particularly through proliferation of ukiyo-e ("pictures of the floating world"). Etoki once again became popular during the later eighteenth century as storytellers began to set up <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> with an unrolled scroll hanging from a pole. In the Meiji Period (1868–1912) tachi-e ("stand-up pictures"), {{similar to those in}} the Edo period, were told by performers who manipulated flat-paper cut-outs of figures mounted on wooden poles (similar to the shadow puppets of Indonesia and Malaysia). The Zen priest Nishimura is also credited to have used these pictures during sermons to entertain children. Another form of etoki was the Japanese modified stereoscope imported from the Netherlands. Much smaller in size, six engravings of landscapes and everyday scenes would be placed one behind the other on top of the device and lowered when required so that the viewer, who looked at them through a lens, could experience the illusion of space created by this device. The artistic and technological developments of the Edo and Meiji periods can be linked to the establishment of kamishibai.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that you know of your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E

500|$|Organised {{entertainments}} {{also became}} {{popular in the}} late 19th century, and 20th-century pyrotechnic manufacturers renamed Guy Fawkes Day as Firework Night. [...] Sales of fireworks dwindled somewhat during the First World War, but resumed in the following peace. At {{the start of the}} Second World War celebrations were again suspended, resuming in November 1945. For many families, Guy Fawkes Night became a domestic celebration, and children often congregated <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners,</b> accompanied by their own effigy of Guy Fawkes. This was sometimes ornately dressed and sometimes a barely recognisable bundle of rags stuffed with whatever filling was suitable. A survey found that in 1981 about 23percent of Sheffield schoolchildren made Guys, sometimes weeks before the event. [...] Collecting money was a popular reason for their creation, the children taking their effigy from door to door, or displaying it <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners.</b> [...] But mainly, they were built to go on the bonfire, itself sometimes comprising wood stolen from other pyres; [...] "an acceptable convention" [...] that helped bolster another November tradition, Mischief Night. Rival gangs competed to see who could build the largest, sometimes even burning the wood collected by their opponents; in 1954 the Yorkshire Post reported on fires late in September, a situation that forced the authorities to remove latent piles of wood for safety reasons. Lately, however, the custom of begging for a [...] "penny for the Guy" [...] has almost completely disappeared. In contrast, some older customs still survive; in Ottery St Mary men chase each other through the streets with lit tar barrels, and since 1679 Lewes has been the setting of some of England's most extravagant 5November celebrations, the Lewes Bonfire.|$|E
500|$|Formby {{was born}} into poverty in the {{industrial}} north west of England; his mother was an alcoholic and part-time prostitute, and during much of his youth he was maltreated. To earn money he would sing for pennies <b>on</b> <b>street</b> <b>corners,</b> before he joined a singing duo in his teens. He began to develop his own act during the 1890s and built up a following in Lancashire. He also developed a series of stage characters, including that of [...] "John Willie", which is described by the cultural historian Jeffrey Richards as [...] "the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad... hen-pecked, accident-prone, but muddling through." [...] Formby also had a successful recording career and made the transition from music hall to revue in 1916.|$|E
