Congee can be left watery, or can be drained so it has a texture similar to Western <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge.</b> Congee can also be made from brown rice, although this is less common and takes longer to cook.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few days, Garfield made some improvement, as the nation viewed the news from the capital and prayed. Although he never stood again, {{he was able to}} sit up and write several times, and his {{recovery}} was viewed so positively that a steamer was fitted out as a seagoing hospital to aid with his convalescence. [...] He was nourished on <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> (which he detested) and milk from a cow on the White House lawn. When told that Indian chief Sitting Bull, a prisoner of the army, was starving, Garfield said, [...] "Let him starve," [...] then, [...] "Oh, no, send him my oatmeal." [...] X-radiation (or X-ray) usage, which likely would have helped the president's physicians determine exactly where the bullet was lodged in his body, would not be invented for another fourteen years. [...] Alexander Graham Bell tried to locate the bullet with a primitive metal detector; he was not successful. One means of keeping the president comfortable in Washington's summer heat {{was one of the first}} successful air conditioning units: air that was propelled by fans over ice and then dried had reduced the temperature in the sickroom by 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius).|$|E

50|$|Cereal, <b>oatmeal</b> and <b>porridge</b> {{quickly became}} an {{important}} breakfast component in North America. Barley was a common grain used, though other grains and yellow peas could be used. In many modern cultures, porridge is still eaten as a breakfast dish.|$|R
5000|$|Ireland {{is known}} for its oatmeal. The most famous variety of these is steel-cut oatmeal. Oatmeal is very popular in Ireland, and is a common breakfast there. It is one of Ireland's major culinary exports, and is widely {{available}} throughout the world. Major brands include McCann's. Ireland is also very big on its porridge. In the 19th and 20th century, the Irish people began to mix whiskey into porridge as a common cold remedy. <b>Oatmeal</b> and <b>porridge</b> have been very important to Ireland since the 19th century and even though they may have been cut back a little when they were introduced to potatoes, <b>oatmeal</b> and <b>porridge</b> is still highly incorporated into Irish diets.|$|R
5|$|Maple syrup {{is often}} eaten with pancakes, waffles, French toast, <b>oatmeal</b> or <b>porridge.</b> It {{is also used}} as an {{ingredient}} in baking and as a sweetener or flavouring agent.

[...] "You told me only this morning that the thing was up, {{and that we should}} soon be slaves for life; working sixteen hours a day for no wages, and living on <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> and potatoes, served out by the millocrats like a regular Bastile." ...|$|E
60|$|The sun {{was high}} {{next morning when}} the wrecked men awoke, and began to feel the outcries of nature with {{reference}} to breakfast. Long before that time the men of Cove had gone off to the hills, the peat-hags, or the sea, according to their respective callings. But Mrs Anderson had a sumptuous breakfast of <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> and fresh milk ready for the strangers.|$|E
60|$|And yet {{in other}} ways {{it was an easy}} service. There was no cloth to lay; the meals were either of <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> or salt junk, except twice a week, when there was duff: and though I was clumsy enough and (not being firm on my sea-legs) {{sometimes}} fell with what I was bringing them, both Mr. Riach and the captain were singularly patient. I could not but fancy they were making up lee-way with their consciences, and that they would scarce have been so good with me if they had not been worse with Ransome.|$|E
60|$|When we wakened in {{the morning}} the storm was over and a young morning was looking through rosy eyelids across a white world. The little {{clearing}} around Peg's cabin was heaped with dazzling drifts, and we boys fell to and shovelled out a road to her well. She gave us breakfast--stiff <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> without milk, and a boiled egg apiece. Cecily could NOT eat her porridge; she declared she had such a bad cold that she had no appetite; a cold she certainly had; the rest of us choked our messes down and after we had done so Peg asked us if we had noticed a soapy taste.|$|E
60|$|Hannah and {{her mother}} and father sat down that night in silence to their simple meal of <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> and Scotch whisky. In the evening the mother sat to her spinning. Busily she plied her work, for it was a task of love. Her eldest born, Jamie, was away at college at Edinburgh, {{preparing}} for the ministry. His graduation day was approaching, and Jamie's mother was spinning him a pair of breeches against the day. The breeches were to be a surprise. Already they were shaping that way. Oyster McShamus sat reading the Old Testament in silence, while Hannah looked into the peat fire and thought of the beautiful young Laird. Only once the Highlander spoke.|$|E
60|$|Jack's hobby was {{athletic}} sports, for he {{was bent}} on having a strong and active body for his happy little soul to live and enjoy itself in. So a severe simplicity reigned in his apartment; in summer, especially, for then his floor was bare, his windows were uncurtained, and the chairs uncushioned, the bed being as narrow and hard as Napoleon's. The only ornaments were dumbbells, whips, bats, rods, skates, boxing-gloves, a big bath-pan and a small library, consisting chiefly of books on games, horses, health, hunting, and travels. In winter his mother made things more comfortable by introducing rugs, curtains, and a fire. Jack, also, relented slightly in the severity of his training, occasionally indulging in the national buckwheat cake, instead of the prescribed <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge,</b> for breakfast, omitting his cold bath when the thermometer was below zero, and dancing at night, instead of running a given distance by day.|$|E
60|$|All this {{pressed on}} his mind; yet the {{original}} statement recurred {{with the same}} irresistible force. He had received a personal insult; he was {{of the house of}} Waverley; and he bore a commission. There was no alternative; and he descended to the breakfast parlour with the intention of taking leave of the family, and writing to one of his brother officers to meet him at the inn midway between Tully-Veolan and the town where they were quartered, in order that he might convey such a message to the Laird of Balmawhapple as the circumstances seemed to demand. He found Miss Bradwardine presiding over the tea and coffee, the table loaded with warm bread, both of flour, oatmeal, and barleymeal, in the shape of loaves, cakes, biscuits, and other varieties, together with eggs, reindeer ham, mutton and beef ditto, smoked salmon, marmalade, and all the other delicacies which induced even Johnson himself to extol the luxury of a Scotch breakfast above that of all other countries. A mess of <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge,</b> flanked by a silver jug, which held an equal mixture of cream and butter-milk, was placed for the Baron's share of this repast; but Rose observed, he had walked out early in the morning, after giving orders that his guest should not be disturbed.|$|E
60|$|In this mood {{he entered}} the wainscotted parlour, in which his uncle was already placed at his morning's refreshment, a huge plate of <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge,</b> with a {{corresponding}} allowance of butter-milk. The favourite housekeeper was in attendance, half standing, half resting {{on the back of}} a chair, in a posture betwixt freedom and respect. The old gentleman had been remarkably tall in his earlier days, an advantage which he now lost by stooping to such a degree, that at a meeting, where there was some dispute concerning the sort of arch which should be thrown over a considerable brook, a facetious neighbour proposed to offer Milnwood a handsome sum for his curved backbone, alleging that he would sell any thing that belonged to him. Splay feet of unusual size, long thin hands, garnished with nails which seldom felt the steel, a wrinkled and puckered visage, the length of which corresponded with that of his person, together with a pair of little sharp bargain-making grey eyes, that seemed eternally looking out for their advantage, completed the highly unpromising exterior of Mr Morton of Milnwood. As it would have been very injudicious to have lodged a liberal or benevolent disposition in such an unworthy cabinet, nature had suited his person with a mind exactly in conformity with it, that is to say, mean, selfish, and covetous.|$|E
6000|$|Edward {{found him}} in his office, {{immersed}} among papers and accounts. Before him was a large bicker of <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge,</b> and at the side thereof a horn spoon {{and a bottle of}} two-penny. Eagerly running his eye over a voluminous law-paper, he from time to time shovelled an immense spoonful of these nutritive viands into his capacious mouth. A pot-bellied Dutch bottle of brandy which stood by intimated either that this honest limb of the law had taken his morning already, or that he meant to season his porridge with such digestive; or perhaps both circumstances might reasonably be inferred. His night-cap and morning-gown, had whilome been of tartan, but, equally cautious and frugal, the honest Bailie had got them dyed black, lest their original ill-omened colour might remind his visitors of his unlucky excursion to Derby. To sum up the picture, his face was daubed with snuff up to the eyes, and his fingers with ink up to the knuckles. He looked dubiously at Waverley as he approached the little green rail which fenced his desk and stool from the approach of the vulgar. Nothing could give the Bailie more annoyance than the idea of his acquaintance being claimed by any of the unfortunate gentlemen who were now so much more likely to need assistance than to afford profit. But this was the rich young Englishman; who knew what might be his situation? He was the Baron's friend too; what was to be done? ...|$|E
60|$|When Tam had {{gradually}} eaten his {{way through}} enough thin <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> (with very little milk, we fear) to make him into a hearty lad of fifteen, it began to be high {{time for him to}} choose himself a final profession in life, such as he was able. And here already the born tastes of the boy began to show themselves: for he had no liking for the homely shepherd's trade; he felt a natural desire for a chisel and a hammer--the engineer was there already in the grain--and he was accordingly apprenticed to a stonemason in the little town of Lochmaben, beyond the purple hills to eastward. But his master was a hard man; he had small mercy for the raw lad; and after trying to manage with him for a few months, Tam gave it up, took the law into his own hands, and ran away. Probably the provocation was severe, for in after-life Telford always showed himself duly respectful to constituted authority; and we know that petty self-made master-workmen are often apt to be excessively severe to their own hired helpers, and especially to helpless lads or young apprentices. At any rate, Tam wouldn't go back; and in the end, a well-to-do cousin, who had risen to the proud position of steward at the great hall of the parish, succeeded in getting another mason at Langholm, the little capital of Eskdale, to take over the runaway {{for the remainder of the}} term of his indentures.|$|E
60|$|It was Wednesday, a day usually kept as a {{moderate}} fast, so the breakfast was of <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge,</b> flavoured with honey, and washed down with mead, after which Brother Shoveller mounted his mule, a sleek creature, whose long ears had an air of great contentment, and rode off, accommodating his pace to that of his young companions up a stony cart-track which soon {{led them to the}} top of a chalk down, whence, as in a map, they could see Winchester, surrounded by its walls, lying in a hollow between the smooth green hills. At one end rose the castle, its fortifications covering its own hill, beneath, in the valley, the long, low massive Cathedral, the college buildings and tower with its pinnacles, and nearer at hand, among the trees, the Almshouse of Noble Poverty at St. Cross, beneath the round hill of St. Catherine. Churches and monastic buildings stood thickly in the town, and indeed, Brother Shoveller said, shaking his head, that there were well-nigh as many churches as folk to go to them; the place was decayed since the time he remembered when Prince Arthur was born there. Hyde Abbey he could not show them, from where they stood, as it lay further off by the river side, having been removed from the neighbourhood of the Minster, because the brethren of St. Grimbald could not agree with those of St. Swithun's belonging to the Minster, as indeed their buildings were so close together that it was hardly possible to pass between them, and their bells jangled in each other's ears.|$|E
60|$|Archie was sedulous at church. Sunday after Sunday he {{sat down}} and stood up with that small company, heard the voice of Mr. Torrance leaping like an ill-played clarionet from key to key, and had an {{opportunity}} to study his moth-eaten gown and the black thread mittens that he joined together in prayer, and lifted up with a reverent solemnity in the act of benediction. Hermiston pew was a little square box, dwarfish in proportion with the kirk itself, and enclosing a table not much bigger than a footstool. There sat Archie, an apparent prince, the only undeniable gentleman and the only great heritor in the parish, taking his ease in the only pew, for no other in the kirk had doors. Thence he might command an undisturbed view of that congregation of solid plaided men, strapping wives and daughters, oppressed children, and uneasy sheep-dogs. It was strange how Archie missed the look of race; except the dogs, with their refined foxy faces and inimitably curling tails, there was no one present with the least claim to gentility. The Cauldstaneslap party was scarcely an exception; Dandie perhaps, as he amused himself making verses through the interminable burden of the service, stood out a little by the glow in his eye and a certain superior animation of face and alertness of body; but even Dandie slouched like a rustic. The rest of the congregation, like so many sheep, oppressed him with a sense of hob-nailed routine, day following day—of physical labour in the open air, <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge,</b> peas bannock the somnolent fireside in the evening, and the night-long nasal slumbers in a box-bed. Yet he knew many of them to be shrewd and humorous, men of character, notable women, making a bustle in the world and radiating an influence from their low-browed doors. He knew besides they were like other men; below the crust of custom, rapture found a way; he had heard them beat the timbrel before Bacchus—had heard them shout and carouse over their whisky-toddy; and not the most Dutch-bottomed and severe faces among them all, not even the solemn elders themselves, but were capable of singular gambols at the voice of love. Men drawing near to an end of life’s adventurous journey—maids thrilling with fear and curiosity on the threshold of entrance—women who had borne and perhaps buried children, who could remember the clinging of the small dead hands and the patter of the little feet now silent—he marvelled that among all those faces there should be no face of expectation, none that was mobile, none into which the rhythm and poetry of life had entered. “O for a live face,” he thought; and at times he had a memory of Lady Flora; and at times he would study the living gallery before him with despair, and would see himself go on to waste his days in that joyless pastoral place, and death come to him, and his grave be dug under the rowans, and the Spirit of the Earth laugh out in a thunder-peal at the huge fiasco.|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{referring}} to my Diary {{for the year}} 1831 I find the following entry: 'This Spring, on 31st April, I went with my father to Abbotsford and left on Sir Walter Scott being taken ill.' The date here given for my visit does not correspond with that in Sir Walter's Diary, but, as there are only thirty days in April it has evidently been written by mistake for the 13th. I had just attained my twenty-first year, and as such a visit at that early age was a great event in my life, I retain a very distinct recollection of the main features of it. I recollect that Lord Meadowbank and his eldest son Alan came at the same time, and the dinner party, at which Mr. Pringle of the Haining and his brother were present. The day after our arrival Sir Walter asked me to drive with him. We went in his open carriage to the Yarrow, where we got out, and Sir Walter, leaning on my arm, walked {{up the side of}} the river, pouring forth a continuous stream of anecdotes, traditions, and scraps of ballads. I was in the seventh heaven of delight, and thought I had never spent such a day. On Sunday Sir Walter did not come down to breakfast, but sent a message to say that he had caught cold and had taken some medicine for it the night before, which had made him ill, and would remain in bed. When we sat at either lunch or dinner, I do not recollect which, Sir Walter walked into the room and sat down near the table, but ate nothing. He seemed in a dazed state, and took no notice of any one, but after a few minutes' silence, during which his daughter Anne, who was at table, and was watching him with some anxiety, motioned to us to take no notice, he began in a quiet voice to tell us a story of a pauper lunatic, who, fancying he was a rich man, and was entertaining all sorts of high persons to the most splendid banquets, communicated to his doctor in confidence that there was one thing that troubled him much, and which he could not account for, and that was that all these exquisite dishes seemed to him to taste of <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge.</b> Sir Walter told this with much humour, and after a few minutes' silence began again, and told the same story over a second time, and then again a third time.[E] His daughter, who was watching him with increasing anxiety, then motioned to us to rise from table, and persuaded her father to return to his bedroom. Next day the doctor, who had been sent for, told us that he was seriously ill, and advised that his guests should leave at once, so that the house might be kept quiet and his daughter devote herself entirely to the care of her father. We accordingly left at once, and I never saw Sir Walter again. I still, however, retain a memorial of my visit. I had fallen into indifferent health in the previous year, and been recommended Highland air. By Sir Walter's advice I was sent to live with a friend of his, the Reverend Doctor Macintosh Mackay, then minister of Laggan, in the Inverness-shire Highlands, and had passed my time learning from him the Gaelic language. This excited in me a taste for Celtic Antiquities, and finding in Sir Walter's Library a copy of O'Connor's Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores veteres, I sat up one night transcribing from it the Annals of Tighernac. This transcript is still in my library.--WILLIAM F. SKENE.|$|E

50|$|Of {{the recipes}} {{published}} in the periodical {{at the time of}} the cookbook's publishing, most were for meals considered to be basic, traditional food today: <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge,</b> lamb, meatballs, liver paste, puffin, fishballs, plukkfisk (a common dish in Iceland and the Faroes, essentially leftover fish with potatoes and other things mixed in), kleynir (common in Iceland and the Faroes, a sort of plain, doughnut-like pastry eaten with coffee), cauliflower soup, and how to make a good sausage. There were, however, a few recipes for more uncommon things, such as adaptations from so-called American recipes or instructions for how to cook pork, which by the article's own admission was something that almost no Faroers had tasted at the time. This was likely due to the fact that the periodical was also being read by fishermen who spent most of their time abroad, travelling to America, Denmark, and other countries which did have alternative foods. Some articles in the periodical were directly addressed to such fishermen.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the next}} few days, Garfield made some improvement, as the nation viewed the news from the capital and prayed. Although he never stood again, {{he was able to}} sit up and write several times, and his {{recovery}} was viewed so positively that a steamer was fitted out as a seagoing hospital to aid with his convalescence. He was nourished on <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> (which he detested) and milk from a cow on the White House lawn. When told that Indian chief Sitting Bull, a prisoner of the army, was starving, Garfield said, [...] "Let him starve," [...] then, [...] "Oh, no, send him my oatmeal." [...] X-radiation (or X-ray) usage, which likely would have helped the president's physicians determine exactly where the bullet was lodged in his body, would not be invented for another fourteen years.

5000|$|If then, {{only for}} the sake of making (a cat) more {{valuable}} as a vermin-killer, she ought to have regular and sufficient food. A cat ought to be fed at least twice a day. Let her have a dish to herself, put down to her, and removed when the meal is finished. Experience is the best teacher as regards the quantity of a cat's food, and in quality let it be varied. <b>Oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> and milk, or white bread steeped in warm milk, to which a little sugar has been added, are both excellent breakfasts for puss; and for dinner she must have an allowance of flesh. Boiled lights are better for her than horse-meat, and occasionally let her have fish. Teach your cat to wait patiently till she is served—a spoiled cat is nearly as disagreeable as a spoiled child. If you want to have your cat nice and clean, treat her now and then to a square inch of fresh butter. It not only acts as a gentle laxative, but, the grease, combining in her mouth, with the alkalinity of her saliva, forms a kind of natural cat-soap, and you will see she will immediately commence washing herself, and become beautifully clean. (N.B.—If you wish to have a cat nicely done up for showing, touch her all over with a sponge dipped in fresh cream, when she licks herself the effect is wonderful.)Remember that too much flesh-meat, especially liver,—which ought only to be given occasionally,—is very apt to induce a troublesome diarrhoea (looseness). Do not give your pet too many tit-bits at table; but whatever else you give her, never neglect to let her have her two regular meals.|$|E
40|$|Background: In a {{double-blind}} placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), it {{is necessary}} that recipes comprising the allergen cannot be distinguished from placebo. Aims of the study: We investigated whether the method of paired comparisons, a sensory difference test, could be used to test the suitability of recipes for a DBPCFC. Methods: We used two recipes, each with three concentrations of peanut or hazelnut flour. The recipe for peanut consisted of mashed potatoes with 2. 7, 8. 9, or 26. 8 mg of peanut flour, and the recipe for hazelnut of <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> with 74, 247, or 742 mg of hazelnut flour. Corresponding amounts of protein in the provided 15 g portions of each recipe were 0. 7, 2. 3, and 6. 8 mg for peanut, and 11. 6, 39, and 117 mg for hazelnut, respectively. Recipes were offered together with a placebo, and evaluated on sensory features by 81 healthy volunteers. Results: The sensory test was easy to perform. Volunteers were not able to detect peanut flour in mashed potatoes, but they recognized hazelnut flour in <b>oatmeal</b> <b>porridge</b> on visual features. Conclusions: Sensory testing by means of the method of paired comparisons is a useful method to evaluate masking of foods for DBPCFC...|$|E
