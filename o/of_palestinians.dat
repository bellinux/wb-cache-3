5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel Ariel Sharon {{and members of}} the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians</b> went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return from Camp David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians</b> left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E
5|$|The nearest {{airport is}} the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel, {{but because of}} {{restrictions}} governing the entry <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians</b> to Israel, and their {{lack of access to}} foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to Amman, Jordan to use the Queen Alia International Airport, which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{was home}} to 2,117,361 Palestinians in 2015, most of them Jordanian citizens. The first wave of Palestinian {{refugees}} arrived during the 1948 Arab Israeli war and peaked in the 1967 Six Day War and the 1990 Gulf War. In the past, Jordan had given many Palestinian refugees citizenship, however recently Jordanian citizenship is given only in rare cases. 370,000 of these Palestinians live in UNRWA refugee camps. Following the capture of the West Bank by Israel in 1967, Jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians</b> to thwart any attempt to permanently resettle from the West Bank to Jordan. West Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of Jordanian citizenship if requested.|$|E

5|$|On 16 October 2015, amid {{a wave of}} {{violence}} between Palestinians and Israelis, dozens <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians</b> overran the tomb {{and a group of}} them set it on fire with petrol bombs. Palestinian security forces dispersed them and extinguished the flames; and although the tomb itself was not apparently damaged, the women's section was reported to be heavily damaged. Israeli security forces later arrived at the scene. According to a Palestinian official, the Palestinians had attempted to set up barricades in the area to prevent home demolitions by the Israeli Army, but a group of them proceeded to attack the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take {{the sting out of}} his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich was one of his {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin {{in the eyes of the}} world. They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians</b> held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, a pro-Palestinian Lebanese MP, Maarouf Saad, {{was shot}} and killed, {{reportedly}} by the Lebanese Army. His death, from his wounds, the following month, and the massacre in April of that year of 27 Palestinians and Lebanese travelling on a bus from Sabra and Shatila to the Tel al-Zaatar refugee camp by Phalangist forces, precipitated the Lebanese Civil War. Arafat was reluctant to respond with force, but many other Fatah and PLO members felt otherwise. For example, the DFLP carried out several attacks against the Lebanese Army. In 1976, an alliance of Christian militias {{with the backing of}} the Lebanese and Syrian armies besieged Tel al-Zaatar camp in east Beirut. The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of Damour, a Phalangist stronghold where they massacred 684 people and wounded many more. The Tel al-Zaatar camp fell to the Christians after a six-month siege in which thousands <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> mostly civilians, were killed. Arafat and Abu Jihad blamed themselves for not successfully organizing a rescue effort.|$|E

5|$|In September 1973, he {{returned}} to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be at the conference. At the conference he publicly broke off relations with Israel, citing its government's {{close relationship with the}} U.S. and its treatment <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians</b> during the Israel–Palestine conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally. As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to defend Syrian territory from Israeli incursions. Leaving Algiers, Castro visited Iraq and North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|On 24 May, Abu Nuwar was {{appointed}} as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff following Annab's retirement. Glubb's dismissal {{was met with}} great enthusiasm among Jordan's inhabitants and Arab nationalists in {{and outside of the}} country. However, Abu Nuwar's ascendancy as head of the army was resented by its veteran Bedouin units; he was generally regarded as a competent staff officer, but did not have experience as a commander. As part of his efforts to modernize the army, he mandated that education was a prerequisite for advancement, an act which disproportionately affected Bedouin officers, many of whom lacked formal education. As a result of Abu Nuwar's measure, several senior Bedouin officers were retired or reassigned to non-command posts. To counterbalance opposition to him within the army's ranks, Abu Nuwar established the Fourth Infantry Brigade, which mostly consisted <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> who he believed would form an integral part of his power base within the military. Abu Nuwar's appointment also contributed to the increasing deterioration of ties between Jordan and the British government.|$|E
5|$|The Six-Day {{war began}} when Israel {{launched}} {{air strikes against}} Egypt's air force on 5 June 1967. The war ended in an Arab defeat and Israel's occupation of several Arab territories, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although Nasser and his Arab allies had been defeated, Arafat and Fatah could claim a victory, in that the majority <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> who had {{up to that time}} tended to align and sympathize with individual Arab governments, now began to agree that a 'Palestinian' solution to their dilemma was indispensable. Many primarily Palestinian political parties, including George Habash's Arab Nationalist Movement, Hajj Amin al-Husseini's Arab Higher Committee, the Islamic Liberation Front and several Syrian-backed groups, virtually crumbled after their sponsor governments' defeat. Barely a week after the defeat, Arafat crossed the Jordan River in disguise and entered the West Bank, where he set up recruitment centers in Hebron, the Jerusalem area and Nablus, and began attracting both fighters and financiers for his cause.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the nature <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> education under Israeli military occupation. Confidential interviews, currently available field research, and a theoretical background form the basis from which the author has constructed a picture of the nature <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> education under occupation. The major topics covered include a political history of the Arab-Israeli conflict including the adoption of the internal colonialism theoretical perspective; {{an analysis of the}} relationship between colonialism and education; the special significance of education to the Palestinians and the Israelis; an outline <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> education under occupation with particular reference to the post- 1967 era; an account <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> life under military occupation which details the inhumane treatment <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> residents <b>of</b> the Occupied Territories by the Israeli military authorities and settlers; the revolutionary nature of the intifada; the targeting <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> university staff and students by Israelis for especially harsh treatment; the massive Israeli crack-down on Palestinian formal and informal education and the implications for the <b>Palestinians</b> <b>of</b> the widespread and prolonged closures <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> schools and universities. The author concludes that the Israeli authorities have specifically targeted Palestinian education as an area which they want to maintain close control over. The Israelis desire the Palestinian population (particularly in the occupied Territories) to have only limited, token educational opportunities, in order to keep them ignorant, and passive. During the intifada then, the Israelis have severely disrupted all levels <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> education. Widespread school and university closures have been used by the Israelis to collectively punish the Palestinian community and hinder their chances of developing a strong independent Palestinian infrastructure which could become the foundation <b>of</b> a <b>Palestinian</b> state...|$|R
50|$|Although the Palestinian {{struggle}} {{stands as}} {{a great source of}} inspiration for many artists, Palestinian art is not solely defined by the political character <b>of</b> Palestine. <b>Palestinian</b> modern art has become part of a successive process in which Palestinian culture and heritage play an essential role. The post Nakbah period has affected a great deal of art work, however, new generations <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> artists redefined new boundaries of representation and creativity. The new generations <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> artists have presented their work in a new manner reshaping the traditional representation <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> art, and challenged the understanding of international audiences <b>of</b> the <b>Palestinian</b> Art and narrative.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, an {{official}} Lebanese government report stated that the total number of casualties for these battles was put at 3,781 dead and 6,787 injured in the fighting between Amal and the Palestinians. Furthermore, the number <b>of</b> <b>Palestinians</b> killed in inter-factional clashes between pro-Syrian and pro-Arafat organizations was around 2,000.
