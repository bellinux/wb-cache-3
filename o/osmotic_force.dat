So, {{in this study we}} wanted to investigate experimentally, on cats, the effect of changes in serum and CSF osmolarity on CSF volume and how this changes of CSF volume influence on intracranial pressure. For this purpose we used experimental models of direct ventriculo-aqueductal and ventriculo-cisternal perfusion with both isoosmolar and hyperosmolar aCSF, the free drainage of CSF from a cannula put into the cisterna magna and the measuring of CSF pressure by the cannula put into the lateral ventricle of the brain. Serum osmolarity was changed by intravenous application of 20 % mannitol or intraperitoneal administration of distilled water. Obtained result showed that the changes of <b>osmotic</b> <b>forces</b> in CSF compartments leads to changes of total CSF volume and that changes of CSF pressure are directly connected with this changes of CSF volume. The extent of CSF volume changes depends on the size of contact area of CSF system that was exposed to the changes of <b>osmotic</b> <b>forces.</b> It was also shown that with physiological intracranial pressure, without changes of <b>osmotic</b> <b>forces,</b> there was no “net” CSF formation or absorption.

Before and after axial loading the numerically simulated hydrostatic pressure compares well with the experimental ranges measured. Loading the disc decreased the height of the disc and results in an outward bulging of the outer annulus. Fiber stresses were highest on the most outward bulging on the posterior-lateral side.

40|$|Background/purpose: To {{describe}} {{the water and}} ion transport through the skin under different conditions, we developed a three-component mixture model. This model has proven to {{describe the}} transient change in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) after a change in relative humidity {{and the result of}} damage to the skin. <b>Osmotic</b> <b>forces</b> arc present in the model. To assess the influence of <b>osmotic</b> <b>forces</b> on the water uptake of the skin, we investigated transient TEWL values after 1 h application of salt solutions of different molarities (0, 1, and 4 M NaCl). Methods: Filters saturated with 0, 1, and 4 M NaCl solution were applied for 1 h under occlusion. TEWL was measured 50 – 90 min after removal of the solution. The transient water loss curves were fit with an exponential function. The area under the fitted curve was calculated and regarded as a measure for the amount of extra water absorbed in the skin. Results: For all molarities, TEWL is increased immediately after removal of the solution. In time, this increase decays until pre-application values are reached again. The rate of decrease differs significantly for all three molarities. Ninety-five per cent of the increase has been reversed after 30, 19, and 6 min for the 0, 1, and 4 M case, respectively. The amount of water absorbed differs significantly between the three molarities 7. 3 ± 2. 0; 3. 9 ± 1. 0; 2. 0 ± 0. 5 g/m 2, respectively. Conclusions: In all cases, there was an increase in TEWL immediately after removal of the solution. The significant differences in decay time and amount of water absorbed between the three molarities indicate that <b>osmotic</b> <b>forces</b> do {{play an important role in}} the water uptake...|$|R
40|$|Prior to an {{assessment}} of the role of aquaporins in root water uptake, the main path of water movement in different types of root and driving forces during day and night need to be known. In the present study on hydroponically grown barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) the two main root types of 14 - to 17 -d-old plants were analysed for hydraulic conductivity in dependence of the main driving <b>force</b> (hydrostatic, <b>osmotic).</b> Seminal roots contributed 92 % and adventitious roots 8 % to plant water uptake. The lower contribution of adventitious compared with seminal roots was associated with a smaller surface area and number of roots per plant and a lower axial hydraulic conductance, and occurred despite a less-developed endodermis. The radial hydraulic conductivity of the two types of root was similar and depended little on the prevailing driving force, suggesting that water uptake occurred along a pathway that involved crossing of membrane(s).

To examine this possibility and to investigate the osmotic properties of storage granules within cells, we investigated the effects of changes of osmolality on stability and function of cultured bovine chromaffin cells. Cell volume measurements indicated that the cells behaved as osmometers and that the intracellular osmolality rapidly equilibrated with the osmolality of the extracellular medium. Hyperosmotic solutions strongly inhibited nicotinic agonist-stimulated secretion but did not alter nicotinic agonist-stimulated Ca 2 + uptake. Hyperosmotic solutions also strongly inhibited elevated potassium-stimulated secretion but only weakly inhibited elevated K+-stimulated Ca ~+ uptake. Thus, hyperosmotic solutions inhibited secretion at a step after calcium entry.

30|$|Since we did {{not measure}} plasma volume {{immediately}} after resuscitation but waited 2  h in the present study, other more slowly acting mechanisms {{may have contributed to}} the poor plasma volume expanding effect of crystalloids compared to colloids. Infusion of crystalloids will decrease the colloid <b>osmotic</b> <b>force</b> that counteracts filtration of fluid and is likely to further decrease plasma volume expansion by crystalloids. Also, we cannot exclude that different effects on permeability by FFP and colloids on the one hand and crystalloids on the other hand could influence plasma volume expansion. If present, such an effect cannot be specific for FFP since albumin is equally effective as volume expander. Also, no support for such an effect can be found in TER data. In summary, we believe that an inflammation-induced increase in the extravascular distribution volume crystalloids in combination with a low plasma colloid osmotic pressure is the most likely reason for the poor plasma volume expanding properties of RA.|$|E

40|$|The sheaths from freshly teased nerve fibers of the prawn {{exhibit a}} {{positive}} radial birefringence, {{consistent with their}} EM appearance as highly organized laminated structures composed of numerous thin cytoplasmic sheets or laminae bordered by unit membranes and arranged concentrically around the axon. The closely apposed membranes in these sheaths are fragile and often break down into rows of vesicles during fixation. Desmosome-like attachment zones occur in many regions of the sheath. The membranes within these zones resist vesiculation and thereby provide a "control" region for relating the type of vesicles formed in the fragile portions of the sheaths to the specific fixation conditions. It is proposed that during fixation the production of artifactual vesicles is governed by an interplay of three factors: (a) direct chemical action of the fixative on the polar strata of adjacent unit membranes, (b) <b>osmotic</b> <b>forces</b> applied to membranes during fixation, and (c) the pre-existing natural relations between adjacent membranes.

40|$|A {{colloidal}} particle {{placed in}} an inhomogeneous solution of smaller non-adsorbing polymers will move towards regions of lower polymer concentration, {{in order to reduce}} the free energy of the interface between the surface of the particle and the solution. This phenomenon is known as diffusiophoresis. Treating the polymer as penetrable hard spheres, as in the Asakura-Oosawa model, a simple analytic expression for the diffusiophoretic drift velocity can be obtained. In the context of drying films we show that diffusiophoresis by this mechanism can lead to stratification under easily accessible experimental conditions. By stratification we mean spontaneous formation of a layer of polymer on top of a layer of the colloid. Transposed to the case of binary colloidal mixtures, this offers an explanation for the stratification observed recently in these systems [A. Fortini et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 118301 (2016) ]. Our results emphasise the importance of treating solvent dynamics explicitly in these problems, and caution against the neglect of hydrodynamic interactions or the use of implicit solvent models in which the absence of solvent backflow results in an unbalanced <b>osmotic</b> <b>force</b> which gives rise to large but unphysical effects.

40|$|We use {{molecular}} dynamics simulations to study osmotically driven {{transport of water}} molecules through hexagonally packed carbon nanotube membranes. Our simulation setup comprises two such semipermeable membranes separating compartments of pure water and salt solution. The <b>osmotic</b> <b>force</b> drives water flow from the pure-water to the salt-solution compartment. Monitoring the flow at molecular resolution reveals several distinct features of nanoscale flows. In particular, thermal fluctuations become significant at the nanoscopic length scales, and as a result, the flow is stochastic in nature. Further, the flow appears frictionless and is limited primarily by the barriers at the entry and exit of the nanotube pore. The observed flow rates are high (5. 8 water molecules per nanosecond and nanotube), comparable to those through the transmembrane protein aquaporin- 1, and are practically independent {{of the length of}} the nanotube, in contrast to predictions of macroscopic hydrodynamics. All of these distinct characteristics of nanoscopic water flow can be modeled quantitatively by a 1 D continuous-time random walk.

We found the vacuolar channel, Yvc 1 p, to be mechanosensitive, showing that the Ca 2 + conduit is also the sensing molecule. Although fragile, the yeast vacuole allows limited direct mechanical examination. Pressures at tens of millimeters of Hg (1 mmHg = 133 Pa) activate the 400 -pS Yvc 1 p conductance in whole-vacuole recording mode {{as well as in}} the excised cytoplasmic-side-out mode. Raising the bath osmolarity activates this channel and causes vacuolar shrinkage and deformation.

Mechanical activation of Yvc 1 p occurs regardless of Ca 2 + concentration and is apparently independent of its known Ca 2 + activation, which we now propose to be an amplification mechanism (Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release).

40|$|Dislocations {{can climb}} out of their glide plane by {{absorbing}} (or emitting) point defects (vacancies and self-interstitial atoms (SIAs)). In contrast with conservative glide motion, climb relies on the point defects' thermal diffusion and hence operates on much longer timescales, leading to some forms of creep. Whilst equilibrium point defect concentrations allow dislocations to climb to relieve non-glide stresses, point defect supersaturations also lead to osmotic forces, driving dislocation motion {{even in the absence}} of external stresses. Self-interstitial atoms typically have significantly higher formation energies than vacancies, so their contribution to climb is usually ignored. However, under irradiation conditions, both types of defect are athermally created in equal numbers. In this letter, we use simple thermodynamic arguments to show that the contribution of interstitials cannot be neglected in irradiated materials, and that the <b>osmotic</b> <b>force</b> they induce on dislocations is many orders of magnitude larger than that caused by vacancies. This explains why the prismatic dislocation loops observed by in situ transmission electron microscope irradiations are more often of interstitial rather than vacancy character. Using discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect on dislocation-obstacle interactions, and find reductions in the depinning time of many orders of magnitude. This has important consequences for the strength of particle-reinforced alloys under irradiation. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

We employed a HEPES-based buffer system which was supplemented with: (a) permeant (KCl or NaCI) or impermeant (Na-isethionate or choline-CI) ions, or (b) permeant (urea) or impermeant (sucrose) uncharged solutes. Intact and permeabilized cells had significantly different solute requirements for degranulation. FMLP-stimulated release from intact cells was supported by NaCI or Na-isethionate > KCl > choline-Cl or sucrose > urea. In contrast, the rank order of Ca 2 + -stimulated release from permeabilized cells was choline-C > Na-isethionate, KCl, or NaCl > sucrose > urea. Hypo-osmotic conditions caused increased levels of background granule release from both intact and permeabilized neutrophils. However, hypo-osmolality inhibited both FMLP-stimulated degranulation from intact cells and Ca 2 + -induced release from permeabilized neutrophils. While hyperosmotic conditions inhibited stimulated release from intact cells, this inhibition was much less pronounced in permeabilized cells when the granules were directly exposed to these solutions. In fact, hyperosmotic sucrose greatly enhanced Ca 2 + -induced secretion. Although isolated specific and azurophil granules showed some lytic tendencies in hypo-osmotic buffers, the overall stability of the isolated granules did not indicate that swelling alone could effect degranulation. These results suggest that degranulation in permeabilized cells is neither due to nor driven by simple <b>osmotic</b> <b>forces</b> (under resting or stimulated conditions) and emphasize differences obtained by bathing both the granules and plasma membrane (as opposed to membranes alone) in various solutes...|$|R

In chapter 3, ingestion of a 400 ml glycerol solution (1 g·kg- 1 body mass) increased serum osmolality (309 mosmol·kg- 1) which was associated with a 4. 0...|$|R
