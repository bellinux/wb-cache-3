40|$|Abstract. - We {{propose a}} new ab initio method {{designed}} for the accurate calculation of effective exchange integrals between atoms with numerous <b>open-shells.</b> This method applies to ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic exchange, direct or ligand-mediated exchange. Test calculations on high spin transition metal oxides such as KNiF 3, Ba 2 CoS 3 or YMnO 3 exhibit a very good accuracy compared either to the best ab initio calculations — when those are feasible — and with experimental evaluations. In {{the last two decades}} transition metal oxides attracted a lot of attention due to the discovery of novel and intriguing properties. The interest of the physicists community was first triggered by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxide compounds. Since then, many transition metal oxides exhibiting properties of practical or theoretical interest were discovered. Presently the attention of the community is mainly focused on cobalt, manganese and iron oxides. Most of these systems presen...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} series of generic results {{regarding}} the structure of nodes in the retarded Green's function G of an interacting system, as exemplified by the extended Hubbard model. In particular: (1) due to an incompatibility between interactions of nearly any form and a precise definition of series propagation, degenerate geometric nodes are split or lifted by interactions; (2) degenerate nodes generically exist at the boundary between regimes of node splitting and node lifting and, {{in the presence of}} interactions, they require fine-tuning; (3) degenerate nodes are highly sensitive to perturbation and their sensitivity increases with their degeneracy. Moreover, for high degeneracies there is a tendency toward lifting rather than splitting. We also propose a characterization of the node structure in extended Hubbard models at arbitrary filling in terms of either the eigenvalues of G, or equivalently, the roots of a polynomial. This shows that "Mott nodes" previously predicted to occur in the transmission spectra of molecular radicals are fundamentally associated with nodes in the eigenvalues of the retarded Green's function that occur in <b>open-shelled</b> systems. This is accompanied by a low-energy two-pole approximation wherein each of the eigenvalues of G are mapped onto a Fermi-liquid-like renormalization of the Anderson model, for which the exact self-energy is provided.

40|$|The enzymatic {{transfer}} of phosphoryl groups {{is central to}} the control of many cellular processes. One of the phosphoryl transfer mechanisms, that of acetate kinase, is not completely understood. Besides better understanding of the mechanism of acetate kinase, knowledge of the structure of butyrate kinase 2 (Buk 2) will aid in the interpretation of active-site structure and provide information on the structural basis of substrate specificity. The gene buk 2 from Thermotoga maritima encodes a member of the ASKHA (acetate and sugar kinases/heat shock cognate/actin) superfamily of phosphotransferases. The encoded protein Buk 2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of butyrate and isobutyrate. We have determined the 2. 5 -Å crystal structure of Buk 2 complexed with (β,γ-methylene) adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate. Buk 2 folds like an <b>open-shelled</b> clam, with each of the two domains representing one of the two shells. In the open active-site cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains, the active-site residues consist of two histidines, two arginines, and a cluster of hydrophobic residues. The ATP binding region of Buk 2 in the C-terminal domain consists of abundant glycines for nucleotide binding, and the ATP binding motif is similar to those of other members of the ASKHA superfamily. The enzyme exists as an octamer, in which four disulfide bonds form between intermolecular cysteines. Sequence alignment and structure superposition identify the simplicity of the monomeric Buk 2 structure, a probable substrate binding site, the key residues in catalyzing phosphoryl transfer, and the substrate specificity differences among Buk 2, acetate, and propionate kinases. The possible enzyme mechanisms are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation is best apportioned into two distinct parts; the first part (Chapters 2 - 4) describes several investigations of low-valent manganese carbonyl/isocyanide complexes, while the second part (Chapters 5 - 7) details the generation of coordination polymers and other supramolecular complexes using the ditopic isocyanide [CNArMes 2] 2. With this division in mind, the attentive reader will hopefully observe that the interrogative method utilized in studies of discrete, molecular complexes can be translated efficiently and effectively to materials development. 	In the first part, the mixed carbonyl/isocyanide complex Mn(CO) 3 (CNArDipp 2) 2 was isolated in gram scale {{with the aid of}} the sterically encumbering isocyanide CNArDipp 2. This green solid, which is electronically and structurally similar to the homoleptic carbonyl Mn(CO) 5, displays the radical-based chemistry expected for an <b>open-shelled,</b> low-spin d 7 organometallic species. However, the kinetic stabilization engendered by the m-terphenyl groups has allowed for a careful study of reaction products, with the notable isolation of several manganese η 2 -N,O-nitroxide radicals. The identification of these species raises doubts concerning earlier work regarding nitrosoarene spin-trapping of photolytically generated Mn(CO) 5, and underscores the importance of the cis-labilizing effect in low-valent Mn chemistry. This latter fact has been elaborated upon with the generation of multiple Mn κ 2 -carboxylates (eg. (κ 2 -O,O’-RCO 2) Mn(CO) 2 (CNArDipp 2) 2) via the cis-labilization of CO from the [Mn(CO) 3 (CNArDipp 2) 2] framework using a variety of metal carboxylate reagents. These Mn carboxylate species can serve as viable sources of the [Mn(CO) 2 (CNArDipp 2) 2]+ fragment under reductive conditions or with the use of Lewis acidic reagents. Finally, the stability of Mn(CO) 3 (CNArDipp 2) 2 permitted a thorough electrochemical study of the Mn(- 1 / 0 / 1) redox couple, with particular attention paid to the reduction of CO 2 by the manganate [Mn(CO) 3 (CNArDipp 2) 2]–. The results of this study are informative towards the design of improved Mn-based molecular catalysts for the catalytic reduction of CO 2. 	In the second part of this dissertation, the development of isocyanide coordination polymers derived from the sterically encumbering diisocyanide [CNArMes 2] 2 is described. In particular, it was found that control over nodal geometry and ligand coordination number is accomplished for Cu(I) isocyanide coordination polymers in direct analogy to previously surveyed chemistry for molecular Cu(I) m-terphenyl isocyanide complexes. The ability to favor low isocyanide coordination was further utilized in the preparation of Ni-ISOCN- 1, the first authenticated metal-organic material utilizing zerovalent metal sites as nodes. Similar to the aforementioned Cu(I) polymers, Ni-ISOCN- 1 features low isocyanide coordination, which results in a formal 16 e– count at each Ni(0) site. An assessment of the physical properties of these and other polymers is presented, providing a first glimpse into the chemistry of crystalline transition metal-isocyanide coordination polymers...|$|R

50|$|The uranium-cyclooctatetraenyl bonding {{was shown}} by {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy to be {{primarily due to}} mixing of uranium 6d orbitals into ligand pi orbitals and therefore donation of electronic charge to the uranium, with a smaller such interaction involving the uranium (5f)2 orbitals.
