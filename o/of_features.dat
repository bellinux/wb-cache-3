40|$|Abstract: Feature {{models are}} used to {{represent}} the variability and commonality of software product lines, and permit the configuration of specific applications. However, universally accepted definitions <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> and feature diagrams are missing. This paper proposes the use of hypergraphs to integrate the different versions of these concepts in an extensible characterization. The definition, validation and selection <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> configurations are based on hypergraph properties and existing algorithms. Once the formalism is stated, the definition <b>of</b> a <b>feature</b> meta-model is straightforward {{and a set of}} modeling tools, compatible with the different flavors <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> diagrams, can be readily built. Finally, configuration and transformation <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> diagrams into UML models are defined as algebraic and QVT transformations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a {{particular}} understanding <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> class behavior - the recurrent patterning together <b>of</b> certain phonological <b>features,</b> such as place of articulation and laryngeal features. The proposals build on the well known work <b>of</b> <b>Feature</b> Geometry in assuming the importance <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> classes in phonology, but differ in that <b>features</b> <b>of</b> a class are targeted directly and invidually by constraints (or rules), even when a feature class such as 'Place' is mentioned. Further, constraints mentioning feature classes are gradiently violable. Evidence for this view <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> classes comes from two sources. First, assimilation involving feature classes is sometimes only partially successful; an adequate understanding of such cases requires the proposed view <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> classes. Second, there are broad categories <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> class generalization that require it, including dissimilatory effects usually handled by the Obligatory Contour Principle. Overall, the proposals broaden the explanatory potential <b>of</b> the <b>feature</b> class idea due to Feature Geometry. At a more general level, the results here suggest that linguistic representations sometimes need to be reconsidered {{in the context of}} Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993), since they can effectively function as inviolable constraints and so hinder our understanding of the more subtle kind of phenomena revealed by analyses employing gradiently violable constraints...|$|R
