500|$|An {{observer}} in {{an accelerated}} reference frame must introduce what physicists call fictitious forces {{to account for}} the acceleration experienced by himself and objects around him. One example, the force pressing the driver of an accelerating car into his or her seat, has already been mentioned; another is the force you can feel pulling your arms up and <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> attempt to spin around like a top. [...] Einstein's master insight was that the constant, familiar pull of the Earth's gravitational field is fundamentally the same as these fictitious forces. [...] The apparent magnitude of the fictitious forces always appears to be proportional to the mass of any object on which they act – for instance, the driver's seat exerts just enough force to accelerate the driver {{at the same rate as}} the car. [...] By analogy, Einstein proposed that an object in a gravitational field should feel a gravitational force proportional to its mass, as embodied in Newton's law of gravitation.|$|E

[...] An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby.

[...] In 2014, GoLocalPDX contributor Byron Beck included Starky's in his list of the [...] "Top 12 Gay Clubs in Portland", writing: [...] "Starky's is for those who remember that brunch is best served on Sunday with a Bloody Mary. This true original is more restaurant than bar but that doesn't stop people from coming here for some of the stiffest drinks in town." [...] In 2015, Willamette Week contributors included Starky's in their list of favorite Portland gay bars.|$|E
500|$|Divine's mother, Frances Milstead, {{remarked that}} while Divine [...] "was blessed with many talents and abilities, {{he could be}} very moody and demanding." [...] She noted {{that while he was}} [...] "incredibly kind and generous", he always wanted to get things done the way that he wanted, and would [...] "tune you <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> displeased him." [...] She noted that in most interviews, he came across as [...] "a very shy and private person". Divine's Dutch friends gave him two bulldogs in the early 1980s, on which he doted, naming them Beatrix and Claus after Queen Beatrix and her husband Prince Claus of the Netherlands. On {{numerous}} occasions he would have his photograph taken with them and sometimes use these images for record covers and posters. Divine suffered from problems with obesity from childhood, caused by his love of food, and in later life his hunger was increased by his daily use of marijuana, an addiction that he publicly admitted to. According to Bernard Jay, in Divine's final years, when his disco career {{was coming to an end}} and he was struggling to find acting jobs, he felt suicidal and threatened to kill himself on several occasions.|$|E

[...] 411Mania's Adam Larck gave it {{a score of}} 6.6 out of 10 and said, [...] "For a puzzle game, Crush 3D {{is a good choice}} for 3DS fans. While the mechanic may not be as creative as it was a few years ago, it’s still a decent game to check <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> never saw the PSP version or haven’t played games like Fez or Echochrome, I’d recommend checking this out to see what crushing is all about." [...] However, Digital Spys Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and stated: [...] "Despite the five-year gap between releases, Crush 3D takes a few steps backwards in terms of visual style and presentation. Other than a rather limited and lacklustre selection of new levels and StreetPass features, it also offers very {{little in the way of}} brand new bonus content, making it difficult to recommend to anybody familiar with its PSP counterpart. Despite its shortcomings, however, Crush 3D gets it right where it counts." [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40.|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{names of}} pulquerias are {{considered}} to be important for their identity and are often representative of contemporary popular culture in Mexico. They not only told the customers what to expect from that particular establishment, but also made references to popular literature, the theater, as well as international figures or events. Opera titles such as Norma, Semiramide, and La Traviata were in use, as were literary figures, Don Quixote and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, among others. More romantic and militant names like The Great Napoleon and Mexico's Former Glories were also common. More bizarre names included Get <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> Can and The Assault Barrels of pulque were also given different names depending on their flavor or alcoholic strength, such as the [...] "pulque of the tough ones" [...] or the [...] "whining female". Many of the names written {{on the walls of the}} outside of the pulquerias were misspelled, which is thought to be a testimony to the low literacy rates in Mexico at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Goodman {{was also}} {{responsible}} for a significant step in racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white musicians could not play together in most clubs and concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by the Jim Crow laws. Goodman broke with tradition by hiring Teddy Wilson to play with him and the drummer Gene Krupa in the Benny Goodman Trio. In 1936, he added the vibraphonist Lionel Hampton to form the Benny Goodman Quartet. In 1939 Goodman added the pioneering jazz guitarist Charlie Christian to his band and small ensembles; Christian played with him until his death from tuberculosis {{less than three years}} later. This integration in music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson became the first black American to enter Major League Baseball. [...] " [...] popularity was such that he could remain financially viable without touring the South, where he would have been subject to arrest for violating Jim Crow laws." [...] According to Jazz by Ken Burns, when someone asked him why he [...] "played with that nigger" [...] (referring to Teddy Wilson), Goodman replied, [...] "I'll knock you <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> use that word around me again".|$|E

Smith and Holland have commented that [...] "she came into the room, bringing the whole of the 'East-end' in with her [...] In exactly half a minute she'd charmed the pants off them". She was considered perfect, apart from her age. Smith and Holland have commented in their book Inside Story that [...] " [...] was too young! They had said so from the beginning. By rights, they should not even be interviewing her. But wasn't she perfect, apart from her age? So different from any other 'Kathy' they had seen. Fresher. More down to earth.
