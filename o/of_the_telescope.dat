5|$|Eventually, {{following}} {{the resumption of}} shuttle flights in 1988, the launch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> was scheduled for 1990. On April 24, 1990, shuttle mission STS-31 saw Discovery launch the telescope successfully into its planned orbit.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, {{noted that the}} repair of STIS was a major victory for both the mission and the science community, as that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> {{performed}} unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed of, and looking at things like the motion of stars around black holes.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope,</b> {{the field of}} supernova discovery has expanded to other galaxies. These occurrences provide important information on the distances of galaxies. Successful models of supernova behavior have also been developed, {{and the role of}} supernovae in the star formation process is now increasingly understood.|$|E
5|$|The English {{astronomer}} John Flamsteed catalogued over 3000 stars. Further discoveries paralleled {{the improvements}} in the size and quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope.</b> More extensive star catalogues were produced by Lacaille. The astronomer William Herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet Uranus, the first new planet found. The distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the parallax of 61 Cygni was measured by Friedrich Bessel.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} saw the {{addition}} of an inner railway track, {{which was designed to}} take a third of the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope.</b> The outer railway track, which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years, was relaid in the second phase. Four bogies and their steelwork were added on the inner track, and the existing bogies on the outer track were overhauled.|$|E
40|$|Development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescoping</b> boom {{radiator}} from concept studies {{through a}} detailed design is reviewed. Particular attention {{is given to}} the scaling law for specific mass of cylindrical radiator geometries and radiator mass projections for large scale heat rejection systems. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescoping,</b> cylindrical radiator is identified as a leading candidate for rejecting tens of megawatts of thermal energy while maintaining a reasonable launch...|$|R
40|$|Design {{optimization}} {{is reported}} for glancing telescopes of increased collecting areas. Considered are nested geometries for X-ray and extreme ultraviolet telescopes, {{each of which}} generates only one singular principal surface. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> X-ray <b>telescope,</b> <b>the</b> field curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>telescope</b> serves as a standard and <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>telescopes</b> is made coplanar by a slight descrease in <b>the</b> collecting area <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>telescopes.</b> In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV <b>telescope,</b> a slight change in the maximum slope angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>telescope</b> makes <b>the</b> field curvatures coincide. Five concentric X-ray telescopes form a collecting area of approximately 900 sq cm, and a nested EUV telescope consisting of two concentric telescopes produces a collecting area of about 45 sq cm...|$|R

5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope.</b> A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} was constructed {{so that the}} bowl could be completely inverted. Originally, {{it was intended to}} use a movable tower at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> to change the receivers at the focus. However, the movable tower was never built, due jointly to funding constraints and the fact that much of the receiver equipment was placed at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> rather than at the focus. Instead, receivers were mounted on 50-foot (15-m) long steel tubes, which were then inserted by a winch into the top of the aerial tower while the bowl was inverted. The cables from the receivers then ran down the inside of this tube, which could then be connected when the {{telescope was}} pointed at the zenith. Associated receiver equipment could then be placed either in the small, swinging laboratory directly underneath the surface; in rooms at the tops of the two towers; at the base girders, or in the control building.|$|E
5|$|There {{were large}} cost overruns with the {{telescope}}'s construction, mainly {{due to the}} steeply rising cost of steel {{at the time the}} telescope was constructed. The original grant for the telescope's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased its share of the funding several times as the cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> rose; other money came from private donations. The final part of the debt from the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope,</b> £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly due to the telescope's early, very public role in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories. The final total cost for the telescope was £700,000.|$|E

5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> {{were used to}} study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope.</b> McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and checking out the suits and equipment {{that would be used}} during the EVA.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> {{as a tool}} for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth {{was at the center of}} the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E

5|$|Observations of sunspots were {{recorded}} during the Han Dynasty (206 BC–AD 220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. Averroes {{also provided a}} description of sunspots in the 12th century. The invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by Thomas Harriot, Galileo Galilei and other astronomers. Galileo posited that sunspots were {{on the surface of}} the Sun rather than small objects passing between Earth and the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Once the 342 {{individual}} {{images were}} cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, {{they had to}} be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Once the Space Telescope {{project had}} been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was given {{responsibility}} for the design, development, and construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope,</b> while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope. Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.|$|E

5|$|The Galilean moons were {{discovered}} in either 1609 or 1610 when Galileo made improvements to his telescope, which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever. Galileo's discovery showed the importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> {{as a tool for}} astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye. More importantly, the incontrovertible discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a serious blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, or the geocentric theory in which everything orbits around Earth.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the launch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope,</b> the {{returned}} images indicated a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread out over a radius {{of more than one}} arcsecond, instead of having a point spread function (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope,</b> nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E

50|$|Two CCD cameras {{where used}} to provide {{accurate}} measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telescope's</b> orientation. <b>The</b> first wide-field camera pointed towards Polaris and gave a coarse orientation up to 15 arcminutes. The other camera was mounted in the primary focus and gives an accuracy of 0.5' for stars brighter than 6th magnitude, which in total gives an accurate position tracking <b>of</b> 10' for <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> and hence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microwaves.|$|R
