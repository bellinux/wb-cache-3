5|$|A new note in Coutances' {{administration}} was his custom of issuing writs {{not in his}} own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the advice and consent <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading nobles of the realm, {{as well as the}} barons of the Exchequer. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.|$|E

5|$|Barney Burman {{supervised}} the makeup {{for the other}} aliens: his team had to rush the creation <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aliens, because originally {{the majority of them}} were to feature in one scene towards the end of filming. Abrams deemed the scene too similar to the cantina sequence in Star Wars and decided to dot the designs around the film. A tribble was placed in the background of Scotty's introduction. Both digital and physical makeup was used for aliens.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{magnitude}} <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> units comprising the SI system of measurement is ultimately {{defined by the}} mass of a -year-old, golf-ball-sized piece of metal, {{the quality of the}} IPK must be diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. Yet, despite the best stewardship, the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and the mass of the IPK have likely diverged another µg since the third periodic verification years ago. Further, the world's national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trendspersisted.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, the rehabilitation <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims of Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. But {{as soon as}} he became leader, Brezhnev began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, Garran {{was made}} the first Solicitor-General of Australia (the office was then known as Commonwealth Solicitor-General) by Billy Hughes, who had since become Prime Minister. The {{creation}} {{of the office and}} Garran's appointment to it was to some degree recognition of his existing role as Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department, in which Garran gave legal advice to several successive governments, but it also represented a formal delegation <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powers and functions formerly exercised by the Attorney-General.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo.

William de Warrenne had backed the duke during his campaign, however, and now found himself politically exposed. He was exiled and disseised of his English estates, including Castle Acre, until in 1103 the duke was able to persuade Henry to permit William to return and reclaim his lands.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield {{remained}} a major industrial city throughout {{the first half}} of the 20th century, but the downturn in world trade following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching restructuring of steel production throughout the European Economic Community led to the closure <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steelworks from the early 1970s onward. Urban and economic regeneration schemes were initiated in the late 1980s. The city centre was blighted by empty shops and improvements were halted by the Great Recession.|$|E
