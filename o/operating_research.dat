However, {{many of the}} programming models for weak consistency, which promise the largest scalability gains, have {{little in the way}} of evaluation to demonstrate the promised scalability. We present an experience report on the implementation and large-scale evaluation of one of these models, Lasp, originally presented at PPDP ` 15, which provides a declarative, functional programming style for distributed applications. We demonstrate the scalability of Lasp's prototype runtime implementation up to 1024 nodes in the Amazon cloud computing environment. It achieves high scalability by uniquely combining hybrid gossip with a programming model based on convergent computation. We report on the engineering challenges of this implementation and its evaluation, specifically related to <b>operating</b> <b>research</b> prototypes in a production cloud environment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction At rst sight the two {{problem areas}} {{constraint}} satisfaction and machine learning {{do not appear}} to be similar. The rst has a clear denition of its problem domain and a crisp denition of solutions. The second is a much broader dened problem domain, which leads to many objectives to be solved. Many research areas have focused there attention on constraint satisfaction, <b>operating</b> <b>research,</b> ant colonies, evolutionary computation and, most notable, constraint programming. Although the problems that are being studied share the same goal, which is to satisfy a set of constraints, their precise denition varies. Among these problems we nd numerous well known ones such as, k-graph colouring, 3 -sat and n-queens. For any of these problems we can transform them to a binary constraint satisfaction problem without loss of generality. This holds for any nite constraint satisfaction problem, and it means that we can solve a prob...|$|E
40|$|Achieving the {{benefits}} of a resource economy, which supports the execution of services wherever and whenever is most convenient, cost-effective, and trustworthy, represents the next big computer systems research opportunity. That is, we believe that the emphasis in the <b>operating</b> <b>research</b> community should move away from working out how to extract a few more percentage points of speed from individual computing resources, and focus instead on how to size, provision, and manage those resources to serve the needs of a rapidly diversifying set of services. HP Laboratories are embarking on a major endeavor to pursue this, and this position paper outlines our view—and a taxonomy—of some of the issues involved, and highlights some of the research opportunities that it presents. We are actively seeking research partners to collaborate with us. Note: this is a longer form of the position summary that is to appear in the proceedings of HotOS-VIII (Schloss Elmau...|$|E
