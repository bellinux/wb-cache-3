25|$|The 5000 metres final {{was held}} {{on the final day}} of the Championships. In his second-best event, Vainio {{surprised}} the Finnish audience with a bronze medal. The tight race again culminated in the final metres with Eamonn Coghlan as the overwhelming champion. As in the 10,000 metres race, Werner Schildhauer took the silver, beating Vainio by 0.14 seconds. Vainio won his bronze medal in an extraordinary way; he flung himself in the last 5 metres and fell flat <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>As</b> a result, he beat Dmitri Dmitriyev, who was fourth, by 0.04 seconds. Vainio considers this race to be the most sentimental event in his career.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E
2500|$|He {{has also}} been {{concerned}} with racial stereotyping of the media. In the documentary Naked & Famous, he explained how photographers want him to frown angrily in photos. He points to a cover of The Big Issue, where he has a milder look <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> being more representative of how he feels. In the song [...] "Tricky Kid" [...] from Pre-Millennium Tension, he wrote [...] "As long as you're humble/Let you be the king of jungle".|$|E

2500|$|The veteran West Indies cricket writer Tony Becca {{wrote in}} the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "Mendis bowls everything. With a smile <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> he caresses the ball before {{delivering}} it, he bowls the offbreak, he bowls the legbreak, he bowls the googly, he bowls the flipper, he bowls a straight delivery, he bowls them with different grips and different actions, he bowls them with a different trajectory and at a different pace, and he disguises them brilliantly. The result is that he mesmerises, or bamboozles, batsmen.|$|E
2500|$|Quranic and hadith traditions such as Sahih Bukhari {{as well as}} tafsir {{have given}} an oral {{depiction}} of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the Night Journey, when {{he is supposed to}} have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that [...] "Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion". Others say his face was flushed as if he just had a bath ("a reddish man with many freckles <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> if he had just come from a bath"). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as [...] "a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary". However, other narrations give variations in the color. Salim ibn Abd-Allah reports from his father Abdullah ibn Umar that the prophet [...] "did not say that Jesus was of red complexion", rather he was [...] "a man of brown complexion and lank hair". In contrast Abd Allah ibn Abbas says that Jesus was of [...] "moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{title track}} [...] "Like It Like That" [...] was {{named one of}} the best singles of the year by both Rave Magazine and The Music Network. [...] "Art of Love" [...] was one of the twenty songs shortlisted for the 2010 APRA Song of the Year and [...] "All to Myself" [...] was shortlisted in 2011. Sebastian {{received}} two peer judged ARIA Music Award nominations in 2010. The album was nominated for Best Pop Release, and he was nominated as Best Male Artist. Sebastian also received nominations for Most Popular Australian Artist, Most Popular Australian Album, and Most popular Australian Single for [...] "Like It Like That" [...] and [...] "Art of Love. The album received many positive reviews. Paul Cashmere from Undercover Music wrote, [...] "By covering the classics on The Memphis Album Guy Sebastian discovered Guy Sebastian. He has drawn from that epitome and created what should be considered the debut album from the next phase of his career. [...] If The Memphis Album was Guy's initiation into becoming a Soul Man then Like It Like That is the graduation. Ara Jansen said in The West Australian, [...] "While there are plenty of pop elements to the album, Sebastian has finally and unabashedly unleashed his soul side. He's also done it with a big grin <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> songs such as the wonderful [...] "Magic" [...] and the title track fizz like a soft drink on a hot day." [...] A reviewer for TV Central wrote, [...] "There's no doubt in anyone's mind that Sebastian's previous 'Memphis' record has inspired him like no other. From the first beat of his new album, it screams soul. It's bold, brash, but it works — it really works. It's {{probably one of the most}} cohesive albums from Sebastian to date. Listening from start to finish, you truly feel like you’ve experienced a musical journey. [...] The album, while not without its flaws, is definitely one of the most artistically complex records we've heard from an 'Australian Idol' artist to date. It's rich, multi-layered and engaging." ...|$|E
