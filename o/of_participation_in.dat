5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England, Pantulf held {{lands in}} Shropshire from Earl Roger de Montgomery. The earl settled {{a number of}} his Norman vassals, {{including}} Pantulf, on his new lands in Sussex and Shropshire. Pantulf was probably not present at the Battle of Hastings, likely due to Earl Roger's lack <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the campaign of conquest. Pantulf's grants totalled eleven manors located in Hodnet Hundred. Pantulf's lands in England were centered on Wem, and are considered a feudal barony, making Pantulf the first Baron of Wem. Although he had substantial lands in England, Pantulf continued to spend most of his time on the continent.|$|E

Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer set up an Interagency Task Force, composed of Oregon State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and executed search warrants in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found in a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were convicted on charges of attempted murder and served 29months of 20-year sentences in a minimum-security federal prison.|$|E

Tech's win against Temple was its last in the regular season. The Hokies lost their final two regular-season games, dropping their overall record to 8–4. To some Virginia Tech fans, the Insight Bowl invitation accepted on December1 was a disappointment after a season that began with hopes <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the national championship game.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the notion}} <b>of</b> {{community}} <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> tourism originates {{from the general}} concept <b>of</b> community <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> development studies, {{the subject of the}} former seems to have evolved and popularized in isolation from the meaning and scope of its origin. This article reveals that such isolation has ushered in a rigid and simple paradigm <b>of</b> community <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> tourism. This is assumed to be of one form and has universal validity without considering the existence of the different circumstances at various tourist destinations. It is suggested that the concept <b>of</b> community <b>participation</b> should be re-considered in terms of an adaptive categorical paradigm, which incorporates a range of various forms <b>of</b> community <b>participation.</b> These forms <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> are outlined for a variety of abstract situations with the aim of illustrating the legitimacy of different forms <b>of</b> community <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> tourism...|$|R

In January 2014, Batista returned to WWE after having left in May 2010, and promptly won the 2014 Royal Rumble match for a slot in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Batista's win and Daniel Bryan's lack <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the Royal Rumble match was heavily booed by the live crowd at the event. At Elimination Chamber, Randy Orton successfully defended his championship in the Elimination Chamber match to set up Orton versus Batista (who still received a negative fan reaction at Elimination Chamber when he defeated Alberto Del Rio) for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Daniel Bryan also participated in the Elimination Chamber match, but was the last wrestler eliminated due to interference by Director of Operations Kane, who was affiliated with the Authority.|$|E
5|$|Even {{cities and}} states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their {{merchant}} Republics, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> governance and belief in liberty. The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.|$|E
5|$|The {{shift in}} support by the Soviet Union {{motivated}} the Barre regime to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on Russia's Cold War arch-rival, the United States, {{which had been}} courting the Somali government for some time. The U.S. eventually gave extensive military support. Following the disastrous Ogaden War, Barre's government began arresting government and military officials under suspicion <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the abortive 1978 coup d'état. Most {{of the people who}} had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad where they formed the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force. Among these opposition movements were the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA), a Gadabuursi group which had been formed in the northwest to counter the Somali National Movement (SNM) Isaaq militia.|$|E
