40|$|In {{my office}} I have a large, {{comfortable}} red chair. This chair is a whole—an object composed of its parts. Applying mereological concepts to objects {{allows us to}} make sense of how objects in <b>the</b> world ~like <b>chairs!</b> that occupy a region of space are composed of many smaller objects that occupy subregions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region. The objects that occupy these subregions are held to be proper parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as a whole. The approach allows us to understand many facts about <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> objects that compose <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> and to explain a number of seemingly contradictory claims we might want to make about it. We might say <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> is curved and flat, meaning that <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that is <b>the</b> armrest is curved and <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that is <b>the</b> seat is flat. We might say <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> is clean and dirty, meaning that <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that is <b>the</b> headrest is clean but the armrest where I placed my sandwich is dirty. Although I can pick out at least two different objects that have a left armrest as a proper part, an object that is my <b>chair</b> including <b>the</b> headrest and an object that is my <b>chair</b> excluding <b>the</b> headrest, I don’t think there are two distinct left armrests in my office, since the first object entirely overlaps the second. But what if we want to think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> in a different way? We can think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as having many different spatial components, but we can also think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as having many different qualitative components. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> has armrests, a headrest, a back and a seat, but it also has <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> being red, of being large, and being comfortable. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> is <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> its spatial components, but it might very well be that <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> is also <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> its qualitative components. In other words, it makes sense to think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as composed <b>of</b> many smaller ~and partly overlapping! objects that are spatial parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> Why not also think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as being made up of many smaller ~and partly overlapping! objects that are qualitative parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair?</b> Indeed...|$|R

2500|$|Ecclesiastical {{privileges}} {{were granted}} to the order almost from its beginning. Alexander IV freed the order from {{the jurisdiction of the}} bishops; Innocent VIII, in 1490, {{granted to the}} churches of the order indulgences such as can only be gained by making the Stations at Rome; Pope Pius V placed the Augustinians among the mendicant orders and ranked them next to the Carmelites. Since the end of the 13th century the sacristan of the Papal Palace was always to be an Augustinian friar, who would be ordained as a Bishop. This privilege was ratified by Pope Alexander VI and granted to the Order forever by a Bull issued in 1497. The holder of the office was Rector of the Vatican parish (of which the chapel of St. Paul is the parish church). To his office also belonged the duty of preserving in his oratory a consecrated Host, which had to be renewed weekly and kept in readiness in case of the pope's illness, when it was the privilege of the papal sacristan to administer the last sacraments to His Holiness. The sacristan had always to accompany the pope when he travelled, and during a conclave it was he who celebrated Mass and administered the sacraments. He lived at the Vatican with a sub-sacristan and three lay brothers of the order (cf. Rocca, [...] "Chronhistoria de Apostolico Sacrario", Rome, 1605). Augustinian friars, as of 2009, still perform the duties of papal sacristans, but the appointment of an Augustinian bishop-sacristan lapsed under Pope John Paul II with the retirement of Petrus Canisius Van Lierde in 1991.
