5|$|In April, the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company was {{reattached}} to the 7th Infantry Division, {{this time}} to the 31st Regimental Combat Team. The company spent the month training replacements, with up to 400 enlisted men filtering into the company. By May, the process <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> these men to other units began as U.S. Army units throughout Korea, driven by necessity, began slowly desegregating. The Rangers eventually settled at a force of 123 men, among them the first white member of the unit, medic Joe Russo.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> climate <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> and trainees&# 39; personality on transfer {{behavior is}} studied systematically by using interview, questionnaire survey and on-the-spot experiment. The results are: 1, The climate <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training influences directly the frequency <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> behavior. Time and leaders&# 39; positive feedback can discriminate between different levels <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> behavior. 2, Trainees&# 39; {{idea of the}} applicability of training programs can influence directly the frequency <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> behavior. In the meantime, trainees&# 39; idea of the applicability of training programs is influenced directly by zero feedback, his flexibility and self-efficacy. 3, Zero feedback, time support and colleagues&# 39; support can discriminate between different type <b>of</b> climate <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training. In different type of climate, the percent of trainees showing different level <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> behavior is significant different. 本研究通过访谈、问卷调查和现场研究等多种方法，考察了中学教师在接受了一种新的教学方法培训后，组织气氛和个人特征对其迁移行为的影响。结果发现： 1 、受训者对迁移气氛的知觉直接影响迁移行为发生的次数：即个人知觉到的培训迁移气氛越好，迁移发生的次数越多。其中，时间支持和领导的积极反馈能最大程度地区分迁移行为的不同强度水平。 2 、领导有无反馈是影响受训者对训练内容实用性看法的重要环境因素，而受训者对训练内容实用性的看法直接影响迁移行为发生的次数：即越认为训练内容有实用价值，迁移发生的次数就越多。此外，受训者对训练内容实用性的看法还受到自己的灵活性和自我效能的影响。 3 、领导有无反馈、时间支持和同事支持等因素是区分培训迁移气氛类型的关键指标。在具有不同迁移气氛类型的组织中，受训者在迁移行为不同强度水平上的发生率有显著差异：培训迁移气氛较好的组织，受训者更多地表现出高强度水平的迁移行为；而培训迁移气氛较差的组织，受训者更多地表现出低强度水平的迁移行为或没有迁移行为...|$|R

5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

5|$|The ZX81 {{was also}} sold {{for a while}} in {{duty-free}} shops at UK airports. However, this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> their technology to their own states' industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, where they would be assembled for the Chinese market.|$|E

5|$|The {{generation}} of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH {{relies on the}} malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.|$|E

5|$|In November 1909, {{industrialist}} Ambrose O'Brien of Renfrew, Ontario, was in Montreal {{to purchase}} supplies for a railway contract. At {{the request of}} the Renfrew Creamery Kings hockey team, he attended the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA) meetings, held at the Windsor Hotel, to represent Renfrew in its application to join the league. At the meeting, the ECHA team owners rejected Renfrew's application. Later that day the ECHA's owners chose to disband their league and form the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) in a bid to exclude the Montreal Wanderers, who had upset the other owners when they moved into a smaller arena that would reduce the visiting team's share of gate receipts. In the lobby of the hotel, O'Brien met Jimmy Gardner, manager of the Wanderers, and discussed forming a new league which would include Renfrew, the Wanderers, and two teams that O'Brien owned in the Ontario mining towns of Cobalt and Haileybury. Gardner suggested that O'Brien start a team of francophone players based in Montreal, forming a rivalry with the Wanderers. As a result, the National Hockey Association (NHA) was founded on December 2, 1909, and Les Canadiens were created two days later, initially financed by O'Brien with the intent <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> ownership to francophone sportsmen in Montreal as soon as possible.|$|E

5|$|Merit can {{be gained}} {{in a number}} of ways, such as giving, virtue and mental development. In addition, there are many forms of merit-making {{described}} in ancient Buddhist texts. A similar concept of kusala (Sanskrit: kusala) is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, his teachings, the Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma), and the Sangha. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. Merit has become part of rituals, daily and weekly practice, and festivals. In addition, there is a widespread custom <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> merit to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that kingship was often legitimated through it, and still is.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 2000s the Caribous were {{becoming}} difficult to maintain, and {{were no longer}} capable of operating in war zones as they lacked electronic warfare systems {{and other forms of}} self-protection. As a result, it was decided in late 2008 to retire the aircraft and replace them with Beechcraft King Air 350s on an interim basis until another tactical transport entered service. The Caribous were gradually retired from May 2009, the last leaving service on 27 November that year when A4-140 was flown to Canberra and handed over to the Australian War Memorial for preservation. By the time the aircraft were retired, No. 38 Squadron had been operating Caribous for 45 years. Three King Air 350s were transferred to No. 38 Squadron from the Army's 173rd Surveillance Squadron on 20 November 2009, and deliveries of a further five newly built aircraft were completed in July 2010. At least one of the Army aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with ground surveillance sensors, and this capacity was retained after it was transferred to the Air Force. No. 38 Squadron's King Airs were initially operated by Army personnel, who were given the choice <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> to the RAAF or converting to helicopters at the end of their posting. The other No. 38 pilots were converted to the type at the Army's Oakey Army Aviation Centre, but the squadron began conducting its own conversion courses after the second batch of five aircraft were delivered.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bricius's earlier appeal, it was {{not until}} Andreas de Moravia's episcopate that Pope Honorius III issued his bull on 10 April 1224 authorising his legates Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop of Caithness, Robert, Abbot of Kinloss and Henry, Dean of Ross to examine the {{suitability}} <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> the cathedra to Elgin. The Bishop of Caithness and the Dean of Ross performed the translation ceremony on 19 July 1224. On 10 July, Alexander II (Alaxandair mac Uilliam) had agreed to the transference in an edict that referred to his having given the land previously for this purpose. The land grant predated the Papal mandate and there is evidence that building had started in around 1215.Construction of the cathedral was completed after 1242. Chronicler John of Fordun recorded without explanation that in 1270 the cathedral church and the canons' houses had burned down. The cathedral was rebuilt in a larger and grander style to form the greater part of the structure that is now visible, work that is supposed to have been completed by the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296. Although Edward I of England took an army to Elgin in 1296 and again in 1303, the cathedral was left unscathed, as it was by his grandson Edward III during his assault on Moray in 1336.|$|E

5|$|In {{his letter}} of 29 October 1862, Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory named yard number 294 as North Carolina and number 295 as Mississippi. In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell, {{notified}} Bulloch, who had purchased the ships {{in his own}} name, that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation currently at war. Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863, nominally {{on behalf of the}} Egyptian government, with the intention <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea. The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships, so this was superficially plausible. North Carolina, later HMS Scorpion, was given the cover name of El Toussan and Mississippi, later HMS Wivern, received the name of El Monnassir. Lord Russel, prompted by the protests of the U.S. Ambassador, Charles F. Adams queried the Egyptian government directly and confirmed that this was merely a subterfuge to disguise the true ownership of the vessels. The Admiralty was prompted to send a guard ship, , to watch over the newly launched El Toussan after Lairds had made a request to begin sea trials in September. The Liverpool Collector of Customs was instructed not to let the ship leave her graving dock under any circumstances and the Surveyor of Customs finally seized the ships on 9 October.|$|E
