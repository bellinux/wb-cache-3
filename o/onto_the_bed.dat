5|$|David is revived {{and walks}} to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David’s {{memories}} to reconstruct the Swinton home and explain to him that they cannot make him human. However, David insists that they recreate Monica from DNA in the lock of hair. The Mecha warn David that the clone can only live for a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and watches the two lie peacefully together.|$|E
5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin {{out of the room}} and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that he will be in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E
25|$|Juvenal's {{account of}} her nights spent in the brothel is {{commonly}} portrayed. Gustave Moreau paints her leading another man <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> while an exhausted prostitute sleeps in the background, while in Paul Rouffio's painting of 1875 she reclines bare-breasted as a slave offers grapes. The Dane Peder Severin Krøyer depicts her standing, her full body apparent under the thin material of her dress. The ranks of her customers are just visible behind the curtain against which she stands (see above). Two drawings by Aubrey Beardsley were produced for a private printing of Juvenal's satires (1897). The one titled Messalina and her companion shows her {{on the way to}} the brothel, while a rejected drawing is usually titled Messalina returning from the bath.|$|E

5000|$|New {{arrangement}} {{of flowers and}} bedding plants are brought in each planting season. Some of the techniques {{used in the past}} range from formal French parterres to old-fashioned English cottage gardens. Using a technique called [...] "tossing", gardeners throw the different varieties of flower packs <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> in a natural flow to coordinate growth. Flowers don't usually appear in single, neat rows of the same flower type.|$|R

25|$|Boyer {{told the}} police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She claimed that after they left a local nightclub together, she had {{repeatedly}} requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She claimed that once {{in one of the}} motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and that she was certain he was going to rape her. According to Boyer, when Cooke stepped into the bathroom for a moment, she quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She claimed that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long in responding, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothing back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called police.|$|E
25|$|The Prince crawls {{into bed}} and appears to sleep. However, he begins writhing as he dreams of the troupe of swans {{emerging}} from under and behind, dancing around him. He wakes from his nightmare, checking under his bed and around his room for swans. His tortured expression and jerky movements convey the Prince in turmoil. His lead Swan then slowly emerges from within the Prince's bed. The Swan dances with the Prince and assures him of his continued affection. But, {{the rest of the}} swans turn on the lead Swan when he makes it clear that he values his relationship with the Prince more than he does them. They separate the two and begin attacking the Prince before the Swan leaps in to save him. The Swan embraces the Prince and envelops him in his wings. The swans' fury increases and their next attack dismembers the Swan, who then disappears. Heartbroken and despondent, the Prince wails and collapses <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> The Queen then finds her dead son's body and breaks down in sobs. However, in death the Prince and the Swan are reunited; as shown by a tableau depicting the lead Swan tenderly holding the young Prince in his arms.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} precaution {{is to remove}} and reduce trash and rubbish from your property, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cans—especially if they are stored {{right next to the}} house. With attached garages, block off house access by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under it. This minimizes chances that any spider can crawl <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally worn should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. However, spiders' perched legs allow them to walk over most pesticides, making the use of chemicals to eradicate the spiders impractical and unnecessarily toxic. A 2014 study indicates that fumigation may be more effective than previously believed. Sticky traps placed along floor boards offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the flatbed concept, the {{aircraft}} was designed to sit low to the ground. Trucks would drive up to the aircraft and push their loads <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> back. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> of <b>the</b> aircraft consisted of parallel I-beams as the primary load-carrying structure, with metal sheeting on the top to provide a smooth walking surface. Like most cargo aircraft, rollers could be raised through small holes cut in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to allow palletted loads to be rolled on and off without requiring a forklift.|$|R

500|$|Drake was {{featured}} in full-page interviews in the pop press. In July, Melody Maker referred to the album as [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "interesting", though NME wrote in October that there was [...] "not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining". It received radio plays from the BBC's more progressive disc-jockeys such as John Peel and Bob Harris. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions. In an interview his sister Gabrielle said: [...] "He was very secretive. I knew he was making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into my room and said, 'There you are.' He threw it <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and walked out!" ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1967 Leigh was rehearsing {{to appear}} with Michael Redgrave in Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance when her {{tuberculosis}} recurred. Following {{several weeks of}} rest, she seemed to recover. On the night of 7 July 1967, Merivale left her as usual at their Eaton Square flat to perform in a play, and he returned home just before midnight to find her asleep. About 30 minutes later (by now 8 July), he entered the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor. She had been attempting {{to walk to the}} bathroom and, as her lungs filled with liquid, collapsed and suffocated. Merivale first contacted her family and later was able to reach Olivier, who was receiving treatment for prostate cancer in a nearby hospital. In his autobiography, Olivier described his [...] "grievous anguish" [...] as he immediately travelled to Leigh's residence, to find that Merivale had moved her body <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Olivier paid his respects, and [...] "stood and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between us", before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements; Olivier stayed until her body was removed from the flat.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Knock You Down", {{directed}} by Chris Robinson, premiered on March 23, 2009. The video begins with Hilson slowly falling backwards onto a bed, and then West appears and raps the introduction. Both start reflecting on their previous relationship, before the clip flashes {{back to the}} previous events. West is shown to be an artist, who is painting a portrait of Hilson. Hilson and West begin to caress each other, as she as shown in several seductive poses in a bed and sings {{in front of a}} white backdrop. The video returns to the present, showing Hilson and West breaking up, as both of them fall backwards onto the floor, similar to the way Hilson falls <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> in the opening sequence. Visual effects come into play greater in this scene, as when West falls, he shatters into pieces. Ne-Yo then appears, and sings his lines in front of a grey backdrop. Ne-Yo and Hilson proceed to go on a date at a party in West and Hilson's apartment, and are seen being affectionate by West. He then confronts Hilson, and Ne-Yo also approaches the duo before Hilson walks off, torn between the two men. The clip ends with Hilson falling backwards onto a bed, in similar fashion as the opening scene.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{subjects}} are often placed {{in contact with}} the scanner, there is a high potential for damage to the scanner from objects scratching or cracking the surface of <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> or from liquids that might seep from the subject into the interior of the scanner. These risks can be mitigated by placing a layer of transparent protective material, such as clear plastic film, <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> scanner <b>bed.</b> Another approach is to invert the scanner, so <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> is above <b>the</b> subject and not quite in contact with it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} examples {{were produced}} by simply placing an existing light gun mount directly <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> cargo <b>bed</b> of <b>the</b> truck, and securing it in place. No armouring or special support equipment was installed. One such conversion {{was performed in}} Congo-Leopoldville in 1965, using an Oerlikon GAI 20 mm anti-aircraft gun. Another conversion in the Congo entailed mounting pods with 2.75" [...] aircraft rockets on a pedestal on <b>the</b> cargo <b>bed,</b> but this proved unsuccessful.|$|R
500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room. They said they heard two women arguing about {{business}} matters. Selena told Saldívar {{she could no}} longer be trusted, and demanded Saldívar return her financial papers. Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and saw the gun. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed it at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's maintenance man, reported hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen clutching her chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing the gun at her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll shoot me again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again". DeLeon tried to talk to Selena but noticed she was beginning to lose consciousness; he said she was moaning and moving less often. DeLeon noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} police, Taylor {{eventually}} admitted kidnapping Tiernan. His explanation {{was that he}} had not visited Haughley Gill for many years, but by chance had been there on the afternoon that Tiernan went missing. He said that she had walked past him and on impulse he had seized her from behind, tied her hands behind her back with a dog leash, covered her head with his jacket and forced her to walk to his home in nearby Cockshott Drive. He then forced her into his bedroom and <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> where, during a struggle, she had fallen off the bed, striking her head on the floor. He said that he had then picked her up by the scarf around her neck, at which point she had died, and claimed that her death was an accident.

2500|$|Powell now {{drew out}} his knife and burst through Seward's bedroom door. Inside were Seward's Army nurse, Sergeant George F. Robinson, and Fanny Seward. Powell slashed Robinson on the forearm, and the soldier fell. Powell punched Fanny in the face, and leapt <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> He savagely began knifing Seward {{in the head}} and throat. Seward, however, was wearing a metal and canvas splint on his jaw, which {{deflected}} most of Powell's blows. However, Powell managed to cut through Seward's right cheek and along his right throat, causing a large amount of blood flow. Believing Seward to be dead, Powell hesitated. Just then, Seward's other son, Augustus, burst into the room. Powell stabbed him several times. [...] Augustus dragged Powell onto the floor. [...] Robinson and Augustus Seward wrestled with the strong, uninjured Powell. Powell stabbed Robinson in the chest and shoulder, and slashed a portion of Augustus' scalp from his head.|$|E
2500|$|Chesham {{is located}} in the Chiltern Hills and from its lowest point of [...] above sea level rises up valley sides. It lies at the {{confluence}} of four dry valleys formed by the meltwater {{at the end of the}} last ice age which deposited <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> rock of chalk, alluvial gravels, silts, on which the town now sits. Subsequent periods of subsidence and submergence deposited clays and flints. The River Chess is a chalk-stream which rises from three springs; to the north-west along the Pednor Vale at Frogmoor, at Higham Mead to the north of the town, and to the west near the Amersham Road which converge in the town near to East Street. The river was known as the Isen from at least 12th century when it is found contributing to the name to the nearby hamlet of Isenhampstead, later to divide and become the manors of Isenhampstead Chenies and Isenhampstead Latimer and persisting until the 19th century. It has been suggested, but not established, that the old name 'Isen', which derives from the Anglo-Saxon word for iron, refers to the chalybeate or iron-charged spring waters which feed the river Today the streams are culverted and conducted below street level before emerging at Waterside and flowing in a south easterly direction towards Latimer. From there it flows to the north of Chenies and on towards Rickmansworth after which it joins the River Colne.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{feasible}} to punt one-handed while turning the punt pole over, {{in the manner}} of a paddle wheel. The advantage this gives the punter is that the pole can be dropped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed</b> at an angle forward of the punter's position, while the momentum of the punt continues. When the pole comes vertical, pressure can be applied immediately to drive the punt forwards. This style of punting is particularly effective at providing power more continuously in fast-flowing streams or when the punt is moving quickly. This technique is more easily executed in shallow rivers.|$|R
