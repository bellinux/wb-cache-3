50|$|All {{systems are}} 24-bit single address machines. Programmer-accessible {{registers}} are A (accumulator), B (extension), X (index), and P (program counter—14 bits), plus an <b>overflow</b> <b>indicator.</b> The 9300 has three index registers X1 through X3 {{which can be}} used as base registers to allow access to memory above 16K words. The W and Y registers are used for input/output.|$|E
5000|$|The display {{has eight}} digits, {{with both a}} minus sign and an <b>overflow</b> <b>indicator</b> dot on the right hand side. The decimal point is [...] "floating"—it is {{positioned}} automatically by the calculator logic. This was an advanced feature for the time; many desk calculators of this era had fixed decimal points and required very wide displays to maintain a minimum level of precision across {{the entire range of}} numbers available. The QT-8D's floating decimal allowed its display to be much narrower while still keeping eight digits of precision.|$|E
5000|$|The F or File spec(s) are next, and {{describes}} the files {{used in the}} program. Files may be disk files (DISK) or may be devices such as a printer (PRINTER), the workstation (WORKSTN), keyboard (KEYBORD), unformatted display (CRT or DISPLAY), or user-defined (SPECIAL). Record size, block size, <b>overflow</b> <b>indicators,</b> and external indicators are described. It is possible that an RPG program will not use any F specs.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} between the QT-8D and the QT-8B {{in the operation of}} the right-hand display tube, which contains both a minus-sign indicator and a large dot. On the QT-8D, this dot is used as an <b>overflow</b> error <b>indicator.</b> But on the QT-8B, it acts as a low-battery indicator; overflow errors are signalled by displaying all zeroes with all the decimal point indicators lit.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this effort}} is to use multi-scale {{modeling}} to understand the effect of operator-environment interaction and the global environment on Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) processes. Models were developed at 3 scales, including: 1) Operator interaction with computer interface (Agent-based model); 2) Processing of Time Sensitive Targets (TST, Petri net model); and 3) Mission-scale objectives, strategy, and processes, including adversary response and global and US public perception (System Dynamics model). An existing Petri net model of the operational architecture of the AOC was updated for this study; all models were developed with subject matter experts. Petri nets are well-suited for modeling systems that consist {{of a number of}} processes that communicate and need synchronization. The focus of the Petri net process model is critical event response time and manpower utilization. These measures of operation are computed and passed to the System Dynamics model. Information <b>overflow</b> <b>indicators</b> for operators (e. g., operator stress) and the effect of operator reduction on critical event processing both have high degrees of interdependence with the overall time critical event processing, and were found to be critica...|$|R
5000|$|The display, {{like that}} of the QT-8D, is an 8-digit vacuum {{fluorescent}} display with nine individual tubes: eight digit tubes and a single extra tube for the minus sign and <b>overflow</b> <b>indicator.</b> As with the QT-8D, the tubes are Iseden [...] "itron" [...] tubes with the same distinctive [...] "handwritten" [...] digit style and the same half-height [...] "0". However, unlike the QT-8D, the EL-8 digit tubes only have eight segments to form digits, and the EL-8's extra tube is positioned at the top right corner of the display instead of at its right end. A separate lamp serves as a power indicator.|$|E
50|$|The {{programmed}} operator facility {{allows the}} instruction code field {{to indicate a}} call to a vector of subroutine addresses. The six bit instruction code allows up to 64 programmed operators (octal 00 through 77). If the P bit is set, an instruction code of xx is treated as a call to location 1xx (octal). The location of the POP instruction is saved in location zero. Bit zero of location zero is set to the current value of the <b>overflow</b> <b>indicator</b> and the indicator is reset. Bit 9 of location zero is set to '1'b to indicate an indirect address, allowing the programmed operator routine to indirectly access the data specified in {{the address of the}} POP instruction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{display is}} a vacuum {{fluorescent}} display, {{the first such}} display ever used in a production calculator. It is built from nine individual tubes, one tube for each digit and a single extra tube for the minus sign and <b>overflow</b> <b>indicator.</b> These Iseden [...] "itron" [...] tubes have a unique digit style which {{is very different from}} today's seven-segment displays. Each digit tube uses nine segments to form the digits, and these segments are of varying shapes and lengths, producing a distinctive digit style reminiscent of handwritten digits. The digit [...] "0" [...] is only half the height of the other digits. This half-height zero makes it easy to distinguish zeros from other digits, a useful feature since the QT-8D does not have logic to suppress leading or trailing zeros in the display.|$|E
