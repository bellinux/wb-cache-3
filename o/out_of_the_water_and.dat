5|$|Some marine halfbeaks, {{including}} Euleptorhamphus velox and Euleptorhamphus viridis, {{are known}} for their ability to jump <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> glide over the surface for considerable distances, and have consequently sometimes been called flying halfbeaks.|$|E
5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping completely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water)</b> <b>and</b> tail-slapping. These activities may {{have a variety of}} purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, Aulie's {{father was}} using a tractor to clear snow off a frozen dugout in {{anticipation}} of an outdoor shinny game on New Year's Day. The ice could not support {{the weight of the}} tractor, and he fell through. Aulie was able to pull his father <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> get him to safety. The Canadian Red Cross honoured Aulie with their Rescuer Award for his act.|$|E

25|$|In both cases, {{having a}} crew member lift <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mast <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> may help speed the process, as <b>the</b> {{greatest}} challenge <b>of</b> righting a capsized boat is shedding <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> from <b>the</b> sails. A helpful step, where possible (on a loose footed sail), is to disconnect <b>the</b> clew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail from the boom, which prevents the sail from scooping up <b>water</b> as <b>the</b> sail lifts <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> bow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsized vessel should be pointed towards the wind {{so that when the}} sail starts to lift <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>the</b> wind can catch underneath the sail and help right the boat.|$|R
5|$|In the water, {{several of}} the crew — most notably Lieutenant, junior grade, Stanton F. Kalk, the officer-of-the-deck when the torpedo struck — began to get men <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> into the life rafts. Kalk worked in the cold Atlantic water to {{equalize}} the load among the various rafts, but died of exhaustion and exposure.|$|E
5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they {{elevate the}} upper part of their bodies vertically <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 2013, SeaWorld Orlando opened Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin to the public.

5|$|The {{following}} day, at the beach, Brody sees a {{dark shadow}} that approaches the swimmers. Thinking it is a shark, he frantically orders everyone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> causes a panic by firing his gun. However, the shadow is {{revealed to be}} a school of bluefish. His fears are confirmed when he acquires a close-up picture of the shark from the diver's camera. The Amity town council, including local developer Len Peterson, deny the evidence and fire Brody.|$|E
5|$|By morning, most of {{the posse}} has deserted, and those {{remaining}} are attacked by Jake's former gang. Jake, who had stolen the gang's loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control but it is foiled. The aliens begin attacking them again and Ella is captured. Jake jumps aboard the ship and attacks the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash. The alien survives the crash, suddenly comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> attacks Ella, fatally wounding her. Jake then kills the alien with his wrist-blaster.|$|E
5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> spin {{three or four times}} about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E

5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, she lifted her head <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia {{went on to win the}} relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her head <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> seeing the American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 {{of a second}} going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics {{was the only time}} that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish. These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still {{spent most of their}} time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E

5|$|This ray can be {{identified}} by its dark dorsal surface covered in white spots or rings. Near {{the base of the}} ray's relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic fins, are several venomous, barbed stingers. Spotted eagle rays commonly feed on small fish and crustaceans, and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed. These rays are commonly observed leaping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats, in one incident resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys. The spotted eagle ray is hunted by a wide variety of sharks. The rays are considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums. They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
25|$|Volans {{represents}} {{a type of}} tropical fish that can jump <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> glide through the air on wings.

25|$|After being {{deposited}} {{in their final}} resting places the carcasses were torn apart, had their bones trampled and chewed by scavengers. These processes left the abrasion and toothmarks seen on the bones preserved at H97-02.

25|$|Rescue, {{and where}} necessary, resuscitation, should be started {{as early as}} {{possible}} for best results.

Only rescue ventilation is practicable in <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> chest compressions require a suitable platform, so in-water assessment of circulation is pointless.
