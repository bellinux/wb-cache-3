As already shown, inward transport is much faster for aminophospholipids than for phosphatidylcholine.

Magnesium depletion of the erythrocytes considerably decreases the <b>outward</b> <b>rate</b> of both aminophospholipids to values close to that of phosphatidylcholine.

40|$|Neurofilaments are {{synthesized}} in {{the cell}} body of neurons and transported outward along the axon via slow axonal transport. Direct observation of neurofilaments trafficking in live cells suggests that the slow <b>outward</b> <b>rate</b> of transport {{is due to the}} net effects of anterograde and retrograde microtubule motors pulling in opposition. Previous studies have suggested that cytoplasmic dynein is required for efficient neurofilament transport. In this study, we examine the interaction of neurofilaments with cytoplasmic dynein. We used fluid tapping mode atomic force microscopy to visualize single neurofilaments, microtubules, dynein/dynactin, and physical interactions between these neuronal components. AFM images suggest that neurofilaments act as cargo for dynein, associating with the base of the motor complex. Yeast two hybrid and affinity chromatography assays confirm this hypothesis, indicating that neurofilament subunit M binds directly to dynein intermediate chain. This interaction is blocked by monoclonal antibodies directed either to NF-M or to dynein. Together these data suggest that a specific interaction between neurofilament subunit M and cytoplasmic dynein is involved in the saltatory Neurofilaments are neuron-specific intermediate filaments composed of three subunits...|$|E

Reductions in either extracellular sodium or chloride shifted the charge-voltage (Q-V) and time constant-voltage (τ-V) characteristics of the process towards more negative potentials. The shift induced by sodium (TMA+, tetramethylammonium substitution) was stronger than that induced by chloride (acetate substitution), and the shift of τ was accompanied by a decrease in its maximum value. Increasing extracellular Ca 2 + did not produce significant shifts in Q-V and τ-V curves. The negative shift of the Q-V curve upon chloride reduction and the decrease {{in the value of the}} relaxation time constant, τ, when either sodium or chloride were lowered, contrasted with the prediction of the Hill-Boltzmann interpretation of the process. Analysis of the unidirectional rate constants under different conditions revealed that both sodium and chloride shifted the <b>outward</b> <b>rate</b> more than the inward rate; furthermore, the shifts induced by sodium were larger than those induced by chloride.

The dipeptide Gly-Gln at pH 6. 5 or 7. 5 was used as substrate. Raising {{the temperature in the}} range 20 - 30 °C causes an increase in the maximal transport-associated current (I (max)) with a Q (10) close to 4. Higher temperatures accelerate the rate of decline of the presteady-state currents observed in the absence of organic substrate. The voltage dependencies of the intramembrane charge movement and of the time constant of decline are both shifted towards more negative potentials by higher temperatures. The shift is due to a stronger action of temperature on the <b>outward</b> <b>rate</b> of charge movement compared to the inward rate, indicating a lower activation energy for the latter process. Consistently, the activation energy for the complete cycle {{is similar to that of}} the inward rate of charge movement. Temperature also affects the binding rate of the substrate: the K (0. 5) -V curve is shifted to more negative potentials by higher temperatures, resulting in a lower apparent affinity in the physiological range of potentials.

40|$|ABSTRACT Membrane {{potential}} {{and the rate}} constants for anion self-exchange in dog, cat, and human red blood cells {{have been shown to}} vary with cell volume. For dog and cat red cells, the <b>outward</b> <b>rate</b> constants for SO 4 and CI increase while the inward rate constant for SO 4 decreases as cells swell or shrink. These changes coincide with the membrane potential becoming more negative as a result of changes in cell volume. Human red cells exhibit a similar change in the rate constants for SO 4 and CI ettlux in response to cell swelling, but shrunken cells exhibit a decreased rate constant for SO 4 efflux and a more positive membrane potential. Hyperpolarization of shrunken dog and cat red cells is due to a volume-dependent increase in PN,. If this increase in PNa is prevented by ATP depletion or if the outward Na gradient is removed, the response to shrinking is identical to human red cells.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{mutation}} K 448 E in the rat GABA transporter rGAT 1 was studied using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and voltage clamp. At neutral pH, the transport-associated current vs. voltage (I–V) relationship of the mutated transporter was different from wild-type, and the pre-steady-state currents were shifted towards more positive potentials. The mutated transporter showed an increased apparent affinity for Na+ (e. g. 62 vs. 152 mm at − 60 mV), while the opposite was true for GABA (e. g. 20 vs. 13 μm at − 60 mV). In both isoforms changes in [Na+]o shifted the voltage dependence of the pre-steady-state and of the transport-associated currents by similar amounts. In the K 448 E form, the moved charge and the relaxation time constant were shifted by increasing pH towards positive potentials. The transport-associated current of the mutated transporter was strongly reduced by alkalinization, while acidification slightly decreased and distorted {{the shape of the}} I–V curve. Accordingly, uptake of [3 H]GABA was strongly reduced in K 448 E at pH 9. 0. The GABA apparent affinity of the mutated transporter was reduced by alkalinization, while acidification had the opposite result. These observations suggest that protonation of negatively charged residues may regulate the Na+ concentration in the proximity of the transporter. Calculation of the unidirectional rate constants for charge movement shows that, in the K 448 E form, the inward rate constant is increased at alkaline pH, while the <b>outward</b> <b>rate</b> constant does not change, in agreement with an effect due to mass action law. A possible explanation for the complex effect of pH on the transport-associated current may be found by combining changes in local [Na+]o with a direct action of pH on GABA concentration or affinity.

40|$|The inner moons of Jupiter and Saturn migrate {{outwards}} due to {{tidal energy}} dissipation within the planets, {{the details of}} which remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that resonance locking between moons and internal oscillation modes of the planet can produce rapid tidal migration. Resonance locking arises due to the internal structural evolution of the planet and typically produces an <b>outward</b> migration <b>rate</b> comparable {{to the age of}} the Solar system. Resonance locking predicts a similar migration time-scale but a different effective tidal quality factor Q governing the migration of each moon. The theory also predicts nearly constant migration time-scales a function of semimajor axis, such that effective Q values were larger in the past. Recent measurements of Jupiter and Saturn's moon systems find effective Q values that are smaller than expected (and are different between moons), and which correspond to migration time-scales of ∼ 10 Gyr. If confirmed, the measurements are broadly consistent with resonance locking as the dominant source of tidal dissipation in Jupiter and Saturn. Resonance locking also provides solutions to several problems posed by current measurements: it naturally explains the exceptionally small Q governing Rhea's migration, it allows the large heating rate of Enceladus to be achieved in an equilibrium eccentricity configuration, and it resolves evolutionary problems arising from present-day migration/heating rates...|$|R

The conglomerates occur at different structural levels: 1) in units belonging to the Umbro-Marche-Romagna Sequence, both underlying and overlying the allochthonous deposits of the Val marecchia thrust sheet, 2) in units belonging to the epi-Ligurian Sequence. The analysis of pitted and striated pebbles and cobbles, mesoscopic faults and fractures show evidences of three episodes of tectonic deformations. The first one, characterized by a NE-SW trending subhorizontal extension, is of Messinian age. This extensional episode could be related to the slowing in the <b>outward</b> migration <b>rate</b> of the Apennine deformational front during the late Tortonian-Messinian. The other episodes of deformations, of early Pliocene-Pleistocene age, are characterized by a main subhorizontal shortening direction trending NE-SW, the older one, and NW-SE, the younger one. The episode characterized by the NE-SW shortening direction is probably related to the main tectonic stress field acting in the Northern Apennines during the Neogene. The NW-SE shortening direction is more difficult to explain. It was detected in other sectors of the chain, where was linked to the tectonic activity of local trasverse structural elements. Indeed in the studied area there are transverse (transfer faults) structures that could be linked to this shortening direction.

Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an applied membrane potential to investigate the ion flux of bacterial sodium channel NaVMs. 5. 9 µs simulations with 500 mM NaCl suggest different mechanisms for inward and outward flux. The predicted inward conductance rate of ∼ 27 ± 3 pS, agrees with experiment. The estimated <b>outward</b> conductance <b>rate</b> is 15 ± 3 pS, which is considerably lower. Comparing inward and outward flux, the mean ion dwell time in the selectivity filter (SF) is prolonged from 13. 5 ± 0. 6 ns to 20. 1 ± 1. 1 ns. Analysis of the Na+ distribution revealed distinct patterns for influx and efflux events. In 32. 0 ± 5. 9 % of the simulation time, the E 53 side chains adopted a flipped conformation during outward conduction, whereas this conformational change was rarely observed (2. 7 ± 0. 5 %) during influx. Further, simulations with dihedral restraints revealed that influx is less affected by the E 53 conformational flexibility. In contrast, during outward conduction, our simulations indicate that the flipped E 53 conformation provides direct coordination for Na+. The free energy profile (potential of mean force calculations) indicates that this conformational change lowers the putative barriers between sites SCEN and SHFS during outward conduction.

This K+ current was characterized according to its time dependence and its steady-state activation. IK+. out could be described in terms of a Hodgkin-Huxley type conductance.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of hydrodynamical {{simulations}} of the orbital evolution of planets undergoing runaway gas accretion in radiative discs. We consider accreting disc models with constant mass flux through the disc, and where radiative cooling balances the effect of viscous heating and stellar irradiation. We assume that 20 - 30 M_⊕ giant planet cores are formed in the region where viscous heating dominates and migrate outward under the action of a strong corotation torque. In the case where gas accretion is neglected, we find evidence for strong dynamical torques in accreting discs with accretion rates Ṁ≳ 7 × 10 ^- 8 M_/yr. Their main effect is to increase <b>outward</b> migration <b>rates</b> {{by a factor of}} ∼ 2 typically. In the presence of gas accretion, however, runaway outward migration is observed with the planet passing through the zero-torque radius and the transition between the viscous heating and stellar heating dominated regimes. The ability for an accreting planet to enter a fast migration regime is found to depend strongly on the planet growth rate, but can occur for values of the mass flux through the disc of Ṁ≳ 5 × 10 ^- 8 M_/yr. We find that an episode of runaway outward migration can cause an accreting planet formed in the 5 - 10 AU region to temporarily orbit at star-planet separations as large as ∼ 60 - 70 AU. However, increase in the amplitude of the Lindblad torque associated with planet growth plus change in the streamline topology near the planet systematically cause the direction of migration to be reversed. Our results indicate that a planet can reach large orbital distances under the combined effect of dynamical torques and gas accretion, but an alternative mechanism is required to explain the presence of massive planets on wide orbits.

40|$|Abstract] One of {{the notable}} {{attributes}} of the Gasdynamic Mirror (GDM) fusion propulsion system {{is the fact that}} it lends itself readily to thrust control due to asymmetry in the magnetic field configuration. GDM is a magnetic plasma confinement device that has been proposed as a potential propulsion system. It differs from the standard “collisionless” mirror in that it operates at a much higher plasma density and is generally designed with a large aspect ratio to provide plasma stability. When a plasma is injected into such a device, the electrons tend to escape through the mirrors more readily due to their small mass, leaving behind an excess of ions and correspondingly a positive electrostatic potential. Such a potential accelerates the ions while slowing down the electrons until both species drift <b>outward</b> at equal <b>rate.</b> Of special importance to its value as a propulsion device is the effect of magnetic field asymmetry on such an electrostatic potential. Numerical simulations have been carried out to study this phenomenon and to quantify the role of asymmetry on the overall performance of the system. Experiments will be conducted in order to validate the theoretical and simulation models and to provide a basis for further assessment of GDM as a propulsion device with variable thrust capability...|$|R

It was hypothesized that there would be genetically determined differences in outward remodelling and IMT induced by carotid flow alterations.

40|$|Many ultracompact HII regions {{exhibit a}} cometary {{morphology}} in radio continuum emission. In such regions, a young massive star is probably ablating, through its ultraviolet radiation, the molecular cloud clump that spawned it. On {{one side of}} the star, the radiation drives an ionization front that stalls in dense molecular gas. On the other side, ionized gas streams outward into the more rarefied environment. This wind is underpressured with respect to the neutral gas. The difference in pressure draws in more cloud material, feeding the wind until the densest molecular gas is dissipated. Recent, time-dependent simulations of massive stars turning on within molecular gas show the system evolving in a direction similar to that just described. Here, we explore a semi-analytic model in which the wind is axisymmetric and has already achieved a steady state. Adoption of this simplified picture allows us to study the dependence of both the wind and its bounding ionization front on the stellar luminosity, the peak molecular density, and the displacement of the star {{from the center of the}} clump. For typical parameter values, the wind accelerates transonically to a speed of about 15 km / s, and transports mass <b>outward</b> at a <b>rate</b> of 10 ^- 4 solar masses per year. Stellar radiation pressure acts to steepen the density gradient of the wind. Comment: Preprint format, including 21 figures at the en...|$|R
40|$|During patch-clamp {{recordings}} {{from fish}} retinal ganglion cells, excess depolarization by inward current passage across uncompensated series resistance can {{give rise to}} the appearance of fast and tetrodotoxin-blockable outward K`+current activation (Pignatelli & Ishida Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 24 : 1026, 1998). This fast outward current component was detected during recordings without series resistance compensation, but not it 80 % series resistance compensation was applied. Also, we noted that this outward current increased in amplitude at rates resembling those of previously reported Na+-activated K+ currents. Because previous voltage-clamp studies suggested that Na+activated K+ current contributes to spike repolarization in neurons, we calculated membrane potential changes produced by depolarizing current injections into cells modelled by measured values of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ conductances. leak conductance, and whole-cell capacitance. When <b>outward</b> current activation <b>rate</b> was set as fast {{as that of the}} tetrodotoxin•sensitive outward component, repetitive spikes were not elicited at any stimulus current intensity, and spikes that overshoot zero rnV could not be generated. If, instead, these calculations incorporated K+ current activation rates measured with 80 % series resistance compensation, current injections of 8 - 100 pA elicited repetitive spiking at frequencies (10 - 85 Hz) resembling those recorded from ganglion cells in various preparations. Our calculations imply that whole-cell outward K+ current activation rates recorded without series resistance compensation are inordinately rapid, and that Na+-activated K+ currents are unlikely to repolarize single spikes.

30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that {{periodic}} disturbance can inoculate cane stands against both subsequent stressors and eventual senescence. We observed that, in certain subplots, populations of cane culms all died, reflecting patchy senescence in some cases and complete stand die-offs in others. Such events were particularly pronounced in 2004, a drought year, among large forest stands and unburned small forest stands; however, subplots went extinct during later years as well. We suspect that the greater areal extent of large forest stands reflects older rhizome systems with poorer clonal integration than those of small stands. We have demonstrated previously that cane stands spread <b>outward</b> at similar <b>rates</b> regardless of stand type (Gagnon et al. 2007), so large stands may have been expanding longer (with older rhizome systems) than small stands. We speculate that compensatory growth triggered by the removal of culms rejuvenated the still-integrated rhizome systems of small stands, and thereby rendered them more resistant to subsequent drought and other stressors. The fact that large stands appeared to be more susceptible to die-offs {{regardless of whether they}} burned suggests that cane stands that go too long without disturbance may be susceptible to demographic collapse. Hughes (1966) described similar die-offs but was unable to attribute the phenomenon to any specific cause, although he suggested disease as the culprit. Cane restoration efforts should anticipate similar local die-offs after multiple years without disturbance. Given these observations, we propose that burning still-vigorous cane stands reduces their likelihood of subsequent local extinction, especially in a shaded environment.|$|R
