5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E

If one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him, the flock behaved very much like a school of fish. Understanding how humans interact in crowds is important if crowd management is to effectively avoid casualties at football grounds, music concerts and subway stations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{authors and}} {{scholars}} addressed this issue. Malcolm Gladwell discuses the “Law of the Few” in his book, The Tipping Point. He suggests that highly connected and rare {{people have the}} ability to shape the world. This handful of unique people can spread the word around and create a social epidemic through their connections, charm, personality, expertise and persuasiveness. The notion that a small group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> influence others and cause them to adopt products, services or behaviors was the subject of another book, The Influentials by Edward Keller and Jonathan Berry. This minority comprises a wide range of people who act as experts in their field and their opinions are highly regarded by their peers.|$|E
25|$|Substantial {{damage to}} tissue {{anywhere}} {{within the region}} shown in blue on the figure below can potentially result in aphasia. Aphasia can also sometimes be caused by damage to subcortical structures deep within the left hemisphere, including the thalamus, {{the internal and external}} capsules, and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia. The area and extent of brain damage or atrophy will determine the type of aphasia and its symptoms. A very small number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> experience aphasia after damage to the right hemisphere only. It has been suggested that these individuals may have had an unusual brain organization prior to their illness or injury, with perhaps greater overall reliance on the right hemisphere for language skills than in the general population.|$|E

25|$|Current {{criminal}} legislation {{does not}} provide for special penalties for acts that target another by reason of his sexual orientation, age or health status. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offense of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms, and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> then, of course, be also one defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups {{of people who are}} victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.|$|E
25|$|Social class {{mobility}} {{could be}} low because of housing inequality. People who live or {{were born in}} the housing inequality, they have more problems to solve instead of making money. And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does our next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but {{this is the only way}} they can get into higher class in the future. Not so many <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> make it.|$|E
500|$|Avondale was {{developed}} {{later as a}} new area of Riverside on former Magnolia Plantation land.

In 1920 an investment group led by Telfair Stockton purchased Edgewood and surrounding land to develop as an exclusive upscale subdivision. Named for Cincinnati's Avondale neighborhood, plantation of former Edgewood owner James R. Challen, the development was billed as [...] "Riverside's Residential Ideal", which was [...] "...desirable because the right kind of people have recognized its worth and because the wrong kind <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> find property more to their liking elsewhere." ...|$|E

500|$|The book {{states that}} Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Robert Jastrow were all {{fiercely}} anti-communist and they viewed government regulation {{as a step}} towards socialism and communism. The authors argue that, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives. Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded. The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science. The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: [...] "small numbers <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to {{his newly}} formed label. Early into the album production, {{in a meeting}} where Borchetta and Swift {{discussed}} potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, [...] "That's your first single." [...] She responded, [...] "Well. That's how that works then." [...] Prior to that event, Swift {{did not believe that}} the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song [...] "is reminiscent, and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost. I {{think one of the most}} powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That was a really good song to start out on, because a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> relate to wanting something you can't have." [...] When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was [...] "cool" [...] and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 season, {{prior to}} the hiring of Gaston, the Blue Jays had a record of 35–39. Once Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record. The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> teach you how to hit, but not a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> teach you how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, but you want to do more than that. Gene always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage than just that one run".|$|E

2500|$|Like {{the term}} Kadazan-Dusun, Sama-Bajau is a {{collective}} term, {{used to describe}} several closely related indigenous people who consider themselves a single distinct bangsa ("ethnic group" [...] or [...] "nation").

2500|$|At times, {{the term}} traitor {{has been used}} as a {{political}} epithet, regardless of any verifiable treasonable action.

Likewise the term traitor is used in heated political discussiontypically as a slur against political dissidents, or against officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents. In certain cases, as with the Dolchstoßlegende (Stab-in-the-back myth), the accusation of treason towards a large group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be a unifying political message.
