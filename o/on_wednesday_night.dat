5|$|As per the {{regulations}} for , three practice sessions were held, two {{one and a}} half-hour sessions on Thursday and another one-hour session on Saturday morning. After a thunderstorm <b>on</b> <b>Wednesday</b> <b>night,</b> {{the first of the}} two free practice sessions held on Thursday morning, started with every driver setting their installation laps on intermediate tyres. The track soon dried up, and the cars changed to slick tyres. Nico Rosberg had an early shunt when he clipped his front wing exiting the Tabac corner though he did not sustain considerable damage to his car. The two Mercedes drivers swapped places {{at the top of the}} time sheets for most of the session, until late improvements pushed Rosberg down the order to finish ninth, more than a second off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rookie Max Verstappen surprised the paddock by finishing second, two-tenths of a second down on Hamilton. The Renault-powered cars all finished within the top seven, while the Williams team ended the session in tenth and seventeenth, owing to the car not being well suited for wet and low-temperature conditions.|$|E

25|$|The vessel {{struck a}} reef off Bass Point, Shell harbour, late <b>on</b> <b>Wednesday</b> <b>night,</b> and was badly holed. As she {{appeared}} likely to founder quickly, she was abandoned, {{and the crew}} of 11 rowed to Kiama, five miles away. Returning to the scene early yesterday morning, they were astonished {{to find that the}} Incoming tide had refloated the vessel, which was rapidly drifting out to sea. The crew, in the ship's dinghy, reached Kiama at 2 o'clock yesterday morning, and Captain James Reid, the master, reported the matter to the police. The men rested until shortly before daybreak, and then set out in a launch owned by Mr. C. Stead to retrieve their personal belongings. As they drew near the spot where the Koraaga had gone ashore they found she had disappeared, and it was feared that she had already foundered. Within a few minutes, however, the vessel was seen about {{a mile and a half}} offshore, drifting southward under the influence of a strong current and a stiff north-easterly breeze. Her trawling flags were still flying, and she gave the appearance of being under control. So much so that, several hours later, two Interstate steamers passed without noticing anything amiss. By noon the trawler, now low in the water, was several miles out to sea. Members of the crew overtook the Koraaga early in the morning and went on board. They found that the engine room was flooded, and the vessel was being kept afloat by watertight compartments. There were then two possibilities, either that she would founder when the weight of water broke down the bulkheads, or that she would go ashore on Gerringong Beach. Word was sent to Sydney, and Cam and Sons, the owners, dispatched the trawler Charlie Cam, equipped with towing gear, to the scene. It was hoped to reach her before she went ashore or sank, and that she would have sufficient buoyancy to enable her to be towed to Sydney. She disappeared, however, before the Charlie Cam had reached the scene, and the salvage trawler was recalled. Worn out by his all day vigil beside the sinking vessel, Captain Reid returned to Kiama at 4 o'clock. He reported that the trawler had heeled over and foundered an hour before, about five miles east of Black Head, Gerringong, 9 miles from Kiama. Captain Reid was on board until just before the foundering. He said that the Koraaga sank in two minutes. The trawling flags and signals were still flying when she disappeared.|$|E
500|$|Although Ferguson later praised television's part in {{aiding the}} Premier League, he {{maintained}} the league's freedom of control continued to impair club's chances in European competitions: [...] "You get some ridiculous situations when you're playing <b>on</b> <b>Wednesday</b> <b>night</b> in Europe {{and then at}} lunchtime the following Saturday. You ask any manager if they would pick that themselves... there'd be no chance." [...] He likened television to God and said [...] "When you shake hands with the devil {{you have to pay}} the price." [...] Arsène Wenger also criticised the influence television companies had over scheduling: [...] "At the moment, television decides. You cannot have decisive games with one team playing Friday and Tuesday, and another on Sunday and Tuesday." ...|$|E
500|$|Fears were {{as high as}} ever {{among the}} traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion. There was an {{outbreak}} of general panic <b>on</b> <b>Wednesday</b> <b>night</b> in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington. A light in the sky over Fleet Street started a story that 50,000 French and Dutch immigrants had risen, widely rumoured to have started the fire, and were marching towards Moorfields to finish what the fire had begun: to cut the men's throats, rape the women, and steal their few possessions. Surging into the streets, the frightened mob fell on any foreigners whom they happened to encounter, and were only appeased, according to Evelyn, [...] "with infinite pains and great difficulty" [...] and pushed back into the fields by the Trained Bands, troops of Life Guards, {{and members of the}} court.|$|E

500|$|On Wednesday, however, The Village Voice ran {{reports of}} the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that {{included}} unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: [...] "forces of faggotry", [...] "limp wrists", and [...] "Sunday fag follies". A mob descended upon Christopher Street once again and threatened to burn down the offices of The Village Voice. Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people. The incidents <b>on</b> <b>Wednesday</b> <b>night</b> lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: [...] "The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression." ...|$|E
500|$|The first dry {{session of}} the week {{occurred}} <b>on</b> <b>Wednesday</b> <b>night</b> {{in the first of}} three qualifying sessions. The first timed laps of the session immediately saw the qualifying record for the track, in its current configuration, broken. Bernhard's first timed lap of three minutes and 17.767 seconds in the No. 17 Porsche broke the [...] record by nearly a second, only to be followed by Jani in the No. 18 Porsche with a three minutes and 16.887 seconds lap time. Neither driver improved their times over the rest of the session, giving the No. 18 Porsche provisional pole position, followed in third by the remaining Porsche 919. The Audi trio followed, with Duval leading the group but nearly three seconds off the pole pace. Toyota's best effort came from Sarrazin in the No. 2 car, nearly two seconds adrift of the Audi's lap times. Nissan's lap times improved to a three minutes and 38.468 seconds, but were over twenty seconds off the pole position time.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall {{has stated}} that the band's songs [...] "have always come from our {{ministry}} in the church. They start as messages <b>on</b> <b>Wednesday</b> <b>night,</b> things we're teaching our teenagers and their families"; Until the Whole World Hears retains that same formula. Hall also stated that the musical sound of their songs is written {{so as not to}} conflict or detract from the lyrics, comparing the musical elements of his songs to a plate that the 'meat', the lyrics, are served on. A philosophy that [...] "fuels" [...] the album is the idea of putting [...] "faith in action"; Hall stated that he wanted believers to become more active in their faith, and to [...] "get out of their pews and get involved in what God is doing". [...] "Always Enough" [...] was written when a member of Hall's church was killed in Afghanistan; the band was unable to attend his funeral, as they were {{on the other side of}} the United States and couldn't cancel their tour dates. Another song on the album, the title track, was inspired by the Biblical character of John the Baptist. Several songs on the album are reinventions of hymns, which Hall enjoyed experimenting with; Hall retained the lyrics of the songs while reworking their melodies.|$|E
