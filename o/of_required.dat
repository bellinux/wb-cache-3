5|$|After a {{knee injury}} due to an {{accident}} with a scooter and a few weeks <b>of</b> <b>required</b> rest and adjusted training, Van Dijk won a stage in the Energiewacht Tour; {{because she did not}} earn enough bonus seconds during the tour she finished second in the general classification. Van Dijk also won the individual time trial and the road race in the Omloop van Borsele. A few days later she started in the Gracia-Orlova, where she won the prologue and a stage and helped her teammate Evelyn Stevens to win the general classification. Back in the Netherlands, in Emmen, she became the Dutch time trial champion in the elite category {{for the second time in}} her career.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein {{announced}} plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum, reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>required</b> courses from 21 to 15.

The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Casey {{returned}} to Washington, D.C. in October 1940 to become {{chief of the}} Design and Engineering Section in the Construction Division of the Office of the Quartermaster General, under Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. An enormous construction program was underway {{to meet the needs}} of World War II. Working with a staff that included George Bergstrom, a former president of the American Institute of Architects, Casey set about revising the standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new triangular division, 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the cantonment areas required, and the length <b>of</b> <b>required</b> roads and utility lines. Casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 April 1941.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro was {{primarily}} evaluated during the Applicant phase, accurately on March 14, 2008, when the IOC Working Group released its report {{after four days}} of meetings, giving a weighted-average score of 6.4 to the bid. It {{was based on a}} thorough technical analysis of the projects presented on the Application File, which was developed by the Rio de Janeiro bid committee after having access to the Olympic Games Knowledge Management database as well as the official IOC Technical Manuals. The Working Group composed of several experts assessed the city's potential for staging successful Olympic Games according to eleven criteria presented in the Application File. Rio de Janeiro's highest score came from Government support, legal issues and public opinion due to the strong government commitment, and its lowest from Safety and security due to the city's chronic problems of violence. Experience in major events also yielded good scores, while a shortage in the number <b>of</b> <b>required</b> hotel rooms undermined the accommodation theme. The Working Group also gave an 8.3 score to Tokyo, 8.1 to Madrid, 7.0 to Chicago, 6.9 to Doha, 5.3 to Prague and 4.3 to Baku; being the basis for the selection to the Candidature phase. On September 18, 2008, after the shortlist which concluded the Application phase, the IOC announced the composition of its Evaluation Commission. The commission inspected the four Candidate cities under the leadership of Nawal El Moutawakel, who also chaired the Evaluation Commission for the bid process of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.|$|E
5|$|The German {{military}} {{was one of}} the pioneers of the use of airborne formations, conducting several successful airborne operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided to form their own airborne formations. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of two British airborne divisions, {{as well as a number}} of smaller units. The British airborne establishment began development on 22 June 1940, when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. Despite the Prime Minister's desire to have 5,000 airborne troops within a short period, a number of problems were rapidly encountered by the War Office. Very few gliders existed in Britain in 1940, and these were too light for military purposes, and there was also a shortage of suitable transport aircraft to tow gliders and carry paratroopers. On 10 August, Churchill was informed that although 3,500 volunteers had been selected to train as airborne troops, only 500 could currently begin training due to limitations in equipment and aircraft. The War Office stated in a memorandum to the Prime Minister in December 1940 that 500 parachute troops could probably be trained and be ready for operations by the spring of 1941, but this figure was purely arbitrary; the actual number that could be trained and prepared by that period would rely entirely on the creation of a training establishment and the provision <b>of</b> <b>required</b> equipment.|$|E

In 1956, the policy <b>of</b> <b>requiring</b> escorts and <b>of</b> <b>requiring</b> women to enter through the North entrance was finally dropped. In 1968, the last place in the Union {{to have such a}} policy, the Billiards Room, ended its policy and admitted women on an equal basis.|$|R
5|$|The Minerals Management Service (renamed on 18 June 2010 to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOE)) is the {{regulatory}} and inspecting body for {{offshore oil drilling}} and rigs in the United States of America. According to an Associated Press investigation, certain safety documentation and emergency procedure information, including documentation for the exact incident that later occurred, was absent. The exact number <b>of</b> <b>required</b> monthly inspections performed varied over time; the inspections were carried out as required for the first 40 months, but after that around 25% of inspections were omitted, although the investigation notes this is partly expected, since there are circumstances such as weather and movement which preclude an inspection. Reports {{of the last three}} inspections for 2010 were provided under Freedom of Information legislation. Each of these inspections had taken two hours or less.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Hamilcars that the War Office {{required}} frequently fluctuated. In May 1942 the War Office asked GAL for 360 Hamilcars {{to be used}} in two major airborne operations, but this was found to be unrealistic; not only was the production rate for the glider far too slow to accommodate this large number, the same number of tugs needed to tow the gliders could not be found. In November 1943 the War Office issued another report in which it increased the number <b>of</b> <b>required</b> gliders to 800, an even more unrealistic number; by the time production of the Hamilcar ended, a total of 344 had been built. GAL produced an initial run of 22 Hamilcars, which included the two prototype models and ten pre-production aircraft required for evaluation trials. Subsequent production of parts was assigned to a series of sub-contractors called the 'Hamilcar Production Group', which included the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, the Co-operative Wholesale Society and AC Cars. Production for the glider was targeted to begin in late 1941 with approximately 40–50 to be completed {{by the end of that}} year; in reality this was overoptimistic, with the planned 40–50 only being completed by June 1944.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, the {{requirements}} for the service project and specific troop leadership were defined, and the number <b>of</b> <b>required</b> merit badges returned to 11. The Eagle Scout candidate was required to plan, develop, and carry out a leadership service project. Minor changes {{were made to the}} required merit badge list in 1970. In 1972, the Improved Scouting Program increased to 24 the number of merit badges needed to obtain Eagle, while reducing the list <b>of</b> <b>required</b> merit badges to ten, eliminating badges that required swimming and outdoor skills—both of which were later reinstated, and adding the requirement to show leadership during the service project. In 1978, the number of merit badges needed for Eagle was lowered to the original 21, and the number <b>of</b> <b>required</b> merit badges was set at 11 (this was changed to 12 in 1993). In 2014 the number of Eagle required merit badges were increased to 13.|$|E
