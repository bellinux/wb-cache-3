5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the <b>oil</b> <b>producers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since the {{completion}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in 1977, the government of the state of Alaska has been reliant on taxes paid by <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> and shippers. Prior to 1976, Alaska's personal income tax rate was 14.5 percent—the highest in the United States. The gross state product was $8billion, and Alaskans earned $5 billion in personal income. Thirty years after the pipeline began operating, the state had no personal income tax, the gross state product was $39billion, and Alaskans earned $25billion in personal income. Alaska moved from the most heavily taxed state to the most tax-free state.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{state control}} over the oil sector, the RCC began a program of nationalization, {{starting}} with the expropriation of British Petroleum's share of the British Petroleum-N.B. Hunt Sahir Field in December 1971. In September 1973, {{it was announced that}} all foreign <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> active in Libya were to see 51% of their operation nationalized. For Gaddafi, this was an important step towards socialism. It proved an economic success; while gross domestic product had been $3.8 billion in 1969, it had risen to $13.7 billion in 1974, and $24.5 billion in 1979. In turn, the Libyans' standard of life greatly improved over the first decade of Gaddafi's administration, and by 1979 the average per-capita income was at $8,170, up from $40 in 1951; this was above the average of many industrialized countries like Italy and the U.K.|$|E

5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 {{million barrels per day}} despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E
5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of {{hundreds of billions of}} US dollars per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E
25|$|The crisis had a {{major impact}} on {{international}} relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> to lift the embargo in March 1974.|$|E

25|$|Significant oil {{producing}} {{countries will}} have a national purchasing advantage over similar countries with no oil to sell.

25|$|However, in the 1980s, other <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> (especially Saudi Arabia) {{raised their}} production, and oil prices dropped. Venezuela's oil {{revenues}} dropped substantially, and {{per capita income}} declined by about 25%. This imperiled economic and social stability in general. The government's overspending on programs caused massive levels of debt with poverty, inflation and unemployment rising while income declined. Corruption was also widespread with crime increasing yearly, making the Venezuelan public, primarily the poor who especially felt neglected, become outraged.|$|E

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of civilization, when pottery and mudbricks were made by hand, to now, mudrocks have been important. The first book on mudrocks, Geologie des Argils by Millot, was not published until 1964; however, scientists, engineers, and <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> have understood the significance of mudrocks since {{the discovery of the}} Burgess Shale and the relatedness of mudrocks and oil. Literature on this omnipresent rock-type has been increasing in recent years, and technology continues to allow for better analysis.|$|E
25|$|Elections in July saw Sirimavo Bandaranaike {{become the}} world's first elected female head of {{government}}. Her government avoided further confrontations with the Tamils, but the anti-communist {{policies of the}} United States Government led to a cut-off of United States aid and a growing economic crisis. After an attempted coup d'état by mainly non-Buddhist right-wing army and police officers intent on bringing the UNP back to power, Bandaranaike nationalised the oil companies. This led to a boycott of the country by the oil cartels, which was broken with aid from the Kansas <b>Oil</b> <b>Producers</b> Co-operative.|$|E

40|$|Defense Energy SeminarMany {{people fear}} that a hostile foreign <b>oil</b> <b>producer</b> {{will be able to}} damage Americans and, for that reason, think that the U. S. {{government}} should ensure U. S. access to oil. But a foreign government cannot cause Americans to line up for gasoline. Only price controls imposed by U. S. governments can do that, which is what they did in the 1970 s. A hostile foreign <b>oil</b> <b>producer</b> cannot inflict more than a small amount of harm on Americans by refusing to sell oil to Americans, unless this <b>oil</b> <b>producer</b> is willing to cut its own output. If a hostile foreign <b>oil</b> <b>producer</b> maintains output but cuts exports to the United States, it initiates a game of musical chairs in which the number of chairs equals the number of players. Different buyers will be linked with different sellers, with a cost to Americans of only about $ 1 per person per year. The only way a foreign <b>oil</b> <b>producer</b> can harm Americans is by cutting output, but that producer will then harm itself and will also harm all oil users, not just U. S. consumers. This harm is likely to be well under 0. 5 percent of U. S. GDP. Ironically, war for oil could well drive the price of oil higher, not lower, thus costing Americans twice: as taxpayers and as oil users...|$|R
25|$|Newspapers {{were quick}} to {{publicize}} the issue. The injustice of the South Improvement scheme outraged many independent <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> and owners of refineries. Rogers led the opposition among the New York refiners. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March 1872 sent a committee of three, with Rogers as head, to Oil City to consult with the Oil Producers' Union. Working with the Pennsylvania independents, Rogers and the New York delegation managed to forge {{an agreement with the}} railroads, whose leaders eventually agreed to open their rates to all and promised to end their shady dealings with South Improvement.|$|E
25|$|The IPL line {{fundamentally}} {{changed the}} pricing of Alberta oil {{to make it}} sensitive to international rather than regional factors. The wellhead price reflected {{the price of oil}} at Sarnia, less pipeline tolls for shipping it there. IPL is by far the longest crude oil pipeline in the western hemisphere. Looping, or constructing additional lines beside the original, expanded the Interprovincial system and allowed its extension into the American midwest and to upstate New York. In 1976, it was 3,680 kilometres through an extension to Montreal. Although it helped assure security of supply in the 1970s, the extension became a threat to Canadian <b>oil</b> <b>producers</b> after deregulation in 1985. With Montreal refineries using cheaper imported oil, there was concern within the industry that a proposal to use the line to bring foreign oil into Sarnia might undermine traditional markets for Western Canadian petroleum.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics of}} Western {{military}} intervention suggested that resources—not democratic or humanitarian concerns—were the real {{impetus for the}} intervention, among them a journalist of London Arab nationalist newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi, the Russian TV network RT and the (then-)leaders of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, Hugo Chávez and Robert Mugabe. Gaddafi's Libya, despite its relatively small population, was known to possess vast resources, particularly {{in the form of}} oil reserves and financial capital. Libya is a member of OPEC and one of the world's largest <b>oil</b> <b>producers.</b> It was producing roughly 1.6 million barrels a day before the war, nearly 70 percent of them through the state-owned National Oil Corporation. Additionally, the country's sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, was {{one of the largest in}} the world, controlling assets worth approximately US$56 billion, including over 100 tons of gold reserves in the Central Bank of Libya.|$|E
