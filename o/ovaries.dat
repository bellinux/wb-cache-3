5|$|Abnormal genitalia: usually {{cryptorchidism}} (retention of testicles in body) or monorchism (single testicle). In female patients, this presents {{as missing}} or single <b>ovaries,</b> much harder by nature to detect. Ultrasound imaging is performed at regular intervals, {{from the age}} of 1 year, to determine if <b>ovaries</b> are present.|$|E
5|$|A higher {{percentage}} of female workers of the bee species Apis cerana are reported to activate their <b>ovaries</b> than those of Apis mellifera or Apis florea. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their <b>ovaries</b> in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.|$|E
50|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of ovarian torsion includes laparoscopy to uncoil the torsed <b>ovary</b> and possibly oophoropexy to fixate the <b>ovary</b> {{which is likely}} to twist again. In severe cases, where blood flow is cut off to the <b>ovary</b> {{for an extended period of}} time, necrosis of the <b>ovary</b> can occur. In these cases the <b>ovary</b> must be surgically removed.|$|R

50|$|The {{perianth}} {{parts are}} attached below the <b>ovary.</b> The <b>ovary</b> is therefore superior, but appears half-inferior in Peridiscus because the <b>ovary</b> {{is embedded in}} the large, fleshy disk. The gynoecium consists of three or four carpels, united to form a unilocular <b>ovary.</b> The placentation is apical, with two ovules at the apex of each carpel. The <b>ovary</b> has a central column in Medusandra and Soyauxia. Each carpel bears a stylulus and these are well separated at the apex of the <b>ovary.</b>|$|R
5|$|Among {{the many}} homologies in mammal {{reproductive}} systems, <b>ovaries</b> and testicles are homologous.|$|E
5|$|In fertilised queens, the <b>ovaries</b> {{only become}} active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of the <b>ovaries</b> are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic and vaginal {{ultrasounds}} {{are helpful}} {{in the diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound may appear normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and <b>ovaries</b> appear indistinct. Enlarged <b>ovaries</b> accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E

5|$|Fish <b>ovaries</b> may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian <b>ovaries</b> shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E

40|$|Oocytes {{organization}} and <b>ovary</b> maturity of bigeye tuna were examined using fish {{caught in the}} west tropical Atlantic Ocean. A total of 522 ovarian samples were examined on their external feature by neck eye. Samples of the <b>ovary</b> were cross-sectioned, stained and observed under light microscopic. The GSI was also registered. From the histological analysis, six oocytes developmental stages could be distinguished: Oogonia and Perinucleolar; Early lipid and Vitellogenesis; Late vitellogenesis; Migratory nucleus; Pre-hydrated and Hydrated stages. Four states of <b>ovary</b> maturity were characterized from the external features examination: immature <b>ovary,</b> Early maturation <b>ovary,</b> Later maturation <b>ovary</b> and Spent/resting <b>ovary.</b> The GSI varied from a mean of 9. 56 at the Early maturation <b>ovary</b> stage to 24. 54 at the later maturation <b>ovary</b> stage. At the sent/resting stages, the mean GSI was 15. 97. In average, the fish size varied from 112. 6 to 143. 3 cm. During the <b>ovary</b> maturation it was observed the presence of simultaneous oocytes stages, suggests an assynchronic development of the <b>ovary</b> and a continuous spawning behavior of the specie.

5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of females consist of paired <b>ovaries,</b> lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. The lateral ducts are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored. Unlike other insects, the gonopore, or genital opening {{is behind the}} seventh abdominal segment. The <b>ovaries</b> are primitive {{in that they are}} polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate {{along the length of the}} ovariole). In some species these long ovarioles branch off the lateral duct, while in others, short ovarioles appear around the duct.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the {{participation}} of the vagus nerve in pre-pubertal rats with unilateral ovariectomy on puberty onset, and on progesterone, testosterone and estradiol serum levels, and the compensatory responses of the <b>ovary.</b> Unilateral vagotomy did not modify the onset of puberty in unilaterally ovariectomized rats. Ovulation rates of animals with the left vagus nerve sectioned and the left <b>ovary</b> in-situ was lower than in rats with only unilateral ovariectomy. Sectioning the left vagus to 32 -day old rats with the left <b>ovary</b> in-situ resulted in lower compensatory ovarian hypertrophy than in rats with right unilateral ovariectomy. Twenty-eight or 32 -day old animals with sectioning of the right vagus nerve and the right <b>ovary</b> in situ showed higher compensatory ovulation. Twenty-eight -day old rats with the right <b>ovary</b> in situ had higher progesterone and testosterone levels than animals of the same age with the left <b>ovary</b> in-situ. Compared to animals with the right <b>ovary</b> in situ, animals treated at 32 -days of age, sectioning the ipsi-lateral vagus nerve resulted in higher progesterone levels. Higher progesterone levels were observed in 28 - and 32 days old rats with the left <b>ovary</b> in situ and left vagus nerve sectioned. Thirty-two day old animals with the right <b>ovary</b> in situ and right vagus nerve sectioned had higher progesterone levels than rats of the same age with the left <b>ovary</b> in situ and left vagus nerve sectioned. Left vagotomy to 28 -day old rats with the left <b>ovary</b> in situ resulted in higher testosterone levels, a reverse response to that observed in animals with sectioning of the right vagus and the right <b>ovary</b> in situ.
