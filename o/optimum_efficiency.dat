25|$|The {{commonly}} employed Cuman battle tactic {{was repeated}} attacks by light cavalry archers, facing and shooting {{to the rear}} of the horse, then a feigned retreat and skilled ambush. To maintain this tactic to <b>optimum</b> <b>efficiency</b> the Cumans kept a large number of reserve horses (10–12 remounts) to replace fatigued ones, so that a fresh horse was available at all times. The horsemen used oval shaped stirrups and employed a large bridle for their horses. Another important accessory was a small whip attached to the rider's wrist. Tribal banners were either made of cloth with tribal emblems or dyed horse hair– with more tails signifying greater importance of the warrior or group. Some of the Cumans who moved west were influenced by Western heraldry, and they eventually displayed hybridized European-Cuman heraldry.|$|E
25|$|Political {{scientist}} Elinor Ostrom, who {{was awarded}} 2009's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences {{for her work}} on the issue, and others revisited Hardin's work in 1999. They found {{the tragedy of the}} commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as Hardin maintained, since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves. For example, it was found that a commons in the Swiss Alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since 1517, in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland. In general, it is in the users of a commons interests to keep the common running and complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at <b>optimum</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E

50|$|Enhanced {{controls}} {{systems may}} monitor the return air quality or carbon dioxide concentration {{in order to}} automatically modulate the air mix for <b>optimum</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> whilst maintaining desired fresh air requirements. Such systems work very well in buildings where the occupancy rate can vary greatly throughout the day, or seasonally. Additionally, when outside air conditions are such, typically mid-season weather conditions, {{it may be that}} ambient temperatures are suitable for free cooling purposes. In such conditions the mixing damper will be set to close and the system use full fresh air for <b>optimum</b> energy <b>efficiency.</b> Where fresh air is not required, such as early morning pre-heat or pre-conditioning periods, the mixing damper can be automatically set to full recirculation, again for <b>optimum</b> energy <b>efficiency.</b>|$|R

To achieve <b>optimum</b> <b>efficiency</b> with the new powerplants, the air intakes were enlarged to increase mass air flow.

500|$|Hidden in {{a remote}} {{mountain}} valley, Bors commands the world's last government. The microstate is tightly centralized around him, and he manages it bureaucratically for <b>optimum</b> <b>efficiency</b> in all {{sectors of the economy}} and military. The effect is [...] "an accurate and detailed reproduction of a society two centuries gone." [...] Bors is immediately established as an utterly necessary figure in his society and is quickly escorted back into service {{as the leader of the}} government by Fowler. A personal assistant as well as mechanic to Bors, Fowler maintains a pretension of loyalty to the robot, but privately recognizes that his society is stagnant and that its leader is becoming mentally unbalanced. Pessimistic, he expresses cynicism regarding the subservient role humans in his society play to Bors. He is contrasted with Peter Green, a genuinely loyal assistant to the robot, who is among the few humans trusted to oversee his body while it is unconscious for repair. Though loyal to his leader, Green nonetheless draws Bors' distrust as the robot's paranoia steadily grows.|$|E
2500|$|Separating the {{expensive}} machinery section from the cargo space offers several advantages {{in comparison to}} conventional vessels, {{one of the most}} important being the ability to operate on the [...] "drop and swap" [...] principle which minimizes the turnaround time in port for the pusher and its crew. When a pusher-barge combination arrives at a port, the fully laden barge is left for unloading while the pusher picks up an empty one and leaves again. In theory the system works on <b>optimum</b> <b>efficiency</b> when there are as many barges as there are pushers and ports of call – the barges are always either being loaded or unloaded, or underway with a pusher. In addition to reducing unprofitable waiting time such operation principle allows more time for the unloading of the barge, removing the need for expensive cargo handling equipment in the unloading port.|$|E

Random Gaussian and random binary antipodal spreading are considered. We obtain the <b>optimum</b> asymptotic multiuser <b>efficiency</b> of a K-user system with spreading gain N when K and N→∞ and the loading factor, K/N, grows logarithmically with K under some conditions. It is {{shown that the}} optimum detector in a Gaussian randomly spread CDMA system has a performance close to the single user system at high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) when K and N→∞ and the loading factor, K/N, is kept less than _ 3 K/ 2. Random binary antipodal matrices are also studied and a lower bound for the <b>optimum</b> asymptotic multiuser <b>efficiency</b> is obtained. Furthermore, we investigate the connection between detecting matrices in the coin weighing problem and <b>optimum</b> asymptotic multiuser <b>efficiency.</b> We obtain a condition such that for any binary input, an N× K random matrix whose entries are chosen randomly from a finite set, is a detecting matrix as K and N→∞.
