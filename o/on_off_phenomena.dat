40|$|L-Dopa is {{the drug}} of choice in the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease but it has dose related adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, end of dose deterioration, <b>on</b> <b>off</b> <b>phenomena</b> and on chronic therapy motor complications synonymous to parkinsonism. Mucuna pruriens (M. P) commonly known as velvet beans or cowitch are used in case of spasms associated with Parkins onism. Clinical efficacy of seeds of this plant was confirmed and the efficacy was contributed to its L-Dopa content. M. P extract showed twice the antiparkinsonism activity compared with synthetic L-Dopa. There is sufficient L-Dopa in broad bean (Vicia faba) pods. One study proved its efficacy in Parkinsonism. Ginkgo biloba extract showed protective effect in vivo and invitro. 50 % ethanolic extract of Plumbago zeylanica was effective in rats. The following plants were reported to have L-Dopa but their protective effect is yet to be established in animal models. Vigna aconitifolia, Vigna unguiculata, Vigna vexillata, Prosopis chilensis, Pileostigma malabarica, Phanera vahlis, Parkinsonia acculeata, Macuna urens, Canvavalia glandiata, Cassia floribanda, Casia hirsute and Dalbergia retusa etc...|$|E
40|$|A set of 10 horse powers (HP) multi-split air {{conditioner}} {{with a digital}} scroll compressor and a standard compressor was designed. The control strategy of compressor switching and the control model of compressor output capacity were presented. The output ratio of the digital compressor was determined in the control strategy. Furthermore, in the control model of compressor output capacity, considering the pressure disturbance, a certain suction pressure range {{was used as the}} pressure control target to adjust the output capacity. Experiments show that the system ran unstably, the standard compressor frequently appeared <b>on</b> <b>off</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> and some operation parameters such as the output ratio of the digital compressor, the opening of electric expansive valve (EEV), the cooling capacity and the air outlet temperature fluctuated. A new control model of the output capacity was proposed, in which the average suction pressure in an adjustment period was taken as the current pressure to regulate the output capacity. Experimental results demonstrate that the control model can be used to solve the frequent <b>on</b> <b>off</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of the standard compressor and oscillation of the operation parameters, realize control accuracy of less than 0. 2 degrees C deviation of the air outlet temperature.

40|$|Remote {{detection}} of radioactive materials is impossible when the measurement location {{is far from}} the radioactive source such that the leakage of high-energy photons or electrons from the source cannot be measured. Current technologies are less effective in this respect because they only allow the detection at distances to which the high-energy photons or electrons can reach the detector. Here we demonstrate an experimental method for remote {{detection of}} radioactive materials by inducing plasma breakdown with the high-power pulsed electromagnetic waves. Measurements of the plasma formation time and its dispersion lead to enhanced detection sensitivity compared to the theoretically predicted one based only on the plasma <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> <b>phenomena.</b> We show that lower power of the incident electromagnetic wave is sufficient for plasma breakdown in atmospheric-pressure air and the elimination of the statistical distribution is possible in the presence of radioactive material. ope...|$|R
5000|$|In 1934, {{shortly after}} the inauguration of the facility, some owners of {{recreational}} gardens discovered that a light bulb connected to ground and a highly spun wire made the bulb light up brightly enough to illuminate a small house. Later many other did so. Transmission energy is taken from the transmitter, and induces electrical power in the wire. This effect was not discovered immediately. Later, technicians of the transmitter noticed, that in the houses of nearby gardens, lights went <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> depending <b>on</b> whether the transmitter was switched <b>on</b> or <b>off.</b> This <b>phenomenon</b> got the nickname [...] "Hamburger Lichtwunder" [...] (German: [...] "Hamburg's light miracle").

40|$|We {{construct}} and analyze a discrete fitness landscape called metabolic adjustment landscape, from sub-networks covered by different productive flux distributions of a metabolic net-work. The topological structure of this landscape, i. e., the lo-cal minima and saddle points, can be compactly {{represented as a}} hierarchical structure called barrier tree. The switching from one local optimal flux pattern to another one is accom-panied by adjustment costs, since genes have to be turned <b>on</b> or <b>off.</b> This <b>phenomenon</b> gives raise to saddle points in the metabolic adjustment landscape. Our approach allows calcu-lating the minimal cost pathway that connects any two local minima in the landscape. Furthermore, our method yields a detailed ordering which reactions have to be (de-) activated to switch from one flux distribution to another one with minimal adjustment costs. Such a mechanistic hypothesis can guide experimental verification. We apply our approaches to a net-work describing the central carbon metabolism of E. coli...|$|R
40|$|The Electrodynamic Vibration Exciter (shakers) {{has been}} one of the most {{employed}} excitation sources in modal tests. The shaker is an electromechanical device that provides a mechanical motion due to the input signal sent to its coil. Despite being widely used, it is well known that the shaker interacts with the structure under test. In particular, when the structure passes through a given resonance, the force delivered by the shaker abruptly decreases, causing the so called drop <b>off</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> This paper aims to study this force drop <b>off</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in the single shaker modal testing. Analytical models are developed to help in understanding the physical principles involved in the interaction between the shaker and the structure under test. Experimental analyses are performed using different shakers as well as excitation signals, in order to evaluate the effects of the input signal, as well as the power amplifier operational modes, on the structure dynamics. Preliminary tests revealed that significant distortions might occur during vibration tests using shakers and these distortions significantly affect the determination of the structure response...|$|R

In particular, in subsequent papers, we will prove the Arnold conjecture in both degenerate and non-degenerate cases with integer coefficients for general, symplectic manifolds. ...|$|R

Researches on genetic structure of Sardinian population, performed with of both classical and DNA markers, revealed an extremely complex picture of the relationships between Sardinian and other Italian and Mediterranean populations, that can be explained by Sardinian’s historical and demographic past. A high degree of internal heterogeneity was also found and it can be attributed first to strict isolation and consequent high levels of endogamy and consanguinity, secondly, to selective factor linked to endemic malaria that influenced the distribution of some gene frequencies.
