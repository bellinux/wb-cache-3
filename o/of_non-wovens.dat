40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the IMechE, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications [© Professional Engineering Publishing]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] paper reports image analysis methods {{that have been developed}} to study the microstructural changes <b>of</b> <b>non-wovens</b> made by the hydroentanglement process. The validity of the image processing techniques has been ascertained by applying them to test images with known properties. The parameters in preprocessing of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images used in image processing have been tested and optimized. The bre orientation distribution is estimated using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Hough transform (HT) methods. The results obtained using these two methods are in good agreement. The HT method is more demanding in computational time compared with the Fourier transform (FT) method. However, the advantage of the HT method is that the actual orientation of the lines can be concluded directly from the result of the transform without the need for any further computation. The distribution of the length of the straight bre segments of the fabrics is evaluated by the HT method. The effect of curl of the bres on the result of this evaluation is shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{a method to}} prepare hydrophobic composite non-wovens con-taining chicken feathers and synthetic fibres (PES, PP). Such non-wovens {{can be made in}} aqueous medium using a paper-making method. The raw material (poultry feathers) is abundantly available from slaughterhouses as a waste. The sorption and mechanical prop-erties and a morphological assessment of the prepared non-wovens are presented. The non-wovens were characterised by excellent sorption {{of a wide range of}} hydrophobic petroleum substances, good selectivity (sorption of liquids immiscible in water), and were unsinkable. The materials can be used directly on an aqueous surface, as well as on other surfaces such as concrete or asphalt to clean up leaked oily substances. The non-wovens are lightweight, easy to store and use and are inexpensive.

The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>non-woven</b> geotextile reinforcement into sand increased the peak strength of sand significantly and the reinforced samples exhibited a greater axial strain at failure. Also {{the effect on}} number of reinforcement layers was studied and found as {{increasing the number of}} reinforcement layers resulting in more ductility by clogging developed in the shear band within the specimens.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} an {{experimental study of}} three types <b>of</b> <b>non-woven</b> preforms (needlepunched, spunlaced and mat manufactured using a paper-making process) intended as composite reinforcement. These are potentially very attractive for transport applications. First, the influence of processing on elementary fiber tensile properties is shown to be limited. Then the preforms are evaluated in polypropylene matrix composites and mechanical properties are determined. The structure <b>of</b> <b>non-woven</b> reinforcements {{is strongly dependent on}} the manufacturing route. By varying the fiber content it is shown that the most efficient reinforcement for flax fibers is the mat produced by paper processing. The new spunlaced reinforced composites are shown to have slightly lower tensile properties (15 % lower strength, and 25 % lower stiffness) compared to mat composites at equivalent volume fraction, but further optimization is possible for these materials. Based on the measured constituent properties micromechanics models have been used to estimate composite stiffness. A good correlation is obtained between test results and model predictions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Studies have {{highlighted}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages <b>of</b> woven and <b>non-woven</b> fabrics. The present study assessed the change in resterilisation proportion after introduction <b>of</b> <b>non-woven</b> fabric for packaging of instruments and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>non-woven</b> fabrics compared with woven fabrics. Materials and Methods: The present study is a secondary data analysis of resterilisation data collected from November 2009 to August 2013. We calculated the proportions (and their 95 % confidence intervals) of resterilisation done every month. The proportion over time was compared using a Chi-square test for trend. We used linear regression analysis to adjust for the number of surgeries performed every month. We also compared the cost <b>of</b> woven and <b>non-woven</b> fabrics. Results: <b>Of</b> the total 117, 335 surgical packets prepared during the study period, 1900 were resterilised; thus, the overall proportion was 1. 62 % (95 % CI: 1. 55 % to 1. 69 %). The resterilisation proportion was 8. 95 % (95 % CI: 7. 73 % to 10. 17 %) in November 2009 and was 0. 38 % (95 % CI: 0. 16 % to 0. 62 %) in August 2013 (P < 0. 001). After adjusting for the total number of surgeries conducted every month, we found that the number of packets resterilised reduced every month (per month reduction: - 1. 97, 95 % CI: - 2. 76 to - 1. 18). The total cost (initial preparation and resterilisation) for 100 units of woven fabric is INR 6359. 41 per month (confidence limit estimates: 6228. 20 to 6430. 62) and for non-woven fabric was INR 6208. 50 (confidence limit estimate: INR 6194. 90 to 6223. 35) (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: The introduction <b>of</b> <b>non-woven</b> spunbond-meltblown-spunbond fabrics did reduce the proportion of resterilisation of packaged instruments. The decline was sharp and sustained over time, even after accounting for the change in the number of procedures. Furthermore, though the switch from woven to non-woven fabric was cost-effective in our situation, it may not be directly translated to other scenarios...|$|R

The {{phase change}} properties, thermal conductivity, thermal resistance, heat flux and inner temperature difference between wool felt and the thermoregulated <b>non-woven</b> fabrics <b>of</b> the <b>non-woven</b> fabrics were measured respectively.

During a heating process, heat flux <b>of</b> the <b>non-woven</b> fabrics {{is composed of}} three parts: heat absorbed by the cold textile touching the hot plate, heat transmitted from the hot plate to the cold plate, and the heat absorbed by PCM from the hot plate during the phase change process. The measured maximum inner temperature difference in a temperature rising process between the wool felt and the thermo-regulated non-woven fabric is approximately 8 °C. The inner temperature difference (Tr-Ts > 0) lasts 16 - 45 min. By contrary, the measured maximum inner temperature difference in the temperature decreasing process is approximately - 6. 5 °C.
