2500|$|More recently, Hanson has {{appeared}} {{to reject the}} term neoconservative, writing in a 2016 column [...] "Hillary's Neoliberals" [...] that the term neoconservative was coined in the 1970s to describe liberals who moved right on social issues and on maintaining deterrence during the Cold War. Hanson has critiqued the decision of several neoconservatives to declare their support for Hillary Clinton as preferable to Donald Trump on grounds that Clinton {{has a long history}} of abuse of office, and is mired in scandal over violations of national security statutes as well as influence peddling between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Hanson has attacked these neoconservatives as [...] "neoliberals" [...] who were never entirely proper conservative, arguing that these people had joined the Republican Party out of distaste for the Democratic Party, which had nominated as the presidential candidates George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 as opposed to converting to conservatism. [...] Hanson ended his column that there were now two emerging factions in America — the proverbial ordinary Americans supporting Trump vs. the elites of both the Democratic and Republican parties supporting Clinton. Hanson wrote: [...] "A mostly urban, highly educated, and high-income globalized elite often shares more cultural and political affinities with their counterparts on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> than they do with the lower-middle and working classes of their own parties. Just as Hillary Clinton may feel more comfortable with the old neoconservatives, Trump supporters have little in common with either Clintonites or neocons. Clinton versus Trump is a war of NPR, CBS, and the New York Times against the National Enquirer, conservative talk radio, and the Drudge Report. Clinton supporters such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, onetime Bush officials Hank Paulson and Brent Scowcroft, and billionaire Meg Whitman certainly have nothing in common with Republican Trump supporters such as Mike Huckabee and Rush Limbaugh. Culture, not just politics, is rapidly destroying—but also rebuilding—traditional political parties." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{woman was}} a very intelligent-looking person, not of the usual English ruddiness, but rather thin and {{somewhat}} pale, though bright, of aspect. Her way of talking was very agreeable. She inquired if we wished to see Wordsworth's monument, and at once showed it to us,--a slab of white marble fixed against {{the upper end of}} the central row of stone arches, with a pretty long inscription, and a profile bust, in bas-relief, of his aged countenance. The monument, is placed directly over Wordsworth's pew, and could best be seen and read from the very corner seat where he used to sit. The pew is one of those occupying the centre of the church, and is just across the aisle from the pulpit, and is the best of all for the purpose of seeing and hearing the clergyman, and likewise as convenient as any, from its neighborhood to the altar. On the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> beneath the pulpit, is Lady Fleming's pew. This and one or two others are curtained, Wordsworth's was not. I think I can bring up his image in that corner seat of his pew--a white-headed, tall, spare man, plain in aspect--better than in any other situation. The woman said that she had known him very well, and that he had made some verses on a sister of hers. She repeated the first lines, something about a lamb, but neither S----- nor I remembered them.|$|E

He also noted the growing national debt, and promised to adhere to foreign policies guided by the principle of non-intervention. Azcona's prospects for a successful presidency appeared dim — in part, because his party's bloc in the Congress was still splintered (unlike the more-united PNH deputies on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle).</b> Beyond such parochial concerns the crisis in Central America still raged on, presenting a daunting prospect for any Honduran leader.|$|E

5000|$|Brownback {{supported}} a political surge {{coupled with the}} military surge of 2007 in Iraq and opposed the Democratic Party's strategy of timed withdrawal: It does mean {{that there must be}} bipartisan agreement for our military commitment on Iraq. We cannot fight a war with the support of only one political party. And it does mean that the parties in Iraq - Sunni, Shi’a and Kurds - must get to a political agreement, to a political equilibrium. I think most people agree that a cut and run strategy does not serve our interest at all, nor those of the world, nor those of the region, nor those of the Iraqi people. So I invite my colleagues, all around, particularly on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> to indicate what level of commitment they can support.

[...] Noted economist Tyler Cowen who wrote on Bloomberg News: [...] "Conard’s central idea is that risk-bearing equity capital is the truly scarce asset in most economic situations, and economic analysis should adapt accordingly. He is very creative in seeing some {{of the implications of}} this view. I[...] [...]found it very stimulating to ponder. It puts many of the pieces together in a new and different way." [...] Harvard economist Greg Mankiw recommended Upside and interviewed Conard on CSPAN. David Author, George Borjas, Larry Lindsey, and other prominent economists also praised it.

5000|$|The {{issue of}} whether or not to expand the options for women serving in the U.S. armed forces as fighter pilots and in other {{frontline}} assignments was a contentious social issue of the day. In 1991, a famous incident had occurred at the Tailhook Association convention in Las Vegas, where male naval aviators had behaved in manners inappropriate, if not criminal, and where the follow-up criminal and other investigations by the then-named NIS, the Naval Inspector General, and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, were later heavily criticized by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, with the concurrence to Acting Secretary of the Navy Sean O'Keefe, to whom the report was delivered and who began to take corrective action with respect to both the perceived attitude problems towards women and the functions of the investigative arms of the Department of the Navy.The fallout from the incident resulted in a hard blow to the naval aviation community, where the promotions of many naval aviators were put on hold. The common counterclaim from the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> as articulated by former Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration and naval flight officer John F. Lehman, was that the naval aviation community had been unfairly subjected to a witch-hunt motivated by political correctness, in effect killing its esprit de corps, and by extension damaging its combat effectiveness. During the Clinton administration in April 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin announced a new policy, which in effect made it possible to have female fighter pilots serving on aircraft carriers at sea and in other new positions (but still prohibited from serving in infantry etc.) ...|$|E

5000|$|It was {{not until}} 1937 that further 56 ft cars were built, to a {{slightly}} different design. The new cars had different bogie spacing and a more rounded profile, to allow general route availability. They were classed A, with the initial batch being built at Otahuhu Railway Workshops. It took Otahuhu and Addington Railway Workshops until 1945 to complete the class. There was {{a large amount of}} variation in the body arrangement between batches. This primarily reflected the carriage's use - 2nd Class (X25480), 1st Class, 1st/2nd Class Composite (X25916) or Semi Sleeping - but there was also variations between carriages intended for North Island and South Island use. South Island 1st Class cars (X25495) were built with pressure ventilation and a coupe compartment at one end, while North Island 1st Class cars (X25485) used roof-based vents like 2nd Class cars, and did not include a coupe. Up to 12 2nd Class cars were converted into 20-bed Ambulance cars for use in World War 2 and after the war were converted for general use, six of which were converted for 1st Class use, with four receiving seats of a more modern design, that were later used for the Endeavour Express and The Connoisseur car. Eight out of 11 Semi Sleeper cars were rebuilt as 16-berth all-sleeper cars, one rebuilt as a 14-berth sleeper because it retained the original 4-berth cabin. 56-ft cars quickly became the mainstay of the passenger fleet, being used on the NZR's important trains in their red livery.The carriages were 56 ft long and 11 ft high. The width was 8 ft at the waist reducing to 8 ft at about window height so that the cars could run over all lines. The extra width allowed second class seating to have one double seat each side of the aisle so seating four per row; but first class cars had seating for three per row, a single seat on one side and two single seats on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> The seating for passengers was: ...|$|E

40|$|As the 2016 presidential {{campaign}} {{heads into the}} final stretch, Americans remain just as frustrated and angry about the election as in May when the primaries were drawing to a close. In the latest national poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, the public says their issues and concerns are not being addressed by the campaigns, and {{there is too much}} focus on personal aspects of the candidates and not enough on their qualifications. The issues that matter most to the public overall are health care, Social Security, education, and terrorism, although Republicans care more about terrorism while Democrats are more concerned with health care. Regardless of party affiliation, Americans consider the economy and education to be of great importance to them personally. But partisan divisions are found in the level of importance assigned to many other issues asked about in the survey. For example, three-quarters of Democrats say the environment and climate change are extremely or very important to them personally. Only about 4 in 10 Republicans agree. And on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> more than 8 in 10 Republicans consider the national debt to be extremely or very important, along with just 6 in 10 Democrats. While disappointed in the focus of the 2016 election, this campaign is drawing the public's attention. Two-thirds of Americans say the election interests them in general, and 6 in 10 have paid a good deal of attention to the campaign so far.   In comparison, four years ago, less than half of voters surveyed by The New York Times and CBS News said they were paying {{a lot of attention to}} the {{presidential campaign}} between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. But interest was at similar levels in September during Obama's first presidential campaign against John McCain. At the time, a New York Times/CBS News poll found 63 percent said they were paying a lot of attention to the campaign.
