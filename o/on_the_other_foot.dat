25|$|Netball {{rules do}} not permit players to let their landing foot touch the ground again if it is lifted at all while in {{possession}} of the ball, so players can take 1.5 steps while holding the ball. Pivoting does not count as a step. Players are entitled to balance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> if the landing foot is lifted. An infraction of this rule is usually called stepping or travelling , as in the similar rule in basketball. Consequently, {{the only way to}} move the ball towards the goal is to throw the ball to a teammate. The ball can be held by a player for less than three seconds at any time. A player may tap or deflect the ball, let it bounce and then take possession and throw it. The player cannot catch the ball with both hands, drop it and pick it up again; this is called a replayed ball. The duration before it is called a drop is determined by the umpire. These rules, combined with the restrictions on where one player of a particular position can move, ensure that everyone on the team is regularly involved in play.|$|E
25|$|In the County Championship {{match against}} Sussex at Hove in May, Botham {{came very close}} to his maiden century but was {{dismissed}} for 97, his highest score to date. The match was drawn. At the end of the month, Somerset played Gloucestershire in a remarkable match at Taunton. Batting first, Somerset scored 333 for seven (innings closed) and then, thanks to six for 25 by Botham, bowled out Gloucestershire for only 79. The follow-on was enforced but Gloucestershire proved a much tougher nut to crack second time around. With Zaheer Abbas scoring 141, they made 372 and left Somerset needing 118 to win. Botham took five for 125 in the second innings for a match analysis of 11 for 150, his maiden 10wM. This match ended {{the same way as the}} famous Test at Headingley in 1981 but the boot was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> for Botham here because he was on the team that enforced the follow-on – and lost. Mike Procter and Tony Brown did the damage and bowled Somerset out for 110 in 42 overs, Gloucestershire winning by just eight runs. Botham scored his maiden first-class century at Trent Bridge on Tuesday, 3 August in the County Championship game against Nottinghamshire (Notts) who won the toss and decided to bat first. Derek Randall scored 204* and the Notts innings closed at 364 for 4 (Botham one for 59). Somerset were 52 for one at close of play. On day two, Somerset scored 304 for 8 (innings closed) and Botham, batting at number six, scored 80. At close of play, Notts in their second innings were 107 for four, thus extending their lead to 167 with six wickets standing. On day three, Notts advanced to 240 for nine declared (Botham one for 16), leaving Somerset with a difficult target of 301. At 40 for two and with both their openers gone, Brian Close changed his batting order and summoned Botham to come in at number four. Close himself had gone in at three but he was out soon afterwards for 35. With support from Graham Burgess (78), Botham laid into the Notts bowling and scored an impressive 167 not out. Somerset reached 302 for four in only 65 overs and won by six wickets.|$|E

40|$|Stability and leakiness: Opposing {{challenges}} to the glomerulus. The complex architecture of the glomerular tuft is stabilized by several mechanisms. The basic system consists of the GBM and the mesangium maintaining the branching pattern of the capillary network. Superimposed are the podocytes, which appear to take effect by two mechanisms. First, podocytes contribute to the stabilization of the capillary folding pattern by supporting the angles between neighboring capillaries. Second, podocyte foot processes fixed to the outer aspect of the GBM probably function as contractile patches counteracting the elastic distension of the GBM. Simultaneously, the pattern of foot process interdigitation underlies the elaboration of a filtration slit and is thus pivotal for the high hydraulic permeability and the specifity of the glomerular filter. The loss of this pattern—commonly termed “foot process effacement” or “foot process fusion”—is frequently found in pathological situations and results in a decrease in permeability and impairment in specifity. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, <b>foot</b> process effacement is associated with prominent hypertrophy of the contractile apparatus of podocytes, suggesting an increased ability to generate forces counteracting capillary expansion. Thus, foot process effacement appears as an adaptive change in podocyte phenotype giving priority to the support function of podocytes for the prize of reducing the specific permeability...|$|R

40|$|Detection {{of motor}} {{intention}} with short latency from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) {{is essential for}} the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for neuromodulation. This latency determines the temporal association between motor intention and the triggered afferent neurofeedback. In this study, we compared two typical experimental paradigms for the detection of movement intention from EEG. A template-matching algorithm was used to detect movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) in eight healthy subjects for two types of cued motor imageries using either a random or non-random cue. For the random cue, the true positive rates of detection of movement intention were 63. 5 ± 5. 9 % (foot movement) and 61 ± 6. 5 % (right hand movement). Detection occurred 102. 8 ± 119. 3 ms and 112. 2 ± 104 ms prior to onset of execution cue. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, <b>foot</b> and hand movement intentions were detected significantly earlier (p < 0. 05) (198 ± 147. 3 ms and 206 ± 134. 2 ms prior to onset, respectively) and with a greater true positive rate (p < 0. 05) (75. 3 ± 5. 5 % and 70. 2 ± 6. 1 %) when non-random cues were used. These results suggest that a non-random cue paradigm is preferable to a typical random cue in BCI systems designed for neuromodulation. However, the important consideration of variable practice afforded by the random cue, which is known to facilitate learning, requires further study...|$|R

Some of the harsh criticism is unjust, because, if you listen to it carefully, the album isn't that bad, but it just hasn't got the punch that it could have had if we'd taken the time." [...] Chris Hillman concurred with Clark, telling The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan [...] "In all honesty, we didn't have enough time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album. They gave us one-and-a-half months to do that album, expecting guys to regroup after a five to six year absence." [...] Hillman also cited the band's eagerness to avoid conflict as a contributing factor to the album's artistic failure: [...] "everybody was so afraid of stepping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> person's <b>feet</b> because of the tension that had gone down six years prior to that, that it became a bland album. Everybody was being too nice to each other." [...] McGuinn blamed the reunion album's lack of success, at least partly, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hedonism exhibited by members of the band during the recording process: [...] "David had this incredibly strong pot.
