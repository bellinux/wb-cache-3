40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there were differences between in-school and <b>out-of-school</b> day <b>care</b> centres. Five centres housed in public schools and five housed in other locations were selected for the research. Aquality assessment was administered in each centre which examined the following components - physical environment, adult social structure and socia-emotional environment, children's socia-emotional environment, cognitive stimulation program and toys and equipment. Quantitative analysis using simple t-tests showed a significant difference between in-school and <b>out-of-school</b> day <b>cares</b> for the physical environment variable. Differences approached significance for the children's socia-emotional environment variable as well as overall quality. Qualitative analysis using a triangulated methodology revealed noticeable differences for every variable. The researcher concluded that both the quality of the physical environment and the capabilities of the administrators strongly influence the quality of the day care environment. This study also included an assessment of children's attitude toward learning. No significant difference was found between in-school and out-of-school centres...|$|R
30|$|The stellar example, however, is Quebec, the francophone {{province}} {{that had}} remained outside the Canada Child Benefit, Early Childhood development and Multi-lateral Framework agreements. As the OECD report hopefully noted, Quebec’s experience “will {{be useful for}} Canada in developing a publicly managed, universal early childhood system” (OECD, 2004, p. 5). Quebec’s innovations began in 1997 with the adoption of its “$ 5 a day” (now $ 7) childcare policy. With this came a commitment to adding 200, 000 spaces, which it has achieved and plans to add 20, 000 more by 2010. As of 1998 all school boards were required to provide <b>out-of-school</b> hours <b>care</b> for kindergarten and elementary school children where there is sufficient demand. As {{a result of these}} developments, Quebec has spaces for 36 % of all children aged 0 – 12.|$|R

However, there is still only limited scientific evidence for greater psychological distress amongst orphans and even less evidence for the effectiveness of current support strategies. Furthermore, programmes that address established mechanisms through which orphanhood can lead to greater psychological distress should be more effective. We use quantitative and qualitative data from Eastern Zimbabwe to measure the effects of orphanhood on psychological distress and to test mechanisms for greater distress amongst orphans suggested in a recently published theoretical framework. Orphans were found to suffer greater psychological distress than non-orphans (sex- and age-adjusted co-efficient: 0. 15; 95 % CI 0. 03 0. 26; P 0. 013). Effects of orphanhood contributing to their increased levels of distress included trauma, being <b>out-of-school,</b> being <b>cared</b> for by a non-parent, inadequate care, child labour, physical abuse, and stigma and discrimination. Increased mobility and separation from siblings did not contribute to greater psychological distress in this study. Over 40 % of orphaned children in the sample lived in households receiving external assistance. However, receipt of assistance was not associated with reduced psychological distress.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{determinants}} or the influence of childcare arrangements for school age children in the Irish context. Using longitudinal data from Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the Growing Up in Ireland (GUI) child cohort study, this paper examines the factors associated with participation in non-parental after-school care in middle childhood and examines the influence of such care settings on children’s outcomes at age 13. The findings show that participation in the type of after-school clubs captured by the GUI data (largely paid care in a group setting) is supporting children with specific educational needs and those with limited family support, as well as being strongly associated with maternal employment and high household income. Cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes at thirteen years are best explained by child, family, school and parental characteristics rather than direct effects of the type of <b>out-of-school</b> <b>care</b> arrangement held at age nine...|$|E

More than 6 out of 10 parents regularly use day care for their pre-school children. About half of nursery school children and 3 in 10 primary school children regularly use <b>out-of-school</b> <b>care.</b> For Kind en Gezin, the organisation that monitors child-minding for the Flemish authorities, it is important to continue to follow developments closely {{from the perspective of the}} consumer also. How many parents use child-minding facilities? When and under what circumstances? What type of child-minding do they use and does everyone find something that suits them? How do they evaluate the quality of child-minding facilities? The aim of the study commissioned by Kind en Gezin from the Higher Institute for Labour Studies (HIVA) was to organise a large-scale survey of a representative group of parents with young children in Flanders into their use of child-minding and the background to this. The study was to cover both pre-school and schoolchildren. In addition to an analysis of about 2000 ‘standard’ Flemish families, use of child-minding by certain specific groups was also investigated. These were: families with a disabled child, ethnic minority families, disadvantaged families, one-parent families and families where the mother is unemployed. nrpages: 195 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) {{is one of}} {{the best}} known deadly diseases in the world, due to its devastating impact on communities, families, children and development. Worldwide, 34 million people are presently living with HIV/AIDS out of which 17 million are HIV/AIDS orphans. India is the home to the second largest number of HIV/AIDS orphans in the world after South Africa and is expected to become the next epicenter of HIV/AIDS orphan crises. A thorough review of published empirical studies was done. PubMed, PsycINFO databases, online publications of several organizations, web searches and several online journals related to HIV/AIDS were reviewed. Studies related to HIV/AIDS orphans belonging to the age group of 6 to 18 years, who had lost either or both parents to HIV/AIDS or were living with HIV/AIDS infected parents were selected for the purpose of review. Mental health status of HIV/AIDS orphans demands attention because they severely experience negative emotions, behavioral problems, higher levels of psychological difficulties and poor academic performances due to the reasons of being <b>out-of-school,</b> being <b>cared</b> for by a non-parent, inadequate care, child labour, physical abuse, stigma and discrimination. Majorities of the studies found lower level of Perceived Social Support (PSS) of HIV/AIDS orphans. HIV/AIDS orphans need help, we need to know how their mental health is at risk and how to develop prevention and intervention efforts for improving their mental health.

40|$|This chapter takes a child-centred {{focus on}} {{debates about the}} goals of a good {{childcare}} system, and takes as its particular priority the interests and needs of children in low-income and socioeconomically disadvantaged families and their right to benefit from participation in mainstream early childhood education and care (ECEC) services of good quality. Two recent influential Australian reports (ACOSS 2006; Press 2006) and the OECD (2001) adopt the term early childhood education and care (ECEC) to refer to formal prior-to-school care and education for infants and young children, covering services such as long day care centres, family day care, registered in-home care and pre-schools (or kindergartens in some jurisdictions) that provide sessional care and education for children {{one to two years}} prior to the commencement of school. I would add to this list, <b>out-of-school</b> hours <b>care,</b> of increasing significance as mothers in two parent and sole parent families increase their labour force participation when their children enter school, and as the implementation of welfare-to-work legislation from 1 July 2006 mandates at least 15 hours of paid work or employment-related activity for income support recipients once their youngest child is aged six. The argument here is predicated on the well-substantiated international literature which demonstrates that good quality early childhood education and care services are of benefit in improving the social/emotional wellbeing, and cognitive development outcomes for all children, particularly for low income and disadvantaged children – an effect which recognises children both as present citizens whose wellbeing should be paramount and as future citizens with respect to the enhancement of their educational and employment participation, often called their human capital (Lister 2004) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} {{of children in}} the US and many other high-income nations are now cared for many hours per week by people who are neither their parents nor their school teachers. The role of such pre-school and <b>out-of-school</b> <b>care</b> is potentially two-fold: First, child care makes it feasible for both parents or the only parent in a single-parent family to be employed. Second, early intervention programs and after school programs aim to enhance child development, particularly among disadvantaged children. Corresponding to this distinction, there are two branches of literature to be summarized in this chapter. The first focuses on the market for child care and analyzes factors affecting the supply, demand and quality of care. The second focuses on child outcomes, and asks whether certain types of programs can ameliorate the effects of early disadvantage. The primary goal of this review is to bring the two literatures together in order to suggest ways that both may be enhanced. Accordingly, we provide an overview of the number of children being cared for in different sorts of arrangements; describe theory and evidence {{about the nature of the}} private child care market; and discuss theory and evidence about government intervention in the market for child care. Our summary suggests that additional research is needed in order to better characterize interactions between government programs and market-provided child care. pre-school, child care, day care, early intervention, Head Start, after school programs, subsidies, regulations...|$|E

Background : The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were: to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born {{at the start of}} the 21 st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will require to provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229) to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and development to focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may be to emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhood to investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when available Additional objectives subsequently included for MCS were: to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion) to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom The first sweep (MCS 1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS 2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS 3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS 4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, and the fifth sweep (MCS 5) in 2012 - 2013, when they were eleven years old. Sub-sample studies : Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see SN 5614). Weighting : Users should note that the weighting section in the 'Guide to the Datasets' document recommends analysis in Stata, as SPSS is not currently able to weight the data using the survey design factors. The depositor is working on a solution for SPSS, but this is not yet available. A Stata version of the dataset is available for download by registered users, alongside the SPSS and tab-delimited versions. MCS web pages : Further information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. MCS 4 : The objectives of MCS 4 were the same as MCS 3, namely: to continue tracking the child's physical, cognitive and behavioural development to chart continuity and change in the child's family circumstances and physical environment up to age seven to record the child's transition to primary school and their experience of the first years at school to track the child's previous experience of early education and day-care, along with current <b>out-of-school</b> <b>care</b> arrangements record the progress of the child's older siblings to re-contact families who had participated in at least one of the earlier surveys but who may not have participated in all sweeps to ask the children directly about their thoughts and experiences at age seven The first edition of MCS 4 was released in April 2010. For the second edition (November 2010), some extra materials were deposited: the MCS 4 geographically-linked data file, the main MCS 4 Technical Report and Appendix, the Teacher Survey questionnaires for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Teacher Survey technical report. For the third edition (August 2012), a new derived variables dataset was added to the study, along with an updated version of the household grid file and an updated 'Guide to the Datasets' document. For the fourth edition (December 2012), an updated version of the derived variables dataset was added to the study. Syntax was also run on the parent interview dataset to remove some variables that had been updated and moved to the derived variables dataset - see list in the 'READ' file for details. A new Derived Variables User Guide and an updated Guide to the Datasets have been added to the documentation. For the fifth edition (September 2015), the MCS 4 Cohort Member assessment file has been updated and now includes the Standardised Maths Score and Anonymised Interview number. For the sixth edition (November 2015), Children's Aspirations Classification data and accompanying documentation were added to the study. In August 2011, the Teacher Survey data and documentation were removed from this study. They are now available in a separate study: SN 6848 - Millennium Cohort Study: Fourth Survey Teacher Survey, 2008. Main Topics : The files currently included in the MCS 4 study comprise data from the main Parent Interview, the Household Grid, Child Measurement and Assessment and the Cohort Member self completion questionnaire. The Parent Interview file comprises data from the Main Respondent, Partner Respondent and Proxy Respondent questionnaires, which covered household information; family context; early education, schooling and childcare; child and family activities and child's behaviour; parenting activities; child's health; parent's health; employment, income and education; housing and local area; and other matters. The 'unfolding brackets' questions, used to home in on an income that was not known exactly, have been split out into separate files for ease of navigation through the dataset. The Household Grid file comprises demographic data on households and additional derived variables. The Child Assessments and Measurement files include cognitive and physical measurements, including the 'Story of Sally and Anne' cognitive protocol; the British Ability Scales covering Picture Similarities, Naming Vocabulary and Pattern Construction; and Maths Test; height; weight; and waist circumference and body fat measurement. The Cohort Member paper self completion was given to all participant children.

40|$|With {{prevalence}} rates of obesity among {{children and adolescents}} steadily rising, childhood obesity and overweight has become a public health concern. Publically funded elementary schools are {{in a unique position}} to provide children with opportunities regarding the promotion of physical activity and healthy nutritional behaviors. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to conduct exploratory research to investigate the dietary habits of elementary school students enrolled in four Hillsborough County <b>Out-of-School</b> Time (HOST) <b>care</b> programs. Methods: The study utilized a quantitative, non-experimental study design. The instruments that were used in this research included a new questionnaire that was titled “All about You Yesterday”. This paper questionnaire was a combination of questions from the Physical Questionnaire for Older Children, Youth Risk Behavior Survey, and Day in The Life Of Questionnaire. The questionnaire gathered information about what the students had eaten the day before. It also allowed for collection of students’ gender, age, and grade level, physical activity levels, and the amount of time they spent being sedentary. Dietary data collected from the questionnaire was inputted into the ASA- 24 -Kids program for calculating Healthy Eating Index scores. Scores were examined to categorize the children’s diets as: poor, needs improvement, and good. This data was plotted into SAS to determine if there were patterns. The relationships between dietary and demographic factors were analyzed. A logistic regression model was used to test the association between dietary scores and amount of physical activity. Results: A total of 91 students participated in this study. The average score was categorized as needs improvement, as were the majority of the students’ diets. The findings showed a pattern that diets improved from third to fourth grade and declined in fifth grade. More males had diets that were categorized as needs improvement rather than poor, and site C had the most students with diet in the needs improvement category. However, none of the covariates were significant. The models used to test the association between the HEI scores and the amount of physical activity produced large p- values (3 ̆e 0. 05), which indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis that states that there is no association. The same was true for the association between sedentary levels and the HEI categories. Conclusions: The study showed that, regardless of having the opportunity to eat nutritious meals, a great number of after-school children had diets that were categorized as poor. Findings also showed that there was no association between diet and the amount of physical activity that the after-school children participated in; nor did the diets have an association with the sedentary levels reported. Recommendations: In an effort to improve the diets of elementary school children, schools should encourage their students to try fruits and vegetables that are being offered through taste tests. If the meals that are offered during the taste tests are enjoyed then they should be offered as part of the school’s lunch or snack. After school programs should also offer these taste tests and include short nutritional lessons into their programs where children are also given the opportunity to cook and eat healthy snacks...|$|R
