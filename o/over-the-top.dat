5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I think maybe, the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm really proud of it because that's really one that goes <b>over-the-top</b> {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has {{religious}} imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars - which I always like.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, 2016, {{the team}} renewed its {{contract}} with CSN Northwest through the 2020–2021 season, giving the network {{exclusive rights to}} all Trail Blazers games beginning in the 2017–18 season (and thus ending the team's over-the-air syndication package). The team had originally considered an arrangement with KPTV, under which games would be broadcast over-the-air and simulcast via an internet service, but deals with potential streaming partners fell through. DirecTV's Root Sports Northwest made a higher-value, long-term offer, but the offer was rejected because Root Sports could not guarantee whether its carriage deal with Comcast Cable, which serves 55% of the Portland market, would be renewed. On November 2, 2017, NBC Sports Northwest launched a paid <b>over-the-top</b> service, Blazers Plus, offering paid access to 15 games through {{the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

He returns home to find his domineering father reading the paper. Michael's personality changes yet again, this time more shy and reserved. When he learns of his son's success, Michael's father blesses his son with a Jewish prayer.|$|E
5|$|Saints Row IV {{is an open}} world action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Volition and published by Deep Silver. It is the fourth title in the Saints Row series.

5|$|Whereas many {{pitchers}} throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with {{a pronounced}} <b>over-the-top</b> arm action. This may have increased his velocity, but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially {{movement away from}} left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches. His four-seam fastball gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin. It not only appeared to move very late but also might move two or three distinct times. His overhand curveball, spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24inches due to his arm action. Rob Neyer called it the best curve of all time. He also occasionally threw a changeup and a forkball.|$|E

25|$|Films such as Valley of the Dolls (1967), Mommie Dearest (1981) and Burlesque (2010) gained camp status {{primarily}} due to the filmmakers' {{attempting to}} produce a serious film that wound up unintentionally comedic.

25|$|Although a spinoff of The Weather Channel, Local Now is {{formatted}} as {{a general}} news and weather channel. Because of the distribution structure of <b>over-the-top</b> subscription television, Local Now utilizes a version of TWC's IntelliStar unit – installed at The Weather Channel's uplink site in Atlanta – that are configured differently from that used by The Weather Channel and Weatherscan, allowing for the recycling of segments featured in one news block seamlessly into another and routine updating of segments {{to each of the}} localized feeds. Local Now's automated model – which leverages The Weather Channel's existing infrastructure and technology, and employs only three staff members – allows Local Now to be offered {{at a fraction of the}} retransmission rates charged by local broadcast stations.

Many of the in-game commercials went through several drafts and the developers found this writing process to be challenging.|$|E
