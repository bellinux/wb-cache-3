5|$|After the Aktions in late 1941, {{no further}} {{large-scale}} deportations or other massacres {{took place in}} the Vilnius Ghetto. This period <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> lasted throughout 1942 and early 1943. During this period, Gens' department oversaw the three police precincts the ghetto had been divided into, as well as the ghetto's prison. The police force in early 1942 had about 200 policemen.|$|E
5|$|From 872 to 877 {{there was}} {{apparently}} a period <b>of</b> <b>calm,</b> since the sources are silent on any {{military operations in}} Sicily. This was probably chiefly due to internal turmoil in Muslim Sicily, with six governors reported as having taken office during this period, {{as well as the}} weakness of the Aghlabid government on the Ifriqiyan metropolis. In Italy, Muslim raids continued, but the Byzantines had a major success in 875 or 876, after the death of Louis II, when they took possession of Bari.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{inhabitants}} of the new French territory did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them. For this reason, rice farmers in Carabane experienced lootings and abductions by the Karoninka people. Troops led by Émile Pinet-Laprade attacked the Karoninka villages in March 1860, forcing them to submission. A period <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> ensued. While the Mandinka Muslims continued, illegally, to practice slavery and trade, non-Muslim villages tended to come together, accepting the Resident of Carabane as the arbitrator of their disagreements.|$|E

5|$|The search {{team and}} {{equipment}} {{had to be}} organised within four months, {{to take advantage of}} a narrow window <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> conditions in the North Atlantic. Organisation of the search was complicated by the presence on board of a documentary team and their film equipment, along with a television journalist who made live news reports via satellite during the search. The search team also planned to stream video from the remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) directly to Channel 4's website.|$|E
5|$|There were 29known {{tropical}} cyclones, including 24 of typhoon status, {{of which}} {{several of the}} storms were deadly. A typhoon in November was the deadliest cyclone of the season, causing 49deaths as it crossed the Philippines.

5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) as essential to a liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with fear, and whose sense <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> and inner contentment is free from anger, fear, and joy toward others.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} features architecture {{intended to}} evoke a sense <b>of</b> <b>calm.</b> It was constructed {{with a central}} courtyard {{and a number of}} windows overlooking it, as well as nature-related artwork and architecture. There are also separate hallways for staff and visitors {{in order to make the}} interior appear less crowded. The hospital also features a substantial amount of parking and a shuttle service to the entrance. Miami Valley Hospital South was constructed with future expansion in mind. Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway can be added to the wing which will add 60 beds, and the maternity ward can also be expanded with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could be expanded to 180 beds.|$|E
5|$|The period <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> for Pagan {{ended in}} the early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought {{to cut off the}} retreat of Song {{refugees}} in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols.|$|E

5|$|This period <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> {{came to an}} {{end when}} the British consul in Rio de Janeiro nearly sparked a war between Great Britain and Brazil. He sent an {{ultimatum}} containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862. The Brazilian government refused to yield, and the consul issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared itself for the imminent conflict, and coastal defenses were given permission to fire upon any British warship that tried to capture Brazilian merchant ships. The Brazilian government then severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|When Hillyar's {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Port Louis, Captain Schomberg immediately assumed command {{and led the}} squadron out again on 14 May, following the French eastwards. Heading straight for Tamatave, the only resupply point between Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope, Schomberg rapidly gained on the French and when dawn broke on 20 May the French were {{within sight of the}} harbour. During the day, both commanders were frustrated by light winds and periods <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> in which none of the ships were able to move. Roquebert completed resupplying his ships at 12:00 and pulled away from the harbour in battle line, Clorinde followed by Renommée and Néréide while the British, although initially intending to form a line with Astraea at its head, gradually broke into a loose formation created by the vagaries of the wind.|$|E
5|$|Ilona turned south, {{and later}} south-southeast, on 15December {{and began a}} steady {{approach}} to Western Australia. Slight intensification took place, with the cyclone achieving its peak strength around 00:00UTC on 17December with ten-minute sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph) and a barometric pressure of 960hPa (mbar; 28.35inHg). The JTWC estimated Ilona to be slightly stronger, with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph)—a Category2-equivalent on the SSHS. That day, Ilona passed near the North Rankin gas platform. Around 16:00UTC, the eye of Ilona made landfall near Mardie Station. Around 16:30UTC, the center of Ilona passed over the town, with a five minute period <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> observed. An eye passage was also reported in Fortescue Roadhouse. The cyclone rapidly decayed as it accelerated inland, falling below tropical cyclone strength by 00:00UTC on 19December, at which time it was situated northeast of Meekatharra. Thereafter, the decaying low turned east and ultimately dissipated later that day {{just west of the}} Western Australia–South Australia border.|$|E

5|$|On 20 May the British squadron, {{under the}} command of Captain Charles Marsh Schomberg, {{discovered}} the French off Tamatave and attacked, both sides hampered by light winds which impeded movement for much of the day. During a period <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> weather early in the battle, the French were better positioned than the disorganised British squadron and Roquebert's ships inflicted severe damage on several British vessels before an increasing breeze allowed Schomberg to press home his attack. As the evening approached, the French attempted to escape, Roquebert sacrificing his flagship and ultimately his life to allow the frigates Clorinde and the badly damaged Néréide to escape. Five days later, Schomberg's squadron rediscovered Néréide at Tamatave and persuaded the town's commander to surrender without a fight. The battle was the last action of the Mauritius campaign and confirmed British dominance of the seas east of the Cape of Good Hope {{for the rest of the}} Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|On 31 December, the {{battered}} Vénus docked in Rivière Noire and Stewart and his men, {{who had never}} {{had an opportunity to}} seize their freedom, were marched to Port Louis, where they witnessed the arrival of Manche, accompanied by Créole, Charlton and United Kingdom on 1 January 1810. For their services, Stewart and his fellow prisoners were later released and allowed to sail to the Cape of Good Hope. There they discovered Windham, which had failed to arrive at Île de France. Although her prize crew had retained control of the ship following the storm, they had been sighted, chased and seized within sight of Île de France on 29 December by the newly arrived British frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Lucius Curtis. Bellone and her prizes arrived at Port Louis on 2 January, having slipped past Rowley's blockade during a period <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} accelerated northeastward, {{and passed}} over the Hampton Roads area early on September 3. After crossing the Chesapeake Bay, the cyclone traversed the Delmarva Peninsula near the Atlantic coastline, and at around 1500UTC the eye passed directly over Cape Henlopen, Delaware; a thirty-minute period <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> was reported. It continued across the Delaware Bay and later passed over Cape May, New Jersey, where a fifteen-minute calm was reported. Modern researchers estimate it was a Category3 or Category4 hurricane upon striking New Jersey, {{one of the few}} hurricanes to hit the state. Moving ashore at very low tide, it paralleled the state's coastline just inland, and after exiting into Lower New York Bay the hurricane made landfall on New York City at around 1930UTC on September 3; this makes it the only major hurricane to directly hit the city. A minimal hurricane in 1893 also made landfall on what later became part of New York City. One modern researcher estimates the hurricane was moving at a forward speed of 35mph (55km/h), and upon moving ashore had a pressure of 965mbar. The hurricane continued northeastward through New England, and after entering Massachusetts on September 4 its exact path was unknown; one researcher estimated the cyclone tracked northeastward until losing its identity over southeastern Maine, while another assessed the storm as passing far to the west of Maine.|$|E

5|$|The {{king and}} queen were not pleased with married life. The royal couple enjoyed periods <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> and affection, but Anne refused to play the {{submissive}} role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a false pregnancy or miscarriage in 1534, he saw her failure {{to give him a}} son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine. Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with Margaret ("Madge") Shelton in 1535, although historian Antonia Fraser argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister Mary Shelton.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages <b>of</b> <b>calm</b> or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
