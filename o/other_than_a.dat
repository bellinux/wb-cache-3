5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the Minister's order to {{prohibit}} all publications by WTBTS was not excessive. Any order <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> total blanket order {{would have been impossible}} to monitor administratively. Therefore, the fact that the contents of one publication were unobjectionable did not, by itself, make the ban unreasonable.|$|E

5|$|Although the Attorney General, William de Grey, {{advised that}} the {{publishers}} should again be prosecuted, Mansfield disagreed, {{saying that if}} they {{failed to respond to}} Junius, he would become bored and stop writing.

5|$|Based on {{an anecdote}} about the Second World War by the Romani {{historian}} Jacques Sigot, {{the film was}} inspired by a Romani who escaped the Nazis with help from French villagers. It depicts the rarely documented subject of Porajmos (the Romani Holocaust). <b>Other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> band of Romani people, the film has a character based on Yvette Lundy, a French teacher who was active in the French resistance and deported to a concentration camp for forging passports for Romani. Gatlif had intended to make a documentary but the lack of supporting documents led him to present it as a drama.|$|E
5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E

5|$|Burnley did {{not play}} any {{pre-season}} friendly games <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> practice match between the first team and the reserves, which was watched by a crowd of around 10,000 at Turf Moor. The team's last competitive match had ended in a 0–2 defeat against Manchester United in the Lancashire Senior Cup on 8May 1920, almost four months earlier. The strip for 1920–21 was very little changed {{from that of the}} previous season; the claret jersey with light blue sleeves and a light blue stripe around the collar was kept along with the white shorts, but the claret socks were replaced by black.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significant}} reclamation {{on the two}} sites very little evidence remains of the power stations, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> small number of bricks and steel rods. Some minor structures have survived to the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, a brick wall, and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains of the power stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E
5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France was barely criticised at all in Africa, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mild response by Dahomey and one by the Democratic Republic of Congo. The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos.

5|$|Fruit bodies grow on the ground. Phellodon species, {{like all}} members of the order Thelephorales, are thought to be mycorrhizal, forming {{symbiotic}} relationships with trees. Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae. The ectomycorrhizae that P.niger forms with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope ratio analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P.niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> tree host.|$|E

The Metropolitan Council's Metro Transit, which operates the light rail system and most of the city's buses, provides free travel vouchers through the Guaranteed Ride Home program to allay fears that commuters might otherwise be occasionally stranded if, for example, they work late hours.|$|E
5|$|In Mark, {{the disciples}} play hardly any role <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{negative}} one.

The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.|$|E

5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> submission {{to the will}} of the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the release of Third/Sister Lovers, Bell died in a car accident.

Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.|$|E

Aerosmith played their first gig in Mendon, Massachusetts at Nipmuc Regional High School (now Miscoe Hill Middle School) on November 6, 1970. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, who also attended the Berklee School of Music and was formerly of the band Earth Inc. Whitford, from Reading, Massachusetts, had already played at Reading's AW Coolidge Middle School. <b>Other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> period from July 1979 to April 1984, the line-up of Tyler, Perry, Hamilton, Kramer, and Whitford has stayed the same.|$|E

It was loaned to the Patent Office for display in 1862.

5|$|Taiwan-based athlete Alfonso Martinez was {{the sole}} {{representative}} of Belize in taekwondo, and in any sport <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> track and field event, at the Beijing Olympics.

His opponent was Juan Antonio Ramos, a taekwondo martial artist from Spain. In the course of the match Ramos scored two points on Martinez, while Martinez scored only one on Ramos. Thus Ramos defeated Martinez and advanced to the next round, while Martinez did not. Ramos ultimately placed fifth in the final round.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law does not recognize proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E
