5|$|Construction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> tunnel {{project began}} with partial {{closures}} of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane {{in either direction}} and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour. To prepare for extended periods of service disruption on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its electric trolleybus routes onto 1st Avenue.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 1975, a {{westbound}} GO train {{collided with}} a Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus that was stalled on a crossing at St. Clair and Midland Avenue. Nine passengers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> were killed and 20 others were injured. This was the worst accident in terms of loss {{of life in the}} history of the TTC and GO Transit systems. The level crossing was replaced by an overpass a few years later.|$|E

Cool then shot himself as the bus veered across two lanes of traffic and plunged off the bridge's eastern side onto the roof of an apartment building below. Herman Liebelt, a passenger <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> later died of injuries he sustained in the crash.|$|E

5|$|Patrick gets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts to get <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits {{in a very long}} line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E

5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E

5|$|Currently under {{construction}} are dedicated lanes for bus services which will operate {{as part of}} the new urban rapid transit network (bus rapid transit). The system includes high-quality stations and stops; express buses that can carry more than 120 passengers and will run on a three-minute frequency during peak hours along Amman's busiest corridors; terminals and park-n-ride facilities; and an integrated fare collection system allowing passengers to pay the fare at stations before embarking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b> The BRT is planned to run along three major corridors. The first one connects Sweileh with Mahatta via Sport City, with a major underground station at the University of Jordan. The second corridor connects Sport City with Downtown Amman at Ras El-Ain. The third corridor connects Customs Square with Mahatta.|$|E
5000|$|All buses are {{designated}} [...] "Fare Paid Zones", which means passengers {{are required by}} law to have a valid fare while <b>on</b> board <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b> Failing to pay the fare or not having a valid fare while <b>on</b> board <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> could result in the passenger being fined $173 and/or removed from <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b> Fare inspections are conducted by Transit Security Officers and members from the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bus</b> transport: <b>The</b> {{volume of}} {{automobile}} traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus's</b> route can affect <b>the</b> <b>bus's</b> {{ability to keep}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> schedule. While a route that is free of obstruction can remain on schedule or even move ahead of schedule, heavy traffic can slow down <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> behind its schedule. This can be due to regular conditions {{at the time of}} day, or an occasional or one-time event, such as a sports game or festival that draws a large crowd.|$|R

Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a quilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down hard on the pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E
5|$|Leslie gives Jess an art kit on his birthday, {{much to his}} delight.

Afterwards, Jess apologizes to Leslie by giving her a puppy, whom she names Prince Terrien. Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll resembling Janice, and a squirrel-like creature resembling Hoager, whom they name the 'Sqoager'. At school, Leslie becomes frustrated by Janice's fee for using the toilet. Jess and Leslie play a prank on Janice, and she becomes the laughing stock of everyone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b> Once Leslie's parents finish their book, she and Jess help paint their house. Jess is impressed by her parents' happiness, and smiles as he watches their family. At school, Leslie discovers from an upset Janice that her bullying is due to her abusive father, and they become friends and later Janice becomes Jess' friend. Jess and Leslie take P.T. to Terabithia, where they fight off several creatures resembling students at their school. When it starts raining, they decide to go home, and Jess looks on smiling as Leslie runs away.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City elected not to parade {{the trophy}} at the match {{as they did}} not wish to be seen as 'crass' in front of the visiting Stoke City supporters. Instead, Manchester City were invited by Manchester City Council to host an open-top bus parade through the City of Manchester in celebration of their victory.

The parade finally reached Ashton New Road where thousands supporters were waiting at the gates of the City of Manchester Stadium to welcome the team home. The parade culminated in a special reception at the stadium, where 40,000 who claimed free tickets for the event were waiting. Greater Manchester Police estimated that the parade attracted a crowd in excess of 100,000.|$|E
