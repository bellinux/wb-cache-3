500|$|It is an R {{song with}} {{elements}} of electro. Lyrically, Carey is recounting a past relationship which fell into [...] "violent times", {{and how she}} still deals {{with the effects of}} what she experienced. Carey begins with the line [...] "I was a girl/ You were ‘the man'/ I was too young to understand/ I was naïve /Believing everything you told me." [...] Although Carey never mentions Mottola's name, many critics believed that she was addressing him directly in the lines [...] "Shining like a chandelier/ That decorated every room inside/ The private hell we built", [...] "Sleeping with the enemy, aware that he was smothering every last part of me" [...] and [...] "Said you were strong/ Protecting me/ Then I found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were weak/ Keepin' me there, under your thumb/ Cause you were scared that I'd become much/ More than you could handle." [...] After confessing that she would [...] " [...] up scared some nights, still dreaming about the violent times," [...] Carey decides {{to walk away from the}} relationship, and declares [...] "but I still live with the side effects". J. Freedom De Luc of The Washington Post likened the [...] "echoing" [...] repetition of [...] "Side effects" [...] to that of Rihanna's on her 2007 single [...] "Umbrella". In an interview with Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, Carey explained why she felt compelled to write the song: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{was greeted with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim. Music journalist Mark Pytlik wrote the visual [...] "marked an unquestionable creative apex for Björk's visual work, a perfect synthesis of form and content". IGN gave the video a score of 9/10, writing it is an [...] "utterly gorgeous sight to behold" [...] and [...] "just about perfect". Times Craig Duff called it a milestone in computer animation and stated that [...] "no robot had expressed the sensuality that director Chris Cunningham imbues in a Björk-bot in the video". MusicRadar considered the music video to be [...] "one of the most visually striking promos of Björk's career." [...] NME also praised the [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] clip as one of Björk's best, and particularly commended the wide angle shot of the cyborgs kissing as the chorus kicks in. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine dubbed it [...] "the perfect pre-millennial precursor to our current gadget-assisted culture of self-love" [...] and also wrote, [...] "When it was released, I thought it looked cool and {{stressed the importance of}} loving yourself. Now I think it's a terrifying and sealed-off nightmare wherein you find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are the only person who will ever love you." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Scott Plagenhoef considered that [...] "the strongest single images from any video of the 1990s come from [...] ", also calling it [...] "strange and moving". CMJ New Music Monthlys Douglas Wolk called the video [...] "magnificent" [...] and praised it for [...] " [...] out the beauty of the song".|$|E

500|$|... "Heart" [...] {{received}} {{a wide range}} of opinion from reviewers, though the balance was clearly on the positive side. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, wrote that it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish", and HuffPost TV Crystal Bell called it [...] "a standout episode of the season". Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle characterized it as [...] "sort of terrible" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and IGN's Robert Canning gave it an [...] "okay" [...] grade of 6.5 out of 10, but Canning also acclaimed [...] "the introduction of Rachel's two dads played by Jeff Goldblum and Broadway vet Brian Stokes Mitchell"; he said they were [...] "fantastic" [...] and their schemes regarding the engagement [...] "delightful". Bell called theirs [...] "the most surprising pleasant performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "I absolutely adored these two". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as [...] "annoyingly perfect", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, [...] "What's not to like? Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could see, from their characterization, [...] "how Rachel got to be the way she was". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: [...] "For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show {{for two and a half}} seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers [...] "to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking" [...] was [...] "very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but I sort of like that it suggests to me that, yeah, this is who these guys are." [...] He characterized Hiram and LeRoy as [...] "goofy sitcom characters", unlike Burt or Carole.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2008, Curreri {{suffered}} a throat injury, which {{caused him to}} cancel {{the majority of his}} remaining concerts for the year. He explains: [...] "Basically I quit smoking, and it turns <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can damage your vocal chords right after that pretty easily because they expand in their newfound health." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to Forester's {{investing}} {{style of}} buying low P/E stocks with good earnings prospects, he {{is compared to}} Warren Buffett. Forester loosely quotes Buffett at times such as in Barron's Magazine when he said: [...] "It's When The Tide Goes <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> find out who's swimming without a bathing suit. I have mine on." [...] Although he is now likened to Buffett, Forester maintains Templeton as his role model. [...] He invests by the philosophy credo that [...] "I buy undervalued stocks, {{and if there are}} none, I go to cash." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 1983 Albini met Naked Raygun singer Jeff Pezzati through mutual {{friends and}} {{convinced}} him to play bass guitar with Big Black. Pezzati recalled that Albini [...] "knew {{a heck of a}} lot about, right from the start, how to release a record and get the word <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have a record", and that [...] "He jumped at the chance to have a band play his stuff." [...] The two practiced in Pezzati's basement, and one day Naked Raygun guitarist Santiago Durango came downstairs and asked to play along. The trio clicked as a unit, Durango's ability to rework arrangements and tweak sounds helping to refine Albini's song ideas. According to Albini, [...] "He ended up being absolutely crucial to Big Black." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to honouring journalists, Lindsey Hilsum, the Channel 4 News International Editor {{who was the}} host of the 2014 awards, emphasises that the Amnesty Awards play a very important role in encouraging editors to allow journalists to cover more obscure stories that are far away and expensive. She said that when: “you point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> won an Amnesty Award for a similar story a couple of years ago. It makes editors think that they will get some sort of kudos from this, and that it matters within the industry. So I think it’s tremendously important and I think Amnesty is doing a tremendous job by giving us these awards so that we can use them to say: ‘Yes, we’ve got to carry on reporting human rights, it really matters’." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liberati's {{system of}} {{acquiring}} his style {{is founded on}} the bedrock of virtuosoship: persevering, persistent, faithful work of the severest nature. With a determination and energy truly admirable he devoted all his spare moments to practice. His {{first step was to}} perfect the 'attack of the tone.' Then, with a metronome as his guide in tempo, he practiced scales in all keys—always in a light staccato—until he could play them with absolute precision, in both time and tune. He stated, [...] "You may think you play a scale perfectly but try it with a metronome and you will find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't. I thought I did until I began practicing with a metronome." [...] Although then regarded as an artist, Liberati learned that he could not play a simple scale with evenness, but by diligence he gained the point he sought. He was forced to begin at a slow tempo but gradually increasing it, he rapidly acquired the desired precision at any tempo he found necessary.|$|E
