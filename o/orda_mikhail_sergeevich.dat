5000|$|Wolkonsky {{was born}} on the Fall estate near Revel in Imperial Russia (now Tallinn, Estonia). His mother was Princess Elizaveta Grigorievna Volkonskaya, {{daughter}} of Grigory Petrovich Volkonsky (son of Sophia, a sister of Decembrist Sergei Volkonsky) and Mary (née Countess Benckendorff, daughter of Count Alexander Benckendorff).

In our previous investigation, we found a medium correlation between the efficacy and safety of haloperidol and the activity of CYP 3 A 4 in patients with alcohol abuse. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the correlation between the activity of CYP 2 D 6 and the efficacy and safety of haloperidol in patients with diagnosed alcohol abuse. Methods: The study involved 70 men (average age: 40. 83 ± 9. 92 years) with alcohol addiction. A series of psychometric scales were used in the research. The activity of CYP 2 D 6 was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry using the ratio of 6 -hydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro-beta-carboline to pinoline. Genotyping of CYP 2 D 6 (1846 G>A) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: According to results of correlation analysis, statistically significant values of Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) between the activity of CYP 2 D 6 and the difference of points in psychometric scale were obtained in patients receiving haloperidol in injection form (Sheehan Clinical Anxiety Rating Scale =- 0. 721 [P< 0. 001] and Udvald for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale = 0. 692 [P< 0. 001]) and in those receiving haloperidol in tablet form (Covi Anxiety Scale =- 0. 851 [P< 0. 001] and Udvald for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale = 0. 797 [P< 0. 001]). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the correlations between the activity of CYP 2 D 6 isozyme and the efficacy and safety of haloperidol in patients with alcohol addiction.

Objective: The primary {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the relationship between CYP 3 A 5 gene polymorphism, activity of the CYP 3 A isoenzyme, and the risk of development of adverse drug reactions by haloperidol in patients with alcohol abuse. Methods: Sixty-six male alcohol-addicted patients participated in the study. The safety of haloperidol was evaluated by Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale (UKU) and Simpson–Angus Scale for extrapyramidal symptoms (SAS). The activity of CYP 3 A was evaluated by determining the concentrations of an endogenous substrate of this isoenzyme (cortisol) and its urinary metabolite (6 -beta-hydroxycortisol, 6 -B-HC). Genotyping of CYP 3 A 5 * 3 was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction with allele-specific hybridization. Results: The frequency of A-allele occurrence in Russian population was very poor (2. 27 %). CYP 3 A 5 * 3 polymorphism had no influence on safety profile indicators of haloperidol (UKU scale: p= 0. 55, SAS scale: p= 0. 64). In addition, there was no statistical significant difference between the values of indexes of the metabolic ratio (6 -B-HC/cortisol) in groups with different genotypes of CYP 3 A 5 * 3 : GG 5. 00 (3. 36; 6. 39) vs AG 5. 26 (2. 10; 6. 78) (p= 0. 902). Conclusion: The frequency of A-allele occurrence of CYP 3 A 5 * 3 in Russian population is very poor, and it has no high influence on the safety of haloperidol treatment; therefore, there are no reasons to take this polymorphism into account in patients with alcohol addiction who receive haloperidol.

Contradictory data concerning the effects of genetic polymorphisms of genes encoding these receptors and associated structures (catechol-O-methyltransferase [COMT], glycine transporter and gene encoding the density of D 2 receptors on the neuronal membrane) are described. Objective: The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the correlation between DRD 2, SLC 6 A 3 (DAT) and COMT genetic polymorphisms and to investigate their effect on the development of adverse drug reactions in patients with alcohol-use disorder who received haloperidol. Patients and methods: The study included 64 male patients (average age 41. 38 ± 10. 14  years, median age 40  years, lower quintile [LQ] 35  years, upper quintile [UQ] 49  years). Bio-Rad CFX Manager™ software and “SNP-Screen” sets of “Syntol” (Russia) were used to determine polymorphisms rs 4680, rs 1800497, rs 1124493, rs 2242592, rs 2298826 and rs 2863170. In every “SNP-Screen” set, two allele-specific hybridizations were used, which allowed to determine two alleles of studied polymorphism separately on two fluorescence channels. Results: Results of this study detected a statistically significant difference in the adverse drug reaction intensity in patients receiving haloperidol with genotypes 9 / 10 and 10 / 10 of polymorphic marker SLC 6 A 3 rs 28363170. In patients receiving haloperidol in tablets, the increases in the UKU Side-Effect Rating Scale (UKU) score of 9. 96 ± 2. 24 (10 / 10) versus 13 ± 2. 37 (9 / 10; p <  0. 001) and in the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) score of 5. 04 ± 1. 59 (10 / 10) versus 6. 41 ± 1. 33 (9 / 10; p = 0. 006) were revealed. Conclusion: Polymorphism of the SCL 6 A 3 gene can affect the safety of haloperidol, and this should be taken into account during the choice of drug and its dosage regimen.
