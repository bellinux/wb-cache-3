5|$|Finland. Aikamme tieteislukemisto (August 1958– December 1958) was a Finnish edition <b>of</b> <b>Galaxy,</b> {{edited by}} Mary A. Wuorio and {{published}} by Viikkosanomat Oy.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{returned}} {{all eight}} broadcast prints <b>of</b> <b>Galaxy</b> 4 and The Underwater Menace to the BBC to be disposed of. In the mid-1980s, former ITV engineer Terry Burnett purchased episode 3 <b>of</b> <b>Galaxy</b> 4 and episode 2 of The Underwater Menace from another collector, unaware of their value (the only extant {{episode of the}} former serial, and one of just two from the latter). In December 2011, after a chance encounter with Doctor Who Restoration Team member Ralph Montagu, Burnett returned the episodes to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Ifs {{new owner}} was Robert Guinn, <b>of</b> <b>Galaxy</b> Publishing. The change of {{ownership}} was abrupt {{and led to a}} delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not appearing until July 1959. The editor was Horace Gold, who was also the editor <b>of</b> <b>Galaxy</b> Science Fiction; Galaxy had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and If and Galaxy appeared in alternate months for the next few years. In a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with If was to experiment, using new writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science-fiction historian Mike Ashley, the effect was that If became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for Galaxy.|$|E
50|$|A galaxy {{group or}} group <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> (GrG) is an {{aggregation}} <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> comprising about 50 or fewer gravitationally bound members, each {{at least as}} luminous as the Milky Way (about 1010 times the luminosity of the Sun); collections <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> larger than groups that are first-order clustering are called galaxy clusters. The groups and clusters <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> can themselves be clustered, into superclusters <b>of</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|R

5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A {{slightly}} more extensive description <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> types {{based on their}} appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering {{the universe as}} a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> types and their distribution suggests that {{life as we know}} it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for {{life as we know it}}, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Tens <b>of</b> {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{have been}} catalogued, {{but only a}} few have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies</b> and <b>of</b> Clusters <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies),</b> the MCG (Morphological Catalogue <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies)</b> and UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies).</b> All <b>of</b> the well-known <b>galaxies</b> appear in {{one or more of these}} catalogues but each time under a different number.|$|R
50|$|M60 is the third-brightest giant {{elliptical}} <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> the Virgo cluster <b>of</b> <b>galaxies,</b> and is {{the dominant}} member of a subcluster <b>of</b> four <b>galaxies,</b> which is the closest-known isolated compact group <b>of</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bicay's {{research}} interests include large-scale structure in the universe, the atomic gas content <b>of</b> spiral <b>galaxies,</b> and the infrared properties <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> and clusters <b>of</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> clusters.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} {{are found}} in the halo of a galaxy and contain considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters, which {{are found in}} the disk of a galaxy. Globular clusters are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. These globular clusters orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs (130,000 light-years) or more. Larger galaxies can have more: Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant elliptical galaxies (particularly those at the centers <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> clusters) such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties of that kind <b>of</b> <b>galaxy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Even though Hoag's Object {{was clearly}} {{shown on the}} Palomar Star Survey, it was not {{included}} in either the Morphological Catalogue <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies,</b> the Catalogue <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies</b> and Clusters <b>of</b> <b>Galaxies,</b> or the catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{studies on the}} {{correlation}} functions <b>of</b> <b>galaxies,</b> <b>of</b> clusters <b>of</b> <b>galaxies,</b> even <b>of</b> superclusters (e. g., Groth and Peebles 1977; Davies and Peebles 1983; Kalinkov and Kuneva 1985, 1986; Bahcall 1988 and references therein) but not so many on pairs and groups <b>of</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Results <b>of</b> the calculations of two-point correlation fuctions for some catalogs of pairs and groups <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> are given. It is assumed that the distances to pairs and groups <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> are given by their mean redshifts according to R = sigma (sup n, sub i- 1) V sub i/nH (sub 0), where n is the number <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{in the system and}} H sub 0 = 100 km s(exp - 1) Mpc(exp - 1) ...|$|R
50|$|NGC 7793 is one <b>of</b> the {{brightest}} <b>galaxies</b> within the Sculptor Group, a group <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{in the constellation}} of the same name.

5|$|Other {{political}} stations {{include the}} likes <b>of</b> <b>Galaxy</b> FM, {{founded in the}} early 1980s and gaining a strong audience by the late 80's after becoming consistent reliable station broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings. Galaxy FM did attempt to broadcast 24 hours on the FM briefly and did advertise for a short time, before returning to broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings after 1992 with no profit making adverts. It was not until June 2012 Galaxy FM attempted to broadcast 24 hours {{a day on the}} FM again and deliberately continued to not use profit making advertisements to maintain the station. However, in late September/early October 2012 due to constant attacks from the authorities the station {{decided to go back to}} its original schedule, this time with an additional day and a half of broadcasting per week; broadcasting on the FM from Thursday afternoons until Monday afternoons. Galaxy FM encourages the black population to liberate themselves through empowerment and self-reliance.|$|E
5|$|As Syzygy and Nutting {{prepared}} for the MOA show, Bushnell learned that another pair of engineers were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar. In August 1971 Bushnell called Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, operating as Mini-Computer Applications, {{so that they could}} meet and discuss their solutions to the problem of running Spacewar on an inexpensive computer. Pitts and Tuck were developing a prototype machine <b>of</b> <b>Galaxy</b> Game when they met with Bushnell; the game, however, while a faithful recreation of Spacewar, ran on an externally-connected DEC PDP-11 with a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display, and the total cost of the prototype unit was US$20,000. The Syzygy duo were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that Galaxy Game was not using an innovative solution Syzygy had missed to build an economically-competitive arcade game. Pitts and Tuck, conversely, felt that Computer Space was a pale imitation of Spacewar, while Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. They eventually produced two game prototypes, both displayed in the Stanford student union building, but never produced the game commercially due to the high cost of the cabinet.|$|E

25|$|Historically, lensing {{analyses}} were conducted on galaxy clusters detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). The sample <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> clusters studied with lensing was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, only the most luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of California at Davis and collaborators published the first sample <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> clusters detected via their lensing signals, completely independent of their baryon content. Clusters discovered through lensing are subject to mass selection effects because the more massive clusters produce lensing signals with higher signal-to-noise.|$|E

25|$|During the 1970s, {{there was}} a major puzzle in that the density of baryons as {{calculated}} by Big Bang nucleosynthesis was much less than the observed mass of the universe based on measurements <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> rotation curves and galaxy cluster dynamics.

50|$|Galactic {{clusters}} are gravitationally bound large-scale structures <b>of</b> multiple <b>galaxies.</b> The evolution <b>of</b> these aggregates {{is determined}} by time and manner of formation {{and the process of}} how their structures and constituents have been changing with time. Gamow (1952) and Weizscker (1951) showed that the observed rotations <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> are important for cosmology. They postulated that the rotation <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> might be a clue of physical conditions under which these systems formed.
