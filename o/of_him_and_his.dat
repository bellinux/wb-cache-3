5|$|Denning's {{oldest brother}} Jack was killed near Gueudecourt in 1916. His brother Gordon, who saw {{action in the}} Battle of Jutland, died of {{tuberculosis}} contracted during his Navy service. Denning would describe his dead brothers as the best <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> siblings.|$|E
5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Fauxlivia and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) investigate {{reports of a}} Fringe event in the Rosencrantz building, and speak with Derek, who tells them he has not noticed {{anything out of the}} ordinary. The two leave, and Derek is left paging sadly through a photo album filled with pictures <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> late wife and their daughters.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, the New York Zoological Society held {{a celebration}} {{to commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Beebe's work for them. He was by this point the only {{remaining}} member of the zoo's original staff, and had produced more scholarly papers and publicity than any other employee. Letters and testimonials poured in from other scientists with whom Beebe had worked, attesting to their admiration <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> influence on them. One letter from the Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote that Beebe's work had been an inspiration to his own, particularly A Monograph of the Pheasants and Beebe's books about jungle wildlife.|$|E

5|$|Kalyani {{is nearly}} molested by a {{vagabond}} named Venu, but is saved by Gunasekaran. She later leaves Madurai and arrives at Tiruchi, where she obtains {{work as a}} maid of blackmarketeer Narayana Pillai, who also tries to molest her. She is, however, saved by his wife, and leaves the job. While searching for his sister, Gunasekaran reaches Tiruchi and comes across Vimala, a wealthy woman, to whom he explains the miserable status <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> sister in the society. After resting in her house for a while, he silently leaves to continue searching for Kalyani.|$|E
5|$|The video focuses {{solely on}} lead singer, Jason Wade, {{as the rest}} of the band members do not appear in the video. The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the bed with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E
5|$|After {{consulting}} with his family, Tiberius made his wishes known whereupon the Senate collected the honors into a commemorative decree, the Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris, {{and ordered the}} consuls of AD 20 to issue a public law honoring the death of Germanicus, the Lex Valeria Aurelia. Although Tacitus stressed the honors paid to him, the funeral and processions were carefully modeled after those of Gaius and Lucius, Agrippa's sons. This served to emphasize {{the continuation of the}} domus Augusta across the transition from Augustus to Tiberius. Commemorative arches were built in his honor and not just at Rome, but at the frontier on the Rhine and in Asia where he had governed in life. The arch of the Rhine was placed alongside of that of his father, where the soldiers had built a funerary monument honoring him. Portraits <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> natural father were placed in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine in Rome.|$|E

5|$|Hare was {{released}} on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which {{took him to the}} town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown at the door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> eventual fate is unknown.|$|E

60|$|Over {{his cigar}} Dartie peered round at Bosinney, {{who was sitting}} with his arms crossed, staring {{straight}} in front <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> on <b>his</b> face {{the look of a}} man being tortured.|$|R
60|$|Arnold Jackson stood {{staring in}} front <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> in <b>his</b> eyes was a dreamy softness. His thin, {{thoughtful}} face was very grave. Bateman, glancing at it, was once {{more conscious of}} its intense spirituality.|$|R
25|$|Arina Vlasevna Bazarova – Bazarov’s mother. A very {{traditional}} {{woman of the}} 15th-century Moscovy style aristocracy: a pious follower of Orthodox Christianity, woven with folk tales and falsehoods. She loves her son deeply, but is also terrified <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> rejection of all beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the street}} names of the town were named by the first {{managing}} director of N.Z. Forest Products Ltd.(builders of the Kinleith mill), Sir David Henry (1888–1963), after places near his hometown of Edinburgh, in Scotland. David Henry Primary School is a key example <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> namesaking.|$|E
25|$|Knowles's parents {{separated}} in 1983 and divorced March 12, 1984; his mother received custody <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> younger sister Dannie.

Knowles's other activities included the Boy Scouts of America and he attained the rank of Eagle Scout.|$|E

25|$|With Rowand {{having made}} Edmonton his home, the fort became an {{important}} centre in the west. It was a necessity for any traveller going any further west of Edmonton to go through there for provisions first. Rowand constructed a three-storey house {{in the heart of}} the fort for the exclusive use <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family, denoting his station to his subordinates, visitors and trade partners alike.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his career}} in Irish politics, O'Connell was able to gain a large {{following}} among the Irish masses in support <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> Catholic Association. O'Connell's main strategy was one of political reformism, working within the parliamentary structures of the British state in Ireland and forming an alliance of convenience with the Whigs. More radical elements broke with O'Connell to found the Young Ireland movement.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{nothing else}} is known <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> rule except that in 1248, {{he was with}} the Nicaean army campaigning against the Latin Empire near Nicomedia, when the Genoese {{suddenly}} seized Rhodes. A Nicaean expedition, under the pinkernes John Kantakouzenos, recovered the island in a campaign that probably lasted until 1250. After 1250, Gabalas family rule over Rhodes was terminated formally as well as de facto, and the island became a Nicaean province.|$|E

25|$|Hoste {{continued}} {{in command of}} the Mutine for the next three years, campaigning in Italy under Nelson, where in the autumn of 1799, he took part in the capture of Rome. He later served under Lord Keith, who knew little <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> career appeared to have stalled until, possibly at Nelson's prompting, he was promoted post-captain by Lord St Vincent, First Lord of the Admiralty, in January 1802.|$|E
25|$|Francia imbued Paraguay with a {{tradition}} of autocratic rule that lasted, {{with only a few}} breaks, until 1989. He is still considered a national hero, with a museum dedicated to his memory in Yaguarón. It contains portraits <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> daughter as well as his sweets box, candlestick and tobacco case. Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos wrote an ambivalent depiction of the life of Francia, a novel entitled Yo el Supremo (I, the Supreme).|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} his {{political}} career, Peckford became increasingly unpopular. The provincial economy continued to struggle throughout his premiership, unemployment remained high and revenues were low. A global recession hurt the province's resource sector and the fishery was the brink of collapse. Peckford's promise of rural development only led to make-work projects and federally administered employment insurance programs. While he had hoped the Sprung Greenhouse would help diversify the economy it only hurt the credibility and popularity <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> party. On 21 January 1989, Peckford announced his retirement from politics.|$|E
60|$|It is a feat {{beyond me}} {{to realize that}} he is sixty-nine years old. And when I look at the {{tremendous}} build <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> at <b>his</b> fearful, man-handling hands, I conjure up a vision <b>of</b> <b>him</b> avenging Captain Somers's murder.|$|R
