30|$|Materials {{and methods}} This observational, {{cross-sectional}} study concerned French soldiers of two theaters of <b>operations</b> in Africa (<b>SANGARIS</b> in Central African Republic and BARKHANE in Malia), between October 2015 and April 2016. The performance for {{application of the}} tactical tourniquet SOFFT® was evaluated during simulation sessions and included the time for application and its effectiveness, demonstrated by {{the elimination of the}} popliteal pulse Doppler signal. A performance score included both an application time shorter than 60  s and the interruption of the Doppler signal. Personality traits were assessed using validated questionnaires: the Self-Esteem Scale of Rosenberg (SES), the HEXACO personality inventory for empathy (HEXACO), the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and the Büssing Altruism Scale (BAS).|$|R

50|$|After he {{was sworn}} into office, France {{confirmed}} {{that it will}} end its military intervention in Central African Republic. France had around 2,500 troops deployed in the country as part of <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris,</b> supporting about 10,000 United Nations peacekeepers. Without France's support, Touadéra now faces the immediate challenge of maintaining security in major cities.|$|E
50|$|Hollande {{launched}} <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris</b> in December 2013 after {{international aid}} was requested by President Francois Boziz following advance by Séléka, a rebel {{group that had}} been able to capture parts of the capital. In October 2013, the Central African Republic's state lost the ability to maintain order and the United Nations began to voice concerns of potential genocide.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, the Anders Kompass scandal broke at the UN. An {{internal}} UN report, entitled 'Sexual Abuse of Children by International Armed Forces', detailed {{allegations of}} sexual abuse by French soldiers serving with the peacekeeping <b>operation</b> <b>Sangaris.</b> Senior UN aid worker Anders Kompass, who knew the UN would not act on the report, leaked the internal report to French authorities, who reportedly thanked him.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, General Francisco Soriano, leader of <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris,</b> {{stated that the}} {{swiftness}} of the French deployment was [...] "a real performance, that few other armies could match", and that the operation had managed to [...] "prevent the outburst of violence that was foretold in the capital, where our efforts were focused (...) It is clear that we prevented a number of massacres." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2012 the Central African Republic was {{embroiled in}} {{internal}} conflict, {{resulting in the}} ousting of the Christian president Francois Bozize in March 2013. Michel Djotodia, the leader of Muslim Séléka rebels, assumed the presidency but was himself forced to resign in January 2014. According to the UN Refugee Agency, 37,000 people have escaped to neighboring countries, while 173,000 have been internally displaced. In December 2013, peacekeeping missions <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris</b> by France and MISCA by the African Union were mounted.|$|E
50|$|On 14 May CAR's PM Nicolas Tiangaye {{requested}} a UN peacekeeping force from the UN Security Council and on 31 May former President Bozizé was indicted for {{crimes against humanity}} and incitement of genocide. On {{the same day as}} the December 5th attacks, the UN Security Council authorized the transfer of MICOPAX to the African Union led peacekeeping mission the International Support Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA or AFISM-CAR) with troop numbers increasing from 2,000 to 6,000 {{as well as for the}} French peacekeeping mission called <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris.</b>|$|E
5000|$|General Villiers was {{nominated}} on February 15, 2014 as Chief {{of the general}} staff headquarters of the Armies (chef d'état-major des armées) succeeding Admiral Édouard Guillaud. Charged with attacks against the Islamic State after the November 2015 Paris attacks, he judged that the necessary military attacks against this entity can only but guarantee peace and security, by recalling the comfort means of the French Armed Forces. [...] He coordinated the exterior operations of Operation Barkhane in Sahel, <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris</b> in Central African Republic and Opération Chammal in Syria and in Iraq. He was also equally {{in charge of the}} interior natured anti-terrorist operation, Opération Sentinelle.|$|E
50|$|In February 2016, after a {{peaceful}} election, the former Prime Minister Faustin-Archange Touadéra was elected president. In October 2016, France {{announced that it}} was ending its peacekeeping mission in the country, <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris</b> and largely withdrew its troops, saying that the operation was a success. Since 2014, there was little government control outside of the capital, Bangui. Armed entrepreneurs have carved out personal fiefdoms in which they set up checkpoints, collect illegal taxes, and take in millions of dollars from the illicit coffee, mineral, and timber trades. By 2017, more than 14 armed groups vied for territory, notably four factions formed by Ex-seleka leaders who control about 60% of the country's territory.|$|E
5000|$|Socialist François Hollande won {{election}} in 2012 as president. He adopted a generally hawkish foreign-policy, in close collaboration with Germany {{in regard to}} opposing Russian moves against Ukraine, and in sending the military to fight radical Islamists in Africa. He takes a hard line {{with regard to the}} Greek debt crisis. François Hollande launched two military operations in Africa: Operation Serval in Mali (the French armed forces stopped an Islamist takeover of Bamako, the nation's capital city); and <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris</b> (to restore peace there as tensions between different religious communities had turned into a violent conflict). France was also the first European nation to join the United States in bombing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Under President Hollande, France's stances on the civil war in Syria and Iran's nuclear program has been described as [...] "hawkish".|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on 29 January, Peter Bouckaert, talking for Human Rights Watch, stated that the French had badly anticipated Anti-Balaka actions: The French though they could limit themselves to disarm the former rebels in a mission that seemed simple in the beginning and promised to quick success. But nothing unfolded as foreseen and <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris</b> is now confronted to a bloodbath in the country. Faced with this new reality, the French military seems tetanised. When we notified them that Muslims would be massacred in the PK13 neighbourhood in Bangui, they replied {{that they did not}} wish {{to take part in the}} conflict! But preventing a massacre is not taking sides. Actually, it is the African forces of the MISCA that are taking most of the initiatives, but most of the risk as well. In particular, Rwandan, Burundi and Congolese troops, who managed to save people with lots of courage, while French troops often do not leave their armoured vehicles and seldom venture out of the main axis to see what is happenning in popular neighbourhoods.|$|E
50|$|For {{the next}} 19 years, France would {{intervene}} in Central African politics by supporting and removing Central African Presidents. In 1997, Central African President Ange-Félix Patassé negotiated the Bangui Agreements {{to bring an}} end to the 1990s conflict between government and rebel forces. As a result of the agreements, France closed its military base in Bouar in 1998.In March 2009, French troops were deployed to Bangui after reports that rebels were taking over the capital to remove President François Bozizé from power. In 2012, civil war erupted in the Central African Republic when mostly Muslim rebels known as Séléka removed President Bozizé from power in 2013, and installed Michel Djotodia as President. After the removal of Bozizé, a mainly Christian rebel group known as Anti-balaka rebelled against the government and Muslim nationals in the country. Séléka and government forces fought against Anti-balaka and targeted Christian nationals in the country. As a result of the religious and ethnic conflict in CAR, France returned to CAR to stop the bloodshed by deploying 1,000 troops and armored vehicles into the country to maintain peace known as <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris.</b> French President François Hollande visited French troops in CAR in December 2013. The troops remained in CAR until 2016. President Hollande returned to CAR in May 2016 to oversee the removal of French troops from the country which concluded in October 2016 and met with newly-elected President Faustin-Archange Touadéra.|$|E
50|$|In the Central African Republic Bush War, the {{government}} of President François Bozizé fought with rebels until a peace agreement in 2007. The current conflict arose when a new coalition of varied rebel groups, known as , accused {{the government}} of failing {{to abide by the}} peace agreements and captured many towns at the end of 2012. The capital was seized by the rebels in March 2013 and Bozizé fled the country, and the rebel leader Michel Djotodia declared himself president. Renewed fighting began between Séléka and militias called anti-balaka. In September 2013, President Djotodia disbanded the Seleka coalition which had lost its unity after taking power and in January 2014, Djotodia resigned and was replaced by Catherine Samba-Panza, but the conflict continued. In July 2014, Exséléka factions and anti-balaka representatives signed a ceasefire agreement in Brazzaville. By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned with the anti-Balaka in the south and west, with most of its Muslims evacuated, and ex-Seleka in the north and east. By 2015, there was little government control outside of the capital, Bangui. The dissolution of Seleka led to ex-Seleka fighters forming new militia that often fight each other. A rebel leader Noureddine Adam declared the autonomous Republic of Logone on 14 December 2015. Peacekeeping largely transitioned from the ECCAS led MICOPAX to the AU led MISCA to the UN led MINUSCA while the French peacekeeping mission was known as <b>Operation</b> <b>Sangaris.</b>|$|E
