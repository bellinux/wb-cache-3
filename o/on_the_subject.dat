5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan).

Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|E
