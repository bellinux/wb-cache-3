5|$|Two {{centuries before}} Mau and the Hōkūle‘a, Captain James Cook, {{with the help}} of Tupaia, gained {{knowledge}} that <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> closely held. Before his death in 1779, Cook hypothesized that Polynesians shared common ancestry; he even pinned their origin to Asia. However, Cook's theory did not prevent debate among scholars. Before the Hōkūle‘a voyage in 1976, academic debate about the settlement of Polynesia was divided between several schools of thought.|$|E
5|$|De Materia Medica is {{the prime}} {{historical}} {{source of information about}} the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian names for some plants, which <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources. Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1945, MacArthur {{was ordered}} to {{exercise}} authority through the Japanese government machinery, including the Emperor Hirohito. MacArthur's headquarters was located in the Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under their ultimate control. Unlike Germany, {{there was a certain}} partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and the {{most of the rest of}} the Japanese elite. The Emperor was a living god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found that ruling via the Emperor made his job in running Japan much easier than it <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b>|$|E

5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of the Earl of Gloucester's death at the Battle of Bannockburn is the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi. This account is written as a moral tale, expounding on the earl's heroism and the cowardly conduct of his companions. For this reason, its historical accuracy must be taken with some caution. According to some accounts, Gloucester rushed headfirst into battle {{in the pursuit of}} glory, and fell victim to his own foolishness. The Vita, on the other hand, claimed that, as the earl was vigorously trying to fend off the Scottish attacks, he was knocked off his horse, and killed when his own men failed to come to his rescue. It is also likely that the quarrels between Gloucester and Hereford over precedence could have contributed to the chaotic situation. According to one account, Gloucester rushed into battle without a distinguishing coat of arms, exposing himself to the Scottish soldiers, who <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> eager to secure a valuable ransom.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 24, 1911. The film had mixed reviews from critics. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer was thorough {{in the analysis of}} the film who did not like the production for its poor rehashed story and maudlin melodrama. The characters behavior was not logical and the series of events relied on deus ex machina elements, such as the Salvation Army suddenly decides to march down to the water's edge, then stop and remain in the background so that they can save his soul at the opportune moment. The reviewer did state that the acting was good. The Billboard review agreed that the story was implausible, but agreed that the skill of the actors made it more plausible than it <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> The Morning Telegraph and Walton of The Moving Picture News would praise the film for its pathos and heart. The film is presumed lost because the film is not known to be held in any archive or by any collector.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, when a {{group of}} colonels staged a coup d'état against the government, in order to {{increase}} desperately needed revenues, the junta offered lavish incentives for Greek shipowners to bring their companies back to Piraeus.

25|$|From 1949 {{until the}} late 1970s, the state fixed China's {{exchange}} rate at a highly overvalued level {{as part of the}} country's import -substitution strategy. During this time frame, the focus of the state's central planning was to accelerate industrial development and reduce China's dependence on imported manufactured goods. The overvaluation allowed the government to provide imported machinery and equipment to priority industries at a relatively lower domestic currency cost than <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> possible.|$|E

25|$|In the Clinic sample, 48% of the 29 alcoholics who {{achieved}} sobriety eventually attended 300 or more AA meetings, and AA {{attendance was}} associated with good outcomes in patients who <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> predicted not to remit. In the Core City sample the more severe alcoholics attended AA, possibly because all other avenues had failed—after all, AA meetings are rarely attended for hedonistic reasons.

25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal policy can {{be limited by}} {{crowding}} out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{from the}} status-class term Intelligentsia, sociologists derived the term mass intelligentsia to {{describe}} the populations of educated adults, with discretionary income, who pursue intellectual interests by way of book clubs and cultural associations, etc. That sociological term was made popular usage by the writer Melvyn Bragg, who said that mass intelligentsia conceptually explains the popularity of book clubs and literary festivals that <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> of limited intellectual interests to most people from {{the middle class and}} from the working class.|$|E
25|$|For {{agricultural}} purposes the Chinese {{had invented}} the hydraulic-powered trip hammer by the 1st century BC, during the ancient Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD). Although it found other purposes, its main function was to pound, decorticate, and polish grain that <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done manually. The Chinese also innovated the square-pallet chain pump by the 1st century AD, {{powered by a}} waterwheel or an oxen pulling on a system of mechanical wheels. Although the chain pump found use in public works of providing water for urban and palatial pipe systems, it was used largely to lift water from a lower to higher elevation in filling irrigation canals and channels for farmland.|$|E

From the academic year 2005/2006 onwards, access rules have enforced minimum grades of 95 (out of 200) in the national access examinations for all candidates in every sector of public higher education. In practical terms, and unlike what happened in the past, the new rule meant the exclusion {{of a large number of}} applicants who <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> admitted with negative grades to the less selective courses of some public institutions, and consequently lead to a number of available places for students left vacant every year in many courses.|$|E
25|$|The top {{two teams}} in the EFL Championship and in EFL League One are {{automatically}} promoted to the division above and thus do not compete in the play-offs. The top three teams in EFL League Two and the champion of the National League (formerly known as Conference Premier) are also automatically promoted. In each of these divisions the four clubs finishing below the automatic promotion places compete in two-legged semi-finals with the higher-placed club enjoying home advantage in the second leg. The away goals rule does not apply for the semi-finals, {{which has led to}} some games swinging the way of a team that <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> beaten by the rule. The Football League play-off finals were originally played in two legs, at both teams' home grounds, but were later changed to one-off affairs, which are played at Wembley Stadium in London.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} moored in Gatun Lake, between the Gatun Locks and the Chagris dam spillway. Beginning in October 1968 the 10 MW {{electrical}} power {{produced by the}} MH-1A plant aboard the Sturgis allowed it to replace the power from the Gatun Hydroelectric Station, which freed the lake water for navigation use. To help out further, the Andrew J. Weber, a diesel-fueled power barge of 20MW capacity, was deployed to the Canal Zone in November 1968. These two barges not only contributed to meeting the Canal Zone’s power requirements, but also made possible the saving of vast quantities of water that <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> needed to operate the hydroelectric power station. The Corps of Engineers estimates that over one trillion gallons were saved (or, rather, freed up) between October 1968 and October 1972– enough to permit fifteen additional ships {{to pass through the}} locks of the canal each day.|$|E
