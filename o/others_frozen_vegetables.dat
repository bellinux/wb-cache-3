40|$|Graduation date: 1992 This study {{examines}} {{the link between}} policy-induced changes in the relative prices of Mexican and U. S. <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> and their shares of the U. S. market. Several scenarios were examined {{in order to assess}} the impacts on quantities demanded of both U. S. and Mexican produced <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> caused by changes in their relative prices. An econometric model incorporating a two-stage budgeting process based on Armington's model of demand for commodities differentiated by kind and origin was used to estimate the U. S. demand for <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables.</b> This was accomplished by first deriving an overall, or total U. S. demand relationship for <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> and then estimating the U. S. demand relationships for <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> by country of origin (U. S. and Mexico). The relative price elasticities estimated by the model were used to investigate how changes in the relative prices of <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> by country affect the composition of demand for <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> in the U. S. The scenarios examined relative price changes resulting from different economic and political developments. These included such things as reductions in U. S. tariff rates brought about by further trade liberalization (such as the proposed North American Free- Trade Agreement), changes in the minimum wage rate in both countries, and increased technology transfer from the U. S. to Mexico. Applying the estimated model parameters to these scenarios suggested that relative price changes in <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> from, say Mexico, not only affected the price and quantity demanded by U. S. consumers of Mexican <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables,</b> but it also affected the price and quantity demanded of U. S. produced <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> by U. S. consumers. Demand for <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> produced in Mexico was estimated to be relative price inelastic at - 0. 6375, while demand for <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> produced in the U. S. was relative price elastic with a value of - 1. 3445. According to the model projections, price changes in <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> produced in either country tend to have a greater effect proportionately on the quantity demanded of <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> produced in Mexico. This can be attributed to Mexico's relatively small share of the <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetable</b> market in comparison to the United States. The effect of a relative price change caused by a free-trade agreement, which lowers the price of Mexican <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> through tariff removal, would increase Mexico's market share and decrease the United States' market share in the U. S. <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetable</b> market. But when one looks at the quantities of <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> implied by these market share changes one discovers that they are relatively small compared to the total volume of <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> in the market...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Dietetics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Vegetables {{and fruit}} appear to confer {{protection}} against various diseases, but most adults in South Africa eat substantially {{less than the}} recommended amounts. Many barriers and factors that influence vegetable consumption {{have been identified in}} the literature. One major barrier is the perishability of <b>vegetables.</b> <b>Frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> can be a useful way in encouraging greater intakes. Some consumers are, however, of the opinion that processing destroy nutrients to a large extent. There is, therefore, a lack of understanding of the freezing process. Research on the attitudes of consumers towards <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> in South Africa is limited. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the attitudes of consumers regarding the link between <b>frozen</b> and fresh <b>vegetables</b> and health and the attributes of <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Subjects/Setting: One thousand nine hundred and ninety seven South African respondents, representative of the four major race groups of South Africa (whites, blacks, coloureds and Indians) were randomly chosen from metropolitan areas from the nine provinces in South Africa. Questionnaires, existing of 17 food-related sections, including subsections on vegetables and health, were designed by researchers in co-operation with business partners. MARKINOR, a market research company, was contracted to collect the data. Respondents were questioned regarding their attitudes towards the link between <b>frozen</b> and fresh <b>vegetables</b> and health. Statistical analysis performed: The quantitative data produced by the survey was analysed by using the StatisticaⓇ-programme in order to generate the relevant tabulations, descriptive statistics and statistical tests. Results: Overall, the attitudes of consumers towards <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> were found to be negative. Practical and statistically significant attitude differences towards <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> were found between most variables. Results from this study revealed that different levels of education, age and gender do not have a big influence on consumer's attitudes towards <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables.</b> However, practical and statistically significant differences were found between the various LSM (Living Standards Measure) groups, especially with regard to the convenience of <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Results also indicated that Indians, the age group 61 + and males were the most negative towards <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Almost 75 % of all consumers indicated that they never eat <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Only 1 % of consumers in the LSM group 2 own a fridge/freezer. An alarmingly 26 % of all consumers indicated that they are not convinced that vegetables are healthy. Application/Conclusions: Nutrition professionals should use these findings to target messages in health-promotion programmes to increase the overall consumption of vegetables. The use of <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> by consumers with frozen storage facilities should be promoted aggressively. Consumers also need practical advice on how to overcome the barriers to dietary change. Nutrition counseling efforts should also be aimed specifically at increasing <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption among targeted subgroups, particularly Indians, males and the age group 61 +. It is strongly recommended that suitable measuring instruments be developed for assessing the knowledge and attitude of South Africans towards vegetable and fruit consumption and the ability of individuals to improve their health. The results of this study may prove to be very useful in this regard. Master...|$|R

40|$|Dietary {{antioxidants}} (AO) {{are believed}} {{to contribute to the}} overall health benefits seen from fruit and vegetables. Despite increased public awareness of the health benefits of fruit and vegetables through campaigns such as 5 A DAY, consumption remains low. Freezing is usually regarded as destructive to AO and ascorbic acid (AA) and this has fostered a belief that fresh vegetables are nutritionally superior to frozen. In this study, AO and AA activity in commercially bought fresh and <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> were investigated and compared after a typical home cooking practice (boiling). Five different vegetables were examined: carrots, broccoli, green beans, peas and spinach. Each vegetable was bought four times from a selection of local supermarkets and green grocers in the Wirral, United Kingdom to account for variation. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay and 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) assay were utilised to measure total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and AA content respectively. The results showed both fresh and <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> to contain AO and AA after cooking. Cooked fresh spinach and peas contained significantly (p<. 05) higher levels of total AO than cooked frozen spinach and peas. However the remaining fresh and <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> (broccoli, carrots and green beans) did not appear to differ in AO content after cooking. Furthermore {{there was no difference between}} AA content in fresh and <b>frozen</b> cooked <b>vegetables.</b> The current study provides evidence against the misconception that fresh is always nutritionally superior to frozen at the point of consumption. <b>Frozen</b> <b>vegetable</b> promotion may be the way forward to increase fruit and vegetable consumption as they are generally nutritionally comparable to fresh but, cheaper, result in less waste, are more convenient and, if packaged correctly, taste the same as fresh. Further work, on a larger scale, is needed, to measure AO and AA content of fresh and <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> bought and cooked by the consumer...|$|R
