5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{recollections}} {{throw some}} light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel {{was in love with}} Misia Edwards, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.|$|E
25|$|Hilke Kuhlmann's Living Walden Two {{possesses}} many {{subtle and}} not-so-subtle {{criticisms of the}} original Walden Two which {{are related to the}} actual efforts that arose from the novel. One criticism {{is that many of the}} founders of real-life Walden Twos identified with, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> emulate, Frazier, the uncharismatic and implicitly despotic founder of the community.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Virgin Digital was {{launched}} to cater {{for those that}} bought their music digitally <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> rip and burn their current music collection. This is designed {{to add to the}} services provided by Virgin, rather than replace the Megastores. The download service faced some criticism from consumer groups due to its incompatibility with the popular iPod music player. The service has since been discontinued. Around the world there were other Virgin branded digital music retail websites, such as VirginMega.fr, France's number 2 music download website.|$|E

25|$|The {{islands are}} home to a notable {{independence}} movement that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of World War II, some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946 an independence referendum was held {{on the question of}} secession. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This {{was the first time that}} the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> continue within the Danish kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{social and}} linguistical {{situation}} {{that made the}} pre-Slavic population is hard to reconstruct, especially if is accepted {{the theory that the}} autochthonous population was dominant at the time of arrival of the Slavs yet accepted the language and culture of Slavic newcomers who were in the minority. This scenario can only be explained with the possible distortion of cultural and ethnic identity of native Romanized population that happened after the fall of West Roman Empire, and that the new Slavic language and culture was seen as a prestigious idiom they had to, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> accept.|$|E
25|$|Derace Kingsley, {{a wealthy}} businessman, hires Marlowe {{to find his}} estranged wife, Crystal. Although {{separated}} from his wife, Kingsley fears that Crystal— rich, pretty, spoiled and reckless—may have become involved in a scandal that could jeopardise his position with the shareholders of the company {{of which he is}} an executive. The last definite place Crystal was known to have been was their vacation cabin on Little Fawn Lake. Kingsley had received a telegram from Crystal about two weeks before (dateline El Paso, Texas) stating that she was divorcing him and marrying her gigolo boyfriend, Chris Lavery. But when Kingsley ran into Lavery in L.A. and asked him where Crystal was, Lavery told him that he hadn't seen her, wasn't with her in El Paso, didn't know where she was, and never agreed, <b>or</b> <b>wanted,</b> <b>to</b> marry her.|$|E
5000|$|Asteya in practice, states Patricia Corner, implies to [...] "not steal", [...] "not cheat" [...] nor unethically {{manipulate}} other's {{property or}} others for one's own gain. Asteya as virtue demands {{that not only}} one [...] "not steal" [...] through one's action, one shouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> encourage cheating through speech <b>or</b> writing, <b>or</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> cheat even in one's thinking. Smith states that the virtue of asteya arises out of the understanding that all misappropriation {{is an expression of}} craving and a feeling of lack of compassion for other beings. <b>To</b> steal <b>or</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> steal expresses lack of faith in oneself, one's ability to learn and create property. To steal another's property is also stealing from one's own potential ability to develop. The Sutras reason that misappropriation, conspiring <b>to</b> misappropriate <b>or</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> misappropriate, at its root reflects the sin of lobha (bad greed), moha (material delusion) or krodha (bad anger).|$|R

500|$|Some {{critics and}} biographers have opined {{along the lines}} of Andrew Gibson: [...] "The modern James Joyce may have vigorously {{resisted}} the oppressive power of Catholic tradition. But there was another Joyce who asserted his allegiance to that tradition, and never left it, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> leave it, behind him." [...] Gibson argues that Joyce [...] "remained a Catholic intellectual if not a believer" [...] since his thinking remained influenced by his cultural background, even though he lived apart from that culture. His relationship with religion was complex and not easily understood, even perhaps by himself. He acknowledged the debt he owed to his early Jesuit training. Joyce told the sculptor August Suter, that from his Jesuit education, he had 'learnt to arrange things {{in such a way that}} they become easy to survey and to judge.' ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, Morrissey {{appeared}} as corrupt police detective Maurice Jobson in Red Riding, the Channel 4 adaptation of David Peace's Red Riding novels. Morrissey {{already knew the}} directors of the films, enjoyed reading the script and had either worked with his co-stars on other projects, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work with them. He liked the flaws in the Jobson character and that he differs from typical vigilante police officers portrayed on television. Morrissey said of Jobson, [...] "I think he sets out to be a good cop, he tries to do his job well but he gets involved in some corruption and realises that being a 'bit' corrupt is like being a 'bit' pregnant. You either are or you're not." [...] He received a Best Actor nomination from the Broadcasting Press Guild for the role. At the end of the year, Morrissey played Bobby Dykins in the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy (2009). As a self-confessed [...] "Beatles geek", Morrissey relished the opportunity to star in the film about Lennon's childhood.|$|E

500|$|Whedon {{noted that}} the pod does not entirely {{take place in the}} Framework, and that the {{characters}} [...] "have their full memories of what happened" [...] once they return to the real world. Some, such as Fitz, struggle with their actions in the Framework. The producers felt the impact of the [...] "what if" [...] scenario comes from rooting the changes in character choices, with Bell saying, [...] "I will give the writers room credit that everything that was chosen had an emotional resonance. It was something you hadn’t seen, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see or wondered about, so for us it was really rich territory to mine." [...] Whedon added, [...] "It wasn’t just, 'OK, let’s go Wacky World!' It was, 'What if you’d made different decisions?' That made it for us a much more fun puzzle." [...] Regarding the season finale and setting up the next season, Bell said that [...] "Each year we’ve tried to reinvent the series in some way ... I think the end [...] really does suggest something quite different." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Shevhei ha-Besht {{explicitly}} {{mentions the}} existence of pre-Besht era Hasidic circle in Brody.

2500|$|Literary scholar Edward Said, {{who held}} it to exemplify a kind of {{thinking}} that hopes to [...] "cancel and transcend an actual reality—a group of resident Arabs—by means of a future wish – that the land be empty for development by a more deserving power". In his book The Question of Palestine, Said cites the phrase in this wording, [...] "A land without people for a people without a land". S. Ilan Troen and Jacob Lassner call Said's omission of the indefinite article 'a,' a [...] "distortion" [...] of the meaning and suggest that it was done [...] "perhaps malevolently" [...] {{for the purpose of}} making the phrase acquire the meaning that Said and others impute to it, that Zionists thought that the land was <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make it into a land [...] "without people". Steven Poole calls this omission of the indefinite article [...] "a subtle falsification". Historian Adam Garfinkle criticizes Said for attributing the phrase to Zangwill without giving a citation. Garfinkle's heavest criticism, however, is of Said for writing [...] "without people" [...] instead of [...] "without a people", which he says substantially changes the meaning.|$|E
2500|$|Joubert {{moved to}} Moseley, Birmingham, in 1962 {{to take up}} a Senior Lectureship at the University of Birmingham; he was later made Reader in Music. In 1979 he was a visiting {{professor}} at the University of Otago in New Zealand. The number and scope of his works increased, and among those composed during the following decades were two further full-length operas, Under Western Eyes (Op. 51, 1968) and Jane Eyre (Op. 134) (based on the novels by Joseph Conrad and Charlotte Brontë respectively), Symphony No. 2 (Op. 68, 1970), various large-scale choral works with orchestras including the oratorio The Raising of Lazarus (Op. 67, 1970) and Herefordshire Canticles (Op. 93, 1979), a second and third piano sonata (Op. 71, 1972; Op. 157), a second and third string quartet (Op. 91, 1977; Op. 112, 1986), song cycles with piano and/or instrumental ensembles, and accompanied and unaccompanied smaller-scale choral music. On the wide scope of his work, Joubert has commented: [...] "I've never really wanted to be pigeonholed as a composer. I've always wanted to write anything that I was either asked to, <b>or</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write. I've never wanted to specialise, although I have to a certain extent been pigeonholed already. I'd rather not be looked upon as sort of limited in that way." ...|$|E
