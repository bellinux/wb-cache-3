5|$|It {{will also}} have glass walls, which {{according}} to DITIB spokesman Alboga will give visitors a feeling of <b>openness.</b> According to the architect, <b>openness</b> is further enhanced by an inviting staircase from the street. The developers have required that the secular areas of the mosque (e.g. the restaurant, event halls and stores) be open to people of all religions.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was also}} Prime Minister of Romania for three {{mandates}} (1918, 1920–1921, 1926–1927), his political success is not as spectacular as the military one. Averescu ended up {{as one of the}} pawns maneuvered by Brătianu. Argetoianu later repeatedly expressed his distaste for Averescu's hesitant stance and <b>openness</b> to compromise.|$|E
5|$|Dubček’s {{relaxation}} of censorship {{ushered in a}} brief period of freedom of speech and the press. The first tangible manifestation of this new policy of <b>openness</b> was the production of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literarni noviny, renamed Literarni listy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{associated with}} the Churches of Christ embrace the methods of modern Biblical criticism but not the associated anti-supernaturalistic views. More generally, the classical grammatico-historical method is prevalent, which provides a basis for some <b>openness</b> to alternative approaches to understanding the scriptures.|$|E
5|$|This mode of {{transportation}} links national, international and global economies, making it vital to many other industries. Newer trends of liberalization of trade have fostered routes among nations bound by agreements. One such example, the American Open Skies policy, led to greater <b>openness</b> in many international markets, but some international restrictions have survived even during the present times.|$|E
5|$|Analyses {{has been}} {{published}} by currency strategists at RBS, scoring countries on their potential to undertake intervention, measuring their relative intention to weaken their currency and their capacity to do so. Ratings {{are based on the}} <b>openness</b> of a country's economy, export growth and real effective exchange rate (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E
5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert spaces are by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the <b>openness</b> and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Bednar has {{featured}} {{heavily in}} the Ex's public profile, and advocated for <b>openness</b> in communications. Food Building vendor Epic Burgers and Waffles' cronuts were tainted by Staphylococcus aureus toxin in 2013, a result of third party maple bacon jam. He advocated that the corporation discuss the issue directly and claimed doing so would increase the fair's credibility with the public.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Khrushchev {{opened a}} Central Committee meeting to {{hundreds}} of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, {{the proceedings of the}} Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This <b>openness,</b> however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.|$|E
5|$|In December 1887, {{on the eve}} of his {{departure}} to tour as a guest conductor through Western Europe, Tchaikovsky stopped in Saint Petersburg and consulted with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov on a detailed program of Russian music that he might lead in Paris. Though this opportunity did not arise, it shows his <b>openness</b> to promoting works by the Belyayev circle as his duty to promote Russian music.|$|E
5|$|In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, {{argues that}} the {{relative}} autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater <b>openness</b> when it faced {{the issues raised by}} The Da Vinci Code and other critics.|$|E
5|$|The scandalous trick and {{the frank}} {{language}} have {{for much of}} the play's history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick's cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl, now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and <b>openness</b> to different interpretations.|$|E
5|$|This is {{yet another}} example of a devoted fanbase and a policy of <b>openness</b> {{combining}} to fill in blanks left by old media barriers. The entire NIN camp is absolutely thrilled that treating our fans with respect and nurturing their creativity has led to such an overwhelming outpour of incredible content, and that we now have such a high quality souvenir from our most ambitious tour ever.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{urbanisation}} of Gateshead {{around it}} has detracted from the panoramic views of western Gateshead {{that were once}} enjoyed by residents, at elevated positions views of Lobley Hill, Team Valley and Dunston Hill can be glimpsed. Although now a suburb of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, the <b>openness</b> and greenspace prevalent in Low Fell means that the suburb continues to enjoy a rural feel, which is an unusual trait in the modern Gatshead conurbation.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or <b>openness,</b> which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This <b>openness</b> generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 2007, the Minister for Local Government {{announced}} a Section 740 inquiry into Port Macquarie-Hastings Council and the Glasshouse project, with particular regard to aspects of financial and project management, the project's {{impact on the}} Council to provide services and amenities to the community, and the <b>openness</b> and transparency of decisions made by the Council. He appointed Frank Willan, a former administrator of Glen Innes Severn Council in 2004, as Commissioner. The mayor expressed disappointment, asserted the methodology of the earlier Section 430 investigation was faulty, and believed the Council's management and decision-making processes would be vindicated.|$|E
5|$|The {{enclosed}} {{design of}} the Albert Dock and the direct loading and unloading of goods from warehouses meant that the complex was more secure than other docks within Liverpool. As a result it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. At the same time their <b>openness</b> to natural light and well ventilated stores meant natural goods such as hemp or sugar could be kept fresher, for longer. The dock came to dominate Liverpool's far eastern trade, with over 90% of the city's silk imports from China coming through it and more generally {{half of all the}} far eastern trade income.|$|E
25|$|While {{strongly}} advocating <b>openness</b> to migrants and refugees, Francis {{acknowledged that}} the right to migrate must be regulated, while refugees from war or other intolerable situations must be received with greater <b>openness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thus, in Rabelais and His World Bakhtin {{studies the}} {{interaction}} between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body. As written, Rabelais and His World not only examines the <b>openness</b> of Gargantua and Pantagruel, it also serves as an example of such <b>openness.</b>|$|E
25|$|As Mayor, Roxanne {{emphasized}} <b>openness</b> and accessibility, collaborative public-private partnerships, {{and community}} and economic development.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger {{understands the}} {{commencement}} {{of the history of}} Western philosophy as a brief period of authentic <b>openness</b> to being, {{during the time of the}} pre-Socratics, especially Anaximander, Heraclitus, and Parmenides. This was followed, according to Heidegger, by a long period increasingly dominated by the forgetting of this initial <b>openness,</b> a period which commences with Plato, and which occurs in different ways throughout Western history.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion and {{introversion}} – {{personality traits}} of degrees of <b>openness</b> or reserve contributing to psychological type.|$|E
25|$|The {{first signs}} of major reform came in 1986 when Gorbachev {{launched}} a policy of glasnost (<b>openness)</b> in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for perestroika (economic restructuring). Though glasnost advocated <b>openness</b> and political criticism, at the time, it was only permitted {{in accordance with the}} political views of the ruling powers. The general public in the Eastern bloc were still threatened by secret police and political repression.|$|E

25|$|The highly fertile {{soils and}} the <b>openness</b> {{of these areas}} confirm that the native Amazonians have been using these fields for agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Consumers' {{choices in}} music {{have been studied}} {{as they relate to}} the Big Five {{personality}} traits: <b>openness</b> to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness. In general, the plasticity traits (<b>openness</b> to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness). Gender has been shown to influence preference, with men choosing music for primarily cognitive reasons and women for emotional reasons. Relationships with music preference have also been found with mood and nostalgic association.|$|E
25|$|The <b>openness</b> {{principle}} {{ensures that}} individuals know about, and {{can participate in}} enforcing their rights under a data protection regime.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} {{examined}} {{whether there is a}} “religious personality.” Research suggests that people who identify as religious {{are more likely to be}} high on agreeableness and conscientiousness, and low on psychoticism, but unrelated to other Big Five traits. However, people endorsing fundamentalist religious beliefs are more likely to be low on <b>Openness.</b> Similarly, people who identify as spiritual are more likely to be high on Extroversion and <b>Openness,</b> although this varied based on the type of spirituality endorsed.|$|E
25|$|Many parodies target Wikipedia's <b>openness</b> and {{susceptibility}} to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.|$|E
25|$|Mindfulness: Adopting a {{particular}} orientation toward one's {{experiences in the}} present moment, an orientation that is characterised by curiosity, <b>openness,</b> and acceptance.|$|E
25|$|Transparency of {{information}} is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system {{has come under fire}} for lack of <b>openness,</b> new legislation may encourage greater <b>openness.</b> There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency {{on the one hand and}} such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation {{of information}} for commercial gain on the other.|$|E
25|$|The {{customer}} organization may adopt certain standards to, for example, ensure <b>openness</b> {{within the}} organization and towards external parties, maximizing interoperability between services/systems, etc.|$|E
25|$|Big Five {{personality}} traits, ("the five-factor model"). Many psychologists currently {{believe that}} five factors are sufficient: neuroticism, extraversion, <b>openness</b> to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.|$|E
