5|$|Andrew III <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> {{made his}} {{maternal}} uncle, Alberto Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in July 1299, stirring up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul Šubić, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II of Naples {{to send his}} grandson to Hungary to claim the throne in person. The king of Naples accepted the proposal and borrowed 1,300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles's journey. A Neapolitan knight of French origin, Philip Drugeth, accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles to Hungary. They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300. From Split, Paul Šubić escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Csák swore loyalty to Charles. Charles's opponent, AndrewIII <b>of</b> <b>Hungary,</b> died on 14January 1301. Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop-elect, Gregory Bicskei, crowned him with a provisional crown before 13May. However, most Hungarians considered Charles's coronation unlawful because customary law required {{that it should have}} been performed with the Holy Crown <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> in Székesfehérvár.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{was the son}} of Stephen the Posthumous, the self-styled Duke of Slavonia, and {{his second}} wife, Tomasina Morosini. Andrew's father was born to Beatrice D'Este, the third wife of Andrew II <b>of</b> <b>Hungary,</b> after the king's death. However, Andrew II's two elder sons, Béla IV <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> and Coloman of Halych, accused Beatrice D'Este of {{adultery}} and refused to acknowledge Stephen the Posthumous as their legitimate brother. Andrew's mother, Tomasina Morosini, was the daughter of wealthy Venetian patrician Michele Morosini.|$|E
5|$|As king, Matthias waged wars {{against the}} Czech mercenaries who {{dominated}} Upper Hungary (today parts of Slovakia and Northern Hungary) and against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia, terminating {{the zone of}} buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Hungary.</b> Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King <b>of</b> <b>Hungary.</b> The Emperor returned the Holy Crown <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.|$|E

5|$|As the Ottoman Empire did {{not force}} Muslim {{conversion}} on its conquered western territories, reformed ideas were quickly {{adopted in the}} two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> they occupied (the Habsburg-ruled third part <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> remained Catholic). A Reformed Constitutional Synod was held in 1567 in Debrecen, the main hub of Hungarian Calvinism, where the Second Helvetic Confession was adopted as the official confession of Hungarian Calvinists.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Middle Ages, two groups of buildings existed on the current site of the city: the wooden fortress at Cluj-Mănăștur (Kolozsmonostor) and the civilian settlement developed around the current Piața Muzeului (Museum Place) in the city centre. Although the precise date of the conquest of Transylvania by the Hungarians is not known, the earliest Hungarian artifacts found in the region are dated to {{the first half of the}} 10th century. In any case, after that time, the city became part of the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Hungary.</b> King Stephen I made the city the seat of the castle county of Kolozs, and King Saint Ladislaus I <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> founded the abbey of Cluj-Mănăștur (Kolozsmonostor), destroyed during the Tatar invasions in 1241 and 1285. As for the civilian colony, a castle and a village were built to the northwest of the ancient Napoca no later than the late 12th century. This new village was settled by large groups of Transylvanian Saxons, encouraged during the reign of Crown Prince Stephen, Duke of Transylvania. The first reliable mention of the settlement dates from 1275, in a document of King Ladislaus IV <b>of</b> <b>Hungary,</b> when the village (Villa Kulusvar) was granted to the Bishop of Transylvania. On 19 August 1316, during the rule of the new king, Charles I <b>of</b> <b>Hungary,</b> Cluj was granted the status of a city (Latin: civitas), as a reward for the Saxons' contribution to the defeat of the rebellious Transylvanian voivode, Ladislaus Kán.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{came to the}} Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> {{upon the}} {{invitation}} of an influential Croatian lord, Paul Šubić, in August 1300. AndrewIII died on 14January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown <b>of</b> <b>Hungary.</b> Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had no central government, the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch. One of those oligarchs, Ladislaus Kán, captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307. Charles was elected king in Pest on 27November 1308, but his rule remained nominal {{in most parts of}} his kingdom even after he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27August 1310.|$|E

5|$|Charles was {{the only}} son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno, and his wife, Clemence of Austria. He was born in 1288; the place of his birth is unknown. Charles Martel was the firstborn son of Charles II of Naples and Charles II's wife, Mary, who was a {{daughter}} of Stephen V <b>of</b> <b>Hungary.</b> After {{the death of her}} brother, Ladislaus IV <b>of</b> <b>Hungary,</b> in 1290, Queen Mary announced her claim to Hungary, stating that the House of Árpád (the royal family <b>of</b> <b>Hungary)</b> had become extinct with Ladislaus's death. However, her father's cousin, Andrew also laid claim to the throne, although his father, Stephen the Posthumous, had been regarded a bastard by all other members of the royal family. For all that, the Hungarian lords and prelates preferred Andrew against Mary and he was crowned king <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> on 23July 1290. She transferred her claim to Hungary to Charles Martel in January 1292. The Babonići, Frankopans, Šubići and other Croatian and Slavonian noble families seemingly acknowledged Charles Martel's claim, but in fact their loyalty vacillated between Charles Martel and AndrewIII.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Stephen II <b>of</b> <b>Hungary,</b> Ladislaus's shrine in the cathedral of Várad became a {{preferred}} venue for trials by ordeal. However, it cannot be determined whether Ladislaus became subject to veneration soon after his death, or if his cult emerged after he was canonized by Béla III <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> on 27 June 1192. Béla {{had lived in the}} Byzantine court, where Ladislaus's daughter, Irene, was venerated as a saint.|$|E
5|$|Following the Mongol {{invasion}} of 1241 and 1242, King Béla IV <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> exempted {{the inhabitants of}} Bilak (Mărişelu), Gyalu (Gilău), Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia), Harina (Herina), Tasnád (Tășnad) and Zilah (Zalău). King Charles I <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> granted immunity to the Saxon communities of Birthälm (Berethalom, Biertan), Kleinschelken (Kisselyk, Şeica Mică), and Mediasch (Medgyes, Mediaș) in 1315, but the same monarch annulled other communities' similar privileges in 1324. Altrodenau (Radna, Rodna) and Bistritz (Beszterce, Bistrița) received immunity in 1366.|$|E

5|$|Internal {{conflicts}} {{characterized the}} last decades of the 13th century in the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Hungary.</b> For instance, a feud between King Béla and his son, Stephen caused a civil war which lasted from 1261 to 1266. Taking advantage of the emerging anarchy, Voivode Litovoi attempted {{to get rid of}} the Hungarian monarchs' suzerainty in the 1270s, but he fell in a battle while fighting against royal troops. One of his successors, Basarab I of Wallachia was the first Romanian monarch whose sovereignty was internationally recognized after his victory over King Charles I <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> in the Battle of Posada of 1330.|$|E
5|$|It was Voivode Basarab I (c. 1310–1352) {{who broke}} {{off with the}} Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> and {{refused to accept the}} king's suzerainty. Basarab I {{received}} international support and the recognition of the autonomy of Wallachia due to his great military victory over King Charles I <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> (1301–1342) at Posada on November 12, 1330. The Metropolitan See of Wallachia, directly subordinated to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, was set up during the reign of Basarab I's son, Nicolae Alexandru (1352–1364). The first silver and bronze coins were minted in Wallachia in 1365.|$|E

She was the {{daughter}} of Louis the Great, King <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> and Poland, and his wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. Mary's marriage to Sigismund of Luxembourg, a member of the imperial Luxembourg dynasty, was already decided before her first birthday.

5|$|On 29 August 1526 {{the forces}} of the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> led by King Louis II were {{defeated}} at the Battle of Mohács by Ottoman forces led by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Louis died in the battle which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Hungary,</b> as he died without an heir. Both Hungary and Croatia became disputed territories with claims from both the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Ferdinand I from the House of Habsburg, brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, married the sister of Louis II and was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Otto, {{who was a}} {{grandson}} of BélaIV <b>of</b> <b>Hungary,</b> was crowned king, but only the Kőszegis and the Transylvanian Saxons regarded him as the lawful monarch.

He was crowned king with the Holy Crown <b>of</b> <b>Hungary</b> in Székesfehérvár by the Archbishop of Esztergom, as required by customary law, on August27, 1310. During the next decade, he launched a series of military campaigns against the oligarchs to restore royal authority.
