40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the advantages of using the dietary pattern approach in evaluating the role of diet in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) prevention and management and to report on the association between major dietary patterns and CVD risk factors among Lebanese adults. The significance of this type of research to primary care physicians is also highlighted. The dietary pattern approach overcomes the inconsistent findings of single nutrient analysis in evaluating diet-disease associations, takes into consideration the synergistic effects of nutrients, and provides culture specific recommendations. Using data from the national Nutrition and Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factor Survey, we appraised the association of dietary patterns with CVD risk factors among Lebanese adults. Two major dietary patterns were identified: Western pattern, characterized by high intake of fast food sandwiches, desserts, and carbonated beverages and the traditional Lebanese pattern, characterized by high intakes of fruits and vegetables, olives and olive <b>oil,</b> and traditional <b>dishes.</b> Only the Western pattern was associated with increased risk of obesity (abdominal obesity), hyperglycemia and the metabolic syndrome. These findings demonstrated the valuable results that can be obtained using the dietary patterns approach in evaluating the association between diet and CVD risk factors and provided evidence that this approach can be used as a tool to push for desirable dietary changes in the country.

This present research was conducted to analyse the effect of glycerol, peanut oil and soybean lecithin on the water vapor permeability (WVP) of edible films based on improved cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) native starches from Côte d’Ivoire. The films were prepared using 4 g cassava starch, 25 % and 30 % glycerol (w/w), 5 % and 10 % peanut oil (w/w) and 0 % to 5 % soybean lecithin (w/w <b>oil)</b> in Petri <b>dishes.</b> The WVP of the films was determined at 25 °C and 75 % relative humidity. The moisture content of the films was determined in an oven at 105 °C and the film thickness was determined manually using a micrometer. The resulting films were homogeneous, transparent and crack-free. WVP, moisture content and thickness of the films increased with increasing glycerol concentration. Increasing the concentrations of the peanut oil and soybean lecithin decreased the thickness and increased the moisture content of the films. The combination of glycerol and peanut oil increased the WVP of the films, whereas addition of soybean lecithin had no effect.

40|$|Olfactory {{predator}} search processes differ fundamentally {{to those}} based on vision, particularly when odour cues are deposited rather than airborne or emanating {{from a point}} source. When searching for visually cryptic prey that may have moved some distance from a deposited odour cue, cue context and spatial variability {{are the most likely}} sources of information about prey location available to an olfactory predator. We tested whether the house mouse (Mus domesticus), a model olfactory predator, would use cue context and spatial variability when searching for buried food items; specifically, we tested the effect of varying cue patchiness, odour strength, and cue-prey association on mouse foraging success. Within mouse- and predator-proof enclosures, we created grids of 100 sand-filled Petri dishes and buried peanut pieces in a set number of these patches to represent visually cryptic 'prey'. By adding peanut <b>oil</b> to selected <b>dishes,</b> we varied the spatial distribution of prey odour relative to the distribution of prey patches in each grid, to reflect different levels of cue patchiness (Experiment 1), odour strength (Experiment 2) and cue-prey association (Experiment 3). We measured the overnight foraging success of individual mice (percentage of searched patches containing prey), as well as their foraging activity (percentage of patches searched), and prey survival (percentage of unsearched prey patches). Mouse foraging success was highest where odour cues were patchy rather than uniform (Experiment 1), and where cues were tightly associated with prey location, rather than randomly or uniformly distributed (Experiment 3). However, when cues at prey patches were ten times stronger than a uniformly distributed weak background odour, mice did not improve their foraging success over that experienced when cues were of uniform strength and distribution (Experiment 2). These results suggest that spatial variability and cue context are important means by which olfactory predators can use deposited odour cues to locate visually cryptic prey. They also indicate that chemical crypsis can disrupt these search processes as effectively as background matching in visually based predator-prey systems. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Olive oil is {{a typical}} product of the Mediterranean basin, where {{almost all of the}} world {{production}} takes place. Due to campaigns for a healthier way of living, consumption of olive oil has also increased in non Mediterranean countries in recent years. As a result of the expanded demand the different participants in the supply chain of olive oil strengthen their efforts to obtain a higher market share in these non-traditional markets. Germany with 82. 5 million inhabitants is of special interest for olive oil producing countries as it serves as an attractive export destination. Although during the period 1997 / 98 Germany imported only about 2. 6 % of the world?s imports of olive oil and consumed about 0. 9 % of the world consumption, it {{is considered to be a}} very dynamic market (Ward et al., 2002). Olive oil becomes more and more popular in Germany not only through the ?for a healthier life? campaigns but also through immigrants coming from the Mediterranean basin. Another reason for the growing popularity of olive oil is the increasing convergence of the consumption habits of the European people as a consequence of the expanded tourism to southern countries.

In the present paper we investigated and analyzed the usage status of fats and oils for cooking in mass feeding facilities and in the home. This study shows that fats and oils were used properly in 86 % of cooking in mass feeding facilities and in 72 % in private homes. Twelve types of fats and oils were used in mass feeding facilities compared with 15 in private homes. Survey results indicate that soybean oil was used most frequently in 88 %of the mass feeding facilities, sesame oil in 76 %, butter in 64 %, margarine in 52 %and rapeseed oil in 32 %. Both olive oil and sesame oil were used most frequently in 48 % of home cooking sites, margarine and butter in 41 %and 40 %, respectively, and both rapeseed oil and corn oil in 38 %. Reasons for selecting cooking fats and oils in the mass feeding facilities were "good for health" and "adhere to the brand of manufacturer", whereas the home cooking sites specified "good for health" and "in use from a long time ago" as the major reasons. In the selection of fats and oils. their reasonable prices were common considerations.

40|$|Abstract Background Health {{programs}} commonly promote handwashing {{by drawing}} attention to potential fecal contamination in the environment. The underlying assumption is that the thought of fecal contamination will result in disgust, and motivate people to wash their hands with soap. However, this has not proven sufficient to achieve high rates of handwashing with soap at key times. We argue that handwashing with soap is influenced by broader range of antecedents, many unrelated to fecal contamination, that indicate to people when and where to wash their hands. This exploratory study aimed to identify and characterize this broader range of handwashing antecedents for use in future handwashing promotion efforts. Methods First, an initial list of behavioral antecedents was elicited through unstructured interviews, focus group discussions and observation with residents, from a low-income community in Dhaka, Bangladesh, who were also recipients of a handwashing intervention. Then, photographs representing three categories of behavioral antecedents were taken: activities of daily living, visual or tactile sensations, and handwashing-related hardware and activities. Finally, the research team conducted ranking exercises with {{a new set of}} participants, from the same area, to assess the perceived importance of each antecedent illustrated by the photographs. The research team probed about perceptions regarding how and why that particular antecedent, represented by the photograph, influences handwashing behavior. Results After coming out of the bathroom and dirt (moyla) on hands were the two antecedents that ranked highest. In all the categories, intervention-related antecedents (three key times for handwashing which included handwashing after coming out of the bathroom, after cleaning a child’s anus and before food preparation; intervention provided items that included handwashing station, soapy water bottle, handwashing reminders from posters and community health provider visits) that were being promoted actively in this community were perceived favorably in the qualitative responses, but did not consistently rank higher than non-intervention items. However, many other antecedents were reported to influence when and where people wash their hands: cutting greasy fish, starting a meal, contact with oil and fat stuck to <b>dishes,</b> <b>oil</b> and lice from hair, sweat, unwashed vegetables, reminders from son and daughter or observing others wash hands, and observing the sunset. Conclusions Beyond well-recognized antecedents related to fecal contact and dirt on hands, we identified a broader set of antecedents not reported in the literature. Adopting a handwashing promotional strategy to highlight existing antecedents that people themselves have identified as important can help inform the content of an intervention that is more relatable and effective in increasing handwashing practices...|$|R

The recent advancements in areas as metabolic roads and directed evolution of the protein, they indicate an exchange of the paradigm of the traditional biology to biotechnology. This work presents a selection of bacteria producer of lipase, with the objective to apply the enzyme in the Buriti oil hydrolysis. Of 440 activated bacteria, 181 isolated ones were effectively tested in medium inductors. Of this total, 75 isolated ones (41 %) showed lipase production. The enzymatic activity were tested in different temperatures (30 ?, 35 ?, 40 ?, 45 ?C), with the enzymatic activity lessening with the increase of the temperature. To 30 ?C had to peak of enzymatic activity. After 72 hours of cultivation in Petri <b>dishes</b> containing olive <b>oil</b> as substrate, the enzymatic index was valued through the relation beTween the diameter of the halo around the colony and the diameter of the colony. The isolated they were classified in different categories according to the enzymatic activity. Of isolated tested, twenty four were selected for the quantitative lipase tests and also for the affinity tests to Buriti <b>oil</b> in Petri <b>dishes.</b> After, it was possible to select six streams (INPA P- 106; INPA P- 108; INPA P- 124; INPA P- 798; INPA P- 803 and INPA P- 799). There were no significant differences beTween the six bacterias and they all were selected for the tests of enzymatic hydrolysis of the Buriti oil. The enzymatic hydrolysis was analysed by Response Surface Methodology. The selected bacterium (INPA P- 798) presented the biggest affinity regarding the Buriti oil when were compared with others five bacterias. The profit of the hydrolysis with the precipitate enzyme (33, 84 % fat acid free) was superior to that of the purified lipase and crude extract results. The optimal activity were beTween 6, 0 and 8, 5 pH values above 3 hours. The extracellular lipase was purified by Sephadex G- 25 gel and his kinetic analysis it presented the best activity 55 ?C and pH 8, 5. The lipolytic enzyme was promoted by CaCl 2 and ZnSO 4 that increase of the activity in 22 % and 18 %, respectively. The activity was inhibited by MgSO 4 in 13 %. The specific activity of the lipase purified was Vmax = 12500 ?M p-NP. mL- 1 e Km = 1, 125 ?M p-NP. min- 1. The selected bacteria is a Burkholderia cepacia, a classic producer of lipase...|$|R
