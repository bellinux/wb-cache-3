5|$|For {{the primary}} deposits, the source pegmatites, {{which are usually}} <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after {{reaction}} with hydrogen chloride; then follow thickening, filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, {{with a series of}} magnets of increasing strength. Monazite <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> this method can be as pure as 98%.|$|E
