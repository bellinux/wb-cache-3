40|$|The study {{ventured to}} use Derridean deconstruction {{as a method}} of {{analyzing}} the novel Viajero. It aimed to identify <b>the</b> binary <b>oppositions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel, establish the hierarchical relationship existing within each binary opposition, deconstruct the binary opposition, identify the parts of the novel showing the unstable relationship between <b>the</b> terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> binary <b>opposition,</b> interpret the text and identify the implications of Derridean deconstruction for enhancing the critical reading skills of the learners. Deconstructing <b>the</b> binary <b>oppositions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel Viajero by F. Sionil Jose was done primarily through content analysis. This needed a close reading of certain parts of the novel Viajero. Derridean deconstruction was then used {{to come up with an}} interpretation of the novel. Much binary <b>opposition</b> exists <b>in</b> Viajero. <b>The</b> interaction of the multitudinous characters and various social constructs produce hierarchical relationships. These binary oppositions privilege one term upon the other. But upon closer reading and investigation, this privileged/less privileged status reveals its inherent instability and inconsistency. Furthermore, the novel contains inherent traces that displace the hierarchical relationship existing between <b>the</b> terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> binary <b>oppositions.</b> Finally, Derridean deconstruction can be used as a basis for analyzing literary text...|$|R
