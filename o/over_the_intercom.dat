5|$|On {{the night}} before his 22nd birthday, on 15 February 1944, Schnaufer and his crew claimed aerial {{victories}} 45 to 47. Bomber Command had sent 561 Lancasters and 314 Halifax four-engined bombers, supported by de Havilland Mosquito night-fighters and bombers, destined for Berlin. Schnaufer, who had been suffering from stomach pains all day, and his crew returned to Leeuwarden at 00:14. Rumpelhardt {{had been the first}} to congratulate him on his birthday <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>intercom.</b> Their fellow airmen had prepared a birthday celebration. The stomach pains had become unbearable and Schnaufer was taken to a hospital with appendicitis. He stayed in the hospital for about two weeks before, together with Rumpelhardt, he went on vacation back home. Carelessly lifting his suitcase, he burst his stitches, resulting in further hospitalisation. He flew his first mission after these events on 19 March 1944.|$|E
5|$|When an Indian American {{passenger}} reveals {{himself as}} an American, one of the terrorists murders him and throws his body off the aircraft {{in front of the}} Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>intercom.</b> When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.|$|E

Edward believes the patients can be cured {{by having the}} evil drained from their bodies. The electricity is cut and the lights go off. Black and Stoller roam in the dark, finding {{the body of the}} night nurse. Purdue's voice is heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>intercom,</b> and the pair move to the office with the tannoy equipment to find him. Edward attacks with a knife—Stoller sees him shape-shift into Purdue, then Bear, and then Woodcock. However, Purdue fights and kills him, proclaiming it [...] "the sanest thing I ever did." [...] Black theorizes that Edward somehow absorbed the killers' violent impulses into himself, but was unable to refrain from acting upon them.|$|E

In {{an effort to}} get Principal Skinner his job back, Bart {{attempts}} to expose Ned's poor leadership to Superintendent Chalmers. Despite the state of chaos at the school, Superintendent Chalmers is not concerned. However, upon hearing Ned utter a brief mention of God <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>intercom,</b> Superintendent Chalmers immediately fires Ned for reciting a school prayer. Principal Skinner is soon re-hired as principal. Bart and Principal Skinner share an amicable chat about their typically antagonistic relationship, then affectionately pat each other on the back.

An {{individual}} scout unit may also sound reveille to rouse the scouts and scouters on a weekend trip, though this is less common.|$|R
50|$|During the {{training}} sessions, Lewis {{was struck by}} the infantilism of most of his fellow trainees. Examples included yelling at and insulting financial experts who talked to them, throwing spit balls at one another and at lecturers, calling phone sex lines and then broadcasting them <b>over</b> <b>the</b> company's <b>intercom,</b> gambling on behavioral traits (such as how long it took certain trainees to fall asleep during lectures), and the trainees' incredible lust for money and contempt for any position that did not earn that much.|$|R
500|$|A [...] "code white" [...] alert was sounded <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>intercom</b> and {{students}} {{were instructed to}} remain in their classrooms. Negotiations with Morrison began {{with the goal of}} allowing the six remaining hostages in the room to be released. Initially, he directly spoke to deputies in the hallway while holding one of the hostages at gunpoint, but later spoke via telephone and used the student hostages as relayers between the negotiators and himself, as {{he did not want to}} speak directly with officials. After four of the six girls were released between the hours of 12:35 p.m. and 1:45 p.m., negotiators heightened the intensity of their indirect discussions with Morrison. During this time, 16-year-old junior Emily Keyes, one of the two remaining hostages, managed to send her family a brief text message stating, [...] "I love u guys" [...] in response to a text message ("R U OK?") her father, John-Michael Keyes, had sent using his cell phone after receiving word that an incident was occurring at the high school.

Cartman gets the job after sabotaging the efforts of a talented student named Casey Miller. However, during his first announcement, Cartman is very critical of the school and makes politically charged accusations against student body president Wendy Testaburger. Principal Victoria asks Cartman to stick to the script during announcements, but he accuses her of trying to silence him, and brings in the American Civil Liberties Union to ensure his freedom of speech. Cartman's announcements are soon broadcast as the politically themed [...] "EC" [...] show on televisions placed in each classroom. On his set's chalkboard he uses the first letters of keywords that he writes to spell out Wendy's intent to [...] "kill Smurfs" [...] which concerns Butters and some other students. When they confront Wendy, she simply refuses to acknowledge Cartman.|$|E
500|$|At 11:30am on 18October1968, {{the flat}} was raided by Sgt. Norman Pilcher, of Scotland Yard's Drugs Squad. In 1974, Lennon remembered that Ono {{answered}} {{the front door}} as a female voice had said (<b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>intercom),</b> {{that there was a}} message from the Apple office. Ono opened the door and saw the female with five men, who were all dressed in plain-clothes. She panicked and closed the door, thinking they were Beatles' fans. Meanwhile, at the back window, another person was banging on the window and holding up a search warrant for Lennon to read. As Lennon was also panicking—not knowing at that point that they were all police officers—the raid consisted of seven police officers and two police dogs—he played for time and refused to open the window. Because of this, Pilcher later accused Lennon of obstruction of justice, which was a crime. Inside the flat, the police searched every room thoroughly, even though Lennon was supposed to accompany them whilst they did so, according to the law. Pilcher then summoned Lennon and pointed to a binocular case on a mantelpiece, asking him, [...] "Is this yours?" [...] Lennon replied in the affirmative, and was then shown 219grams of hashish, which was in the case.|$|E

The doll is quietly released, but the executives of Malibu Stacy have a meeting in which they agree that Lisa's doll is a real threat because it might hurt the sales of their doll. Meanwhile, Grampa struggles with his new job at Krusty Burger, suffering a war flashback at the drive-in and losing his false teeth making burgers. He soon becomes angry at the way seniors are treated, and quits. After a slow initial release, Lisa Lionheart suddenly gains popularity among the fans of Malibu Stacy after being featured in Kent Brockman's news show. At the mall, as kids, and Smithers, rush out to buy Lisa Lionheart, a cart of Malibu Stacy dolls with new hats is wheeled right into the path of the group running for the Lionheart display. Lisa appeals to them that it is just the same doll with a [...] "stupid, cheap" [...] hat, but they all prefer to stick with Malibu Stacy, largely due to the encouragement of Smithers, except for one little girl, who leaves with a Lisa Lionheart doll. Despite the fact that the doll is a failure, Lisa takes heart that her message was able to get through to at least one little girl.|$|E
