But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink <b>over</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{told me to get}} the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E
500|$|Both of Benn's grandfathers were Liberal Party MPs; his {{paternal}} {{grandfather was}} John Benn, a successful politician, MP for Tower Hamlets and later Devonport, who was created a baronet in 1914 (and who founded a publishing company, Benn Brothers), and his maternal grandfather was Daniel Holmes, MP for Glasgow Govan. Benn's contact with leading politicians of the day, {{dates back to}} his earliest years. He met Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald when he was five years old, whom he described as: [...] "A kindly old gentleman [...] leaned <b>over</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> offered me a chocolate biscuit. I've looked at Labour leaders {{in a funny way}} ever since." [...] Benn also met former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he was twelve, and later recalled that, while still a boy, he once shook hands with Mahatma Gandhi; in 1931, while his father was Secretary of State for India.|$|E

500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, I {{observed}} another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down. At about , [...] the Jerry, still way out of my range, turned under me and slightly to the right. I rolled over on my back, following him and gave him an ineffective burst at long range. By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. I thought I had been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right <b>over</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2011, the High Court of Australia {{ordered a}} stay of charges, ruling that Australian officials' {{participation}} in Moti's extradition from the Solomons had been unlawful under Solomon Islands law. Summarising its ruling, the court said: [...] "Further {{prosecution of the}} charges would be an abuse of process because of the role that Australian officials in Mr Moti being deported to Australia". This was a permanent stay of prosecution {{putting an end to}} all court proceedings against Moti; the ruling was a majority decision of six judges to one. Manasseh Sogavare stated, in response to the ruling: [...] "I am so pleased. This matter has hung like a dark cloud <b>over</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my government. This decision has vindicated me".|$|E

It's sort of like I'm taken over or someone's trying to contact me; I really believe very much that I'm in some ways channeling this thing. Because when I write a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines. But for the most part it comes to me, it comes in and I can hear the whole thing finished with harmonies and everything." [...] Graeham Goble (2001) ...|$|E
2500|$|While Walter {{had many}} {{influences}} within music, in his Of Music and Making (1957) he notes a profound influence from the philosopher Rudolf Steiner. He notes, [...] "In old age I {{have had the}} good fortune to be initiated into the world of anthroposophy and during the past few years to make a profound study of the teachings of Rudolf Steiner. Here we see alive and in operation that deliverance of which Friedrich Hölderlin speaks; its blessing has flowed <b>over</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> so this book is the confession of belief in anthroposophy. There is no part of my inward life that has not had new light shed upon it, or been stimulated, by the lofty teachings of Rudolf Steiner ... I am profoundly grateful for having been so boundlessly enriched ... It is glorious to become a learner again at my time of life. I have a sense of the rejuvenation of my whole being which gives strength and renewal to my musicianship, even to my music-making." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, Robeson played [...] "Joe" [...] in the London {{production}} of the American musical Show Boat, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. His rendition of [...] "Ol' Man River" [...] became the benchmark for all future performers of the song. Some black critics were not pleased with the play due to its usage of the word nigger. It was, nonetheless, immensely popular with white audiences. He was summoned for a Royal Command Performance at Buckingham Palace and Robeson was befriended by MPs from the House of Commons. Show Boat continued for 350 performances and, as of 2001, it remained the Royal's most profitable venture. The Robesons bought a home in Hampstead. He reflected on his life in his diary and wrote {{that it was all}} part of a [...] "higher plan" [...] and [...] "God watches <b>over</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> guides me. He's with me and lets me fight my own battles and hopes I'll win." [...] However, an incident at the Savoy Grill, in which he was refused seating, sparked him to issue a press release describing the insult which subsequently became a matter of public debate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stewards}} {{investigated the}} collision between di Grassi and Félix da Costa but elected {{to take no}} action towards the Audi Sport ABT driver, and di Grassi spoke to Félix da Costa after the ePrix. Di Grassi claimed Félix da Costa [...] "didn't know how to race today" [...] {{and that he was}} passed [...] "very harshly" [...] but admitted that he had not seen the latter after overtaking him: [...] "That's the price of starting at the back, there's always these risks. That generated the crash and then this chaotic domino effect that really was a day to forget." [...] Félix da Costa blamed di Grassi for causing the collision, claiming the latter was [...] "out of character" [...] and did not believe that he would attempt such a manoeuvre. He added while di Grassi was intelligent, he steered earlier than expected which forced him to be squeezed into the wall: [...] "He was being very clever - I overtook him and he was staying there. But one lap to another his mind just switched, he tried to overtake me like 20 times in five corners. He was all <b>over</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> then he was just trying desperate moves everywhere." [...] Di Grassi lamented the ePrix and said his team would forget about the event because of him going from being the fastest driver in the second practice session to having a poor qualifying lap and would recover for the next race of the season.|$|E
