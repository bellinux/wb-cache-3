5|$|Other sharks feed on squid <b>or</b> <b>fish,</b> {{which they}} swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point {{outwards}} to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. The great white {{and other large}} predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.|$|E

Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E

5|$|Later inhabitation of Southcote was {{discovered}} at Anslow's Cottages {{south of the}} Kennet, where excavation suggests that a Bronze Age waterfront was made on {{a branch of the}} river. A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England—now known as English Heritage—detailed the discovery of fragments of twined basketry at Anslow's Cottages, showing that eel <b>or</b> <b>fish</b> traps were used on the river near Southcote. Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to the trap suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century. Later discoveries, made in the 1980s during gravel extraction in the area, also uncovered evidence of a landing stage or jetty on the river channel.|$|E
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, <b>or</b> <b>fish,</b> strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos {{have become}} a {{standard}} knockdown tool in animal embryonic systems, which have {{a broader range of}} gene expression than adult cells and can be strongly affected by an off-target interaction. Following initial injections into frog <b>or</b> <b>fish</b> embryos at the single-cell or few-cell stages, Morpholino effects can be measured up to five days later, after most of the processes of organogenesis and differentiation are past, with observed phenotypes consistent with target-gene knockdown. Control oligos with irrelevant sequences usually produce no change in embryonic phenotype, evidence of the Morpholino oligo's sequence-specificity and lack of non-antisense effects. The dose required for a knockdown can be reduced by coinjection of several Morpholino oligos targeting the same mRNA, which is an effective strategy for reducing or eliminating dose-dependent off-target RNA interactions.|$|E

5|$|The {{albatross}} diet {{is predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. It {{should be noted that}} for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill <b>or</b> <b>fish.</b> Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, {{humans have}} {{utilized}} fish {{as a food}} source. Historically and today, most fish protein has come by means of catching wild fish. However, aquaculture, <b>or</b> <b>fish</b> farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE. in China, is becoming increasingly important in many nations. Overall, about one-sixth of the world's protein {{is estimated to be}} provided by fish. That proportion is considerably elevated in some developing nations and regions heavily dependent on the sea. In a similar manner, fish have been tied to trade.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin also {{interacts with}} many herbs and spices, some used in food (such as ginger and garlic) and others used purely for {{medicinal}} purposes (such as ginseng and Ginkgo biloba). All may increase bleeding and bruising in people taking warfarin; similar effects {{have been reported}} with borage (starflower) oil <b>or</b> <b>fish</b> oils. St. John's Wort, sometimes recommended to help with mild to moderate depression, reduces {{the effectiveness of a}} given dose of warfarin; it induces the enzymes that break down warfarin in the body, causing a reduced anticoagulant effect.|$|E

5|$|Both Crex crakes are omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feed on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. The corn crake may take pests such as Sitona weevils, leatherjackets and wireworms. In Africa, termites, cockroaches and dung beetles may be consumed. These opportunist hunters {{will take the}} occasional vertebrate such as a small frog, rodent <b>or</b> <b>fish.</b> Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. In Africa, both species will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. Crex crakes forage singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes {{in association with the}} other member of the genus or with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and common quails.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae can {{be found}} in all feeding guilds in {{freshwater}} habitats. Most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector-gatherers, picking up fragments of organic matter from the benthos. Other species are collector-filterers, sieving organic particles from the water using silken nets, or hairs on their legs. Some species are scrapers, feeding on the film of algae and other periphyton that grows on underwater objects in sunlight. Others are shredder-herbivores, chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder-detritivores, gnawing at rotting wood or chewing dead leaves that have been pre-processed by bacteria and fungi; most of the nutrients of the latter group come from consumption of the bacteria and fungi. The predatory species either actively hunt their prey, typically other insects, tiny crustaceans and worms, or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close. A few species feed opportunistically on dead animals <b>or</b> <b>fish,</b> and some Leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Gravel was {{challenged}} for the Democratic Party's nomination by State Representative Clark Gruening, {{the grandson of}} the man Gravel had defeated in a primary 12 years earlier. Several factors made Gravel vulnerable. As an insurgent candidate in 1968, Gravel had never established a firm party base. Not liking to hunt <b>or</b> <b>fish,</b> he was also always culturally suspect in the state. A group of Democrats, including future governor Steve Cowper, led the campaign against Gravel, with Gravel's actions in respect to the 1978 and 1980 Alaskan lands bills a major issue, especially given that the latter's dénouement happened but {{a week before the}} primary. The sources of Gravel's campaign funds, some of which came from political action committees outside the state, also became an issue in the contest. Another factor may have been Alaska's blanket primary system of the time, which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents; Republicans believed Gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election.|$|E

5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat <b>or</b> <b>fish</b> recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E
5|$|Otters do not {{dramatically}} reduce prey {{populations in}} the wild, generally speaking. When a copious supply of food dwindles or other prey becomes available, otters either transfer to a new location or convert their dietary choices to the most adequate prey. When left unchecked, though, otter depredations can be quite significant under certain circumstances (e.g. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other escape options). Resolution of such conflicts will usually require removal and/or relocation of nuisance otters. Even in larger bodies of water, they may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, low-flow, or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even such fast-swimming species as trout become lethargic in extremely cold water, with a commensurate increase in their vulnerability to predation. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, <b>or</b> <b>fish</b> species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the river otter, the deciding factor whether the river otter can establish itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish.|$|E
5|$|The African crake {{feeds on}} {{invertebrates}} including earthworms, gastropods, molluscs and the adults and larvae of insects, especially termites, ants, beetles and grasshoppers. Vertebrate prey such as small frogs <b>or</b> <b>fish</b> {{may also be}} taken. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. The crake searches for food both within vegetation and in the open, picking insects and seeds from the ground, turning over leaf litter, or digging with its bill in soft or very dry ground. It will chase faster moving prey, reach up to take food from plants, and wade to pluck food items from the water. Crop plants such as rice, maize and peas may sometimes be eaten, but this bird is not an agricultural pest species. It forages singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes in association with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and corn crakes. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E

5|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the history of}} clarinet was the invention of the modern pad. Because early clarinets used felt pads to cover the tone holes, they leaked air. This required pad-covered holes to be kept to a minimum, restricting the number of notes the clarinet could play with good tone. In 1812, Iwan Müller, a Baltic German community-born clarinetist and inventor, developed a new type of pad that was covered in leather <b>or</b> <b>fish</b> bladder. It was airtight and let makers increase the number of pad-covered holes. Müller designed a new type of clarinet with seven finger holes and thirteen keys. This allowed the instrument to play in any key with near-equal ease. Over the course of the 19th-century makers made many enhancements to Müller's clarinet, such as the Albert system and the Baermann system, all keeping the same basic design. Modern instruments may also have cork or synthetic pads.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs <b>or</b> <b>fish</b> were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, <b>or</b> <b>fish.</b> In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E
