Now under attack on two fronts, Hierapytna surrendered.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{is focused on}} examining by describing historically {{the relationship between the}} Philippines and China in <b>the</b> disputed claims <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> in South China Sea. To crystalize this goal, the discourse in the paper heavily employs inter-textual analysis that is logically arranged into an opening idea on the context of <b>the</b> conflicting issue <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> situated in Spratlys, then followed by an extensive illustration {{of the relationship between the}} Philippines and China concerning <b>the</b> territorial claims <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> of South China Sea. Subsequently, a brief reflection guided by the principle of territoriality is portrayed with the goal to authoritatively explain the idea of jurisdiction <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> in <b>the</b> Spratly area. After that, the paper briefly concludes with a prospectus on the issue of South China Sea...|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Beta reached Providencia Island, on October 29, 2005. Rainfall {{from the}} storm were {{estimated}} over 12in (304mm). Roofs were damaged all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> and the island's main communications tower was knocked over. A total of 1,660 homes were damaged by the storm throughout the island, leaving 1.4millionColombian peso (2005COP; $681USD) in repair costs. This disrupted fixed-line telephone service and as the island has no cellular telephone service, it caused a total cessation of communication with the mainland. Beta's arrival on the island {{was accompanied by a}} seven-foot storm surge, which damaged beaches, coastal houses and roads, and washed out a tourist footbridge. Coral reefs around the island were, for the most part, untouched, as only 1percent of the coral sustained minor damage. Minor effects were also found around areas of sea grass. Beaches all around the island lost an average of 9.8ft (3m) of sand due to erosion. Thirty people were injured and 913 families, a total of 3,074 people, were affected during Hurricane Beta's passage <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|E

5|$|Singapore {{argued that}} Pedra Branca was terra nullius, {{and that there}} was no {{evidence}} the island had ever been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate. In the event the Court did not accept this argument, Singapore contended that sovereignty <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> had passed to Singapore due to the consistent exercise of authority <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> by Singapore and its predecessor, the United Kingdom. The actions taken included selecting Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and constructing the lighthouse, requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits, installing a military rebroadcast station on the island, and studying the feasibility of reclaiming land around the island. Malaysia had remained silent in the face of these activities. In addition, it had confirmed in a 1953 letter that Johor did not claim ownership of the island, and had published official reports and maps indicating that it regarded Pedra Branca as Singapore territory. Middle Rocks and South Ledge should be regarded as dependencies of Pedra Branca.|$|E

50|$|The Philippines' {{claims are}} based on {{sovereignty}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Spratlys {{on the issues of}} Res nullius and geography. The Philippines contend their claim was Res nullius as there was no effective sovereignty <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> until <b>the</b> 1930s when France and then Japan acquired <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> When Japan renounced their sovereignty <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> according to <b>the</b> San Francisco Treaty, there was a relinquishment of the right to <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> without any special beneficiary. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> became Res nullius and available for annexation, according to the claim.|$|R

5|$|Tropical Depression One {{formed on}} May 25 from a weak low {{pressure}} area {{to the west of}} Jamaica, which had been producing scattered showers <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> during the preceding days. The depression moved across Cuba shortly after forming, although the convection was located to the east of its poorly defined center. As it headed toward Florida, it was absorbed by an approaching cold front.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} ridge {{over the}} central Atlantic steered the nascent storm westward toward the Lesser Antilles. Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center, although initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric. However, a tight inner core soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify {{throughout the day}} on October 12. Following the appearance of an eye feature early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane while located near Antigua in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed directly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> The hurricane later struck Saint Martin and Anguilla, and skirted {{just north of the}} British Virgin Islands while continuing to intensify. By that time, it was headed toward the northwest around the periphery of the aforementioned ridge.|$|E

5|$|Across Guam, damage totaled over $700million (2002USD, $ USD), {{placing it}} among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon injured 193people, as {{reported}} by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year-old woman was cut by flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack; medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm. As six typhoons had passed directly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> during the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for 12hours Fabian degraded due to internal fluctuations, {{and began to}} weaken. The hurricane turned to the northwest on September 2 {{in response to a}} weakness in the subtropical ridge, a break caused by a mid-level circulation over the southwest Atlantic Ocean. After fading back to a Category3 hurricane, Fabian re-intensified on September 4, and regained Category4 status for a short time. The hurricane weakened again as it accelerated northward towards Bermuda, a motion due to an approaching mid-level trough. As small pockets of dry air became entrained in the eyewall, Fabian weakened slightly, passing just 14miles (23km) west of Bermuda on September 5 as a 115mph (185km/h) Category 3 hurricane. The eastern portion of the eyewall moved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> resulting in a direct hit; however, as the center did not move <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Fabian did not make landfall. After passing the island, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, and weakened to a 105mph (165km/h) Category2 hurricane on September 7. Steady weakening occurred as the hurricane moved into an area of increasing wind shear, drier air, and progressively cooler waters. On September 8, while located 680miles (1095km) east-northeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, Fabian transitioned into an extratropical storm, with no deep convection remaining near the center. The extratropical remnant turned to the north on September 9, and on September 10 it merged with another extratropical storm while located between southern Greenland and Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track directly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and {{resulting in the}} issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E

5|$|Aware of the {{military}} importance of Jersey, the British government had ordered that the island be heavily fortified.

The Battle of Jersey lasted about half an hour, with Britain successfully defending the island. There were about thirty casualties on each side, and the British took 600 French prisoners whom were subsequently sent to England. Both British and French commanders were slain.|$|E
5|$|Dan crossed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> {{and emerged}} into the South China Sea, having lost its eye feature and {{weakened}} {{back into a}} tropical storm. Convection soon redeveloped as the storm moved northwestward through warm waters. The JTWC reports that Dan reattained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on October 12, although it according to the JMA it did so 24 hours earlier. The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph). The JMA indicates that Dan peaked slightly afterward, with 10-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a minimum barometric pressure reading of 960 millibars.|$|E
5|$|Dolly {{weakened}} as it accelerated northeastward, {{although it}} still threatened to strike Bermuda with strong winds.
