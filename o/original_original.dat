A number of recent doors have been installed throughout the 1909 core and are not of cultural heritage significance. Timber French doors with glazing and decorative bolection moulding and timber casement windows open onto the eastern verandah. Some of these doors and windows retain original glazed fanlights with curved brass opening stays and mechanisms with ceramic knobs. Projecting from the north- western corner of the rear, western verandah are {{a number of}} smaller rooms containing toilets and a shower, a staff room, and a small laboratory. The walls and ceilings of these rooms are lined with fibrous cement sheeting and rounded cover strips, and the floors are finished with vinyl, ceramic tiles, and terrazzo. The 1909 laboratory contains equipment, cupboards, and workbenches.|$|E
50|$|Monte Walsh is a 2003 Western {{television}} film directed by Simon Wincer and starring Tom Selleck, Isabella Rosellini, and Keith Carradine. Loosely {{based on the}} 1963 Western novel Monte Walsh by Jack Schaefer, the film is about two long-time cowboys whose solitary and predictable lives on the range are inexorably changed when a fellow cowhand becomes involved with rustling and killing. Set in Wyoming and filmed in Alberta, Canada, Monte Walsh is a remake of the 1970 theatrical film Monte Walsh, starring Lee Marvin. The script is nearly word-for-word identical to the <b>original</b> (<b>original</b> screenwriters David Zelag Goodman and Lukas Heller are credited) {{and a lot of}} set-ups and shots are the same as well, but Selleck plays a much more amiable and kind Walsh, to the point that some of the harsher lines attributed to Marvin's Walsh are given to other characters to soften the title character's personality to match Selleck's more affable style. In 2003, Monte Walsh received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special, and in 2004, the film received the Western Heritage Awards Bronze Wrangler for Outstanding Television Feature Film.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of August 2016, the radiostation was back to normal: the ballads are played on again 24 hours a day along with Rock & Pop, Reggae, some Disco {{and a little bit}} of Eurodance. However, most of the radiostation's old id's are played on 24 hours a day such as Es Música (Is Music), Mas y mejor música de los 80 (More and better 80's music), a bit of La esencia de los 80 (The essence of the 80's) along with some of the latest ids of the radiostation such as Marca <b>Original</b> (<b>Original</b> Brand). Also, there are some rumours that the radiostation could {{broadcast}} back on the FM. On the last days of 2016, Randy Calandra, the ex-DJ of the radiostation who is now the Exitosa,s voiceover, announced that on 31 December from 20:00 La Caja de Año Nuevo (The New Year's Box) will be broadcast with the best mixes by DJ Z. Besides, there are rumours that Randy Calandra would be the official voiceover of the radiostation, this is due to an advertisement which features his voice with some songs from the 80's, 90's and today's.|$|E

5000|$|The {{upper floor}} hall has been {{subdivided}} with timber framed plasterboard lined partitions {{to provide a}} smaller hall, a lounge adjacent to Russell Street, {{and a series of}} offices. The floor is clad with original narrow hardwood tongue and groove boards, exposed in the reduced hall area. Outer masonry walls are rendered. The ceiling has been recently lined with plasterboard. Original roof structure knee braces extending below the existing ceiling have been boxed in. Window and door openings and joinery at the front and rear of the building are <b>original.</b> <b>Original</b> window openings along the right hand side stripped of original joinery and in filled with rendered masonry and glass block work. The reduced hall area has been recently been fitted with an imitation VJ wainscot panelling. At the rear of the hall, the floor provides archaeology of earlier larger stage configurations. The existing stage is also a bulkhead providing headroom over the supper room staircase below. To the left of the stage is a semi-enclosed space fitted out as a kitchen [...] The hall contains a number of timber tables that predate the building, and an early notice board containing Unions and Secretaries? Addresses. At the western end of the front lounge, a wall-mounted timber Honour Board lists past and present presidents, secretaries and trustees of the Toowoomba Trades Hall Board.|$|E

40|$|Amelioration of {{the colour}} {{averaging}} based image retrieval techniques given in [1], {{with the help}} of Even and Odd image parts is the theme of this paper. The reflection of original image is taken across horizontal and vertical directions to get flip image. The even part of image is obtained by adding original and flip images and the odd part of image is obtained by subtracting flip image from original image. Then the colour averaging methods like row mean, column mean, forward diagonal mean, backward diagonal mean, row & column mean and forward & backward diagonal mean are applied on original image, even part of image and odd part of image. The colour averages (feature vectors) of original image are considered in combination with even colour averages and odd colour averages respectively to get three image retrieval methods per colour averaging techniques as <b>original,</b> <b>original</b> with even, original with odd. The proposed content based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques are tested on a generic image database having 1000 images spread across 11 categories. For each proposed CBIR technique 55 queries (5 per category) are fired on the image database. To compare the performance of image retrieval techniques average precision and recall are computed for all queries. The results have shown improved performance (higher precision and recall values) with proposed methods compared to the simple original image feature vectors. In the discussed image retrieval methods original with even proves to be better than original, while original with odd gives the worst performance. Forward diagonal mean (FDM) gives the highest performance in the discussed six methods of featurevector selection for respective CBIR method (original, original+even, original+odd). In all forward diagonal mean (FDM) feature vectors, original with even proves to be the best with highest crossover point value of precision and recall...|$|E
