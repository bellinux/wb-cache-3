King also found examples from a new discovery in Egypt that has {{the same kind of}} grammar, showing that at least one unusual case is not unique. While some experts continue to disagree about the other case, King notes that newly discovered texts often feature grammatical <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> oddities which expand our understanding of the Coptic language.|$|E

25|$|Modern Dutch {{spelling}} still retains many of {{the details}} of the late Middle Dutch system. The distinction between checked and free vowels is important in Dutch spelling. A checked vowel is one that is followed by a consonant in the same syllable (the syllable is closed) while a free vowel ends the syllable (the syllable is open). This distinction can apply to pronunciation <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> independently, but a syllable that is checked in pronunciation will always be checked in spelling as well (except in some unassimilated loanwords).|$|E

25|$|The {{naming of}} places in Wales {{can be a}} matter of dispute and uncertainty. In some cases there is an issue of whether both the Welsh and English names should be used, or only one, and which should be given priority. In other cases it is because usage and style have changed over the years, and there is debate over which form <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> of a placename should be used.

2500|$|Spelling Reform 1 <b>or</b> <b>Spelling</b> Reform step 1 (more {{commonly}} known as SR1) is an English spelling reform proposal advocated by British/Australian linguist Harry Lindgren.

2500|$|Since {{the name}} Shiraz {{has been used}} {{primarily}} in Australia in modern times, while the earliest Australian documents use the spelling [...] "Scyras", the name Shiraz [...] has been speculated (among others by Jancis Robinson) to be in fact a so-called [...] "strinization" [...] of Syrah's name via Scyras. However, while the names Shiraz and Hermitage gradually seem to have replaced Scyras in Australia from the mid-19th century, the spelling Shiraz has also been documented in British sources back to at least the 1830s. So, while the name <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> Shiraz may be an effect of the English language on a French name, {{there is no evidence}} that it actually originated in Australia, although it was definitely the Australian usage and the Australian wines that made the use of this name popular.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, specifying a given kanji, <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> out a kanji word—whether the {{pronunciation}} {{is known}} or not—can be complicated, {{due to the}} fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji (one does not refer to [...] "kanji #237"), and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji—indeed there are many homophonous words, not simply individual characters, particularly for kango (with on'yomi). Easiest is to write the word out—either on paper or tracing it in the air—or look it up (given the pronunciation) in a dictionary, particularly an electronic dictionary; when this is not possible, such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available (and tracing in air is too complicated), various techniques can be used. These include giving kun'yomi for characters—these are often unique—using a well-known word with the same character (and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning), and describing the character via its components. For example, one may explain how to spell the word [...] via the words , , and —the first two use the kun'yomi, the third is a well-known compound—saying [...] "kaori, karai, ryō as in inryō." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the primary}} school level, {{students}} spend all class {{time with their}} peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment may {{be as simple as}} a modified assignment provided by the regular classroom teacher, or it might include formal programs such as Odyssey of the Mind, Destination Imagination or academic competitions such as Brain Bowl, Future Problem Solving, Science Olympiad, National History Day, science fairs, <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> bees. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education [...] ). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like English, Spanish, Latin, Philosophy, Science, etc., or to engage in extra curricular activities. [...] Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives. [...] However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to regular EMS, many jurisdictions also have non-emergency patient transport services operating. In many jurisdictions, these are companies {{who specialize in}} non-emergency patient transfers. [...] Such companies have their own vehicles, which are similar to ambulances and carry some similar patient care equipment. These services can relieve the workload on public EMS through the elimination of some, or most, of the non-emergency transfer volume, and some provide service {{to the public that}} is of the highest standard. In many cases, such services are small private businesses, using second-hand ambulances which have been retired from public EMS service, while others use vehicles expressly built for their purposes. There has, however, been some controversy, in some jurisdictions, with respect to the operating procedures of some (but not all) of these services. [...] In some cases, the vehicles are often made to look as much like EMS ambulances as possible, even retaining emergency lights and sirens (which they are forbidden by law to use), and incorporating the word [...] "paramedic" [...] (this term is not protected in Canada yet), variations on [...] "EMS" [...] (in some cases, [...] "event medical services") <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> variations of [...] "ambulance", such as [...] "ambu-lans", or using the Star of Life logo on their vehicle markings. These services are not generally licensed, or required to meet any recognized standard. These services generally attempt to recruit staff who meet provincial EMS qualification standards, but are under no legal obligation to do so. Such services are not covered by provincial health insurance, operate on a fee-for-service basis, and are not considered to be a legitimate part of mainstream EMS.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the body}} of Kerouac's work has been {{published}} in English, recent research has shown that, {{in addition to his}} poetry and letters to friends and family, he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in French. [...] All these works, including La nuit est ma femme, Sur le chemin, and large sections of Maggie Cassidy (originally written in French), have now been published together in a volume entitled La vie est d'hommage (Boréal, 2016) edited by University of Pennsylvania professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier. In 1996, the Nouvelle Revue Française published excerpts and an article on [...] "La nuit est ma femme", and scholar Paul Maher Jr., in his biography Kerouac: His Life and Work', [...] discussed Sur le chemin's plot and characters. The novella, completed in five days in Mexico during December 1952, is a telling example of Kerouac's attempts at writing in his first language, a language he often called Canuck French. Kerouac refers to this short novel in a letter addressed to Neal Cassady (who is commonly known as the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty) dated 10 January 1953. The published novel runs over 110 pages, having been reconstituted from six distinct files in the Kerouac archive by Professor Cloutier. Set in 1935, mostly on the East Coast, it explores some of the recurring themes of Kerouac's literature by way of a spoken word narrative. Here, as with most of his French writings, Kerouac writes with little regard for grammar <b>or</b> <b>spelling,</b> often relying on phonetics in order to render an authentic reproduction of the French-Canadian vernacular. Even though this work has the same title as one of his best known English novels, it is the original French version of an incomplete translation that would later become Old Bull in the Bowery (now published in The Unknown Kerouac from the Library of America). The Unknown Kerouac, edited by Todd Tietchen, includes Cloutier's translation of La nuit est ma femme and the completed translation of Sur le Chemin under the title Old Bull in the Bowery. La nuit est ma femme was written in early 1951 and completed a few days or weeks before he began the original English version of On the Road, as many scholars, such as Paul Maher Jr., Joyce Johnson, Hassan Melehy, and Yannis Livadas have pointed out.|$|E
