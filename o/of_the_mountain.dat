5|$|A {{pendulum}} hangs straight downwards in a symmetrical gravitational field. However, if {{a sufficiently}} large mass {{such as a}} mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's plumb-bob slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known objectsuch as a starcould be carefully measured on opposite sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> If the mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> could be independently established from a determination of its volume and {{an estimate of the}} mean density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, its mass.|$|E
5|$|Browncove Crags on {{the western}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> has some north-facing routes. These are easier to access from a car park, and they can be linked with the Red Tarn routes.|$|E
5|$|High Lakes Trail #116, the namesake of the Midway High Lakes Area, {{crosses the}} {{relatively}} flat {{area on the}} north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> following a trail the Yakama Native Americans used for picking huckleberries. Like many other trails around Adams, this trail has spectacular views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Other trails, like the Takh Takh Meadows Trail #136, pass through picturesque meadows and old lava flows. One of the longest trails on the Gifford Pinchot, Boundary Trail #1, has its eastern terminus in the Midway High Lakes area at Council Lake. Other trails in the area include the Council Bluff Trail #117, Green Mountain Trail #110, and East Canyon Trail #265.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Hidaka <b>Mountains</b> {{are located}} in the {{southern}} central Hokkaido. The area is underlain mainly by Tertiary metamorphic and plutonic rocks, and is called the Hidaka metamorphic belt. Systematic zircon and apatite fission-track analyses across <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> unraveled <b>the</b> uplift history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hidaka <b>Mountains.</b> In <b>the</b> main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains,</b> zircon FT ages show rapid cooling, while apatite FT ages show slower cooling. These results may indicate early rapid uplift slower later uplift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hidaka <b>Mountains.</b> <b>The</b> early rapid cooling (12 - 17 Ma) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> leads to <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> an earlier uplift than formerly assumed (e. g. Miyasaka, 1987). On the other hand, FT ages, almost 40 Ma, in <b>the</b> eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> are consistent with <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> Oligocene sediments in the Hidaka coastal range, which shows <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> old <b>mountains</b> existing before 30 Ma...|$|R
25|$|Fort St. John is east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rocky <b>Mountains,</b> {{and thus}} has a climate much {{more similar to}} the prairies than the British Columbia {{interior}} west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> <b>The</b> frost-free period is much longer east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> than west, and thus the Peace River area including Fort St. John can grow crops that cannot be grown in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province such as wheat and canola.|$|R

5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque {{headwall}} (the highest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall, creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of Klamath mythology, the {{mountain}} offers activities such as hiking and horseback riding. Historically, the area around it has been inhabited by Native American tribes and settlers.

5|$|After Lockdown on the April29 {{episode of}} Impact!, DOA Dusty Rhodes {{announced}} that A.J.

5|$|East of Middletown, US40Alternate {{passes through}} a {{suburban}} area then begins to ascend Braddock Mountain. The highway gains a climbing lane eastbound to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> which contains the community of Braddock Heights. On the descent of Braddock Mountain, US40Alternate expands to a four-lane road, with one lane eastbound, two lanes westbound, and a center turn lane. At the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> the alternate route temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway through its half-diamond interchange with I-70, which has ramps {{to and from the}} direction of Frederick. East of I-70, US40Alternate reduces to two lanes and passes the Highland Lodge. The alternate route reaches its eastern terminus at a partial intersection with US40 (Patrick Street) at the western edge of Frederick and the Frederick Golden Mile, a heavily commercialized area east to US15 (Frederick Freeway). There is no direct access from eastbound US40Alternate to westbound US40 or from eastbound US40 to the westbound alternate route; those movements are made by using Old Camp Road.|$|E
