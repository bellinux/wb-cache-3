In early 2007, series co-creator Greg Daniels explained to an audience at Paleyfest that Einhorn's direction had become [...] "a character in the show because [...] has an enormous amount of judgment/leeway about where he's looking. And often [...] adds a tremendous amount of comedy is the choosing to look <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> see what that person thinks and back and forth.

Coulter's father figure {{at the time was}} her grandfather Rocky. Coulter's mother gave her every chance to visit her biological father in New Zealand when she was a child.

500|$|Richard Corliss {{noted that}} the film {{appeared}} to have been influenced by The Wizard of Oz and the works of Maurice Sendak, writing, [...] "Labyrinth lures a modern Dorothy Gale out of the drab Kansas of real life into a land where the wild things are." [...] Nina Darnton wrote that the plot of Labyrinth [...] "is very similar to Outside Over There by Mr. Sendak, in which 9-year-old Ida's baby sister is stolen by the goblins". Copies of Outside <b>Over</b> <b>There</b> <b>and</b> Where the Wild Things Are are shown briefly in Sarah's room {{at the start of the}} film, along with copies of Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, a book by Hans Christian Andersen, Grimms' Fairy Tales and Walt Disney's Snow White. The film also features an end credit stating, [...] "Jim Henson acknowledges his debt to the works of Maurice Sendak." ...|$|E

[...] "My purpose is to go <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea," [...] Rodman said. He added that he hoped to accomplish [...] "something that's pretty positive." [...] During the visit, Rodman met with national Olympic athletes, male and female basketball players, viewed a men's basketball practice, and visited a state-run orphanage. Rodman {{was not able to}} meet with Kim Jong Un, but met instead with the nation's Minister of Sports and handed off several gifts for Kim Jong Un, including two signed basketball jerseys, two soap sets, and a copy of Donald Trump's 1987 book, [...] "".

500|$|Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, {{discusses}} {{some economic}} {{issues in this}} episode. Just before Jerry's dare about the egg roll, Elaine says, [...] "You know, it's not fair people are seated first come first served. It {{should be based on}} who's hungriest. I feel like just going <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> taking some food off somebody's plate." [...] Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency, which are the bases behind how tables are seated at restaurants, rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers. Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio are willing to pay more than usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: [...] "Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't go to dinner? Plan Nine from Outer Space – one night only, the big screen! My hands are tied!" ...|$|E
500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E

500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> come up with a hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E

2500|$|Vilsack's was {{critical}} of President Bush's execution {{of the war in}} Iraq, but he hesitated to call for an immediate and complete pullout of U.S. forces: [...] "I don't think we're losing in Iraq. It appears to be a draw. People are upset by the fact that their kids are <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> there doesn't seem to be any end to this whole process. It's not pacifism that makes people think this way. They're questioning the credibility and competence of the Commander-in-Chief." ...|$|E

2500|$|Producer Steve Lillywhite {{was hired}} by U2 in December 1986 to help mix some songs for The Joshua Tree; [...] "With or Without You" [...] was one of them. While Lillywhite and {{engineer}} Mark Wallis were mixing it, Eno entered the room {{and told them that}} he wanted to change the introduction. Wallis said: [...] "And it was kind of awe-inspiring because he said, 'Right, send this guitar through those ten effects <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> send that guitar through those ten effects <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> then feed them back to each other.' So what started as a traditional bit of rhythm guitar, bass, and drums suddenly became something quite otherworldly and spiritual, {{and the sound of the}} music you were hearing started to give you a feeling of where the song was going to go prior to the lyric. I thought that was really visionary." [...] Ultimately, [...] "With or Without You" [...] was the most debated song of those on which Lillywhite worked, as Eno and Lanois each had ideas different from his. Lillywhite, who wanted a more mainstream approach to his mix, favoured [...] "a little more crash, bang" [...] sound to Mullen's drums that enter later in the song, while Eno preferred that the drums remain [...] "more mysterious and more supportive".|$|E
