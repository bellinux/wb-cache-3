After the examination Griggs realized that the pin could not be inserted in modern times, and must have been placed after the man's death but before his burial, a hypothesis confirmed by further analysis. The pin was held in place by an <b>organic</b> <b>resin,</b> analogous to modern bone cement.

5000|$|Galactica {{was seen}} taking {{multiple}} hits from Cylon {{nuclear weapons and}} though the ship suffered damage, she was still operational. It is unclear exactly how well rated the Cylon nuclear weapons were versus Galacticas armor. Also, as the nukes detonated outside of the vessel, most of the energy would have been directed and attenuated out into the area of least resistance: space. However, the punishment has apparently begun to accumulate. In [...] "Blood on the Scales", after disabling the FTL drive, Chief Tyrol noticed a large crack in an interior wall; in the subsequent episode, [...] "No Exit", a more detailed inspection reveals hairline fractures and more obvious structural damage throughout the ship. The damage is aggravated {{by the fact that}} the original builders of the ship cut corners during her construction. Tyrol suggests applying a Cylon <b>organic</b> <b>resin</b> that will insinuate itself into the hull, both repairing and strengthening the metal as it matures. Admiral Adama initially refuses the idea, but after finding cracks in the bulkheads of his own quarters, he gives Tyrol permission to do whatever it takes to repair Galactica. The repairs were not proceeding well, with numerous electrical faults occurring throughout the ship. When Boomer made her escape, she jumped her Raptor close to the port forward section of the bow, causing a spatial distortion which caused massive damage both externally (a large, visible crater in the ships outer hull) and internally, exacerbating the already heavy structural damage.|$|E

40|$|The use of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) {{composites}} {{has become}} a popular solution for retrofitting and strengthening of existing concrete and masonry structures. However, some drawbacks of this technique, mainly {{associated with the use}} of <b>organic</b> <b>resins,</b> have been reported. To overcome such drawbacks, the development of composite materials in which the <b>organic</b> <b>resins</b> are replaced with inorganic matrices has recently caught the attention of the civil engineering industry. Among these newly developed systems, Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) composites, which are comprised of high strength fibers embedded within an inorganic matrix, have shown promising results. However, research on this topic is still limited and important aspects, such as the bond behavior between the composite and the substrate, are not fully understood and require further study. This paper presents the results of an experimental campaign aimed at investigating the influence of the type of matrix and substrate on the bond behavior of FRCM composites. Glass-FRCM composite strips were applied onto concrete and masonry substrates and then tested by means of a classical push-pull single-lap direct-shear test set-up. A cementitious and a lime-based matrix were employed to apply the same type of fiber on concrete and masonry substrates, respectively. FRCM- concrete and FRCM-masonry joints reported the same failure mode. However, higher values of the peak load were obtained for the lime-based glass-FRCM composite applied onto masonry substrates than with the cementitious glass-FRCM composite applied onto concrete substrates...|$|R

40|$|The Mixed Waste Focus Area (MWFA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) is {{currently}} investigating vitrification technology {{for treatment of}} low level mixed wastes (LLMW).

As part of the fiscal year (FY) 1995 activities, SRTC performed crucible-scale studies with <b>organic</b> <b>resins.</b> This waste stream was selected because of the large number of DOE sites, as well as commercial industries, that use resins for treatment of liquid wastes.

However, structural strengthening with organic type composites, such as fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) systems, may be impractical when the element {{is exposed to}} high-temperature service conditions, due to significant degradation of the <b>organic</b> <b>resin.</b> Instead, {{the use of an}} inorganic matrix, {{as in the case of}} fabric-reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) composites, may overcome this problem. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mechanical behavior under high-temperature conditions of FRCM systems. Different FRCM composites are evaluated and include carbon fabrics ranging from dry to highly-impregnated with an <b>organic</b> <b>resin.</b> The experimental spectrum is comprised of uniaxial tensile and double-shear bond tests performed under temperatures ranging from 20 to 120 °C to determine the influence of temperature over the FRCM mechanical properties. Furthermore, SEM analysis was used to study the damage processes at the fiber-matrix interface post tensile testing. Experimental results show variations in the FRCM mechanical properties if tested at high temperature conditions (caused by the deterioration of the resin coating at the interface fiber-matrix) while residual performance after exposure to elevated temperatures remains unchanged. FRCM reinforced with dry fabrics has proven not to be affected by temperatures up to 120 °C. A numerical model using a fracture variational approach, based on incremental energy minimization, was also developed to simulate the FRCM behavior in double shear tests under different temperatures exposition...|$|E

40|$|Phosphorus (P) removal {{mechanisms}} from waste {{stabilization pond}} effluent by a melter slag filter were investigated. The studied filter had treated pond effluent for a decade, but lost its P removal efficiency after 5 years. The P {{distribution in the}} slag was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical fractionation. The results showed the slag to be covered by a film comprising metal oxides/oxyhydroxides, <b>organic</b> <b>resin,</b> and Fe-phosphate precipitates. The slag porous matrix beneath this film hosted lower P concentrations and consisted of metal oxides/oxyhydroxides and calc-magnesium silicates. The study revealed the following mechanisms for P removal from effluent by the melter slag: (1) P adsorption onto metal oxides/oxyhydroxides which are ubiquitous throughout the porous slag matrix and its surface film; (2) P precipitation, mainly as Fe-phosphates (determined by SEM/EDS) on the surface film, derived from the release of metal ions into the solution phase; and (3) P sequestration by an amorphous <b>organic</b> <b>resin</b> that comprises a substantial proportion of the surface film, which was deduced by SEM/EDS and XRF. Results of chemical extractions performed on the slag demonstrated that 1 M HCl, which {{has been used to}} determine Ca-associated P in previous studies, is an unreliable Ca−P marker. By contrast, the citrate−dithionite reagent was shown to be a good indicator of Fe/Al-associated P and revealed that adsorption onto metal oxides/oxyhydroxides, in the porous matrix as well as its surface film, is the most significant P removal mechanism achieved by the slag filter...|$|E
