5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope <b>out</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Katia, {{also known}} as the Affair of Qatia by the British, was an {{engagement}} fought east of the Suez Canal and north of El Ferdan Station, in the vicinity of Katia and Oghratina, on 23 April 1916 during the Defence of the Suez Canal Campaign of World War I. An Ottoman force led by the German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein made a surprise attack on three and a half squadrons of the British 5th Mounted Brigade, which was widely scattered to the east of Romani. The mounted brigade had been ordered to the area to protect the new railway and water pipeline being built from Kantara on the Suez Canal, as this infrastructure extended <b>out</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Canal's zone of defences into the Sinai Peninsula towards Romani. Kress Von Kressenstein's attack was completely successful, decimating the equivalent of little more than a regiment. On the same day, an associated Ottoman attack on Duidar, very close to the Suez Canal, failed when it met with strong British opposition.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} October, the 25th Brigade {{became the}} {{spearhead}} of the 7th Division.

In mid-December, the Australians—who had managed to ensconce themselves on the southern slope—were ready to launch their assault on Shaggy Ridge, starting with an attack on the Pimple, by elements of the 21st Brigade, which had taken over from the 25th. Throughout December and into January 1944, a series of actions were fought along the steep ridges, culminating with the capture of the Kankiryo Saddle and Crater Hill. Following this, the Australians pushed north towards Bogadjim and Madang, which was captured in mid-April.|$|E

500|$|The {{area around}} the Bastille was {{transformed}} in the reign of Louis XIV. Paris' growing population reached 400,000 during the period, causing the city to spill <b>out</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Bastille and the old city into the arable farmland beyond, forming more thinly populated [...] "faubourgs", or suburbs. Influenced {{by the events of}} the Fronde, Louis XIV rebuilt the {{area around the}} Bastille, erecting a new archway at the Porte Saint-Antoine in 1660, and then ten years later pulling down the city walls and their supporting fortifications to replace them with an avenue of trees, later called Louis XIV's boulevard, which passed around the Bastille. The Bastille's bastion survived the redevelopment, becoming a garden {{for the use of the}} prisoners.|$|E
500|$|McVeigh was {{represented}} by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones. According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a [...] "necessity defense"—which would argue {{that he was in}} [...] "imminent danger" [...] from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued that [...] "imminent" [...] does not mean [...] "immediate": [...] "If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's <b>out</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat." [...] Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh {{was part of a larger}} conspiracy, and sought to present him as [...] "the designated patsy", but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks. Jones presented 25witnesses over a one-week period, including Dr. Frederic Whitehurst. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.|$|E

2500|$|In using circulars to knit flat {{pieces of}} fabric the two ends are used just as two {{separate}} needles would be. [...] The knitter holds one tip {{in each hand}} and knits straight across {{the width of the}} fabric, turns the work, and knits or purls back the other way. [...] Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight <b>out</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> arms.|$|E
2500|$|The Apples {{changed their}} {{name to the}} Wallflowers and began playing clubs around Los Angeles, {{specifically}} the Sunset Strip, such as the Whisky a Go Go, Gazzarri's and the Viper Room. While they were playing clubs the band was also sending their demo tape to record companies and figures within the music industry. One of those tapes {{caught the attention of}} Andrew Slater, who would eventually become the Wallflowers' manager. [...] Slater brought the Wallflowers to Virgin Records, who signed the band to a record contract. The Wallflowers then set out to make their first album. [...] However, finding a producer who was willing to work with them proved to be difficult. The band was intent on recording live and few producers were willing to produce that way. Paul Fox eventually stepped in and agreed to produce the album. By the time the Wallflowers got into the studio in 1991, they had a small catalog of songs they had been performing live which they wanted to record for their debut album. All of the songs were written by Dylan {{with the rest of the}} band members contributing input on the music. When in the studio, the band were intent on using as little recording equipment as possible. [...] Dylan explained: [...] "If I could have had it my way I would not have seen a microphone or a cable anywhere." [...] When it came to recording, the songs were drawn <b>out</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> 3 to 4 minute norm; many songs were close to 5 minutes in length with two exceeding 7 minutes. The Wallflowers finished recording and released their debut album on August 25, 1992. After the release they began touring nationwide as an opening act for bands such as the Spin Doctors and 10,000 Maniacs.|$|E
