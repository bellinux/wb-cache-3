5000|$|Centered {{largely in}} the state of Arkansas the Agricultural Wheel sought {{association}} with <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> protest organizations outside the state of Arkansas.

Besides the similarity of their political goals the Agricultural Wheel and the <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> protest organization shared the same organizational structure. [...] The Agricultural Wheel and the <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> protest organizations anticipating merger were organized on the basis of small clubs of farmers organized at the neighborhood level. Even organization at the county level had proved to be impractical. County level organization was too large and not [...] "local enough." [...] In the 1880s, small farmers rarely journeyed to the county seat of their home counties. The Agricultural Wheel continued to exist as a separate organization until 1889 when it merged with the National Farmers' Alliance to form the Farmers' and Laborers' Union of America.|$|R
