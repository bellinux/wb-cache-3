40|$|Purpose – Manufacturing firms {{primarily}} organise {{service provision}} internally, externally {{or through a}} hybrid arrangement. This paper aims to analyse how firm-, offering-, and market-specific factors influence {{the way in which}} a firm organise its service provision. In addition, the paper analyses the specific challenges that each <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> presents for a firm. Design/Methodology/Approach – The study employed a qualitative, multiple-case research design that involved seven manufacturing firms with different organisational arrangements for service provision. Findings – Contrary to certain explicit assumptions, few firms organise for service provision solely through an in-house organisation. Analysis of firms {{in a wide variety of}} industries has shown that the organisational arrangements (internal, external or hybrid configuration) are contingent on factors such as market strategy, customer relationships, product-service linkages, internal competences and market channel characteristics. Research Limitations/Implications – This article is an initial attempt to understand the strategic choices that firms make in terms of inter-organisational arrangements for service provision. The research should be extended by way of a cross-sectional survey in order to test and further validate the importance of the determinants of the organisational arrangements for service provision. Originality/Value – This article contributes to the service marketing and management literature by examining factors that determine whether firms organise for service provision internally, externally or through a hybrid configuration. Prior research has not explicitly addressed this issue.

40|$|Abstract: Concurrent Engineering (CE) is an <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> that {{systematically}} {{employs a}} set of functional disciplines to integrate and simultaneously perform all the tasks that yields to a product satisfying a known list of customer needs. Its chief goals are to shorten the products ’ time to market, increase their quality and performance, and reduce their overall life cycle costs, from conception through disposal. As for Axiomatic Design (AD), it was developed by N. P. Suh at the M. I. T., in the late 1970 s, {{to be used as}} a systematic model for engineering education and practice. Its underlying hypothesis is that there exist fundamental principles that govern good design practice. Starting from such a simple reasoning, AD provides a general framework to assist in the decision making of any design process, offering a means to show in detail and to assess the existing interplay between the design goals and the tentative solutions at any time in the design process. This paper is an attempt to show how AD can be used to implement a dependable Concurrent Engineering environment...|$|E

The paper concludes by arguing that national governments, and their regulatory agencies, should view the rationalisation of organisations involved in the provision of drinking water as key to ensuring better drinking water quality.

40|$|Indigenous {{education}} in Australia {{has not been}} successful for two main reasons. First, {{there has not been}} a close and respectful relationship established between schools and their local Indigenous communities so that the purpose, process and outcomes of schooling can be constantly discussed and refined. Second, the white curriculum has found it extremely difficult to incorporate Indigenous knowledge, history and culture so that school subjects can relate to daily community life. Both problems stem from a highly conservative view of schooling and society. Australian Indigenous peoples make up only a very small proportion of the population and many schools will only have a small number of Indigenous students enrolled, if at all. Teachers may feel that they lack appropriate background knowledge when working with Indigenous children and may be uncertain of how to transform the white curriculum so that it is more culturally inclusive. This chapter describes the development of narrative curriculum and the identification of exemplars of knowledge so that the regular programs offered by neighbourhood schools can be respectful of Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing, It suggests community learning circles as the main <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> to enable the participation of Elders, family members and children in democratic school life...|$|E

The study sorts to diagnose sources of {{and the presence}} of different types of conflicts in the South African Mission (SAM). The researcher made a diagnosis of different conflicts that existed in the South African Mission in Namibia with an attempt to reconstruct an approach to manage conflicts in organisations. In an attempt to address the fundamental problem of the study, the researcher adopted a qualitative approach to the study. The analysis was based on literature reviews and journal articles published on the topic understudy. The study makes a contribution into identifying different conflicts wants that are presence within organisations. The findings established that different types of conflicts such as emotional, task and interpersonal conflicts, amongst others, do exist within the South African Mission, and members of the SAM have difference experiences of these conflicts related to their work responsibilities and to human as well. The study revealed that, both these aspects have significant effect on the personal life and working life of members in the South African Mission.

40|$|Home {{ownership}} {{comes in}} a variety of forms. Owners of single-family dwellings generally enjoy a high degree of control and autonomy. Many home owners, however, are in circumstances which involve greater collective interest, medium and high-rise environments and significant state involvement and regulation. In such situations, tensions and conflicts can arise among residents and others stakeholders in relation to a range of management and maintenance issues and between owners and the wider public interest. This involves constraints on individual freedom and the necessity for co-operation. This paper discusses these and related issues with a particular focus on owners 2 ̆ 7 corporations in Hong Kong. In the Hong Kong context, home owners are most typically in large scale, high rise and often technically complex environments. The particular form of the owner corporation is explored in relation to its history of development, its significance in the home ownership sector and its legal structure. Owner corporations raise a number of issues of participation and democracy. These include the anti-democratic <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> of owners 2 ̆ 7 corporations which tends to limit rather than enhance participation of ordinary owners, the impact of owners 2 ̆ 7 corporations in reinforcing class and income gaps as well as debates on individualism/collectivism and public/private dimensions.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{organisation}} of a company’s external communications has been characterised by enduring debate exemplified in the discussions {{on the relationship between}} marketing and public relations as well as, more recently, in arguments for a greater "integration " or interaction between and consolidation of a company’s communication disciplines. Despite this prolific attention to communication organi-sation in the literature, having resulted in a number of normative prescriptions and suggestions, there has been little if any actual empirical research on aspects of communication organisation across companies. Moreover, within the little prior empirical research, scant attention has been given, firstly, to conceptual develop-ment in the sense of defining constructs and developing valid measures of commu-nication organisation, and, secondly, to the contextual factors that may make a particular <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> of communication disciplines either more or less appropriate for a particular company. This paper therefore develops and tests a number of literature-derived propositions relating organisational dimensions to conditions in a company’s internal and external environments. Findings of an exploratory empirical study show that the organisational relationship (in the form of different types of interaction and their degree of formalisation) between the two primary departments involved in a company’s external communication programmes are correlated with such internal environmental conditions as the departments’ domain similarity and resource dependence, as well as the prevailing organisa-tional norms and cultural conditions within a company...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research into}} the kinematic robustness of autonomous robotic systems. Kinematic structures typical of those employed in the manipulation and locomotion elements of planetary exploration vehicles are represented using Graph Theory techniques, extended by the novel concept of the Constraints Matrix. This replaces the elements (zeroes and ones) of the standard adjacency matrix of the interchange graph of a kinematic system by integer elements representing the numbers of constrained degrees of freedom (dof) throughout the system. It is shown that, as motion faults develop progressively within a particular kinematic system, the succession of kinematic states lies along a trajectory in an abstract kinematic fault space derived from Constraints Matrix eigenvalues. For a 3 -link system, progressing along the trajectory, the change from one kinematic state to the next {{is accompanied by a}} rotation of the corresponding (Constraints Matrix) orthonormal eigenvectors, according to the nature of each fault that has occurred. Thus, aspects of the robustness to, and recovery from kinematic faults, of a kinematic system are represented in geometrical terms.

40|$|Party {{government}} is the <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> that characterises many parliaments in contemporary democracies, including Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Two basic conditions of party government specify that (1) parties must formulate policies for enactment once in office, and (2) parties in office must give high priority to carrying out party policies, and must be sufficiently cohesive or disciplined to enable this implementation. Nonetheless, theories of party government and indeed parties themselves emerged well after the establishment of representative legislatures. Consequently {{there is a great}} deal of tension and many inconsistencies between the constitutional and legal design of parliaments that were intended to comprise of independent/constituency representatives, and the political reality and current practice of party government. A potentially uncomfortable situation has developed whereby MPs hold dual responsibilities to their party and the public that may theoretically conflict. This paper contrasts the obligations MPs assume as party agents with their legal and constitutional responsibilities as parliamentarians. Analysing legal precedent from Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, I argue that in the vast majority of instances a party (or its members) cannot legally mandate their elected MPs to act in accordance with their policy wishes. In the absence of legal sanctions, the paper briefly examines the various other ways in which political parties hold their MPs to account (transparent decision-making, preselections, branch meetings, disciplinary bodies), and evaluates their effectiveness.

40|$|As a {{means of}} {{addressing}} observed inadequacies in school curricula, the Catholic Special Education and Guidance Service, Brisbane Catholic Education Office in 1980 established a partial withdrawal centre for counsellor-selected gifted children. The Learning Enrichment Centre (L. E. C.) aimed to - 1) {{meet the needs of}} enrolled gifted students by - a) providing appropriate learning experiences; and b) providing an administrative arrangement (partial withdrawal) which afforded them the opportunity to interact with like minds; 2) {{meet the needs of the}} system by - a) developing and evaluating units of work for gifted students; b) conducting workshops, seminars and in-service days for teachers. In 1984 the L. E. C. curriculum was designed and implemented in accordance with Maker's model of curriculum modification for gifted students (Maker, 1982). This model outlines a set of principles which Maker claims, recognize the characteristics and needs of gifted students and guide the development of a qualitatively different curriculum. In making decisions about design and implementation of Maker's curriculum modifications, factors related to the setting, the teachers and the students were considered. The overall purpose of the Study was to assist teachers in making rational decisions about future L. E. C. provision. In particular the Study was to collect information on the worth of the program - its relative strengths and weaknesses - and the influence on the curriculum of the administrative arrangement. The program was evaluated by ascertaining levels of satisfaction typically expressed by the students. Of secondary concern was whether the <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> of partial withdrawal had inhibited or enhanced the program's intentions. It was acknowledged that unfavourable attitudes of parents, classroom teachers or peers could conceivably alter students' receptivity of the program. In Term 4, two parallel questionnaires, one addressing the L. E. C., the other the regular classroom, were administered to the students. By comparing responses on matching items, levels of satisfaction with the L. E. C. curriculum were determined. Selected items on the L. E. C. instrument were further to reveal how students felt about the administrative provision and whether classroom teachers and peers were perceived to be supportive. Subsequent to program completion, a questionnaire was mailed to parents bo ascertain their support for the program by asking them how their child's emotional behaviour had changed as a result of LEC attendance. Also they were to indicate whether they preferred that enrichment occur in the regular classroom or partial withdrawal setting. To confirm the students' impressions of classroom teacher support and interest, parents were requested to comment on their understanding of it. Student responses indicated that they found their LEC experiences to be particularly interesting and enjoyable, and the LEC teachers to be kind, helpful, friendly and fair. These perceptions differed significantly from their perceptions of school. Elements of the Maker model which were consistently most valued by the group were the Process modifications, 'Freedom of Choice' and 'Higher Levels of Thinking'. Parents proved to be supportive of the LEC program. Although some would have preferred classroom enrichment to partial withdrawal, they felt that schools could not currently provide it. It was the students' viewpoint that interactions with peers and classroom teachers were not adversely affected by their LEC participation. Classroom teachers were seen to be generally supportive and interested - a perception incidentally not shared by parents and LEC teachers. Perceived positive attitudes towards their LEC involvement most likely enhanced student satisfaction with the program. The evaluation unequivocally indicated that the LEC program based on Maker's model appealed to the students. Though withdrawal from class possibly contributed to program satisfaction, the level of satisfaction was very high and could not be attributed solely to hidden curriculum efects (the <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement).</b> The Study concluded that use of the Maker model as a guide for developing LEC curricula should continue but that parent and classroom teacher attitudes towards the administrative arrangement should be regularly monitored as they appeared to have the potential to enhance or reduce students' receptivity of the program. As a result of Study, various procedures for the conduct of future evaluations were recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} franchising in service provision, job creation and self employment opportunities is widely reported (Spinelli, Rosenberg, & Birley, 2004). In Australia, franchising currently contributes approximately $ 130 {{billion to the}} Australian economy representing 10 percent of national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Frazer, Weaven & Wright, 2008). Current research suggests {{that much of the}} future growth in franchising in many world economies will be attributable to the growth in multi-unit franchising arrangements (Weaven & Frazer, 2007). Multi-unit franchising (MUF) refers to an <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> in which franchisees are allowed to own more than one unit within the same franchise system. However, the existence of multi-unit franchising remains a curious anomaly. In particular, from an agency theoretic perspective, multi-unit franchising appears to represent a suboptimal alternative to traditional dyadic revenue sharing arrangements as it contradicts incentives rationales for franchising choice. However, the ubiquity and popularity of this organisational form has generated consistent debate regarding the relative merits of this growth strategy. Over the last 15 years there has been a myriad of research explaining and examining the area multi-unit franchising. Areas of particular interest have focused upon expansionary strategies, motivations and incentives, and differences between single-unit and multi-unit operations. Further research has explored the challenges which chain organisations encounter when employing a MUF framework (e. g., Bradach, 1995; Garg, Rasheed & Priem, 2005). However, whilst it is evident that growth has occurred throughout the franchising literature in relation to MUF, significant gaps still exist. For example, with the notable exception of Bradach (1995) limited research has explored the key factors (imperatives) essential for multi-unit franchising to succeed (i. e., operational performance), hence, ensuring sustainability of franchise systems. Moreover, previous research has not empirically examined franchise system performance within the context of different organisational forms of MUF that are distinguished by their influence upon the extent of direct franchisor control, rate of system expansion and management of system operations. Therefore, in order to empirically examine the influence of the four franchising imperatives (i. e., (1) unit growth, (2) uniformity, (3) local responsiveness and, (4) system wide adaptation) upon operational performance from a multi-unit perspective (i. e., (1) master franchising, (2) area development franchising, (3) area representative franchising and (4) incremental franchising), further exploration of the four franchising imperatives is warranted. This represents an important gap in the literature. The literature presents only one previous study (Garg et al., 2005) which has examined the four franchising imperatives proposed by Bradach (1995), however this study was limited as (1) only three of the four franchising imperatives were examined and (2) the study (Bradach, 1995) did not provide a comparison between the four different multi-unit franchising forms. As such, this research provides a comprehensive insight into the outcomes which were found to influence the four franchising imperatives upon operational performance across the four multi-unit franchising governance models.

40|$|The {{quest for}} {{excellence}} in institutions is nothing new. Most {{of the twentieth century}} saw management sciences grappling with the question how to improve the productivity and general health of institutions through sound management principles and practice. In recent research, proponents of Total Quality Management have identified it as an essential strategy of successful institutions in a highly competitive and rapidly changing business environment. The overall aim of this study is the development of a framework for the implementation of Total Quality Management in the South African Air Force. As a first prerequisite, a theoretical and conceptual analysis is undertaken of Total Quality Management as it is discussed in a vast volume of published literature. In the process, Total Quality Management philosophy and principles are described within the context of organisational theory, mainly based on so-called quality guru prescriptions. The variety of definitions of Total Quality Management is studied to find an appropriate definition for this study. The primary and supportive Total Quality Management dimensions are identified in the available literature, and integrated into a framework, which is called the "Total Quality Management telescopic framework" {{for the purposes of the}} study. This framework is formulated for use in the development of an appropriate methodology to implement Total Quality Management in South African Air Force Bases. As a basis for the understanding of the empirical part of the thesis, the context and nature of the SA Air Force are also discussed, followed by the self-assessment methods already in use in the institution. The Total Quality Management telescopic framework is meant to provide a mechanism for the adoption of a systematic and ordered approach to the implementation of Total Quality Management in SA Air Force Bases. To achieve this objective, a structured questionnaire survey is undertaken to establish the nature and extent of Total Quality Management as an internal <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> for personnel in SA Air Force Bases. The framework developed from the study of the available literature is used as a basis for the survey research, which attempts to determine the main hypothesis of the study: "The attitude of personnel of the South African Air Force Bases towards the primary and supporting dimensions of the framework for the implementation of Total Quality Management is positive. " With the aid of computerised reliability analysis (Alpha Cronbach) for the test, the above hypothesis is proven to be true on a statistical basis. The attitude of personnel at SA Air Force Bases towards the nature and scope of Total Quality Management is that it enables them to perform their daily tasks better, and that they accept the Total Quality Management effort positively, in spite of specific deficiencies, which the study has brought to light. With these deficiencies as a guide, recommendations are made for their elimination. The research undertaken during the course of writing the thesis has led to the deduction that the greater the extent to which Total Quality Management principles is applied, the greater the improvement in work performance among personnel.
