40|$|In this congressional session, {{there is}} {{expected}} to be much discussion about reworking the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (commonly referred to as the Freedom to Farm Act). This act is set to expire in 2002. Thus, new legislation will likely begin to be written this session. Federal farm policy has significant implications for all of rural Nebraska. Given this importance, how do rural Nebraskans feel the farm bill should be structured? How do they feel about farm program payments? Do they support payment limitations? How do they feel about <b>other</b> <b>specific</b> <b>provisions</b> that could be included in the bill? This report details results of 3, 199 responses to the 2001 Nebraska Rural Poll, the sixth annual effort to take the pulse of rural Nebraskans. Respondents were asked a series of questions about federal farm policy. Comparisons are made among different subgroups of the respondents, i. e., comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: •	The majority of rural Nebraskans favor keeping farm program payments. Seventy-five percent said they did not favor totally eliminating farm program payments, while 25 percent favored the elimination of such payments. •	Older respondents, males, persons with lower educational levels and non-farm households were the groups most likely to favor eliminating farm program payments. •	The majority of rural Nebraskans favor farm program payment limitations. Seventy-three percent of those in favor of keeping farm program payments said there should be a limit on the amount of program payments each farm household can receive per year. •	Farm households had a higher average payment limit than did non-farm households. Farm households believed, on average, that farm households should be able to receive up to $ 61, 277 per year. In contrast, non-farm households had an average limit amount of $ 36, 579. •	Over one-half of rural Nebraskans believe that farm program payments should not be designed to provide support only to a certain size of farm. Fifty-nine percent did not advocate such a system, while 41 percent supported this concept. •	Over one-half of rural Nebraskans support the following federal farm bill provisions: - a short-term conservation reserve type program, - prohibiting livestock feeding by meat-packing firms, - a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions involving large agribusiness firms and - basing farm payments upon conservation practices. •	Over seventy percent of the farm households supported the prohibition of livestock feeding by meat-packing firms, a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions involving large agribusiness firms and the option to enter a short-term conservation reserve type program during times of surplus grain carryover...|$|E

50|$|Bilateral {{investment}} treaties deal {{primarily with}} the admission, treatment {{and protection of}} foreign investment. They usually cover investments by enterprises or individuals of one country in the territory of its treaty partner. Preferential Trade and Investment Agreements are treaties among countries on cooperation in economic and trade areas. Usually they cover a broader set of issues and are concluded at bilateral or regional levels. In order to classify as IIAs, PTIAs must include, among <b>other</b> content, <b>specific</b> <b>provisions</b> on foreign investment. International taxation agreements deal primarily {{with the issue of}} double taxation in international financial activities (e.g., regulating taxes on income, assets or financial transactions). They are commonly concluded bilaterally, though some agreements also involve a larger number of countries.|$|R

50|$|The {{board is}} {{designed}} with combining with Europe 1940 in mind, and Pacific 1940 itself uses {{only part of}} the board: for example, {{there are a number of}} Soviet Union territories on the board, which are only used in the combined game and considered impassible in Pacific 1940. <b>Other</b> <b>specific</b> combined game <b>provisions</b> include territories that start the game as French, Dutch, or Canadian, none of which are represented in Pacific 1940 but are present in Europe 1940. The initial setup of the British, American, ANZAC, Chinese, and Japanese forces for Pacific 1940 half of the combined game is also used for Pacific 1940 itself, so as to consolidate all the setup of the combined game into the Europe 1940 rulebook.|$|R
30|$|In addition, we further {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} disclosure {{and the effects of}} the German Accounting Law Modernization Act on financial reporting properties by examining companies’ disclosure behavior regarding other provisions. We choose this balance sheet item based on the previously described significant changes regarding measurement after the German Accounting Law Modernization Act, such as consideration of future wage and salary adjustments and the required discounting of other provisions with a maturity over 12  months. Other provisions offer an appropriate possibility to investigate companies’ willingness to disclose information because § 285 (12) German GAAP only provides the vague formulation that companies must disclose more information on <b>specific</b> <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> when there is no separate presentation in the balance sheet and recent other provisions are worth a substantial amount. The term “substantial” is open to interpretation.|$|R

SUMMARY Throughout sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls are denied their right to inherit from their husbands and fathers as a result of the operation of the indigenous law rule of male primogeniture, in terms of which an heir must be male. This violates prohibitions on gender discrimination, as well as <b>other,</b> more <b>specific</b> <b>provisions</b> found in international human rights treaties. However, courts in both South Africa and Zimbabwe have in recent years upheld the rule. States Parties to relevant treaties have an obligation to ensure equal inheritance rights for women and girls. In the case of South Africa, provisions of the Constitution are also relevant. After discussing the operation of the indigenous law of inheritance, the international human rights provisions violated by it, as well as the recommendations of the South African Law Commission and legislative proposals on this issue, the writer suggests that legislation should be adopted to ensure equality for women and girls, while retaining the positive aspects of indigenous law and culture...|$|R
30|$|The {{second part}} of the study focuses on {{disclosure}} after the adoption of the new accounting rules. For a subgroup of firms that voluntarily choose to capitalize R&D costs and a randomly chosen subgroup of companies with other provisions, we investigate the amount of disclosure. The results for companies with capitalized R&D costs reveal that approximately 25 % of firms do not fulfill all of the disclosure requirements and that only a few firms provide additional information voluntarily. The same holds for our randomly selected subgroup of companies with other provisions, in which all disclosure information is implicitly discretionary, as § 285 (12) of German GAAP clarifies only that disclosure of more information on <b>specific</b> <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> is mandatory when there is no separate presentation in the balance sheet and when the recent other provisions have substantial value. Thus, we observe substantial variation for both investigations in disclosure compliance. Exploring the determinants of the cross-sectional variance in disclosure compliance appears to be an attractive avenue for future research.|$|R
