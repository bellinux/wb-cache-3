5|$|In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury {{destroyed}} the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, {{which includes the}} well, was consecrated in 1186. There is evidence that, in the 12th century, the ruined nave was renovated enough for services while the great new church was being constructed. Parts of the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and crossing having been completed by 1189, progress then continued more slowly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} {{corner of the}} south aisle {{of the church is}} a {{monument}} of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish. Inserted in a window <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> is a wooden effigy, supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville, a Knight of Henry III's, who owned the northeastern estate named Norton Hautville, now Norton Hawkfield: in the same directional corner of the church are monuments to the Strach(e)y family who lived at Sutton Court.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} side of the church is the first major {{addition}} to the church: Lane's Aisle. This was built 1526–1529 by a local cloth merchant, John Lane (d.1529). It is fan vaulted in a style inspired by the Dorset aisle at Ottery St Mary and some of the carvings are similar to John Greenway's Chapel at Tiverton. John Lane and wife are buried at the east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{niche in}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> holds a 12th-century Madonna and Child, a small polychrome stone statue {{recently}} attributed to Benedetto Antelami.|$|R
50|$|Along <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>the</b> bays are {{separated}} by buttresses, each bay containing a pair of lancet windows, and on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clerestory are six circular windows. There is a porch in <b>the</b> second bay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle.</b> At <b>the</b> west end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave are two tall lancet windows, with two smaller lancets below and a wheel window above. At <b>the</b> east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chancel is a stepped triple lancet window. There are more lancet windows at <b>the</b> west end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south <b>aisle,</b> in <b>the</b> organ-house, and in <b>the</b> vestry. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windows contain Geometrical tracery.|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century reconstruction, {{an ancient}} stone altar was {{unearthed}} at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South <b>aisle,</b> with five consecration crosses representing <b>the</b> five wounds <b>of</b> Christ. <b>The</b> slab was remounted under <b>the</b> East window <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south <b>aisle,</b> {{serving as an}} altar for the Lady chapel. Also uncovered during the reconstruction was a stone which had {{been used as a}} piscina, but was discovered to be <b>the</b> lid <b>of</b> a child's coffin <b>of</b> early date. <b>The</b> stone is now set in <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south <b>aisle.</b> At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> is a black marble reproduction <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Last Supper.|$|R
5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily {{if he were to}} switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E
5|$|The north choir aisle has a stone screen by R.C.Hussey and an {{iron gate}} dated 1558 {{that came from}} Guadalajara. At the east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> is the chapel of St Werburgh which has a vault of two bays, and an east window {{depicting}} the Nativity by Michael O'Connor, dated 1857. Other stained glass windows in the north aisle are by William Wailes, by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and by Clayton and Bell. The chapel contains a piscina dating from the 14thcentury, and monuments to Bishop Graham dated 1867, and to William Bispham who died in 1685, Other monuments in the north aisle include a tablet to Bishop Jacobson, dated 1887, by Boehm to a design by Blomfield.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
2500|$|The clerestory, built circa 1330-40, {{contains}} three windows; {{the rear}} arch ones being old, while those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracery being modern. The arches that open into <b>the</b> western extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> are modern. <b>The</b> responds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower arch are pear-shaped, and date to <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave arcades, but the arch itself is later, and may {{possibly have been}} built at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower, about 1330-40. The addition to <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> projects [...] to the north, and contains a square aumbry. A groove for the parclose screen exists on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arch. There {{appears to have been}} another chantry, or possibly two, at <b>the</b> east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle,</b> with which two niches, one on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east window, were connected. There was another chantry at <b>the</b> east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south <b>aisle,</b> connected with a square aumbry just south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corbel. There are two brackets at different levels on <b>the</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle's</b> east window with carvings of a female head. South <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window, there is a plain bracket. These three brackets probably all belong to the chantry.|$|R
50|$|Folding {{bicycles}} are however {{permitted in}} peak {{times as long}} as they are in a carry bag, exceed no more than 79 cm x 59 cm x 36 cm in size, and are kept out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following a monastic tradition, the Sulpicians built {{a garden}} in the 17th century near their seminary to grow fruits and vegetables. The garden {{borrowed}} the French tradition from <b>the</b> Renaissance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geometrical arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> with <b>the</b> lawn and central statue.|$|R
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet window. On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E
25|$|At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> is {{an altar}} {{containing}} the relics of Saint Petronilla {{and with an}} altarpiece The Burial of St Petronilla by Guercino (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), 1623.|$|E
25|$|The 15th-century font is {{octagonal}} with carved sides. Piscina {{are located}} in the south walls at the east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and the east end of the chapel and in the chancel. The screen is partly 16th century with linenfold panelling which also features on the late 19th century pulpit.|$|E
50|$|From the narthex is also {{accessible}} <b>the</b> true interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, {{which has}} a nave and two aisles divided by columns, with a semicircular apse. The nave is covered by wooden trusses, while <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> are groin-vaulted. Light is provided by narrow single mullioned windows, six in each side plus another in the apse and two at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
25|$|The main {{internal}} space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral is {{that under the}} central dome which extends <b>the</b> full width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave and <b>aisles.</b> <b>The</b> dome is supported on pendentives rising between eight arches spanning the nave, choir, transepts, and <b>aisles.</b> <b>The</b> eight piers that carry them are not evenly spaced. Wren has maintained an appearance of eight equal spans by inserting segmental arches to carry galleries across <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> and has extended <b>the</b> mouldings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper arch to appear equal to the wider arches.|$|R
40|$|In <b>the</b> desgin-process <b>of</b> a {{facility}} layout, {{the focus has}} been mainly on <b>the</b> placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine resources. The material-flow, and therefore <b>the</b> desgin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> has not appropriately been taken into account. We developed a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) to generate <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> in {{a facility}} layout at minimal fixed and variable cost. <b>The</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GA to a practical problem leads to remarkable results...|$|R
25|$|North aisle wall {{memorials}} {{include a}} tablet {{at the east}} end, of white marble on black marble ground, to Joseph Barwis (died 1828), Aslackby vicar from 1798, and his wife, Bridget (died 1834). At the apposite end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> is an oval white marble tablet to Colby Graves (died 1791, aged 41).|$|E
25|$|He {{always got}} my {{attention}} {{when he stood}} up and took the microphone. He would stop every Member in their tracks to hear what he had to say, and there are very few Members that have served in this body that can claim the respect that both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> had for the gentleman from California.|$|E
25|$|Sport stadiums {{and outdoor}} arenas {{frequently}} have {{several types of}} aisles, including aisles to purchase tickets for events, aisles to enter the main event area and aisles to go to seating. Stadium seating routinely is separated into sections by aisles. Seating rows are accessed by stairsteps. To promote safety, aisles commonly are divided by a handrail in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b>|$|E
5|$|West fronts {{in general}} take three {{distinct}} forms: those that follow <b>the</b> elevation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave and <b>aisles,</b> {{those that have}} paired towers at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> each <b>aisle,</b> framing <b>the</b> nave, and those that screen <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. The west front at Wells has the paired-tower form, unusual in that the towers do not indicate <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> but extend well beyond them, screening the dimensions and profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|R
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1836 that centuries of neglect were halted, with the newly {{installed}} vicar, Rev. T. L. Shapcott embarking upon a major reconstruction, involving new pews, raising the floor level, heightening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and extension westward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle,</b> reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof to a lower pitch to bring the whole under one gable, insertion of new galleries to <b>the</b> designs <b>of</b> Francis Goodwin and <b>the</b> replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval nave arcades by stuccoed brick and cast-iron pillars, making a slim, elegant contrast to the solid rough stonework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier walls. The whole scheme cost the parish £2,390.|$|R
25|$|In <b>the</b> first chapel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> is Michelangelo's Pietà.|$|R
25|$|Gloucester Cathedral (1089) {{also had}} three chapels, two of which, {{on the north}} and south sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> still remain; the same is found in Canterbury Cathedral (1096–1107) and Norwich Cathedral (1089–1119), the stern chapel in all three cases having been taken down {{to make way for the}} Lady-chapel in Gloucester and Norwich, and the Trinity chapel in Canterbury.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{recommended}} former Senator Howard Baker, a Republican who was respected on {{both sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> for his competence and his integrity. Reagan was visibly annoyed with Strauss's suggestions, {{but a few days}} later, Donald Regan submitted his resignation, and the President appointed Baker to replace him. Baker skillfully managed Reagan's recovery from the controversy, and Reagan left office with his popularity restored.|$|E
25|$|The {{cylindrical}} columns also {{consist of}} alternate rows of travertine and basalt. Their shape and ornamentation evolved during {{the construction of}} the cathedral, as well as the decoration of the capitals. The alabaster panes in the bottom parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> windows keep the interior cool during the fierce Italian summer, while the neo-Gothic stained-glass in the upper parts of the windows date from 1886 to 1891 and were designed by Francesco Moretti.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} built in {{sandstone}} with roofs of slate and lead. Its plan {{consists of a}} west tower, a four-bay nave and a four-bay chancel with a clerestory under a continuous roof, a north and south aisles and a south porch. At <b>the</b> east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> is StNicholas' chapel and at <b>the</b> east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> is StThomas' chapel. To <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle,</b> occupying <b>the</b> west four bays, is the King's Own Regiment Memorial chapel and to <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> this is <b>the</b> refectory and kitchen. The tower is in four stages surmounted by corner pinnacles and an embattled parapet. In the first stage is a south doorway and above this in the second stage is a four-light window. The third stage has a round window above which is a clock face. The bell openings in the fourth stage have four lights. <b>The</b> parapets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and nave are embattled. The south porch has two storeys with a staircase turret to the east, and crocketed pinnacles. The east window has five lights and Perpendicular tracery.|$|R
50|$|Externally, {{there are}} seven buttresses down each side, framing windows of {{different}} dates and with tracery in different styles, both Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic as typified in <b>the</b> large windows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> west ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> being Decorated {{on the north side}} and Perpendicular on the south. See image above. There is a gabled porch on the north side sheltering a doorway with a depressed arch into <b>the</b> north <b>aisle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between <b>the</b> {{second half}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13th century and early 14th century <b>the</b> chapels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> were {{completed}} {{and a new}} cloister was built. Master Enrique died in 1277 and was succeeded by Master Johan Pérez. Stonemasons were later Aparicio Pérez, active in 1327, Pedro Sánchez de Molina and Martín Fernández, who died in 1396 and 1418 respectively.|$|R
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} is sparely furnished. Gently curved wooden pews with scroll armrests and recessed end panels flank {{the center}} aisle, {{leading to the}} altar. Its wooden flooring is now carpeted; the plaster walls have beaded wainscoting. Above, the wooden trusses with chamfered lower chords and collar ties that frame the roof are exposed. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> is the altar on a raised dais. On it is a wooden lectern with Greek Revival detailing.|$|E
25|$|In Gothic architecture, the aisles' roofs {{are lower}} than that of the nave, {{allowing}} light to enter through clerestory windows. In Romanesque architecture, however, the roofs are at roughly equal heights, with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> being only slightly {{lower than that of}} the nave. In Germany, churches where the roofs of the aisles and nave are the same height, such as St. Stephen's, Vienna, the Wiesenkirche at Soest, , and the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) in Munich are known as Hallenkirchen.|$|E
25|$|The nave is braced {{on either}} side by lower aisles, {{separated}} from the main space by a row of piers or columns. The aisles facilitate the movement of people, even when the nave is full of worshippers. They also strengthen the structure by buttressing the inner walls that carry the high roof, which {{in the case of}} many cathedrals and other large churches, is made of stone. Above the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> are the clerestory windows which light the nave.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{significant}} {{painting is}} a medallion at <b>the</b> east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south <b>aisle.</b> Uncovered in 1967 {{this has a}} central design of a cross in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> an endless knot <b>of</b> rope. <b>The</b> south <b>aisle</b> also has 12th-century pictures of angels and Apostles.|$|R
25|$|In Rouen cathedral, east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{transept}} <b>aisles,</b> {{there are}} apsidal chapels, which {{with the three}} chapels in the chevet make up the usual number. <b>The</b> Cathedral <b>of</b> St. Peter in Poitiers {{has been referred to}} {{as an example of a}} square east end, but a compromise has been made by <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> three segmental apses, and there are no windows in the east front; the most remarkable divergence from the usual design is found here in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> any triforium or clerestory, because <b>the</b> vault <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> is nearly as high as that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave, so that it constitutes an example of what in Germany (where there are many) are called Hallenkirchen; the light being obtained through <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> windows only gives a gloomy effect to the nave.|$|R
500|$|Three doorways {{lead from}} the narthex into the nave, which is [...] high and named for Hibben. It {{is divided into three}} {{vertical}} levels: an arcade at ground level, a triforium beneath <b>the</b> roofs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> and a clerestory. The configuration and its proportions are typical of English churches, but the nave's vaulted ceiling and the [...] supporting it recall French churches. The gallery above the narthex is at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triforium. <b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> are narrower than in medieval churches and are used for passage rather than seating. <b>The</b> south <b>aisle</b> features five window bays, while the north has four; where the easternmost bay would be is the entrance to a side chapel called the Blessed Sacrament Chapel. The pews in the nave are constructed from wood originally intended for Civil War gun carriages; over 100 carvers spent more than a year producing the intricate carvings.|$|R
