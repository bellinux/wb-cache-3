5|$|In 1898, Bresslau met {{her future}} husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding. Shortly thereafter, they {{developed}} a relationship that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both to develop their lives while enjoying each other's companionship, conversation, and virtues. The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> united the pair was their shared ideology: {{to take care of}} others.|$|E

5|$|After Bravo Company's {{rotation}} ends, James {{returns to}} his ex-wife Connie and their infant son, who still live {{with him in his}} house. However, he is bored by routine civilian life. James confesses to his son that there is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he knows he loves. He starts another tour of duty, serving with Delta Company, a U.S. Army EOD unit on its 365-day rotation.|$|E

5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
25|$|Winters v. United States was a United States Supreme Court Case {{with many}} implications. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> makes this case so monumental is the {{precedent}} that is set by it for United States Supreme Court cases {{that would follow}} it.|$|E
25|$|There is also Agnes’s fear {{of going}} insane and {{her fear of}} confrontation; Tobias’s fear of having another child; Julia’s fear of growing up and her fear of being {{displaced}} in her parents’ lives; and Claire’s fear of life and her fear of love, the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> she desperately wants.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to being a coeducational, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> further differentiates Alpha Phi Omega from social fraternities is that its national bylaws restricts its chapters from maintaining fraternity houses to serve as residences for their members. This also encourages members of social fraternities and sororities that have houses to join APO as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is {{apparent}} from the Death of a Salesman {{is the hard}} work and dedication of Charley and Bernard. Willy criticizes Charley and Bernard throughout the play, {{but it is not}} because he hates them. Rather, it's argued that he is jealous of the successes they have enjoyed, which is outside his standards.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{is clear}} from the {{statistics}} is Rathfarnham is aging, with young couples that moved into the area in the 1960s entering retirement. There is a lack of suitable and affordable homes for young people in Rathfarnham and consequently they are flocking out to neighbouring suburbs such as Templeogue, Tallaght and Firhouse.|$|E

25|$|Somali cuisine {{varies from}} region to region and {{consists}} of a fusion of diverse culinary influences. It {{is the product of}} Somalia's rich tradition of trade and commerce. Despite the variety, there remains <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> unites the various regional cuisines: all food is served halal. There are therefore no pork dishes, alcohol is not served, nothing that died on its own is eaten, and no blood is incorporated.|$|E

There are therefore no pork dishes, alcohol is not served, nothing that died on its own is eaten, and no blood is incorporated. Qaddo or lunch is often elaborate.|$|E
25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> kept me on the straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E

And about Chase.|$|R

25|$|The Capital Township {{formed from}} Springfield Township on July 1, 1877, and was {{established}} and {{named by the}} Sangamon County Board on March 6, 1878, {{and the limits of}} the township and City of Springfield were made co-extensive on February 17, 1892 to better serve the people. There are three functions of this township: assessing property, collection first property tax payment, and assisting residents that live in the township. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> makes the Capital township unique is that the township never has to raise taxes for road work, since the roads are maintained by the Springfield Department of Public Works.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is {{different}} about the Basilica of Our Lady of Piat was its entrance arch. It {{was at the}} back of the church and one has to go around from the entrance to see the church façade. The arch has the phrase, Basilica Minore Nuestra Señora de Piat (Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Piat). Our Lady of Piat Basilica sports a simple facade flanked with a tall belfry. It is on top of a hill in the midst of Cagayan River with the intention of avoiding floods brought about by the seasonal overflowing of the river. The church structure is mainly made of red bricks, which is common among churches in Cagayan Valley. It is a contrast to old churches made of limestone and coral stone in many parts of the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the Guggenheim {{retrospective}} and its catalogue did was {{to afford}} an American critical audience a comprehensive view of Beuys's practice and rhetoric. Whereas Beuys had been a central figure in the post-war European artistic consciousness for some time, American audiences had previously only had partial and fleeting access to his work. In 1980, and building on the scepticism voiced by Belgian artist Marcel Broodthaers, who in 1972 Open Letter had compared Beuys to Wagner, art historian Benjamin Buchloh (who was teaching at Staatliche Kunstakademie, just like Beuys) launched a polemically forceful attack on Beuys. The essay was (and remains) the most vitriolic and thoroughgoing critique of both Beuys's rhetoric (referred to as “simple-minded utopian drivel”) and persona (Buchloh regards Beuys as both infantile and messianic).|$|E

6000|$|... "What I a silly thing Love is," [...] {{said the}} Student {{as he walked}} away. [...] "It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling <b>one</b> of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{are not going to}} happen, and making <b>one</b> believe <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are not true. In fact, it is quite un{{practical}}, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics." ...|$|R

25|$|Then {{the trio}} of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which arrive. They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT, because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him. Their father had last seen Charles Wallace {{when he was a}} baby and Calvin had only just met him. They each give her a gift. Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love. Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God {{choosing}} the foolish of the world to confound the wise, and the weak to defeat the strong (1st Corinthians 1:27-29). Mrs Which tells Meg that she has <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> IT does not have. Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed, Charles Wallace is still there under IT's influence. Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love. She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. Mrs Who, Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth. In the vegetable garden they are reunited with Mrs. Murry and the twins. Mrs Whatsit says that, although she and the others like the spectacle of the family reuniting, they have to go somewhere. Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence, she and the others disappear.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} is best understood and {{is almost always}} broken up into four groups and then looking at how architecture changed or didn’t change within those groups. The four groups are: May, Satunsat, and Ah Canul/Canul and Dzib. These groups make up the urban center, and are almost exclusively monumental architecture. They were defined by the excavation team and they’re essentially just a cluster of buildings, or a building (Madrid, 1991). There’s {{a lot more than}} just these four groups; the rest just hasn’t been excavated really, since there was such a heavy focus on excavating monumental architecture. Most of what’s been excavated at Oxkintok is temples, palaces, and multiroom structures. To trace the changes in architecture of the site, the above chart (Fig. 7) was compiled. It’s a compilation of data from the three sources listed below figure 7. It is evident that there are lots of major changes between the three periods, and in general it's a transition from irregular design to a more elaborate, very planned out geometric design with decoration and complex stucco art and stone wrought decorations. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> remains consistent the use of domes and arches for entryways and open spaces. Concerning the individual groups, there's a concentration of Proto Puuc in the Ah-Canul group and Early Oxkintok in the May group that was later modified in the Proto Puuc phase, but no group is confined to one phase.|$|E
500|$|... "1 Thing" [...] was {{produced}} by Harrison and is built around a sample of The Meters' 1970 version of the theme song from Oh! Calcutta!, [...] "Oh, Calcutta!", written by Stanley Walden. Built around The Meters' funky beat-driven percussion, [...] "1 Thing" [...] finds Amerie lamenting an aspect of a relationship that keeps her satisfied. Even if other factors are less than positive, there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> keeps her hooked ("It's this one thing that's got me trippin'"). Amerie said that {{the inspiration for the}} song came from a conversation she had with Harrison [...] "about relationships and how there's always <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> keeps you attracted to someone. No matter what they do or how they act, there's that one undeniable thing that keeps you coming back." [...] She told Blender that the [...] "one thing" [...] "could be bringing flowers, or something more ... physical. People think I'm just this good girl, but there are other sides they don't see." ...|$|E
