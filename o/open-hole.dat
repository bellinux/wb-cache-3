5000|$|A modern oboe {{with the}} [...] "full conservatoire" [...] ("conservatory" [...] in the US) or Gillet key system has 45 pieces of keywork, with the {{possible}} additions of a third octave key and alternate (left little finger) F- or C-key. The keys are usually made of nickel silver, and are silver- or occasionally gold-plated. Besides the full conservatoire system, oboes are also made using the British thumbplate system. Most have [...] "semi-automatic" [...] octave keys, in which the second-octave action closes the first, and some have a fully automatic octave key system, as used on saxophones. Some full-conservatory oboes have finger holes covered with rings rather than plates ("open-holed"), {{and most of the}} professional models have at least the right-hand third key <b>open-holed.</b> Professional oboes used in the UK and Iceland frequently feature conservatoire system combined with a thumb plate. Releasing the thumb plate has the same effect as pressing down the right-hand index-finger key. This produces alternate options which eliminate the necessity for most of the common cross-intervals (intervals where two or more keys need to be released and pressed down simultaneously), but cross intervals are much more difficult to execute {{in such a way that}} the sound remains clear and continuous throughout the frequency change (a quality also called legato and often called-for in the oboe repertoire).|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} isotope {{data base}} of the NTS groundwaters collected during FY 92 - 93 is presented with preliminary interpretations. Multiple samples were collected from over 30 sites on pumped wells and <b>open-holes</b> by wireline bailing. Field water level measurements indicate essentially a bimodal distribution separated by water levels at higher elevations (e. g. Pahute Mesa) from water levels of lower elevations (e. g. Yucca and Frenchman Flats). Down hole temperature measurements have confirmed anomalous temperature gradients in the eastern Yucca Flat area and on Pahute Mesa, where horizontal temperature gradients up to 0. 33 {degrees}F/ 100 ft are found. Consistent with previous reports by others, the major ion geochemistry of the NTS groundwater are dominated by Na-K-HCO{sub 3 } and Ca-Mg-HCO{sub 3 } water types, where the Na-rich water appears {{to be related to}} dissolution in the volcanic tuffs and the Ca-rich water to the Paleozoic carbonates. Increases in dissolved Si also seems to be indicative of groundwater that resides in the volcanic tuffs. Processes controlling the Na/Ca ratios are complex and may include ion exchange reactions with clays, evaporative concentration in the vadose zone, and lithological heterogeneities in addition to simple differential dissolution between the volcanic tuffs and the Paleozoic carbonates. Apparent {sup 14 }C ages range between 4000 and 38, 000 years for groundwaters at the NTS. The uncertainty is large for exact age determinations at this time. The {sup 14 }C abundance decreases with increased dissolved HCO{sub 3 }, and {sup 13 }C suggests dissolution of the ``dead`` Paleozoic carbonates significantly influence the ages, but more work is needed to investigate the influence of vadose zone carbonate...|$|R

50|$|The Conasauga Shale is a {{shale gas}} reservoir, like the Barnett Shale in Texas. The shale is very hard, and until {{technological}} advancements as have been honed in the exploration and drilling of the Barnett Shale, {{it was too}} costly to extract.

50|$|The {{stitching}} of laminates in the through thickness direction with a {{high strength}} thread has proven a simple, low-cost method for producing 3-D composites. The stitching process basically involves sewing high tensile strength yarn (e.g. glass, carbon or Kevlar®), through an uncured prepreg laminate or dry fabric plies using an industrial sewing machine. Studies report an improvement to in-plane mechanical properties due to stitching, whereas others find unchanged or degraded properties.The data assembled for stitched laminates reveal that the tension, compression, flexure, shear and <b>open-hole</b> strengths are improved or degraded up to 20% by stitching relative to those of unstitched laminates.|$|E

5000|$|Nuclear logging was {{initially}} developed {{to measure the}} natural gamma radiation emitted by underground formations. However, the industry quickly moved to logs that actively bombard rocks with nuclear particles. The gamma ray log, measuring the natural radioactivity, was introduced by Well Surveys Inc. in 1939, and the WSI neutron log came in 1941. The gamma ray log is particularly useful as shale beds which often provide a relatively low permeability cap over hydrocarbon reservoirs usually display {{a higher level of}} gamma radiation. These logs were important because they can be used in cased wells (wells with production casing). WSI quickly became part of Lane-Wells. During World War II, the US Government gave a near wartime monopoly on <b>open-hole</b> logging to Schlumberger, and a monopoly on cased-hole logging to Lane-Wells.

50|$|Mallik, as {{an ongoing}} gas hydrate {{research}} site, is the first fully integrated field study and modern production test well of natural gas hydrates in Canada. The wells were successfully drilled to test a major natural gas hydrate accumulation in the Mackenzie Delta of the northwestern Canadian Arctic. It gave scientists the opportunity to monitor the physical response of gas hydrate deposits and investigate permafrost gas hydrates {{in one of its}} most prominent occurrences.From a technical perspective, the results from the scientific R&D Program in the Mackenzie Delta basin confirmed pre-drill predictions that gas hydrates were present in high-saturation, sand-rich reservoirs. Resultantly, scientists were able to successfully recover wireline cores through the different gas hydrate intervals. Also, experts could carry out cross-hole tomography experiments not only before, but also during and after the actual production tests. During the project, a suite of several different <b>open-hole</b> logs could be obtained by using advanced and new gas hydrate logging tools, giving first insights into the reservoir thickness and general natural gas hydrate saturations. Unfortunately, {{due to a lack of}} pipeline or gathering system, there is currently only one field in the Mackenzie Delta - providing natural gas to the town of Inuvik - and no commercial oil or gas production.|$|E
5000|$|Over a {{timeline}} {{of six years}} - drilling began in December 2001 - three different wells (two observation wells: Mallik 3L-38 and 4L-38, one production test well: Mallik 5L-38) were successfully drilled at the Mallik research site. Field operations included the acquisition of a full suite of <b>open-hole</b> logs, permafrost- and hydrate-bearing continuous core, and cross-hole tomography experiments before, during and after production testing. The wells were drilled vertically {{to a depth of}} 1,160 meters below land surface. Subsequent analysis of the logging data confirmed the existence of a total of approximately 110 meters (360 feet) of combined 50-90% saturated gas hydrate-bearing unconsolidated medium-grained sand reservoir intervals within interbedded sand, sandstone, silt, and siltstone of the Oligocene Kugmallit Sequence [...] The natural gas hydrates in these sand-rich intervals in the Mackenzie Delta region mainly occur as pore-filling material in the sand reservoirs and can also infrequently be observed as coatings around individual sand grains. The gas trapped inside the clathrates is predominantly thermogenic methane that generated due to a thermal alteration of organic material. Given the chemical and carbon-isotope compositions of the organic matter, the organic material is predominantly composed of a variety of higher land plants with a terrestrial origin.|$|E

40|$|Multi-fractured {{horizontal}} wells {{are commonly}} employed {{to improve the}} productivity of low and ultra-low permeability gas reservoirs. However, conventional productivity models for <b>open-hole</b> multi-fractured horizontal wells do not consider the interferences between hydraulic fractures and the <b>open-hole</b> segments, resulting in significant errors in calculation results. In this article, a novel productivity prediction model for gas reservoirs with <b>open-hole</b> multi-fractured horizontal wells was proposed based on complex potential theories, potential superimposition, and numerical analysis. Herein, an <b>open-hole</b> segment between two adjacent fractures was regarded as an equivalent fracture, which was discretized as in cases of artificial fractures. The proposed model was then applied to investigate the effects of various parameters, such as the angle between the fracture and horizontal shaft, fracture quantity, fracture length, diversion capacity of fractures, horizontal well length, and inter-fracture distance, on the productivity of low permeability gas reservoirs with multi-fractured horizontal wells. Simulation results revealed that the quantity, length, and distribution of fractures had significant effects on the productivity of low permeability gas reservoirs while {{the effects of the}} diversion capacity of fractures and the angle between the fracture and horizontal shaft were negligible. Additionally, a U-shaped distribution of fracture lengths was preferential as the quantity of fractures at shaft ends was twice that in the middle area.
