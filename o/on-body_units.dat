40|$|A radio {{frequency}} paging communication {{system that has}} coded vibrotactile outputs suitable for use by deaf-blind people was developed. In concept, the system consists of a base station transmitting and receiving unit and many on-body transmitting and receiving units. The completed system has seven operating modes: fire alarm; time signal; repeated single character Morse code; manual Morse code; emergency aid request; operational status test; and message acknowledge. The <b>on-body</b> <b>units</b> can be addressed in three ways: all units; a group of units; or an individual unit. All the functions developed were integrated into a single package that can be worn on the user's wrist. The control portion of the on-body unit is implemented by a microcomputer. The microcomputer is packaged in a custom-designed hybrid circuit to reduce its physical size...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{approach}} to wearable sensor-based assessment of functional ability (FA) of individuals post stroke. We make use of one <b>on-body</b> inertial measurement <b>unit</b> (IMU) to automate the FA scoring of the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). WMFT is an assessment instrument {{used to determine the}} functional capabilities of individuals post stroke. It comprises of 17 tasks- 15 of which are rated according to performance time and quality of motion. We present signal processing and machine learning tools to estimate the WMFT FA scores of the 15 tasks from IMU data. We treat this as a classification problem in multidimensional feature space and use a supervised learning approach. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Play for Health (P 4 H) is an {{open and}} {{extensible}} telerehabilitation platform. It allows patients to perform rehabilitation exercises {{through a variety of}} videogames and interaction methods. Here, we extend P 4 H to address the training needs of patients with Parkinson's disease. We integrate a network of <b>on-body</b> inertial measurement <b>units.</b> This allows new motion-based interactions in serious games at home, and it is a cornerstone extension allowing P 4 H to now also assess the patient’s movements in daily life. We introduce three new serious games in a virtual world on this platform. The game objectives are designed to be engaging, with automatically adapting challenge levels, and they realize motor-cognitive exercises according to specific therapeutic goals. We present the architecture and technical implementation of this system, including specifics in handling a large number of wireless Bluetooth sensors. We outline the scalability of the platform architecture to eventually handle other pathologies and discuss future technical improvements...|$|R
30|$|In this work, the HAR {{system has}} been mainly trained and tested using the REALDISP Activity Recognition dataset, {{available}} at the UCI Machine Learning Repository [24]. This dataset includes recordings from 17 subjects, seven females and ten males, with ages ranging from 22 to 37  years old. These recording include 13 inertial signals obtained from 9 <b>on-body</b> inertial measurement <b>units</b> located on different body parts. Each unit contains four sensors: an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer and a quaternion sensor. Using these sensors, a 3 D (3 -dimension) linear acceleration, a 3 D angular velocity, a 3 D magnetic field orientation and a 4 D quaternions are sampled every 20  ms (50  Hz sample-rate). The experiment consisted in performing {{a complete set of}} exercises: 33 physical activities, including warm up, fitness and cool down activities (walking, jogging, cycling, jumping, etc.). One run-through of the exercises lasted 15 – 20  min. Each session was preceded by a preparation phase lasting around 30  min. This dataset also includes a Null-activity. This label has been assigned to other activities (different from the 33 activities considered in this study), and also, the transitions between activities.|$|R
