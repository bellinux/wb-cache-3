Tanker captain Seok Hae-gyun changed the ship's course to keep in international waters as long as possible. The pirates eventually seized the tanker and used it as a base from which to launch attacks on other ships. The South Korean <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> the Samho Shipping Company, was facing huge losses because it was obligated to continue paying Norwegian investors under its charter even while the vessel was held by pirates. However, the Norwegian government had no military presence in the area at the time. Eight South Koreans, eleven Burmese, and two Indonesians were among the 21 crewmembers being held hostage.|$|E

2500|$|The Company {{warehouse}} near Wilford Street, Nottingham, {{was destroyed}} on 28 September 1818 by an explosion, {{which resulted in}} two men dying. The Nottingham Boat Company had delivered 21 barrels of gunpowder, and a man named Musson noticed that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powder had leaked from a barrel. He rather foolishly dropped a hot cinder onto the powder, which caused it all to explode. He was thrown some [...] by the blast. Several boats were destroyed and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding buildings were damaged. When the insurance company refused {{to pay for the}} damage, the canal company sued the boat company, and were awarded £1000, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal costs, but they could not pay, and the claim was dropped in 1828. In January 1826, the company prosecuted Hooton and Bradshaw for running a steam packet boat, which was forbidden by a regulation passed the previous May. However, <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> protested, and <b>the</b> company changed their policy in May 1826, so that steam boats could be run at their discretion.|$|R
40|$|Research vessels (RVs) {{are complex}} and costly {{platforms}} for data collection and data handling in marine science.

50|$|Meanwhile, Major Dunya {{delivers}} a large container to Captain Richter, <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cargo <b>vessel</b> Aurora. He has apparently been smuggling artifacts stolen by the Iron Bears, but this crate {{is larger than}} normal. He attempts to scan it, but the container is shielded against scanning. Richter is called away to a meeting with Rykov by a security guard, Lloyd, shortly before liftoff. The crate is knocked over and opened when the ship is bumped during the refueling process, revealing the Egg within. The Egg opens and the player-controlled Facehugger emerges. The Facehugger leaves the ship {{through a series of}} umbilical ductworks and begins to track an irritable guard, Cisco, through the POC. When Cisco retires to his quarters for a nap, the Facehugger springs on him and infects him.|$|R
50|$|Requests for waivers certain {{provisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> act {{are reviewed}} by the United States Maritime Administration {{on a case by}} case basis. Waivers have been granted for example, in cases of national emergencies or in cases of strategic interest. For instance, declining oil production prompted MARAD to grant a waiver to <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 512-foot Chinese <b>vessel</b> Tai An Kou to tow an oil rig from <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico to Alaska. The jackup rig will be under a two-year contract to drill in the Alaska's Cook Inlet Basin.

5000|$|Sørlandet {{was damaged}} during World War II {{and served as}} an {{accommodation}} vessel for German submariners. She was restored and ready to sail in 1948. In 1958 she was equipped with an engine. In 1974 {{she was no longer}} used as a public training vessel and was sold to ship owner Staubo. She was registered in Arendal and laid up at anchor in Kilsund for three years. She deteriorated considerably during that time. In 1977 ship owner Skjelbred returned her to the city of Kristiansand. In 1981 a foundation was established; [...] "Stiftelsen Fullriggeren Sørlandet" [...] has been the owner and <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> since. From 1980 to 1983 Sørlandet was the only operating Norwegian sail training ship, and the first open to men and women of all ages and nationalities. Sørlandet crossed the Atlantic four times in 1981.

50|$|An ongoing {{downturn}} in the container shipping industry which began in 2013, and that was caused by {{various factors such as}} weak global GDP, muted demand for container shipping, sluggish global trade, and vessel overcapacity left the container shipping market crippled. The slump has precipitated a wave of mergers and acquisitions coupled with reshuffled vessel sharing alliances as container lines scramble to stay financially viable. Consequently; due to the decline in the industry, CSCL's parent China Shipping Group entered advanced merger talks with its larger government-owned compatriot, the COSCO Group in October 2015. By late December 2015, the two announced a formal merger after regulatory and anti-trust approval. The integration plan stipulated that CSCL will withdraw its involvement in the container shipping business and cease to operate as a carrier; instead it is destined to become a container leasing and financial-asset management company. Meanwhile, COSCO Group's container shipping division; COSCO Container Lines (renamed COSCO Shipping Lines), is expected to take over as the sole <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> fleet. Furthermore, as part of the reconfiguration plan, the CSCL brand was abandoned and renamed as COSCO Shipping Development in an effort to align the company with its new identity in the merged mega-entity.|$|E

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 1500 commercial tour boat operators in Australia {{with a combined}} fleet of approximately 3800 <b>vessels</b> – <b>the</b> majority offer marine fishing, sailing or diving tours. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fishing tour boat operators employ fewer staff and use smaller <b>vessels</b> than <b>the</b> dive and sail tour boat <b>operators.</b> Proportionately more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> used by sail and dive tour boat operators have basic environmental management measures such as ashtrays and garbage bins to reduce overboard littering, and sewage holding tanks with pump-out systems to reduce <b>the</b> impacts <b>of</b> human waste. In addition, more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail and dive tour boat operators claim {{to be aware of}} their boat's environmental impacts and also claim to take steps to reduce or remediate them, including <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> environmental management guidelines. These differences in environmental management measures, however, are associated principally with patterns in vessel size, which affects both the practical and regulatory requirements. In addition, more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dive tour boat operators operate in marine protected areas (MPAs) where regulations are quite often more stringent. Once these factors are allowed for, environmental management of boating related impacts by individual fishing tour boat operators is not significantly worse than by sail or dive tour boat operators. Overall the attempts to reduce environmental impacts are part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broader thrust to improve sustainability by ecologically modernising the industry. In this regard, there appears to be significant scope for improvement within the Australian tour boat industry in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> ensuring that their vessels have garbage bins and ashtrays on board, that such items are clearly labelled and that clients are both advised of their location(s) and the need for their use and especially by clearly advising their clients not to throw items overboard (particularly cigarette butts).

40|$|Full-scale {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} the Polar Supply and Research Vessel, the S. A. Agulhas II during ice-trials in the Baltic Sea. Ice loads on the ship hull and propulsion system were measured concurrently with ice-thickness and whole-body vibration comfort for controlled maneuvers in a level ice field. These {{measurements were}} aimed at establishing the links between ice-properties, hull- and shaft loads and the vibration feedback received by the <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> Results indicate that maneuvers significantly increase the frequency and magnitude of ice loads at the stern shoulder area {{as well as the}} ice impacts on the propellers. The number of ice impacts on the instrumented port side shaft line increased for turning maneuvers in a starboard direction. Occupants on the Bridge did not receive feedback through vibration transmission from ice impacts on the hull as a time-history of discrete events. Instead, ice passage excites the global bending modes of the vessel. Blade impacts between ice debris and the propellers are however perceivably transmitted to vessel operators. Although vibration exposure on the bridge is increased by operations in ice subjective experiences of vibration did not reach levels that caused discomfort...|$|E
