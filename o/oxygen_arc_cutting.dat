40|$|<b>Oxygen</b> plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> {{is widely}} {{employed}} in various industrial fields. In {{the case of}} cutting magnetized plates, the magnetic field is concentrated around the cutting front as cutting progresses, and the electromagnetic force induced by the leakage of magnetic field deflects the plasma jet. The deflected plasma jet leads to poor cutting quality and sometime causes damage to the electrode and nozzle because of double arc abnormal discharge. This phenomenon is called magnetic arc blow, {{and it is a}} critical issue when applying plasma cutting on magnetized plates. In this study, magnetic arc blow behavior is investigated, and a method to prevent it is devised. We examined the relationship between operating conditions and the double arc using external magnetic fields on a plasma jet. We found criteria regarding operation conditions that induce arc blow. In addition, we succeeded in suppressing the double arc caused by the leakage external magnetic field by using a magnetic shield cap composed of ferromagnetic material around the nozzle...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} influence of the nozzle geometry on the physical properties of a <b>cutting</b> <b>arc</b> is reported. Ion current signals collected by an electrostatic probe sweeping across a 30 A <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>arc</b> at 3. 5 mm from the nozzle exit were registered for different nozzle lengths. The temperature and density radial profiles of the arc plasma were found in each case by an inversion procedure of these signals. A comparison between the obtained results shows that the shorter nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, L N = 4. 5 mm operated at 0. 7 MPa and 35 Nl/min) produces a thinner and hotter arc than the larger nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, LN = 9. 0 mm operated at 1. 1 MPa and 20 Nl/min). This behavior is attributed to the marked difference of gas flow rate due to the clogging effect. A smaller gas mass flow reduces the convective cooling at the arc border and decreases the power dissipation of the arc column, resulting in small axis temperatures. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

40|$|Abstract—Industrial surveys {{shows that}} {{manufacturing}} companies define {{the qualities of}} thermal removing process based on the dimension and physical appearance of the cutting material surface. Therefore, the roughness of the surface area of the material cut by the plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> process {{and the rate of}} the removed material by the manual plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> machine was importantly considered. Plasma arc cutter Selco Genesis 90 was used to cut Standard AISI 1017 Steel of 200 mm x 100 mm x 6 mm manually based on the selected parameters setting. The material removal rate (MRR) was measured by determining the weight of the specimens before and after the cutting process. The surface roughness (SR) analysis was conducted using Mitutoyo CS- 3100 to determine the average roughness value (Ra). Taguchi method was utilized to achieve optimum condition for both outputs studied. The microstructure analysis in the region of the cutting surface is performed using SEM.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 1999 The {{simulation}} of Plasma Arc Cutting {{is presented in}} this study. The plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> process employs a plasma torch with a very narrow bore to produce a transferred arc to the workpiece. A technique for modelling plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> has been developed by applying the thermo-metallurgical model to the process and integrating a model of material removal to this model. The model is solved using the finite element method using the FE package SYSWORLD, more specifically SYSWELD. The objective {{is to determine the}} minimum energy required to cut a plate of some thickness using this virtual model. The characteristics of the cut need to exhibit the characteristics of a "high quality cut". The model presented can predict the kerf size given certain process variable settings. The numerical results obtained are assessed by conducting experiments. By maintaining Ill 1 rumum energy input cost savings can be made through energy savings, limiting additional finishing processes and reducing expense of shortening the electrode and nozzle lifetimes. The modelling of the PAC process using virtual design techniques provides a cost-effective solution to the manufacturing industries with respect to process specification development.

The process of cutting metal with a plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> tool is investigated and discussed. Focus {{is on the}} metal cutting process at the inside surface of the kerf. This is an important region that is not well documented due {{to the difficulty of}} experiments and the complexity of computation needed to characterize this process. In the present work, a three-dimensional numerical simulation using a plasma model combined with a melting process model is conducted and results are discussed, leading {{to a better understanding of}} the physical phenomena within the kerf region of a commercial plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> tool. The modeling includes three different phenomena: 1) the plasma jet flow, 2) the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method in identify the gas to molten metal interface, and 3) the phase change model for computing the melting process. The model is implemented in the open source CFD software, OpenFOAM. Thermodynamic and transport properties, calculated by kinetic theory of gases and statistical mechanics, are implemented for accurate simulation in the high temperature regions. The simulation results show the transient cutting process including the physical phenomena for melting of the work piece as well as the plasma flow. The simulated kerf shape is compared to measured kerf under same operations. Additionally, the temperature, velocity, and current density distributions are discussed to understand the plasma characteristics during the cutting process. In an attempt to make a more reasonable kerf shape, the swirl component of the jet, the surface tension and the phase change model are investigated for improvement and discussed. Effects of metal vapor and oxidation reaction are also discussed. This work is a first attempt simulation of the plasma flow, melting, and molten metal flow in the plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> process.

40|$|Many {{manufacturers}} who cut metal use plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> as part {{of their}} manufacturing process. Plasma cutters use electricity and pressurized gas to produce a temperature of up to 50, 000 ºF at the cutting tip. These plasma cutters can rapidly cut through metals as much as 12 inches thick. The use of computer numerical controlled (CNC) plasma cutters allow manufacturers to rapidly cut even very intricate and detailed flat parts. This process is a tremendous improvement over traditional torch cutting, saw cutting, or other machining processes for producing near net shapes. It is faster and less expensive than most of the alternative processes available. There are several processing and quality factors that must be addressed when using a plasma cutter. The most common problem with plasma cutting is the formation of dross (resolidified metal) on the cut edge. The formation of dross on plasma-cut parts creates several problems in the manufacturing process. By carefully controlling the operating parameters, the formation of dross on the work piece can be minimized, which greatly increases the quality of the part and the efficiency of the production process. Efficient operation of a CNC plasma cutter to minimize the formation of dross requires controlling several variables in the process. These variables include: material type and thickness, <b>arc</b> current (amperage), <b>cutting</b> speed, cutting-gas pressure, cutting tip size, and the gap between the cutting tip and the work piece. Experience with plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> and research on the subject reveals that the variables that most affect the formation of dross are <b>arc</b> current, <b>cutting</b> speed, material thickness, and nozzle size. A study involving these four variables will be performed to determine the optimum setup for the CNC plasma cutter to minimize the formation of dross. Michael E.
