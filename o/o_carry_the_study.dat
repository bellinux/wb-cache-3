30|$|Aliquots of {{an initial}} 2 -mM emodin {{solution}} in MeOH were diluted to obtain different concentrations to load in PSi layers and get several samples to analyze. The sample I (Em/Ag/MeOH) contained the drug adsorbed on AgNPs surface using MeOH as solvent. Silver colloid, freshly prepared, was centrifuged and the NPs redispersed in MeOH; subsequently, aliquot of initial emodin solution {{was added to}} get 0.2 [*]mM final concentration. Sample II (Em/Ag/H 2 <b>O)</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> drug adsorbed on silver NPs using water as solvent. The final drug concentration {{was the same as}} in sample I (Em/Ag/MeOH). Sample III (Em-BSA/Ag/H 2 O) included the drug bound to protein albumin forming BSA-emodin complexes. A solid BSA was solved on fresh silver colloid; afterwards, aliquot of emodin initial solution was added. Final protein and drug concentrations were 0 and 0.2 [*]mM. Lastly, sample IV (Em/MeOH) was obtained by loading a 0.2 [*]mM solution of emodin in MeOH in absence of AgNPs. Reference samples, named sample-ref I (Ag/MeOH), sample-ref II (Ag/H 2 O), and sample-ref III (BSA/Ag/H 2 O), were prepared following the same procedure as samples I, II, and III without including emodin. Wafers were transversally cut in order to analyze the corresponding cross-sections.|$|R

40|$|We report {{results from}} a study of nitric oxide {{nightglow}} over the northern hemisphere of Mars during winter and southern hemisphere during equinox. We present observations of the nitric oxide δ and γ band emissions between 190 and 270 nm by the Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph on the MAVEN spacecraft. The emission reveals recombination of N and O atoms dissociated on the dayside of Mars, and is known to trace upper atmosphere hemispheric circulation patterns. We extend previous studies to higher latitudes, finding brighter emissions closer to the poles as predicted from global circulation models. Statistically significant variability suggests variation of the fluxes of N and <b>O</b> <b>carried</b> from <b>the</b> dayside thermosphere, as well as possible variations of the wind pattern in the nightside thermosphere and mesosphere...|$|R
