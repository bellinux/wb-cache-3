They undertook to form a general government, which should stand on a new basis; not a confederacy, not a league, not a compact between States, but a Constitution; a popular government, founded in popular election, directly responsible to the people themselves, and divided into branches with prescribed limits of power, and prescribed duties. They ordained such a government, they gave it the name of a Constitution, therein they established a distribution of powers between this, their general government, and their several State governments.|$|E

40|$|Summary: This {{statistical}} indicators paper {{identifies the}} recent {{trends in the}} value, sales and acquisitions of NSW public sector assets, at a whole of government, and individual department and public sector corporation level (selected by order of asset value for the 2012 - 13 financial year). As a preliminary to that discussion, the paper also presents recent trends in the State Budget position. The data {{presented in this paper}} illustrates that real value of NSW public sector assets has increased consistently in the last decade or so. This has been driven predominantly by the revaluation of non-financial assets such as land and property, and also non-financial asset purchases. This growth has not been consistent across all NSW public sector organisations. Of those presented in this paper, it is evident that public trading enterprises with a high composition of land and property assets (such as the NSW Land and Housing Corporation) have experienced considerably higher real net asset value growth than <b>other</b> <b>general</b> <b>government</b> organisations (which are comprised of a higher proportion of operational assets subject to depreciation) ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the feasibility {{and consequences of}} taking three actions: privatizing deposit insurance, establishing a voluntary deposit insurance system for deposits {{in excess of the}} maximum amount of FDIC insurance, and increasing the limit on deposit insurance coverage for municipalities and <b>other</b> units of <b>general</b> <b>government.</b> As a result of the study, the FDIC does not recommend privatizing deposit insurance, providing a voluntary deposit insurance system for deposits above the maximum amount of FDIC insurance, or increasing the limit on municipal deposits. The study begins by reviewing arguments made by the proponents of privatizing deposit insurance and concludes, first, that privatization will not result in the elimination of moral hazard since moral hazard is an effect of all types of insurance. Further, recent regulatory and statutory improvements in federal banking law have given the FDIC better tools to control moral hazard. Second, much of the regulatory burden on banks is unrelated to deposit insurance and will not go away with privatization. Third, privatization would not remove the taxpayer from ultimate responsibility for losses arising from a systemic crisis. Government intervention in a systemic failure—to prevent broader problems—is really an economic issue, not a deposit insurance issue...|$|R
40|$|Theoretically, {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) contributions and benefits act in tandem {{to serve as}} counterbalances to {{the direction of the}} economy. Government transfers to households to cover costs related to unemployment are usually the principal source of automatic fluctuation in government expenditure. This article investigates the interaction between such transfers and economic performance with the South African economy as a case study. The main finding is that UI contributions destabilised economic activity most of the time, but that the stabilising effect resulting from UI benefits was sufficient to offset these destabilising effects so that the UI balance acted as an automatic fiscal stabiliser over the period 1970 to 2000. The article points out that although UI benefits demonstrate countercyclical properties, the same could not be said with confidence about <b>other</b> components of <b>general</b> <b>government</b> expenditure in South Africa. Furthermore, the stabilising effect of the South African Unemployment Insurance Fund can be expected to be relatively insignificant due to its small share in the total public finances. However, the possible psychological benefits of the UI system and the evidence provided in this paper emphasise the potential of the Unemployment Insurance Fund as an effective automatic fiscal stabiliser also in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|The school {{district}} is {{a staple of}} American law. As the local government tasked with controlling our public schools, the {{school district}} is so well-entrenched that lawmakers and commentators ignore its uniqueness as a legal institution. The school district is peculiar to American law, {{and it is a}} peculiarity within American law. General purpose governments—cities and counties—are the local governments controlling schools outside the United States. In the United States itself, these governments control almost all other major local functions. But they do not control education here. Why? Why does American law rely on a separate local government for the provision of education? This Article tackles this fundamental—yet heretofore largely neglected—historical and normative question. It offers a legal history of the school district, tracing its roots to colonial Massachusetts and chronicling its consolidation and spread through successive centuries. This exploration demonstrates that the school district was adopted as an expedient solution to varied practical problems presented by the unique patterns of early settlement that prevailed in different places and times in American history. Yet the historical investigation additionally shows that at distinct periods lawmakers, commentators, and activists also asserted substantive arguments, of potentially enduring relevance, for the school district’s embrace. These actors ascribed to the school district a capacity to outperform <b>other,</b> <b>general</b> purpose, local <b>governments</b> in promoting certain core values. Those normative values included citizen participation, community building, school improvement through expert management, and stable school funding. Unfortunately, due to modern legal, economic, and social developments, the current school district fails to serve any of these values that were at times attributed to its antecedents; worse, the contemporary school district often undermines them. Accordingly, the Article concludes that state lawmakers should consider abolishing the school district and bestowing control over schools on <b>general</b> <b>governments...</b>|$|R
