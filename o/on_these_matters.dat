5|$|Canon William Lummis, MC, was a {{military}} historian who built up an archive on the service records and final resting places of Victoria Cross holders. This was then summarised into a pamphlet which was taken to be an authoritative source <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters.</b> However, Lummis was aware of short-comings in his work and encouraged David Harvey to continue it. The result was Harvey's seminal book Monuments to Courage. In 2007 the Royal Mail used material from Lummis' archives to produce a collection of stamps commemorating Victoria Cross recipients.|$|E
5|$|The early {{plays of}} Henry Fielding mark the {{beginning}} of Fielding's literary career. His early plays span the time period from his first production in 1728 to {{the beginning of}} the Actor's Rebellion of 1733, a strife within the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane that divided the theatrical community and threatened to disrupt London stage performances. These plays introduce Fielding's take on politics, gender, and morality and serve as an early basis for how Fielding develops his ideas <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters</b> throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Leopold and Wolfgang arrived back in Salzburg {{the court was}} thrown into turmoil {{by the death of}} Archbishop Schrattenbach. This created {{problems}} for Leopold, who had unresolved issues with the court. Part of his salary during the second Italian visit had been stopped, and Leopold wished to petition for its payment, and to pursue the matter of Wolfgang's salary as a Konzertmeister, which Schrattenbach had indicated might be paid on Wolfgang's return from the first Italian journey. There was also the matter of succession to the post of Salzburg's Kapellmeister, to be available soon on the pending retirement of the incumbent, Giuseppe Lolli, who was over 70 years old; Leopold, who had followed Lolli as Vice-Kapellmeister, might normally have felt confident of succeeding him to the higher post. Decisions <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters</b> would now be made by the new archbishop, whose policies and attitudes were unknown.|$|E

25|$|Later Greek historians {{consider}} Democritus to {{have established}} aesthetics {{as a subject}} of investigation and study, as he wrote theoretically on poetry and fine art long before authors such as Aristotle. Specifically, Thrasyllus identified six works in the philosopher's oeuvre which had belonged to aesthetics as a discipline, but only fragments of the relevant works are extant; hence of all Democritus's writings <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters,</b> {{only a small percentage}} of his thoughts and ideas can be known.|$|E

25|$|Italian {{painting}} after 1520, {{with the}} notable exception {{of the art of}} Venice, developed into Mannerism, a highly sophisticated style, striving for effect, that concerned many churchman as lacking appeal for the mass of the population. Church pressure to restrain religious imagery affected art from the 1530s and resulted in the decrees of the final session of the Council of Trent in 1563 including short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, which were to have great impact on the development of Catholic art. Previous Catholic Church councils had rarely felt the need to pronounce <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters,</b> unlike Orthodox ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, for example, the moetzes {{issued a}} written ruling forbidding Orthodox rabbis {{to join with}} any Reform or Conservative rabbis in rabbinical {{communal}} professional organizations that then united the various branches of America's Jews, such as the Synagogue Council of America. This position was not endorsed by the Modern Orthodox. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik of Yeshiva University had initially aligned himself with Agudah, but later established his independent views <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters</b> {{and a host of}} other issues, such as attitudes towards college education and attitudes towards the secular-led Israeli governments. Rabbi Soloveitchik felt it important to nurture the modern Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America (RCA).

25|$|The poem {{is written}} in the first person, and is the soliloquy {{of a young woman}} contemplating life and death, {{engagement}} and withdrawal, love and estrangement, in a setting dominated by the sea, the sky, stars, rocky cliffs, and the rising sun. However, it is also possible to read the poem as an allegory on the way fate moves human affairs or as an attempt to comprehend the horrific violence in Europe {{at the time of the}} poem's composition. The poem is not about World War I, but it does try to address the relationships between destruction and beauty, and, in this sense, it resonates with ancient Greek meditations <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>matters,</b> especially in the plays of Sophocles and Aeschylus. There are, therefore, evident links with le Cimetière marin, which is also a seaside meditation on comparably large themes.|$|E

The Court demanded a high standard of advocacy and acquired a reputation for overturning decisions made by the state supreme courts, and the justices' travelling expenses were cut by Sir Josiah Symon, Attorney General in the short-lived Reid government, in December 1904. O'Connor argued that abolishing tipstaves was a more efficient way of dealing with the Court's increasing expenses and no decision was reached until Isaac Isaacs, taking office with the expansion of the Court in July 1906, was able to broker a compromise.|$|E
