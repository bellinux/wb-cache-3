5|$|As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was {{instrumental}} in turning French policy away from the Gaullist policy of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy of integrating Germany into a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence. Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality of states (international democracy), not the power politics <b>of</b> <b>domination.</b>|$|E

She testified at a Meese Commission hearing on pornography, while Attorney General Edwin Meese was serving socially conservative President Reagan. She had a political discourse with National Review writer David Frum and their spouses arranged by Christopher Hitchens.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the office of Governor is largely one of long periods <b>of</b> <b>domination</b> by a single party, though {{different}} parties were predominant in different eras. Federalists were rare among Kentuckians during the period of the First Party System, and Democratic Republicans won every gubernatorial election in the state until 1828. The Second Party System began when the Democratic-Republicans split into Jacksonian Democrats (the predecessor of the modern Democratic Party) and National Republicans (later to become Whigs). Beginning with the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828, the Whigs dominated the governorship until 1851, with John Breathitt being the only Democrat elected during that period.|$|E
5000|$|Decolonization {{is largely}} {{political}} and historical: {{the end of}} the period <b>of</b> territorial <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> lands primarily in the global south by European powers. Coloniality is in fact the substance of the historical period of colonization—its social constructions, imaginaries, practices, hierarchies, and violence. This substance manifested throughout the world and determined the socioeconomic, racial, and epistemological value systems of contemporary society, commonly called “modern” society. Coloniality did not disappear with decolonization: the nineteenth century end <b>of</b> territorial <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> the Americas by Iberian nations, or the twentieth century end <b>of</b> territorial <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> Asia and Africa by other European nations.|$|R

5|$|The {{island has}} been {{occupied}} since the Mesolithic period, {{and its history}} includes a time of Norse rule and a long period <b>of</b> <b>domination</b> by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald. The 18th century Jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms, some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands. Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century. Skye's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001. About {{a third of the}} residents were Gaelic speakers in 2001, and although their numbers are in decline, this aspect of island culture remains important.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Cambodian empire {{had been}} in decline and Vietnamese people {{migrated}} south into the Mekong Delta, which was had previously been Khmer territory. Furthermore, Cambodia had been periodically invaded by both Vietnam and Siam. Cambodia lurched uneasily between both poles <b>of</b> <b>domination</b> as dictated by the internal strife of her two larger neighbors. In 1796, Ang Eng, a pro-Siamese king had died, leaving Ang Chan, {{who was born in}} 1791. When Gia Long unified Vietnam, Eng was given investiture by Siam in order to hold out Vietnamese influence, but in 1803, a Cambodian mission paid tribute to Vietnam in attempt to placate Gia Long, something that became an annual routine. In 1807, Ang Chan requested formal investiture as a vassal of Gia Long. Gia Long responded by sending an ambassador bearing the book of investiture, together with a seal of gilded silver. In 1812, Ang Chan refused a request from his brother Ang Snguon to share power, leading to a rebellion. Siam sent troops to support the rebel prince, hoping to enthrone him and wrest influence from Gia Long over Cambodia. In 1813, Gia Long responded by sending a large military contingent that forced the Siamese and Ang Snguon out of Cambodia. As a result, a Vietnamese garrison was permanently installed in the citadel at Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital. Thereafter, Siam made no attempts to regain control of Cambodia during Gia Long's rule.|$|E

25|$|The {{incorporation}} of ancient concepts and {{racial and cultural}} assumptions into modern imperial ideology bolstered colonial claims to supremacy and right to colonize non-Europeans. Because of these numerous ramifications between ancient representations and modern colonial rhetoric, 19th century’s colonialist discourse acquires a “multi-layered” or “palimpsestic” structure. It forms a “historical, ideological and narcissistic continuum,” in which modern theories <b>of</b> <b>domination</b> feed upon and blend with “ancient myths of supremacy and grandeur”.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 16th century, Mapuche-speaking agriculturalists {{penetrated}} the western Andes and from there across into the eastern plains and down to the far south.

The Mapuche model <b>of</b> <b>domination</b> through technological superiority and armed confrontation was later repeated as Europeans implemented a succeeding but conceptually identical cycle, essentially replacing the position of the former dominators with a new, albeit predominately European class.|$|E

The polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing further administrative integration.|$|E
