5000|$|The Geography of the OceansIn 1881, Williams’ seminal book The Geography <b>of</b> the <b>Oceans</b> was published. The Geography <b>of</b> the <b>Oceans</b> {{focuses on}} topics such as: General Geography <b>of</b> the <b>Oceans,</b> Physical Geography <b>of</b> the <b>Oceans,</b> the Geography <b>of</b> Particular <b>Oceans.</b> The various {{sections}} focus on: {{the distribution of}} land and water, oceanic river-systems, the salts of the sea, the density, color and phosphorescence of the sea, distribution of marine life, temperature <b>of</b> the <b>ocean,</b> movements <b>of</b> the <b>ocean,</b> sidereal movements or tides, of the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Antarctic and the Arctic Ocean. It was the first book to cover with such intensity the geography <b>of</b> the <b>oceans.</b> ‘A valuable little book entitled The Geography <b>of</b> the <b>Oceans,</b> which may be regarded almost as a new departure in geographical science,’ claimed the book reviewer in The Cornish Telegraph, who continued, [...] ‘I have found the book as fascinating as one of Jules Verne’s novels.’ The Daily Gazette called it, ‘A new geographical work of great importance.’ ...|$|R

Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street. The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street. Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare <b>of</b> <b>Ocean</b> City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that street was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Ocean {{circulation}} patterns have {{a strong}} influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns <b>of</b> <b>ocean</b> currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Ten per cent of the world's population—about 600 million people—live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.|$|E
5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range <b>of</b> <b>ocean</b> habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making {{it difficult for them to}} feed and breathe. The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.|$|E
5|$|The Minerals Management Service (renamed on 18 June 2010 to the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Ocean</b> Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Ocean</b> Energy (BOE)) is the {{regulatory}} and inspecting body for {{offshore oil drilling}} and rigs in the United States of America. According to an Associated Press investigation, certain safety documentation and emergency procedure information, including documentation for the exact incident that later occurred, was absent. The exact number of required monthly inspections performed varied over time; the inspections were carried out as required for the first 40 months, but after that around 25% of inspections were omitted, although the investigation notes this is partly expected, since there are circumstances such as weather and movement which preclude an inspection. Reports {{of the last three}} inspections for 2010 were provided under Freedom of Information legislation. Each of these inspections had taken two hours or less.|$|E

5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern Hemisphere) to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere {{are more likely to}} migrate. This is because there is a large area <b>of</b> <b>ocean</b> in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E
5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area <b>of</b> <b>ocean,</b> sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E
