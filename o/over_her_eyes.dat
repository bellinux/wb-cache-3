500|$|The ermine mantle {{was removed}} and Anne lifted off her headdress, tucking her hair under a coif. After a brief {{farewell}} to her weeping ladies and {{a request for}} prayers, she kneeled down {{and one of her}} ladies tied a blindfold <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She knelt upright, in the French style of executions. Her final prayer consisted of her repeating continually, [...] "Jesu receive my soul; O Lord God have pity on my soul." ...|$|E
500|$|According to her account, Lhermitte {{then told}} {{daughter}} Myriam {{that she had}} a surprise for her in the office. When Myriam entered the office, Lhermitte told her to sit on a chair and wear a blue handkerchief <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Once Myriam was seated, Lhermitte took a marble plaque she found nearby and smashed it over Myriam's head, and then cut her throat. Nora, who was allegedly Dr. Schaar's favorite goddaughter, was asked to sit in a chair while Lhermitte slit her throat from behind.

500|$|Running {{eight minutes}} {{longer than any}} in the series, the episode was also the most {{technical}} and complex. Whedon, who has stated {{this is one of}} his favorite Buffy episodes, used a widescreen letterbox format for filming (the only episode in the series to get this treatment), different lighting to bring out the sets more vibrantly, and long takes for shooting—including a complicated shot with a full conversation, a song, and two choreographed dances that took 21 attempts to get right. These were designed to give viewers all the clues they needed to establish all the nuances of the relationships between characters. Davies commented that the intricacies of filming this episode were [...] "infinitely more complicated than a regular Buffy" [...] episode, and Whedon stated in the DVD commentary that he was ambitious to prove what television is capable of, saying [...] "it just depends how much you care". UPN, the television network that aired Buffys last two seasons, promoted the episode by displaying Gellar's face on billboards with music notes <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and held a special premiere event. Network president Dean Valentine remarked he thought it was [...] "one of the best episodes of television I ever saw in my life".|$|E

5000|$|As a {{host for}} the Phoenix Force, Rachel {{manifested}} the cosmic firebird in displays of great power. During her 2000s Uncanny X-Men appearances, Marvel Girl also exhibited a Phoenix emblem <b>over</b> <b>her</b> left <b>eye</b> whenever she demonstrated psionic feats. It {{was at first}} accompanied by a [...] "shadow form" [...] (similar to the one Jean Grey manifested when she absorbed the telepathic powers of Psylocke). However, the illustration of this shadow form ceased without explanation. After regaining {{a small portion of}} the Phoenix Force (echo), the emblem <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> changed from a gold Phoenix shape to a static version made of electric blue flame. Her display of power was once more altered in X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #3, where she produced the familiar fiery raptor with which the Phoenix Force is commonly associated (see profile image).|$|R
