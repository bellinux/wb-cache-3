5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E

25|$|What {{is perhaps}} the most {{debatable}} characteristic of this collage/montage form is the question of what is added to the message or content of the poem by using a more fragmented view.

25|$|The {{remnants}} of Mycenaean pottery allow archaeologists {{to date the}} site they have excavated.

Furthermore, with the extraction of pottery, historians can determine the different classes of people depending on where the pottery shards were taken from. Due to the large amount of trading the Mycenae people did, tracking whom they traded with can determine the extent of their power and influence in their society and others. Historians then can learn the importance <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> Mycenae people were, where pottery mainly comes from, who was reigning at that time and the different economic standards.|$|E

25|$|Because {{healing is}} Ultima's mission, Antonio's {{relationship}} with her includes accompanying her to gather the curative herbs she knows about through tradition and spiritual revelation. With her Antonio visits the sick and begins to grasp a connection between healing and nature even though he never receives an explicit scientific or grounded explanation for how she foretells future occurrences, heals the infirm, combats witches through casting spells, or when and why she decides not to intervene. Ultima's indigenous and experiential pedagogy allows Antonio to intuit that her approach to healing includes a sense <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> afflicted person is, what s/he believes, knowledge of the healing powers of her herbs, {{and the limits of}} her power. He learns through assisting Ultima in the cure of his uncle that healing requires making himself vulnerable to sickness and to the spiritual as well as physical needs of the sick. With Antonio, Ultima's relationship as healer is also one of teacher. Cynthia Park considers the relationship between those two roles, and abstracts a set of life-giving principles that form the basis for Ultima's way of knowing.|$|E
25|$|While {{the game}} changed names, {{platforms}} and eventually directors, Nomura worked with new director Hajime Tabata {{to ensure that}} Noctis remained as unchanged {{as possible in the}} final product. Alterations and adjustments made to his character model were supervised by Naora. The main goal was to make Noctis appear more realistic: his skin texture was enhanced and subtleties added to its depiction and the effect of different lighting on it, in addition to adding elements such as subtle birthmarks and skin blotches. One of the major goals was keeping the same character impression while making adjustments and enhancements, as series fans already had a concept <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> character was. His hair's shadow effects needed to be adjusted after the upgrade in technology so they did not cast too much shade on his face, but the hairstyle itself was kept consistent. His hairstyle was meant to give two impressions to the player: from the front it was ordered, while from the rear it looked wild. In order to make his hair movements realistic, the team worked with a professional hairstylist to create the design using a mannequin's wig, then used the Luminous Studio engine to render it in real-time. The technique was originally used for the characters in the engine's 2012 tech demo Agni's Philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Express trusts {{are those}} {{expressly}} declared by the settlor. Typically, {{this will be}} intended to create a trust, but there can be situations in which the settlor's intended actions create a trust accidentally, as in Paul v Constance. The creation of express trusts must involve four elements for the trust to be valid. These are capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity refers to the donor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. These are that the trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees. For chattels, this can simply be handing the property to them, while transfers of land and shares must be done in writing following certain prescribed forms.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{has been}} the object of both {{scholarly}} and popular attention, and its discovery {{was reported in the}} international media. [...] Scholars have tended to be critical of the literary value of the poem, but consider it valuable as a historical source. [...] Much of the scholarship on the poem has focused on the question <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> speaker and the addressee in the poem are, and whether Charaxos and Larichos are the historical or fictional brothers of Sappho. [...] Others have discussed the place of the Brothers Poem in the corpus of Sappho's poetry, and its links with Greek epic, particularly the homecoming stories told in the Odyssey. [...] The lost initial stanza or stanzas of the poem have also been the subject of scholarly attention, with various reconstructions being put forward.|$|E

Shenton explained that the stalker had a key to Mitzeee's flat and had been watching her every move, and said that [...] "not only has the stalker come back, but they've come back {{on a whole new}} level". Shenton added that at this point [...] "Mitzeee definitely has no idea that it's Mercedes - in fact, Mercedes is probably the last person that she'd suspect. She actually thinks that it's Lynsey and accuses her, because it seems to make sense".|$|E
500|$|According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can {{be placed}} within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose [...] "follows classic {{technique}} in nonpoetic Western forms". [...] O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a [...] "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a [...] "more expected ghetto expressiveness". [...] McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation {{between her and her}} audience. [...] As McWhorter states, [...] "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> subject really is". [...] McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is [...] "cleaned up" [...] for her readers. [...] Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.|$|E

500|$|Dance Again... The Hits {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on four reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Sal Cinquenmani of Slant Magazine {{wrote that the}} [...] "most immediately striking thing" [...] about the compilation is [...] "just how many hits [...] has racked up over the years". [...] "So many, in fact, that there's a hefty handful of singles missing from the standard edition of the album", using her number-one single [...] "All I Have" [...] {{as an example of}} this. He stated that Lopez's [...] "output has been nothing if not on trend", and that Dance Again... The Hits plays not only as a chronicle of her music career, but of [...] "pop music as a whole since just {{before the turn of the}} century", with genres spanning Latin pop, dance, and R. According to Cinquenmani, the album also serves as a [...] "historical record" [...] <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> rappers du jour were [...] "over the last dozen years or so", from Big Pun, Fat Joe, Ja Rule, and Lil Wayne. He concluded by stating that if the compilation [...] "proves anything" [...] it's that Lopez is, [...] "if not the queen, then at least the duchess of reinvention and should never be counted out".|$|E
500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray gave Justice League #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray {{stated that}} [...] "Johns does {{a terrific job}} of pulling {{together}} what has been essentially four or five separate stories, incorporating not only the three main titles that this will span over the coming months, but introducing several new players into the mix as well." [...] He also praised that the story advanced and showed similar promise that the reboot to the New 52 did in 2011. Joshua Yehl of IGN gave {{the first chapter of}} the Trinity War a 7.8 out of 10. He felt the issue {{set the stage for the}} event and praised the character work. However, he though that the conflict was not presented clearly yet and criticized the lack of the Justice League Dark in the first issue. Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Johns manages to balance personality expositions with story breaks, giving readers a sense <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> opposing sides are, if nothing else. Johns brings lots of big moments to the pages, but the emotions he wrings from those moments really help sell this book." [...] Zawisza was surprised by the amount of time that was spent on Madame Xanadu, feeling as though it was only there for reason to include the Justice League Dark, and was wary that the characters are in danger of being absorbed by the plot. All three praised the art in the issue, especially Ivan Reis' pencils.|$|E
500|$|... "Humbug" [...] {{received}} {{praise from}} critics. In a 2010 {{review of the}} episode, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff gave it a [...] "Grade A" [...] rating. He noted {{the difference between the}} style of the episode and previous stories of the series, saying that at first, it [...] "feel like it might be a very special Murder, She Wrote or something," [...] and that later, [...] "we're clearly in some other show entirely, the only links in the continuity chain being Mulder and Scully themselves." [...] Including Morgan's other scripts for the show, VanDerWerff called his writing [...] "deeply, deeply funny", but said that [...] "Humbug" [...] "may be [...] weakest script". He particularly praised the ending of the episode, saying [...] "there are few other TV writers that would come up with something as haunting and as perfectly understanding of the human condition as the final reveal <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>the</b> killer is." [...] Also writing for The A.V. Club in 2010, Zack Handlen called it [...] "a terrific episode ... well-written and odd". Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called [...] "Humbug" [...] "the pivotal episode of The X-Files." [...] Robert Goodwin said of the episode [...] "Talk about offbeat. It's very theatrical and grandiose. The trick was being careful that it didn't become like a bad Vincent Price movie, but it worked out well." [...] Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade. Reviewers for website IGN named [...] "Humbug" [...] the tenth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series. Topless Robot named it the sixth funniest episode of the series.|$|E
