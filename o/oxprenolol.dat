5000|$|Applications of his {{theories}} and mathematical models {{have had a}} profound effect in the field. Peppas and his students originated the novel muco- and bioadhesive systems that interact molecularly with the mucus and tissue and have been able to prolong bioavailability of proteins and peptides in the blood. As a result of his work, a number of biomedical polymers and commercial delivery devices have been launched. Peppas was the first to develop novel toxic-free poly(vinyl alcohol) gels by the freezing-thawing technique in 1975. These gels became very successful articular cartilage replacement systems. In 1978, he developed the same systems for in situ replacement of vocal cords. In 1979 his group pioneered the use of hydrogels in drug delivery applications, including epidermal bioadhesive systems and systems for the release of theophylline, proxyphylline, diltiazem, and <b>oxprenolol.</b> Peppas’ lab has developed new technologies of oral delivery systems for insulin and other proteins. These devices release insulin orally, “protecting” the insulin throughout its transport in the stomach, upper small intestine, and, eventually, blood, and bypassing diabetics’ need for several daily injections. The same technology has been used for the transmucosal (oral, buccal) delivery of calcitonin (for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women) and interferon-alpha (for cancer therapy), and is being investigated for interferon-beta release for multiple sclerotic patients. [...] Peppas was one of the pioneers of intelligent biomaterials, and medical devices. Using intelligent polymers as early as 1980, Peppas and his group were the first to use such pH-sensitive and temperature-sensitive systems for modulated release of streptokinase and other fibrinolytic enzymes.|$|E

The volume as well as the aspirating and dispensing flow rates of the acceptor solution were the main parameters studied. <b>Oxprenolol</b> was separated on a C 18 stationary phase used for the enantioseparation of <b>oxprenolol</b> was a Chiralcel OD-R column which contained cellulose tris (3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate) coated on silica as chiral selector. The corresponding mobile phase consisted of a mixture of pH 6. 0 phosphate buffer containing NaClO 4 at 0. 45 M concentration and acetonitrile (70 : 30 v/v). UV detection was performed at 273 nm. The method developed was validated. Recoveries for each enantiomer of <b>oxprenolol</b> were about 80 %. The method was found to be linear in the 50 - 2500 ng ml- 1 concentration range (r 2 = 0. 999 for both enantiomers) and good results with respect to intra- and inter-day reproducibility as well as accuracy were obtained.

40|$|The rat {{isolated}} right atrium (frequency response) and progesterone-treated rat uterus (relaxation) {{were used}} to examine the beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulatory effects of alprenolol, <b>oxprenolol</b> and pindolol. In addition, the beta 1 -adrenoceptor stimulatory effect of practolol was studied in the right atrium. All the compounds studied caused a concentration-dependent increase in atrial frequency and relaxation of the uterus. The atrial response to pindolol was competitively inhibited by the beta 1 -selective blocker pafenolol (10 (- 7) M), while the beta 2 -selective blocker ICI 118551 (10 (- 8) M) was without effect. Pafenolol (10 (- 7) M) was also shown to inhibit the atrial frequency effect of alprenolol and <b>oxprenolol.</b> In the uterus, ICI 118551 (3 X 10 (- 9) M, 3 X 10 (- 8) M, 3 X 10 (- 7) M) blocked the pindolol effect with a pKB of 9. 28. In addition, ICI 118551 (10 (- 8) M) competitively inhibited the relaxation of the uterus induced by alprenolol and <b>oxprenolol.</b> For alprenolol (right atrium and uterus), <b>oxprenolol</b> (right atrium), and pindolol (right atrium), the concentrations needed for half-maximal response were significantly greater than those required for occupation of half the receptors. This dissociation was most pronounced for pindolol in the right atrium. In this tissue, 80 - 85 % of the beta 1 -adrenoceptors had to be occupied by pindolol to initiate a tissue response corresponding to 50 % of the maximal effect generated by the compound. The intrinsic activities of alprenolol, <b>oxprenolol</b> and pindolol (expressed as % of the maximal tissue response to isoprenaline) were significantly higher in the uterus than in the right atrium.
