40|$|Recent {{advances}} in weather and <b>ocean</b> observations and <b>forecasts</b> have provided an unprecedented amount of meteorological and oceanographic information {{that has had}} significant impact {{on a wide range}} of marine-related industries, as well as on community and individual activities. However, the evaluation of the benefits of a regular <b>ocean</b> <b>forecast,</b> one significant factor influencing users’ decision-making regarding ocean-related activities, has not received much attention. This thesis examines recent developments in ocean and weather observation and forecasting, and evaluates quantitatively the economic benefits of both weather and ocean information for a range of beneficiaries. The specific economic benefit from the newly established Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) in Australia is estimated using the commonly used simplified percentage-increase evaluation method, taking one node, the New South Wales Integrated Marine Observing System (NSW-IMOS), as a case study. The potential benefit from the establishment of the NSW-IMOS is estimated to be $ 2. 4 million year. A new general method for systematically evaluating economic benefits from <b>ocean</b> weather <b>forecast</b> information, based on Bayesian Theory, is developed in the thesis. This method is then applied to beach users in Australia as a case study. Beach recreation, one of the most popular recreational activities all over the world, is significantly influenced by weather and ocean conditions. However, only the impact of weather conditions on beach recreation has previously been considered. This thesis is one of the first studies to systematically evaluate the benefits of ocean information and the combined effects of weather and ocean information to ocean-related activities. It is also the first to evaluate systematically the benefits of weather and <b>ocean</b> <b>forecasts</b> to any recreational activity. The preferred weather and ocean conditions for beach recreational activities are found using data from beach webcams. The importance of weather and <b>ocean</b> <b>forecasts</b> to beach users, and their satisfaction with these forecasts, are then analysed using data from on-site questionnaire surveys. The characteristics of people who are more likely to check the weather or <b>ocean</b> <b>forecast</b> before their beach visit are determined. The potential economic benefits to beach users in Australia from improved regular weather and <b>ocean</b> <b>forecasts</b> are then estimated quantitatively. These benefits are estimated to be between $ 20. 5 million and $ 409 million per year...|$|R

40|$|A Bayesian {{hierarchical}} model (BHM) is developed to estimate surface vector wind (SVW) fields and associated uncertainties over the Mediterranean Sea. The BHM–SVW incorporates data-stage inputs from analyses and forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and SVW retrievals from the QuikSCAT data record. The process-model {{stage of the}} BHM–SVW {{is based on a}} Rayleigh friction equation model for surface winds. Dynamical interpretations of posterior distributions of the BHM–SVW parameters are discussed. Ten realizations from the posterior distribution of the BHM–SVW are used to force the data-assimilation step of an experimental ensemble <b>ocean</b> <b>forecast</b> system for the Mediterranean Sea {{in order to create a}} set of ensemble initial conditions. The sequential data-assimilation method of the Mediterranean forecast system (MFS) is adapted to the ensemble implementation. Analyses of sample ensemble initial conditions for a single data-assimilation period in MFS are presented to demonstrate the multivariate impact of the BHM–SVW ensemble generation methodology. Ensemble initial-condition spread is quantified by computing standard deviations of ocean state variable fields over the ten ensemble members. The methodological findings in this article are of two kinds. From the perspective of statistical modelling, the process-model development is more closely related tophysicalbalances than inpreviousworkwithmodels for the SVW. Fromthe <b>ocean</b> <b>forecast</b> perspective, the generation of ocean ensemble initial conditions via BHM is shown to be practical for operational implementation in an ensemble <b>ocean</b> <b>forecast</b> system. Phenomenologically, ensemble spread generated via BHM–SVW occurs on ocean mesoscale time- and space-scales, in close association with strong synoptic-scale wind-forcing events.

Using a range of analysis tools and approaches, GODAE systems are useful for quantifying the impact of different observation types {{on the quality of}} analyses and forecasts. This assessment includes both existing and future observation platforms. Many important conclusions can be drawn from these studies. It is clear that altimeter data are extremely important for constraining mesoscale variability in <b>ocean</b> <b>forecast</b> systems. The number of altimeters is also important. For example, near-real-time applications need data from four altimeters to achieve skill that is similar to systems using data from two altimeters in delayed mode. Another important result is that sea surface temperature is the only observation parameter that adequately monitors ocean properties in coastal regions and shallow seas. Assimilation of Argo data provides a significant, measurable improvement to GODAE systems, and is the only observation platform that provides global-scale information for constraining salinity. The complementary nature of different components of GOOS is now clear and the emergence of new assimilation techniques for observing system evaluation provides the GODAE community with a practical path toward routine GOOS monitoring...|$|R
