500|$|The {{collaboration}} {{was originally}} {{planned to be}} a remix of the song, while the solo version would have been included on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud. However, {{in the end it}} made the final cut on the album. Regarding Drake's inclusion on the song, Rihanna told MTV News, [...] "Drake is the hottest rapper <b>out</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and we've always been trying to work together." [...] According to her, when he heard the song he liked it and wrote his verse after three days. Rihanna has further described the song as very youthful, playful and very melodic track; according to her that's why Drake was the perfect choice to be on it, [...] "cause he's a young rapper who has incredible melodies". [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was released as the second single from Loud; it was sent to contemporary hit and rhythmic radio in the United States on October 26, 2010. The single was made available for digital download on November 12 via the iTunes Store. A CD single featuring the song and a remix of it was released on January 21, 2011 in Germany.|$|E
500|$|West {{received}} similar {{approval from}} Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, {{both of whom}} contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated [...] "everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's <b>out</b> <b>right</b> <b>now?</b> I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E
500|$|On March 15, 2012, Rihanna {{explained}} her {{collaboration with}} Brown to Ryan Seacrest during his morning show: [...] "The first song that came about was 'Birthday Cake'. I mean, {{we ended up}} recording {{them at the same}} time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist <b>out</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses. Busta Rhymes released his own freestyle to the song along with rapper Reek da Villian.|$|E

2500|$|When T.I. {{spoke on}} {{the feel of the}} album he stated: [...] "It has a more {{balanced}} blend of that vintage 'U Don't Know Me,' 'Top Back,' Trap Muzik sound with some of the more mainstream radio records that you heard from Paper Trail. It's more of a cohesive blend." [...] In an interview with Rap-Up, T.I. revealed his thoughts on the album and claimed: [...] "I think it’s a lot more urban than Paper Trail, and less apologetic than No Mercy. I think it’s more diversified than T.I. vs. T.I.P. though. It’s got a lotta heart, it’s got a lotta edge. It’s a creative album. It’s probably harder than most of the shit that’s coming <b>out</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E

On May 7, 2013, Jay Bentley issued a statement to The Bad Religion Page, which read, [...] "Greg Hetson is dealing with some personal issues, if he wishes {{to make a statement}} we will support that, if he chooses not to we will support that. Mike Dimkich is indeed helping us <b>out</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> and we are genuinely appreciative. Right now we are just looking forward and getting ready to play our shows." [...] The reason Hetson has not been touring with Bad Religion is likely due to the divorce of his second wife Alia. On January 11, 2014, Bentley confirmed on thebrpage.net that Dimkich is a permanent member of the band. A few days later, Download Festival's official website uploaded a photograph of the new lineup (except Brett Gurewitz).|$|E

[...] The arc will follow Diddy's character as he tours from London to Paris and finds the woman of his dreams - only to lose her, find her, lose her again and find her a final time.

He told Alex da Kid (who produced [...] "Coming Home") [...] "I want a beat that makes me feel like a white man in a basement in Atlanta." [...] Diddy said that [...] "most of the producers he worked with, he's been friends with for a long time. The records came together by hanging out with them, taking them to parties and showing them movies". In an interview with MTV News Diddy said [...] "One of the things [...] trying to represent is emotion... Not being afraid to show emotion on record. A lot of records <b>out</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> — no disrespect to them, but they're all surface. It's about what people have or a dance. All our records are gonna be about love, feelings and emotion. Last Train to Paris is a love story and the most vulnerable album I've ever been involved in. It's raw emotion — you get a feeling, a vibe." [...] Diddy also released an application for the iPhone that integrates his social networking site and Twitter feed. A short film will also accompany the album. Rap producer Bangladesh, also confirmed that he would be producing for the album. According to New York magazine, the album was [...] "assembled from 60 or so songs.
