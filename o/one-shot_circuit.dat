A tight combination of the transducer array with integrated circuitry eliminates bulky cables connecting the elements of the transducer array to a separate system of electronics. Furthermore, preamplifiers located close to the array can lead to improved receive sensitivity. A combined IC and transducer array can lead to a portable, high-performance, and inexpensive 3 -D {{ultrasound imaging}} system. This paper presents an IC flip-chip bonded to a 16 x 16 -element capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array for 3 -D ultrasound imaging. The IC includes a transmit beamformer that generates 25 -V unipolar pulses with programmable focusing delays to 224 of the 256 transducer elements. <b>One-shot</b> <b>circuits</b> allow adjustment of the pulse widths for different ultrasound transducer center frequencies. For receiving reflected ultrasound signals, the IC uses the 32 -elements along the array diagonals. The IC provides each receiving element with a low-noise 25 -MHz-bandwidth transimpedance amplifier. Using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) clocked at 100 MHz to operate the IC, the IC generated property timed transmit pulses with 5 -ns accuracy. With the IC flip-chip bonded to a CMUT array, we show that the IC can produce steered and focused ultrasound beams. We present 2 -D and 3 -D images of a wire phantom and 2 -D orthogonal cross-sectional images (B-scans) of a latex heart phantom. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
