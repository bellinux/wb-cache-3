Realizing he lacks the strength and resources to reach the top, Homer enters a cave to find McAllister's frozen body and evidence proving it was Abraham who betrayed him. Tired and ashamed, Homer sticks his flag pole <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledge.</b> The ensuing crack collapses {{the rest of the}} mountain, making where he is on now the peak.

5|$|Following {{his work}} on the Smithsonian, but before the Scott Building {{finished}} construction, Alexander traveled to New England, where he was assigned to a project at the entrance of Boston harbor. That project, the rebuilding of Minot's Ledge Lighthouse, was widely considered {{to be one of the}} most difficult to be attempted by the U.S. Government up to that time. Designed by Brigadier General Joseph Totten, head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the lighthouse was intended to replace a structure that had been destroyed in an 1851 storm. With multiple ships wrecking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledge</b> annually, the need for a lighthouse was crucial. Appointed superintendent of the lighthouse construction in April 1855, newly promoted Captain Alexander modified Totten's design in accordance with conditions at the site. Because the site of the lighthouse was continually awash, except at low tide and calm seas, the work of preparing the interlocking granite blocks and iron framework of the lighthouse was done at nearby Government Island, adjacent to Cohasset, Massachusetts.|$|E

500|$|At 10:00 on 27 May 1909, {{loaded with}} over 1,000passengers headed for Europe, Princess Alice {{departed}} the Lloyd pier in Hoboken, New Jersey. As she neared The Narrows {{in a heavy}} fog, she steamed to stay clear of outbound French Line steamer [...] and ran hard aground on a submerged rocky ledge near the seawall of Fort Wadsworth {{a few minutes after}} 11:00. After the fog lifted, it was revealed that the bow of Princess Alice had stopped some [...] from the outer walls of the Staten Island fort. Lighthouse tender Larkspur was the first ship to {{come to the aid of}} the Princess, followed by U.S. Army Quartermaster's ship General Meigs and revenue cutter Seneca. No passengers were hurt in the incident and it was determined there was no damage to the hull of the liner. But, despite the effort of attending ships, she remained stuck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledge.</b> Eventually, after offloading [...] of cargo from her front hold onto lighters called to the scene, ten steam tugs and power from Princess Alices own engines freed the ship at 01:47 on 28May, almost 15hours after running aground. The force required to free the liner was great enough that she was then propelled into SSMarken, at anchor some distance away, damaging one of that ship's fenders. After then making her way to the nearby New York City Quarantine Station, Princess Alice anchored to reload her cargo, and by 09:05, she was underway again. However, she ran aground again in soft mud in Ambrose Channel at 10:15. This time she was able to free herself and proceeded on to Bremen, a little more than 24hours late. This voyage was further marred by the apparent suicide of a despondent New York attorney on 30 May. The man, headed to the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse, had previously suffered a nervous breakdown and was under the care of a doctor on board the ship at the time he jumped overboard.|$|E

2500|$|At 0530 hours Lt. Col. Joshi {{spoke to}} Captain Batra {{and asked him}} to reconnoitre the area. Captain Batra, {{accompanied}} by Subedar Raghunath Singh and Major Bhat, his artillery observation officer, took out a patrol to recce a route to re-inforce Naveen from a flank. Batra located the position of the enemy sangar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledge</b> from which enemy machine guns were holding up the advance of his company. At this juncture, Batra, realising {{that there was no way}} from the left or right, decided to make a direct assault in daylight itself. At great personal risk and under heavy fire from enemy machine guns and grenade firing launchers, Batra moved forward, screaming the battle cry of JAK RIF – Durga mata ki jai, and charged the sangar firing incessantly from his AK-47. He sustained grievous injuries in the process, yet he continued his charge, with supporting fire from the rest of the patrol, and reached the very narrow entrance of the sangar, taking the enemy by complete surprise, he killed 5 Pakistani soldiers in a close-quarter battle. [...] "There was a time he grappled with a Pakistani soldier, punching him in the nose. As soon as he fell, Batra plunged his bayonet into the fallen soldier's stomach. But another enemy soldier caught him from behind. He, too, was done to death after being thrown off the back by Batra, the ferocious. All hell broke loose. It was utter chaos," [...] a soldier of JAK RIF, who accompanied him in the attack, said. The attack resulted in seven Pakistani soldiers killed and Indians gaining a foothold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledge.</b> Taken by surprise by this ferocious attack, Pakistanis started retreating. Captain Batra and his men had gained the upper hand by now. However, there was still a enemy machine gun nest in action on that ledge that had to be silenced. Four Pakistani soldiers including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), who was guiding the fire on the Indian soldiers fighting outside, were manning the machine gun nest. Enraged Batra quickly charged forward alone, killing all four members of the crew.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 6–7 July, the {{opposing}} forces were so close that besides exchanges of small arms fire, verbal exchanges continued throughout the night. It was at this stage that it became imperative for Indian troops to destroy this Pakistani post, located north of Point 4875, from where enemy fire was coming as otherwise the situation could get worse. At this juncture, the Indian troops detected the enemy presence on a long and narrow ledge, running north from Point 4875. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledge,</b> the enemy were holding strong sangars echeloned one behind the other. Batra, who was still recovering from his own wounds he received {{in the battle of}} Point 5140, wanted to reach the top to rescue his fellow soldiers and carry out reconnaissance of the ledge where the enemy soldiers were. [...] "The problem was that the Indian soldiers were caught unawares about the presence of the enemy soldiers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledge</b> ahead of Twin Bump. They went ahead into the enemy lines and destroyed their bunkers on 4875 Peak but the firing from the ledge pinned them down," [...] Colonel Joshi said. Even though, It was pitch dark when they had left at night, but even near the top where the soldiers had to climb vertically, visibility was almost zero because of fog. Even worse, it began snowing as they advanced. En route to the top, Batra spotted a Pakistani machine gun position firing at the trapped Indian soldiers. Crouching, he moved toward the machine gun position, hiding behind rocks whenever possible. As he reached close to the enemy's machine gun position he lobbed a grenade, destroying the machine gun position. [...] "Follow me, boys," [...] he whispered in the dark, and they advanced to the next position. At 16,087 feet, even though they were struggling for breath and panting, this did not stop them and they kept advancing non-stop. Before first light on the 7th, the troops succeeded in knocking out two more enemy machine guns, however, firing from the ledge continued. Batra's platoon soon reached the ledge, though by this time it was broad daylight.|$|E
