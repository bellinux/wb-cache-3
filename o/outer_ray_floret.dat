50|$|The {{plant is}} a {{herbaceous}} perennial that grows {{into a small}} bush up to 70 cm high with pungently-scented leaves. The leaves are light yellowish green, variously pinnatifid. The conspicuous daisy-like flowers are {{up to 20 mm}} across, borne in lax corymbs. The <b>outer,</b> <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> have white ligules and the inner, disc florets are yellow and tubular. It spreads rapidly by seed, and will cover a wide area after a few years.|$|R
50|$|The {{branching}} stem of Gaillardia pulchella is hairy and upright, {{growing to}} 60 cm (2 ft) tall. The leaves are alternate, mostly basal, 4-8 cm long, with edges smooth to coarsely toothed or lobed. The pinwheel, daisy-like inflorescences are 4-6 cm in diameter, vividly colored with red, orange and yellow. The central disc florets {{of the flower}} head {{tend to be more}} red-violet, with the <b>outer</b> <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> being yellow. In one variety, almost the entire flower is red, with only the barest tips of the petals touched with yellow. It blooms practically year-round in some areas, but more typically in summer to early fall. The fruit is an achene.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{all members}} of the {{sunflower}} family, the flowering structure is a composite inflorescence, with rose-colored (rarely yellow or white) florets arranged in a prominent, somewhat cone-shaped head - [...] "cone-shaped" [...] because the petals of the <b>outer</b> <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> tend to point downward (are reflexed) once the flower head opens, thus forming a cone. Plants are generally long lived, with distinctive flowers. The common name [...] "cone flower" [...] comes from the characteristic center [...] "cone" [...] {{at the center of the}} flower head. The generic name Echinacea is rooted in the Greek word ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning hedgehog, it references the spiky appearance and feel of the flower heads.|$|R
40|$|Echinacea purpurea is {{native to}} the Atlantic {{drainage}} area of the United States of America and Canada, but not Mexico (McGregor 1968). It has been introduced as a cultivated medicinal plant in parts of north and eastern Africa and in Europe (Iwu 2001). Echinacea purpurea is herbaceous perennial with branched, fibrous root. Stem is erect, stout, branched, hirsute or glabrous, 60 – 180 cm high. As {{a member of the}} Asteraceae family, each “flower” or daisy-like head unit is actually a conglomera-tion of many tiny florets. The inner (disc) florets end in spines, and are surrounded by droopy <b>outer</b> (<b>ray)</b> <b>florets</b> with teeth at their ends. Echinacea is characterized by spiny flowering heads, with an elevated receptacle that forms the “cone”. Color of the disc florets is red-brown and the <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> petals are purplish (Awang and Kindack 1991, Houghton 1994). During the last 20 years Echinacea research has focused on its immune-stimulating properties. Immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities are the main properties described, which make Echinacea useful in the treatment or the prevention of different pathological conditions (Percival 2000). Echinacea is used today in dozens of preparations in European phytomedicine. As Echinacea preparations may vary in chemical composition, their therapeutic effectiveness may be inconsistent. Factors that may influence the chemical composition of Echinacea preparations include the species of Echinacea used (E. purpu-rea, E. pallida or E. angustifolia), the part of the plant used (leaves, flowers, stems or roots), grow-ing, drying and storage conditions and method o...|$|R
40|$|The pseudanthium of {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) {{consists of}} two floret types: zygomorphic sterile <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> and actinomorphic hermaphrodite disc florets. In the tubular ray flower (turf) mutant, the loss-of-function of a CYCLOIDEA (CYC) gene generates hermaphrodite tubular-like <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> that replace the normal sterile <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> We evaluated whether tubular-like <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> have a multifaceted set of floral traits {{and the presence of}} heteromorphic seeds in the turf inflorescence. During early stages of floral ontogeny, primordia of both tubular-like <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> and typical <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> displayed a comparable shape. In contrast, during later stages of development, the form of tubular-like <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> primordia was most similar to disc floret primordia. In mature tubular-like <b>ray</b> <b>florets,</b> corolla and ovary had both <b>ray</b> and disc <b>floret</b> characteristics but also displayed distinct identity traits. In open-pollinated tubular-like <b>ray</b> <b>florets,</b> the seed set was low, but a noteworthy increase of filled achenes was obtained by hand pollination. Wild type ray achenes were always empty. Embryos of tubular-like <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> were shorter and lighter than the embryos of disc florets but able to produce fertile plants. In conclusion, the different identity characteristics combined in tubular-like <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> of the mutant evolved a capitulum type not described in the genus Helianthus...|$|R
50|$|Ray Florets: Typically 12-21 <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> per capitulum. Individual <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> measure between 15-25mm in length.|$|R
5000|$|Individuals of Layia discoidea {{occasionally}} display <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> {{that are}} light yellow in color (see Calphotos and [...] ). Individuals bearing <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> {{have been observed}} in populations at the New Idria, Laguna Mountain, and Panther Peak serpentine masses. It is unclear if the <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> {{are a result of}} hybridization with nearby Layia glandulosa, a genetic mutation, or simply induced by environmental conditions.|$|R
50|$|In the anemone form, {{the disk}} florets are prominent, often raised and overshadowing the <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> The spoon-form disk florets are visible and the long, tubular <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> are spatulate.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ray</b> <b>florets</b> are {{essentially}} the colorful, flowery {{portion of the}} plant. In most Simsia, the amount of <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> can be anywhere between non-existent {{and as many as}} 45. They vary in colors, being any mixture of orange-yellow, lemon-yellow, pink, purple, or white. Simsia calva tend to have 8-21 <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> with their colors being orange-yellow, with traces, lining, or fully colored faces of brown or purple.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{flower head}} has {{a center of}} six {{yellowish}} disc florets with black stamens surrounded by five yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> The <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> generally have three teeth, the central tooth being the smallest. Plants flower in May through October.|$|R

50|$|They show large {{yellow or}} orange flowers, 6-8 cm wide with 10-15 cm long <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> and {{numerous}} disc florets. The phyllaries (a bract under the flowerhead) has long spreading hairs. Each phyllary {{is associated with}} a <b>ray</b> <b>floret.</b> Species of Arnica, with an involucre (a circle of bracts arranged surrounding the flower head) arranged in two rows, have only their outer phyllaries associated with <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> The flowers have a slight aromatic smell.

40|$|Dahlias (Dahlia variabilis) {{exhibit a}} wide range of flower colours because of {{accumulation}} of anthocyanin and other flavonoids in their <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> Two lateral mutants were used that spontaneously occurred in ‘Michael J’ (MJW) which has yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> with orange variegation. MJOr, a bud mutant producing completely orange <b>ray</b> <b>florets,</b> accumulates anthocyanins, flavones, and butein, and MJY, another mutant producing completely yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets,</b> accumulates flavones and butein. Reverse transcription–PCR analysis showed that expression of chalcone synthase 1 (DvCHS 1), flavanone 3 -hydroxylase (DvF 3 H), dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (DvDFR), anthocyanidin synthase (DvANS), and DvIVS encoding a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor were suppressed, whereas that of chalcone isomerase (DvCHI) and DvCHS 2, another CHS with 69 % nucleotide identity with DvCHS 1, was not suppressed in the yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> of MJY. A 5. 4 [*]kb CACTA superfamily transposable element, transposable element of Dahlia variabilis 1 (Tdv 1), was found in the fourth intron of the DvIVS gene of MJW and MJY, and footprints of Tdv 1 were detected in the variegated flowers of MJW. It is shown that only one type of DvIVS gene was expressed in MJOr, whereas these plants are likely to have three types of the DvIVS gene. On the basis of these results, the mechanism regulating the formation of orange and yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> in dahlia is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Chrysanthemum morifolium, one of {{the most}} {{economically}} important ornamental crops worldwide, is well-known for the elaborate and complex inflorescence which is composed of both bilaterally symmetrical <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> and radially symmetrical disc florets. Despite continuing efforts, the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of the two flower types are still unclear so far. CYC-like proteins have been shown to control flower symmetry or regulate flower-type identity in several angiosperm plant lineages. In this study, we conducted comparative analysis of the CmCYC 2 genes in two chrysanthemum cultivars and their F 1 progenies with various whorls of <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> Six CmCYC genes were identified and sequenced, all of which were grouped into the CYC 2 subclade. All the six CmCYC 2 genes were predominantly expressed in reproductive organs, and in particular in the petal of <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> Of these genes, the transcription level of CmCYC 2 c was highly up-regulated in <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> of the double-ray flowered heads. In addition, the result that CmCYC 2 c was highly expressed at key developing stages indicates its role in regulating petal development. Furthermore, overexpression of CmCYC 2 c in C. lavandulifolium, {{one of the}} original species of C. morifolium, led to significant increase in flower numbers and petal ligule length of <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> Besides CmCYC 2 c, the expression of CmCYC 2 f was also significantly upregulated in transgenic lines, implying a possible role in regulating development of <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> Both results of expression patterns and transgenic phenotypes suggest that CmCYC 2 c is involved in regulating <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> identity in the chrysanthemum. This study will be useful for genetic manipulation of flower shape in chrysanthemum and hence promote the process of molecular breeding...|$|R
