In 1996, BOLD was created at the University of British Columbia to develop new technology and techniques in forensic <b>odontology.</b> The University of British Columbia program is the only one in North America that provides graduate training in forensic <b>odontology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Forensic <b>odontology</b> is {{the study}} of dental {{applications}} in legal proceedings. The subject covers a wide variety of topics including individual identification, mass identification, and bite mark analysis. The study of <b>odontology</b> in a legal case can be a piece of incriminating evidence or an aspect of wide controversy.|$|E

25|$|Recently, the {{scientific}} foundation of forensic <b>odontology,</b> and especially bite mark comparison, {{has been called}} into question. A 1999 study {{by a member of}} the American Board of Forensic <b>Odontology</b> found a 63% rate of false identifications. However, the study was based on an informal workshop during an ABFO meeting which many members did not consider a valid scientific setting. In February 2016, the Texas Forensic Science Commission recommended that bite mark evidence not be used in criminal prosecutions until it had a more firm scientific basis.|$|E

25|$|Links {{have been}} {{reported}} between oral sex and oral cancer with human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected people. In 2005, a research study at Malmö University's Faculty of <b>Odontology</b> suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might {{increase the risk of}} oral cancer. The study found that 36 percent of the cancer patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group.|$|E
25|$|Forensic {{dentistry}} or forensic <b>odontology</b> is {{the application}} of dental knowledge to those criminal and civil laws that are enforced by police agencies in a criminal justice system. Forensic dentists are involved in assisting investigative agencies to identify recovered human remains {{in addition to the}} identification of whole or fragmented bodies; forensic dentists may also be asked to assist in determining age, race, occupation, previous dental history and socioeconomic status of unidentified human beings.|$|E
25|$|Forensic {{dentistry}} is {{the proper}} handling, examination and evaluation of dental evidence, which will be then presented {{in the interest of}} justice. The evidence that may be derived from teeth is the age (in children) and identification of the person to whom the teeth belong. This is done using dental records including radiographs, ante-mortem (prior to death) and post-mortem (after death) photographs and DNA. Forensic <b>odontology</b> is derived from Latin, meaning a forum or where legal matters are discussed.|$|E

2500|$|Rose is {{believed}} to have killed Charmaine shortly before Fred's prison release date of 24 June 1971. She is known to have taken Charmaine, Anna Marie and Heather to visit Fred on 15 June. It {{is believed}} to be on or very shortly after this date that Charmaine was murdered. In addition to forensic <b>odontology</b> confirmation Charmaine had died while Fred was still incarcerated, further testimony from Tracey's mother, Shirley, would corroborate the fact Charmaine had been murdered before Fred had been released on 24 June. In her later testimony at Rose's trial, Mrs. Giles would state she and her family had lived in the upper flat of 25 Midland Road in 1971, and that her two daughters had been playmates of Charmaine and Anna Marie. Mrs. Giles would state that after her family had vacated the upper flat of Midland Road in April 1971, on one day in June, she had brought Tracey to visit Charmaine, only for Tracey to be told by Rose: [...] "She's gone to live with her mother, and bloody good riddance!" [...] before Tracey began to weep.|$|E
