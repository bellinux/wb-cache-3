5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) {{in which a}} tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of}} the voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir, recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E

5|$|About 1 in 20 meteorites {{consist of}} the unique iron-nickel {{minerals}} taenite (35–80% iron) and kamacite (90–95% iron). Although rare, iron meteorites are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global stock of iron in use in society is 2200kg per capita. Much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> in more-developed countries (7000–14000kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (2000kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|About 78% of {{the land}} surface of Wales is given over to {{agricultural}} use.), Wales area 20,779 km2 However, very little <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> arable land; the vast majority consists of permanent grass pasture or rough grazing for herd animals such as sheep and cows. Although both beef and dairy cattle are raised widely, especially in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, Wales is more well known for its sheep farming and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Welsh cooking.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E

5|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of {{the psychology}} of forms says that objects that move {{in the same direction}} are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and the star has a smaller radius.

5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the former is simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> ring species.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} part of their range, the Arctic tern has been reducing in numbers. Much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to lack of food. However, most of these birds' range is extremely remote, with no apparent trend in the species as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E

5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E
5|$|Geological {{mapping of}} the volcano has {{indicated}} {{that as much as}} 80% {{of the volcano}}'s surface has been topped by lava flows during the last 5,000years, entirely composed of shield alkalic basalt. More than half <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> under 3,000years old, and about 12% is less than 1,000years of age. Between the years 1700 and 2016, eruptions originated from six vents; four of these lava flows poured into the sea to the west coast.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} {{considered}} to be renewable because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of 1031joules (3·1015TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption. About 20% <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> residual heat from planetary accretion, and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past. Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales. Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.|$|E
