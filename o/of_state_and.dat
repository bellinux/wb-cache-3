5|$|Before the Georgian era, the Treasury of England {{was led by}} the Lord High Treasurer.

5|$|Cuba's {{economy grew}} in 1974 {{as a result}} of high {{international}} sugar prices and new credits with Argentina, Canada, and parts of Western Europe. A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the Organization of American States (OAS), with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice. Cuba's government underwent a restructuring along Soviet lines, claiming that this would further democratization and decentralize power away from Castro. Officially announcing Cuba's identity as a socialist state, the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held, and a new constitution adopted that abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the presidency of the newly created Council <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> Council of Ministers, making him both head <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> head of government.|$|E
