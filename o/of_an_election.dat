5|$|Because Poe {{was found}} on the day <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>election,</b> it was {{suggested}} as early as 1872 that he was the victim of cooping. This was a ballot-box-stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied, drugged, and used as a pawn to vote for a political party at multiple locations. Cooping had become the standard explanation for Poe's death in most of his biographies for several decades, though his status in Baltimore may have made him too recognizable for this scam to have worked. More recently, analysis suggesting that Poe's death resulted from rabies has been presented.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{amended the}} bill to delay debate for six months. As expected, the bill then fell when the Dáil was {{dissolved}} in the intervening period for the 2007 general election. Deputy Howlin said that {{the real reason for}} the delay was that the Government did not want to enact this type of social legislation in the face <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Government {{argued that}} the {{sections}} of the Act dealing with disputation by petition encompassed any question about the validity <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>election,</b> including the eligibility of a candidate, and that the sections should be interpreted broadly. Sue made a similar argument, saying that the sections allowing disputes by petition and the sections allowing disputes by the relevant house of Parliament were not mutually exclusive and that elections could be disputed by either the Parliament or the people.|$|E
5|$|In 1032, Barbolano {{himself was}} deposed {{by those who}} wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge lay dying in Constantinople {{and was unable to}} return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, {{attempted}} to seize the throne without waiting for the formality <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>election,</b> but as soon as he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne simply because {{he was the son of}} Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely checked, and Domenico Flabanico, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election of a son of a Doge.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 local {{elections}} the Progress Party regained {{the level of}} support seen at the 1987 elections. This was said largely to have been {{as a result of}} a focus on Progress Party core issues in the electoral campaign, especially immigration, as well as the party dominating the media picture as a result of the controversy around the 1995 Norwegian Association meeting at Godlia kino. The latter particularly gained the party many sympathy votes, as a result of the harsh media storm targeted against Hagen. In the 1997 parliamentary election, the party obtained 15.3% of the vote, and for the first time became the second largest political party in Norway. The 1999 {{local elections}} resulted in the party's first mayor as a direct result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>election,</b> Terje Søviknes in Os. 20 municipalities also elected a deputy mayor from the Progress Party.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Labor Party Governments led by Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard between 2007 and 2013 {{commissioned}} two defence white papers, {{which were}} published in 2009 and 2013. The 2009 document, , had a focus on responding to China's rapidly growing influence. It included commitments to expand the RAN, including acquiring twelve submarines, and increasing defence spending by three percent per year in real terms. This increase in spending did not occur, however. The Defence White Paper 2013 had similar strategic themes, but set out a more modest program of defence spending which reflected the government's constrained finances. As part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>election</b> commitment, the Liberal-National Party Abbott Government commissioned a further defence white paper that was published in 2016. This document also included a commitment to expand the ADF's size and capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The all-pairs widest path {{problem has}} {{applications}} in the Schulze method for choosing a winner in multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, {{and the winner is}} the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>election</b> using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul {{has voted}} for the winning party in general {{elections}} since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general and local election. The city's electorate has also {{voted for the}} AKP government's constitutional reforms proposed during the 2007 and 2010 constitutional referenda. Turkish President and former AKP Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected Mayor of İstanbul in the 1994 local elections as the Islamist Welfare Party candidate with 25.1% of the vote, winning due to a vote split between the mainstream centrist parties. Conservative parties traditionally find support in older districts with high population densities such as Bağcılar, Fatih, Sultanbeyli and Esenler. The opposition Kemalist center-left Republican People's Party (CHP), currently the second major political force in both İstanbul and the country, gets most of its support from more rural districts such as Silivri, Çatalca and Sarıyer. Urban districts such as Beşiktaş, Bakırköy, Şişli and Kadıköy have returned {{strong support for the}} CHP in past elections. The CHP are generally strongest in the west, where newer residential developments are taking place. İstanbul has 39 districts, more than any other province in Turkey. Since İstanbul is Turkey's largest city and has usually voted {{in the same way as}} the country as a whole, it is largely perceived in Turkish politics that the winning party <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>election</b> is essentially decided by İstanbul's electorate. Political parties thus allocate substantial amounts of electoral campaign funds and to winning control of the İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Due to its electoral importance, İstanbul has reported the largest and most serious cases of electoral fraud in recent elections, including the 2014 local elections.|$|E
