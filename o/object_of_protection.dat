This law listed many prohibitions {{against the use}} of animals, including their use for filmmaking and other public events causing pain or damage to health, feeding fowls forcefully and tearing out the thighs of living frogs. The two principals (Ministerialräte) of the German Ministry of the Interior, Clemens Giese and Waldemar Kahler, who were responsible for drafting the legislative text, wrote in their juridical comment from 1939, that by the law the animal was to be [...] "protected for itself" [...] ("um seiner selbst willen geschützt"), and made [...] "an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> going far beyond the hitherto existing law" [...] ("Objekt eines weit über die bisherigen Bestimmungen hinausgehenden Schutzes").|$|E

40|$|Problems of {{the object}} of penal law {{protection}} have a great impact both in theory and in practice, especially in the scope of finding the so-called "similarity" of a crime. Defining both generic and a direct <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> in an offence of torment and cruelty (art. 184 P. C.) is not raising substantial difficulties. The art. 184 is included in chapter XXV of P. C. and therefore it is commonly advocated in the literature and judicial decisions that "family", "guardianship" and "youth" enlisted in the chapter's title consist a generic <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> of a norm expressed in art. 184 P. C. Those definitions cannot be correct as too narrow from a logical point of view- especially if one considers the fact that interests of other categories of persons from outside a family and not being minors can become an object of a lawless attempt described in art. 184 P. C. i. e. persons dependent from perpetrator or the helpless not protected by duties of guardianship. It can be thus stated that a correct functioning of family and guardianship and a proper development end education of youth are the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> of norms expressed in chapter XXV of P. C. Considering {{the fact that a}} protection of family, guardiaship and youth is the most important but not the exclusive task of art. 184 P. C., the definition of direct <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> should not be also limited to interests listed in the title of chapter XXV of P. C. Consequently, the following definition can be proposed {{on the grounds of the}} postulate of W. Swida: "A due treatment of those categories of people who on account of their objective properties (family relations dependence relations) or their subjective features (minority, helplessness are particularly exposed to improper behavior which can take a shape of torment or cruelty from the side of others, is a direct (main) <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> of a norm expressed in art. 184 P. C. A question of protection is closely related to an issue of similarity of offences in their subjective aspect. The study of crime of torment and cruelty can induce the opinion that similarity of offence of art. 184 P. C. to other crimes of chapter XXV of P. C. and to the crimes described in other parts of the Act (wit,h the exception of crime of persecuting a subordinate art. 319 P. C.) can not be prejudged in abstracto; the question can be settled only on the grounds of actual facts of a case by means of establishing the identity or similarity of generic interests being a main or additional <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> In case of the offence of art. 184 par. 2 P. C, life and man's health being always the additional <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> it has to be similar to all offences directed against life or health as a main or additional object of attempt.

40|$|At {{the outset}} of the article the Author {{critically}} discusses terminological issues related to the Article 298 of the Penal Code. The offence of staging an accident in order to obtain an indemnity has been included in chapter XXXVI Penal Code, which means that it has been classified as an offence against economic relations. The proper <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> is in this case the security of economic relations, while the direct <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> is the convenience of insurers and the closely related and mutually conditioning interests of both insurers and the insured parties. Later on in the article the Author focuses upon the offence subject and the features determining the enforcement proceedings. Finally, he deals with the subject since he considers that an offence specified in Art. 298 of the Penal Code is an oriented offence, which means that it is determined by a specific aim (obtaining the indemnity). The Author also discusses the institution of the so-called active repentance, according to which a person is not liable to a penalty if he voluntarily prevents the payment of indemnity before the beginning of the proceedings...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} the hidden similarities between Raymond Chandler’s prototypical noir The Big Sleep, and the United Nations Responsibility to Protect (R 2 P) document. By {{taking up the}} work of philosopher Giorgio Agamben, this paper shows that the bare life produces the form of protection embodied by Philip Marlowe in Chandler’s novel and by the United Nations Security Council in R 2 P. Agamben’s theorizing of the extra-legal status of the sovereign pertains to both texts, in which the protector exists outside of the law. Philip Marlowe, tasked with preventing the distribution of pornographic images, commits breaking-and-entering, withholding evidence, and murder. Analogously, R 2 P advocates for the Security Council’s ability to trespass laws that safeguard national sovereignty {{in order to prevent}} “bare” atrocities against human life. As Agamben demonstrates, the extra-legal position of the protector is made possible by “stripping bare” human life. This paper also gestures towards limitations of Agamben’s thought by indicating, through a comparison of these two texts, that bare life produces states of exception as the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> rather than punishment...|$|E

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} law {{has developed a}} variety of doctrines to police the boundaries between various forms <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> Courts and scholars alike overwhelmingly conceive of these doctrines {{in terms of the}} nature <b>of</b> the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> The functionality doctrine in trademark law, for example, defines the boundary between trademark and patent law by identifying and refusing trademark protection to features that play a functional role in a product 2 ̆ 7 s performance. Likewise, the useful article doctrine works at the boundary of copyright and patent law to identify elements of an article 2 ̆ 7 s design that are dictated by function and to channel <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> those features to the patent system.
