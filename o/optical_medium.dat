2500|$|If {{a simple}} {{open-ended}} waveguide {{is used as}} an antenna, without the horn, the sudden end of the conductive walls causes an abrupt impedance change at the aperture, from the wave impedance in the waveguide to the impedance of free space, (about 377 ohms). [...] When radio waves travelling through the waveguide hit the opening, this impedance-step reflects a significant fraction of the wave energy back down the guide toward the source, so {{that not all of}} the power is radiated. [...] This is similar to the reflection at an open-ended transmission line or a boundary between <b>optical</b> <b>mediums</b> with a low and high index of refraction, like at a glass surface. [...] The reflected waves cause standing waves in the waveguide, increasing the [...] SWR, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter.

The laser pulse may make a plurality of passes through the laser amplification medium and accumulate a positive B-integral during a positive non-linear phase change.
