500|$|Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona {{won four}} {{consecutive}} La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria {{in both the}} 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years. Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure. On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state, [...] "Cruyff built the cathedral, <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> maintain and renovate it." ...|$|E

Though Hasbro's priority is to deliver a child-friendly show, the writers and production staff, according to Linda Steiner, {{senior vice president of}} Hasbro Studios, [...] "We will certainly, for fun, do the 'bronie' check to see if this could pass with them, but <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> deliver to the kids first." [...] Margaret Loesch, {{president and chief executive of}} Hub Network, said that they have kept their nods to the fandom to subtle hints. She added, [...] "We haven't driven this movement, the fans have, and we don't want to get ahead of that. We want to nourish this phenomenon, not manipulate it." [...] A writer for the show, Meghan McCarthy, said, [...] "Some pop culture-y things are thrown in, but we don't want to do anything that's too 'wink wink'. It detracts from the story that we're trying to tell". Many of the nods to the older audience are drawn in by the storyboard artists and animators, who are challenged to populate scripted scenes with background ponies; McCarthy points the example of ponies fashioned after the main characters from The Big Lebowski due to having to fill in space for scenes set in a bowling alley for the episode [...] "The Cutie Pox".|$|E
500|$|The {{season is}} {{structured}} into three [...] "pods" [...] {{based on its}} airing schedule: the first eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider; LMD (Life Model Decoy) for the subsequent seven episodes; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra. Elements and characters cross over between the different pods, but the sections [...] "definitely have a different feel" [...] from one another, as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes [...] "is {{a long time to}} hold a big bad or a single plot line, especially for an audience", and for the past two seasons, the series was able to have two separated halves that [...] "allows us to introduce a big bad. And then, something happens and we rise somebody new ... Now, there's three of those." [...] "Financial considerations" [...] were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season, as using LMDs does not [...] "cost as much as setting a guy's head on fire via CGI". In terms of writing the [...] "complicated season", Whedon said the writers were [...] "aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> create not just what we are presenting on plot, but letting the audience be one step ahead of us and being one step ahead of that." [...] He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story, an LMD story, and a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season. The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold, which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra. Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season, [...] "World's End", as an additional connection.|$|E

We don't have time to teach and train youngsters up here. <b>Our</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> win pennants, not run schools", he said. Franklin Lewis, sports writer and author, wrote [...] "Lajoie, in spite of his {{marvelous}} fielding and tremendous batting, was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager." [...] Lajoie recommended to Somers on August 17, 1909, he find the team a new manager, although he wanted to remain on the club as a player. Somers responded to Lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when Lajoie came back days later and announced the same decision, Somers acted quickly to find a replacement. Lajoie later described the decision to take on the added duties as a player-manager as the biggest mistake of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play. The highest-paid player in the league, he also offered a $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) reduction in salary. Somers promoted Naps coach Deacon [...] "Jim" [...] McGuire to manager. The team finished 7182 while Lajoie's [...]324 average was third in the AL and 33 doubles second. The Naps finished 1910 7181 but Lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors with a [...]384 average and 227 hits, both categories bettered only in Lajoie's 1901 campaign. His 51 doubles, a career-high, and 304 total bases led the majors, the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the majors in the latter category. Lajoie missed significant parts of back-to-back seasons, the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games. Stovall, the former Naps first baseman, replaced McGuire as the club's manager and the Naps finished 8073. Lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in May during a practice session in Chicago. He played in 117 games on the season, an increase of the 90 he played in one season before, but Cleveland, who had hired Joe Birmingham as the team's fifth manager since Lajoie gave up the role in 1909, finished 7578. Lajoie and Joe Jackson tied for the team lead with 90 RBIs. He finished fourth in the AL with a [...]368 batting average. In 1913, Birmingham and Lajoie had arguments in the open, including one incident in June when Lajoie cursed Birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump. Lajoie hit [...]335 on the year, the last time he would hit over [...]300 in his career.|$|E

40|$|Background: The City of Champaign {{was founded}} in 1861. Today, Champaign is a progressive, trend-setting {{community}} with a dependable city government that provides a stable infrastructure for growth. Employees of the City care about its citizens and are {{actively involved in the}} community. The client 2 ̆ 7 s old logo featured the City building and we were told that it <b>was</b> desirable <b>to</b> retain the building icon in the new logo. Based on the Los Angeles City Hall, the current City building was designed with art deco motifs that were popular with architects in the 1930 s. Located in downtown Champaign, the City building represents an enduring symbol of stability. Objective: We collaborated with a committee of seven people including the City Manager. The committee agreed that the new logo should convey responsibility, competence, integrity, trust and a sense of caring. We also agreed that the City 2 ̆ 7 s character is classic, conservative, established, orderly, sincere, open and energetic. Other logos that the committee liked include the University of Illinois pillar and the Prudential logo. As designers, <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a logo that satisfied everyone on the committee. As consultants, <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> assist the committee in reaching consensus. Solution: One month after being awarded the assignment, we presented a 26 -page proposal that outlined our solution. This proposal illustrated our process of exploration and the various studies we produced reducing the City building down to its essential elements. We arrived at a final illustration of the new City building icon after testing many different variations on the theme. After refinement of the typography, a finished black-and-white logo was presented and approved. Then we presented over 30 color combinations for the committee to consider. After discussion and review, the committee came to a consensus on the final color selection. Upon approval of the cllor logo, we produced an intranet web site with guidelines on the usage of the logo along with downloadable files and examples of applications. The entire process took five months to complete. [URL]...|$|R

2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking. He's always been famous for his version of the 4–3–3 with the wide wingers, all technically highly gifted and fast. This is his mark." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff {{is officially}} {{considered}} as the founding father of now famous Barça-Ajax school of football (also known as 'Barçajax school'), with a distinctive footballing philosophy and predominant style of play, that {{was born in}} Barcelona but has roots in the 1970s Dutch (Amsterdam) school of Total Football. La Masia, Barça's youth academy and talent factory, was among Cruyff's lasting legacy. It {{was the brainchild of}} Cruyff. In 1979, he wanted to establish a copy of the Ajax Youth Academy in Barcelona. His proposal was accepted by president Josep Núñez. It was ten years after the inception of the youth program, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was previous Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola. On 11 July 2010, Spain won the World Cup final with eight players from Barcelona; seven were from La Masia, and six of them were in the starting line-up: Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi, Sergio Busquets, and Pedro. This set a record for the most players to be provided by a club side for a team in a World Cup final. On 10 January 2011, La Masia achieved a record breaking honour becoming the first youth academy to have trained all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or in a single year, with Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Xavi. On 25 November 2012, {{for the first time in}} the club's history, away at Levante's Estadi Ciutat de València, Barcelona played with eleven players formed at La Masia. In an English biography of Pep Guardiola, Guillem Balagué writes, [...] "Cruyff introduced some passing drills into Barça's 'arterial' system. And since then, the rondos have been not just a method but a symbol of the club's playing style: of dominating and never losing the ball. Cruyff blended several ideas and concepts and converted them into a philosophy – the seeds of which were planted throughout a club in urgent need of a footballing identity. Until then, the first team of Barcelona had been comfortably living in a world of excuses and enemies, content with their role as victims when faced with Real Madrid, an institution seen from Catalonia as the club of the Establishment," [...] and adding, “Xavi Hernández describes the style in its purest form: 'I pass the ball and move, or I pass the ball and stay where I am. I make myself available to help you; I look at you. I stop, I keep my head up and look, and, above all, I open up the pitch. Whoever has the ball is running play. That comes from the school of Johan Cuyff and Pep Guardiola. This is Barça.'" [...] On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, former Barcelona manager Guardiola stated, [...] "Cruyff built the cathedral, <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> maintain and renovate it." [...] And one of the most famous La Masia graduates, Xavi, said, [...] "He [...] changed the idiosyncrasy of the club. He introduced the philosophy to keep the ball, to play in triangles, to attack. That philosophy remains true to this day. We're all students of Cruyff and his school of thought." ...|$|E
