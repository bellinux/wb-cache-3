A gentle pumping action minimizes product degradation. They also offer continuous and intermittent reversible flows and can operate dry for brief periods of time. Flow is relatively independent of changes in process pressure, too, so output is relatively constant and continuous.|$|R

40|$|A {{photometric}} method is proposed {{that allows the}} determination of phenolase activity in <b>olive</b> fruits, <b>olive</b> <b>pastes,</b> and virgin <b>olive</b> oil. The method {{can also be used}} to quantify partially purified phenolase from olives, and is based on the coupling between 4 -methyl-o-benzoquinone, the reaction product of phenolase toward its substrate 4 -methylcatechol, and the aromatic amine 4 -amino-N,N-diethylaniline. The deep-blue adduct arising from this reaction has been characterized by means of nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometric techniques and identified as 4 -(4 '-diethylamino-phenylimino) - 2 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl-cyclohexa- 2, 5 -dienone. This compound shows an absorption band, centered (in dichloromethane) at 617 nm, with an c of 11, 080 M(- 1) cm(- 1). The main advantage of the proposed method resides in the high absorption coefficient of the adduct and its ultraviolet/visible absorption pattern, with a gimel(max) in a spectral region void of significant interferences by the pigments that ultimately will probably be present in the extracts to be tested by this proposed method. The method has proven to be sensitive, specific, and reliable...|$|R

Four Italian commercial EVOO brands, all in both whole and stoned version, were considered in this study. The adopted chemometric methodologies were able to describe the different chemical features in phenolic and volatile compounds contained in the two types of oil by using unspecific IR spectral information. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed in cluster analysis to capture data patterns and to highlight differences between technological processes and EVOO brands. The PLS 1 -DA algorithm was used as supervised discriminant analysis to identify the different oil extraction procedures. Discriminant analysis was extended to the evaluation of possible adulteration by addition of aliquots of oil from whole paste to the most valuable oil from stoned olives. The statistical parameters from external validation of all the PLS models were very satisfactory, with low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and relative error (RE%) ...|$|R

50|$|People {{have used}} olive presses since Greeks first began {{pressing}} olives over 5,000 years ago. Roman olive presses survive {{to the present}} time, with a notable collection present at Volubilis in Morocco. An olive press works by applying pressure to <b>olive</b> <b>paste</b> to separate the liquid oil and vegetation water from the solid material. The oil and vegetation water are then separated by standard decantation.|$|E
50|$|All {{production}} {{begins by}} transforming the olive fruit into <b>olive</b> <b>paste</b> by crushing or pressing. This paste is then malaxed (slowly churned or mixed) {{to allow the}} microscopic oil droplets to agglomerate. The oil is then separated from the watery matter and fruit pulp {{with the use of}} a press (traditional method) or centrifugation (modern method). After extraction the remnant solid substance, called pomace, still contains a small quantity of oil.|$|E
50|$|The two-and-a-half-phase oil {{decanter}} is {{a compromise between}} the two previous types of decanters. It separates the <b>olive</b> <b>paste</b> into the standard three phases, but has a smaller need for added water and also a smaller vegetation water output. Therefore, the water content of the obtained pomace comes very close {{to that of the}} standard three-phase decanter, and the vegetation water output is relatively small, minimizing the residue management issues.|$|E
40|$|Olive oil {{flavouring}} with {{aromatic plants}} and spices {{is a traditional}} practice in Mediterranean gastronomy. The aim of this work was to compare the influence of two different flavouring techniques (infusion of spices into the oil vs. combined malaxation of <b>olives</b> <b>paste</b> and spices) on chemical and sensory quality of flavoured olive oil. In particular, oxidative and hydrolytic degradation (by routine and non-conventional analyses), phenolic profiles (by HPLC), volatile compounds (by SPME-GC/MS), antioxidant activity, and sensory properties (by a trained panel and by consumers) of the oils were evaluated. The obtained results evidenced that the malaxation method was more effective in extracting the phenolic compounds, with a significantly lower level of hydrolysis of secoiridoids. As a consequence, antioxidant activity was significantly lower in the oils obtained by infusion, which were characterized by a higher extent of the oxidative degradation. The volatile compounds were not significantly influenced by changing the flavouring method, apart for sulfur compounds that were more abundant in the oils obtained by the combined malaxation method. From a sensory point of view, more intense bitter and pungent tastes were perceived when the infusion method was adopted...|$|R

50|$|If {{ground with}} mill stones, the <b>olive</b> <b>paste</b> {{generally}} stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes. A shorter grinding process {{may result in}} a more raw paste that produces less oil and has a less ripe taste, a longer process may increase oxidation of the paste and reduce the flavor. After grinding, the <b>olive</b> <b>paste</b> is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked {{on top of each other}} in a column, then placed into the press. Pressure is then applied onto the column to separate the vegetal liquid from the paste. This liquid still contains a significant amount of water. Traditionally the oil was shed from the water by gravity (oil is less dense than water). This very slow separation process has been replaced by centrifugation, which is much faster and more thorough. The centrifuges have one exit for the (heavier) watery part and one for the oil. Olive oil should not contain significant traces of vegetal water as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms. The separation in smaller oil mills is not always perfect, thus sometimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at the bottom of oil bottles.|$|E
50|$|These disks {{are then}} {{put on a}} {{hydraulic}} piston, forming a pile. Pressure is applied on the disks, thus compacting the solid phase of the <b>olive</b> <b>paste</b> and percolating the liquid phases (oil and vegetation water). The applied hydraulic pressure can go to 400 atm. To facilitate separation of the liquid phases, water is run {{down the sides of}} the disks to increase the speed of percolation. The liquids are then separated either by a standard process of decantation or by means of a faster vertical centrifuge.|$|E

40|$|The intensities of the {{gustatory}} {{attributes of}} table olives {{is one of}} the sensory set of parameters evaluated by trained sensory panels accordingly to the recommendations of the International Olive Council. However this is an expensive and time-consuming process that only allows the evaluation of a limited number of samples per day. So, an electronic tongue coupled with multivariate statistical tools, is proposed for assessing the median intensities of acid, bitter and salty tastes perceived in table olives. The results showed that the device, coupled with linear discriminant analysis, {{could be used as a}} taste sensor, allowing classifying aqueous standard solutions according to the three basic tastes (repeated K-fold cross-validation: 98 % ±  3 % of correct classifications) based on the electrochemical signals of 5 sensors. It was demonstrated that the taste sensor with multiple linear regression models, enabled quantifying the median intensities of the three basic tastes (repeated K-fold cross-validation: R 2  ?  0. 96  ±  0. 04) perceived in table olives by a trained sensory panel, based on the potentiometric fingerprints (2125 signal profiles) of aqueous <b>olive</b> <b>pastes</b> and brines.

50|$|Some producers, {{in order}} to {{maximise}} product quality, choose to combine the traditional grinding method, the stone mill, with a modern decanter. This technique produces more selective grinding of the olives, reduces the malaxation time <b>olive</b> <b>paste,</b> and avoids the complicated cleaning of the olive press fibre disks. Because {{the use of the}} stone mill requires a loading and unloading phase, this extraction method is discontinuous, i.e., there are times when all the machinery is stopped, therefore it is generally not used on a large commercial scale, being applied only by small scale olive mills producing high quality olive oil.|$|E
50|$|The IOC officially governs 95 {{per cent}} of {{international}} production and holds great {{influence over the}} rest.

Olive oil is classified by how it was produced, by its chemistry, and by its flavor. All production begins by transforming the olive fruit into <b>olive</b> <b>paste.</b> This paste is then malaxed to allow the microscopic oil droplets to concentrate. The oil is extracted by means of pressure (traditional method) or centrifugation (modern method). After extraction the remnant solid substance, called pomace, still contains a small quantity of oil.|$|E
50|$|The {{two phases}} oil {{decanter}} was created {{as an attempt}} to solve these problems. Sacrificing part of its extraction capability, it uses less added water thus reducing the phenol washing. The <b>olive</b> <b>paste</b> is separated into two phases: oil and wet pomace. This type of decanter, instead of having three exits (oil, water, and solids), has only two. The water is expelled by the decanter coil together with the pomace, resulting in a wetter pomace that is much harder to process industrially. Many pomace oil extraction facilities refuse to work with these materials because the energy costs of drying the pomace for the hexane oil extraction often make the extraction process sub-economical. In practice, then, the two phases decanter solves the phenol washing problem but increases the residue management problem. This residue management problem has been reduced by the collection of this wetter pomace and being transported to specialized facilities called extractors which heat the pomace between 45ºc and 50ºc and can extract up to a further 2 litres per 100 kilos of pomace using adapted two-phase decanters.|$|E

40|$|Table olives {{are prone}} to the {{appearance}} of sensory defects that decrease their quality {{and in some cases}} result in olives unsuitable for consumption. The evaluation of the type and intensity of the sensory negative attributes of table olives is recommended by the International Olive Council, although not being legally required for commercialization. However, the accomplishment of this task requires the training and implementation of sensory panels according to strict directives, turning out in a time-consuming and expensive procedure that involves a degree of subjectivity. In this work, an electronic tongue is proposed as a taste sensor device for evaluating the intensity of sensory defects of table olives. The potentiometric signal profiles gathered allowed establishing multiple linear regression models, based on the most informative subsets of signals (from 24 to 29 recorded during the analysis of <b>olive</b> aqueous <b>pastes</b> and brine solutions) selected using a simulated annealing meta-heuristic algorithm. The models enabled the prediction of the median intensities (R 2 ≥ 0. 942 and RMSE ≤ 0. 356, for leave-one-out or repeated K-fold cross-validation procedures) of butyric, musty, putrid, winey-vinegary, and zapateria negative sensations being, in general, the predicted intensities within the range of intensities perceived by the sensory panel. Indeed, based on the predicted mean intensities of the sensory defects, the electrochemical-chemometric approach developed could correctly classify 86. 4 % of the table olive samples according to their trade category based on a sensory panel evaluation and following the International Olive Council regulations (i. e., extra, 1 st choice, 2 nd choice, and olives that may not be sold as table olives). So, the satisfactory overall predictions achieved demonstrate that the electronic tongue could be a complementary tool for assessing table olive defects, reducing the effort of trained panelists and minimizing the risk of subjective evaluations.

The third innovative method is the implementation of the ultrasound before the <b>olive</b> <b>paste</b> malaxation. The objective of the study is to verify the effect of the treatments {{on the quality of the}} product, assessed by means of the chemical characteristics, the phenol composition and the radical scavenging activity of the resulting oils.
