The intracellular accumulation of [3 H]anandamide by human astrocytoma cells was prevented by <b>olvanil</b> with a K(i) value of 14. 1 ± 7. 1 μM.

40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} {{similarity between}} some synthetic agonists of vanilloid receptors, such as <b>olvanil</b> (N-vanillyl-cis- 9 -octadecenoamide), and the `endocannabinoid' anandamide (arachidonoyl-ethanolamide, AEA), suggests possible {{interactions between the}} cannabinoid and vanilloid signalling systems. Here we report that <b>olvanil</b> is a stable and potent inhibitor of AEA facilitated transport into rat basophilic leukemia (RBL- 2 H 3) cells. <b>Olvanil</b> blocked both the uptake and the hydrolysis of [14 C]AEA by intact RBL- 2 H 3 cells (IC 50 = 9 μM), while capsaicin and pseudocapsaicin (N-vanillyl-nonanamide) were much less active. <b>Olvanil</b> was more potent than previously reported inhibitors of AEA facilitated transport, i. e. phloretin (IC 50 = 80 μM), AM 404 (12. 9 % inhibition at 10 μM) or oleoylethanolamide (27. 5 % inhibition at 10 μM). <b>Olvanil</b> was a poor inhibitor of [14 C]AEA hydrolysis by RBL- 2 H 3 and N 18 TG 2 cell membranes, suggesting that the inhibitory effect on [14 C]AEA breakdown observed in intact cells was due to inhibition of [14 C]AEA uptake. <b>Olvanil</b> was stable to enzymatic hydrolysis, and (i) displaced the binding of high affinity cannabinoid receptor ligands to membrane preparations from N 18 TG 2 cells and guinea pig forebrain (Ki= 1. 64 – 7. 08 μM), but not from cells expressing the CB 2 cannabinoid receptor subtype; (ii) inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP formation in intact N 18 TG 2 cells (IC 50 = 1. 60 μM), this effect being reversed by the selective CB 1 antagonist SR 141716 A. Pseudocapsaicin, but not capsaicin, also selectively bound to CB 1 receptor-containing membranes. These data suggest {{that some of the}} analgesic actions of <b>olvanil</b> may be due to its interactions with the endogenous cannabinoid system, and may lead to the design of a novel class of cannabimimetics with potential therapeutic applications as analgesics...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{fatty acid}} amides such as {{anandamide}} (AEA) and <b>olvanil</b> are agonists for the transient receptor potential, vanilloid- 1 (TRPV 1) receptor, {{but have been}} found to activate TRPV 1 -containing C-fibers in some tissues but not others. We used extracellular recording and whole-cell patch clamp techniques to investigate the effect of <b>olvanil</b> and AEA on different types of vagal C-fibers innervating the same tissue, namely jugular and nodose vagal C-fibers in guinea pig lungs. A 30 [*]s exposure to AEA and <b>olvanil</b> caused action potential discharge in all nodose C-fiber innervating lung but failed to activate jugular C-fibers innervating lung and airways. The activation of nodose C-fibers was blocked by the TRPV 1 antagonist iodo-resiniferatoxin. In whole-cell patch clamp recordings of dissociated nodose and jugular capsaicin-sensitive neurons labeled from lungs and airways, <b>olvanil</b> induced large TRPV 1 -dependent inward currents in cell bodies of both nodose and jugular ganglion neurons. Prolonged exposure (up to 5 [*]min) to <b>olvanil</b> caused action potential discharge in jugular C-fiber innervating lung but the onset latency was four times longer in jugular than in nodose C-fibers. The onsets of capsaicin response in nodose and jugular C-fibers were not different. Decreasing the tissue temperature to 25 °C increased the onset latency of olvanil-induced activation of nodose C-fibers 2 – 3 -fold, but did not effect the latency of the capsaicin response. Capsaicin, <b>olvanil,</b> and AEA stimulate jugular C-fibers leading to tachykinergic contractions of isolated bronchi. The time to reach half-maximum is more than four times longer for <b>olvanil</b> and AEA, as compared to capsaicin in evoking contractions. We conclude that brief exposure to certain fatty acid amides, such as AEA and <b>olvanil</b> activate nodose but not jugular C-fiber terminals in the lungs. We hypothesize that this is because the nodose C-fiber terminals are equipped with a temperature-dependent mechanism for effectively and rapidly transporting the TRPV 1 agonists so that they gain access to the intracellular binding sites on TRPV 1. This transport mechanism may be differently expressed in two distinct subtypes of pulmonary C-fiber terminals innervating the same tissue...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study a novel 96 -well plate assay system was used to {{characterize}} pharmacologically the vanilloid receptor in the dorsal spinal cord of the rat. When activated, this receptor stimulates release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from the central terminals of the afferent nerves. Capsaicin, resiniferatoxin (RTX) and <b>olvanil</b> each evoked a concentration-dependent increase in CGRP release with pEC 50 values of 6. 55 ± 0. 07, 7. 90 ± 0. 24 and 6. 19 ± 0. 15 respectively. RTX and <b>olvanil</b> were partial agonists with respect to capsaicin. All concentration-effect curves were bell-shaped. The vanilloid receptor antagonist, capsazepine (10 [*]μM) {{had no effect on}} basal peptide release but inhibited the CGRP release evoked by all 3 agonists to a similar extent. These results suggest that the antagonistic effects of capsazepine were agonist-independent. The capsaicin-sensitive cation channel blocker, ruthenium red (10 [*]μM) had no effect on basal CGRP release, but antagonized the peptide release evoked by capsaicin, <b>olvanil</b> and RTX. The pharmacology of the vanilloid receptor in the rat dorsal spinal cord is not identical to that previously found in other systems. The reason for these differences is unclear, but the possibility of multiple classes of receptor cannot at this stage be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|Activation of vanilloid receptors on {{sensory nerve}} {{terminals}} in the commissural {{nucleus of the}} solitary tract (cNTS) of rats with capsaicin, produces respiratory slowing. In this study, we used microinjection techniques employing pungent and non-pungent vanilloids to further characterize vanilloid receptors in the cNTS. Microinjection of the pungent vanilloid, resiniferatoxin (RTX), into the cNTS of urethane-anaesthetized rats, dose-dependently reduced respiratory rate without affecting tidal volume. RTX was 20 fold more potent at slowing respiration (∼ED 50, 100 pmol) than capsaicin (∼ED 50, 2 nmol). Doses of RTX greater than 100 pmol caused either irregular (dyspnoeic) breathing or terminal apnoea (> 250 pmol). The respiratory slowing response to RTX (75 pmol), was dose-dependently attenuated by injecting RTX (but not vehicle) into the same site 60 min earlier. The non-pungent phorbol derivative of RTX, phorbol 12 -phenylacetete 13 -acetate 20 -homovanillate (PPAHV, 0. 1 – 1 nmol), also slowed respiration (ED 50, ∼ 1 nmol) and almost abolished response to RTX (75 pmol) injected into the same site 60 min later. In contrast to RTX, PPAHV and capsaicin, the putative endogenous vanilloid receptor agonist, arachidonyl ethanolamide (AEA), and non-pungent capsaicin derivative, <b>olvanil,</b> had no direct effect on respiration. However, both AEA and <b>olvanil</b> dose-dependently reduced the respiratory response to injection of RTX (75 pmol) 60 min later into the same site (EC 50 s, for AEA and <b>olvanil,</b> ∼ 2 and 0. 2 nmol, respectively). These studies suggest that both pungent and non-pungent vanilloids interact with vanilloid receptors in the cNTS. However, whereas RTX and PPAHV activate and subsequently desensitize vanilloid receptors on sensory nerve terminals in the cNTS, <b>olvanil</b> and AEA fail to activate despite readily desensitizing responses to RTX in this region...|$|E

To explore how these nonpungent analogs differ from capsaicin, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on cultured rat trigeminal ganglion neurons.

Vanillamides are unmatched {{in terms of}} structural simplicity, straightforward synthesis, and safety compared with the more powerful TRPV 1 agonists, like the structurally complex phorboid compound resiniferatoxin. We have modified the fatty acyl chain of <b>olvanil</b> to obtain ultra-potent analogs. The insertion of a hydroxyl group at C- 12 yielded a compound named rinvanil, after ricinoleic acid, significantly less potent than <b>olvanil</b> (EC(50) = 6 versus 0. 7 nM), but more versatile in terms of structural modifications {{because of the presence}} of an additional functional group. Acetylation and phenylacetylation of rinvanil re-established and dramatically enhanced, respectively, its potency at hTRPV 1. With a two-digit picomolar EC(50) (90 pM), phenylacetylrinvanil (PhAR, IDN 5890) is the most potent vanillamide ever described with potency comparable with that of resiniferatoxin (EC(50), 11 pM). Benzoyl- and phenylpropionylrinvanil were as potent and less potent than PhAR, respectively, whereas configurational inversion to ent-PhAR and cyclopropanation (but not hydrogenation or epoxidation) of the double bond were tolerated. Finally, iodination of the aromatic hydroxyl caused a dramatic switch in functional activity, generating compounds that behaved as TRPV 1 antagonists rather than agonists. Since the potency of PhAR was maintained in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and, particularly, in the rat urinary bladder, this compound was investigated in an in vivo rat model of urinary incontinence and proved as effective as resiniferatoxin at reducing bladder detrusor overactivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} that paracetamol is metabolized to the potent TRPV 1 activator N-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 5 Z, 8 Z, 11 Z, 14 Z-eicosatetraenamide (AM 404) {{and that this}} metabolite contributes to paracetamol’s antinociceptive effect in rodents via activation of TRPV 1 in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) has provided a potential strategy for developing novel analgesics. Here we validated this strategy by examining the metabolism and antinociceptive activity of the de-acetylated paracetamol metabolite 4 -aminophenol and 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzylamine (HMBA), both of which may undergo a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) -dependent biotransformation to potent TRPV 1 activators in the brain. Systemic administration of 4 -aminophenol and HMBA led to a dose-dependent formation of AM 404 plus N-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 9 Z-octadecenamide (HPODA) and arvanil plus <b>olvanil</b> in the mouse brain, respectively. The order of potency of these lipid metabolites as TRPV 1 activators was arvanil = <b>olvanil</b> [...] AM 404. HPODA. Both 4 -aminophenol and HMBA displayed antinociceptive activity in various rodent pain tests. The formation of AM 404, arvanil and <b>olvanil,</b> but not HPODA, and the antinociceptive effects of 4 -aminophenol and HMBA were substantially reduced or disappeared in FAAH null mice. The activity of 4 -aminophenol in the mouse formalin, von Frey and tail immersion tests was also lost in TRPV 1 null mice.

40|$|Anandamide {{acts as a}} full vanilloid {{receptor}} agonist in many bioassay systems, {{but it is a}} weak activator of primary afferents in the airways. To address this discrepancy, we compared the effect of different vanilloid {{receptor agonist}}s in isolated airways and mesenteric arteries of guinea pig using preparations containing different phenotypes of the capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerve. We found that anandamide is a powerful vasodilator of mesenteric arteries but a weak constrictor of main bronchi. These effects of anandamide are mediated by vanilloid receptors on primary afferents and do not involve cannabinoid receptors. Anandamide also contracts isolated lung strips, an effect caused by the hydrolysis of anandamide and subsequent formation of cyclooxygenase products. Although capsaicin is equally potent in bronchi and mesenteric arteries, anandamide, resiniferatoxin, and particularly <b>olvanil</b> are significantly less potent in bronchi. Competition experiments with the vanilloid receptor antagonist capsazepine did not provide evidence of vanilloid receptor heterogeneity. Arachidonoyl- 5 -methoxytryptamine (VDM 13), an inhibitor of the anandamide membrane transporter, attenuates responses to <b>olvanil</b> and anandamide, but not capsaicin and resiniferatoxin, in mesenteric arteries. VDM 13 did not affect responses to these agonists in bronchi, suggesting that the anandamide membrane transporter is absent in this phenotype of the sensory nerve. Computer simulations using an operational model of agonism were consistent, with differences in intrinsic efficacy and receptor content being responsible for the remaining differences in agonist potency between the tissues. This study describes differences between vanilloid receptor agonists regarding tissue selectivity and provides a conceptual framework for developing tissue-selective vanilloid receptor agonists devoid of bronchoconstrictor activity...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Nasal {{transient}} receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) stimulation with capsaicin produces serous and mucinous secretion in {{the human}} nasal airway. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to examine topical effects of various TRP ion channel agonists on symptoms and secretion of specific mucins: mucin 5 subtype AC (MUC 5 AC) and B (MUC 5 B). Methods: Healthy individuals were subjected to nasal challenges with TRPV 1 agonists (capsaicin, <b>olvanil</b> and anandamide), TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA 1) agonists (cinnamaldehyde and mustard oil) and a TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM 8) agonist (menthol). Symptoms were monitored, and nasal lavages were analysed for MUC 5 AC and MUC 5 B, i. e. specific mucins associated with airway diseases. In separate groups of healthy subjects, nasal biopsies and brush samples were analysed for TRPV 1 and MUC 5 B, using immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. Finally, calcium responses and ciliary beat frequency were measured on isolated ciliated epithelial cells. Results: All TRP agonists induced nasal pain or smart. Capsaicin, <b>olvanil</b> and mustard oil also produced rhinorrhea. Lavage fluids obtained after challenge with capsaicin and mustard oil indicated increased levels of MUC 5 B, whereas MUC 5 AC was unaffected. MUC 5 B and TRPV 1 immunoreactivities were primarily localized to submucosal glands and peptidergic nerve fibres, respectively. Although trpv 1 transcripts were detected in nasal brush samples, functional responses to capsaicin could not be induced in isolated ciliated epithelial cells.

Pharmacological characterisation confirmed expression of TRPV 1 with comparable pharmacology to non-neuronal models in this thesis. For example, capsaicin pEC 50 /capsazepine pKB in HEk (human TRPV 1) and SH-SY 5 Y were 6. 77 / 6. 75 and 6. 63 / 7. 44 respectively.

Then intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca 2 +]i) were monitored using FLIPR, before and after the addition of various agonists. The rank order of potency of agonists (resiniferatoxin (RTX) >capsaicin>olvanil>PPAHV) was as expected, and all were full agonists. The potencies of capsaicin and <b>olvanil,</b> but not RTX or PPAHV, were enhanced at pH 6. 4 (pEC 50 values of 7. 47 ± 0. 06, 7. 16 ± 0. 06, 8. 19 ± 0. 06 and 6. 02 ± 0. 03 respectively at pH 7. 4 vs 7. 71 ± 0. 05, 7. 58 ± 0. 14, 8. 10 ± 0. 05 and 6. 04 ± 0. 08 at pH 6. 4). Capsazepine, isovelleral and ruthenium red all inhibited the capsaicin (100 [*]nM) -induced Ca 2 + response in rVR 1 -HEK 293 cells, with pKB values of 7. 52 ± 0. 08, 6. 92 ± 0. 11 and 8. 09 ± 0. 12 respectively (n= 6 each).

40|$|Transient {{receptor}} potential vanilloid 1 (TRPVl) is {{an important}} molecular detector of painful stimuli and it is widely accepted that TRPVl {{is involved in the}} development of chronic pain conditions, which makes it an attractive target to control pain. The aim of this thesis is to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modulation of this receptor by vanilloids, cannabinoids and other lipid mediator using in vitro and in vivo rat models of pain. First, in vitro calcium imaging studies demonstrated that capsaicin and <b>olvanil</b> produced a robust calcium signal in cultured ORG cells, in a TRPVI-dependent manner. The capsaicin-evoked calcium response consisted of an initial peak followed by a decaying plateau phase; both phases of the response were abolished when cells were suprafused with calcium-free buffer. Switching to a calcium-free buffer immediately after the application of capsaicin did not, however, alter the plateau phase of the response. Furthermore, depleting the internal calcium stores using thapsigargin (1 μM) also did not alter the plateau phase. <b>Olvanil</b> evoked a smaller calcium signal, in comparison to capsaicin, but it was more effective at desensitising TRPV I. When comparing the kinetics of the calcium responses of these two agonists, / it was clear that {{there was no difference in}} the latency to the peak response to capsaicin or <b>olvanil</b> and, therefore, this is unlikely to. contribute to differences in desensitisation. The synthetic cannabinoid agonist HU 210 (1 J!M) significantly inhibited capsaicin- evoked calcium responses both in terms of the peak response and the decaying plateau response. The onset of action of HU 210 was investigated, with cells suprafused with HU 210 for varying intervals (1, 4 or 15 minutes). Maximal inhibitory effects of HU 210 on capsaicin-evoked calcium responses were observed after 4 minutes of ii exposure. The inhibitory effects of HU 21 0 were attenuated by pre-treatment with the selective CB 1 receptor antagonist SR 141716 A (1 μM), and by pre-treatment with the G, protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX, 1 mg/ml). Pre-treatment with thapsigargin (1 JlM) also decreased the inhibitory effects of HU 210. Work in this thesis also demonstrated that forskolin pre-treatment (1 JlM, 15 minutes) attenuated the ability of HU 210 to inhibit the initial peak of the capsaicin-evoked calcium response, whereas the ability of HU 21 0 to attenuate the whole response (peak + plateau) was unaltered by forskolin. This finding was further supported by the observation that there was a tendency for HU 210 to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP production in the DRG-like F 11 cell line. Finally, this thesis demonstrated that the essential fatty acid linoleic acid (1 mM) and the linoleic acid metabolites 9 - and 13 -HODE (100 μM) produced a calcium response in DRG cells in a TRPVI-dependent manner. Pre-exposing the cells to the selective 15 -LOX inhibitor PD 146176 (10 μM) significantly inhibited linoleic acid-evoked calcium responses, but did not alter the 9 - or 13 -HODE-evoked calcium responses. In the in vivo rat model of inflammatory pain, intraplantar injection of 2 % carrageenan (100 JlI) significantly increased the weight bearing difference between the two I hindpaws, and the paw oedema 4 h post-injection compared to saline-treated rats. Pre- administration of intraplantar PD 146176 (50 Jlg/ 50 Jll) or anti-S-and 13 -HODE (25 Jlg each) antibodies significantly attenuated the carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia compared to vehicle. In conclusion, TRPV 1 activity can be modulated by different lipid mediators and this modulation may have a therapeutic potential for the control of pain.

We found that four known AMT inhibitors, AM 404, arvanil, <b>olvanil</b> and linvanil, activate VR 1 receptors at concentrations 400 – 10   000 -fold lower than those necessary to inhibit the AMT.

The results show that lipophilicity could play an important role for the interference with TJ and that the mechanism is independent from the ion channel TRPV- 1 and hence on the flux of calcium into the cells. In summary, we synthesized 4 derivatives of capsaicin of lower lipophilicity and compared their properties with other well-known vanilloids. We show that these compounds are able to enhance the permeability of a hydrophilic macromolecule, by opening the TJ for a shorter time than capsaicin.

Sertoli cells also contribute to protection of spermatogenetic cells. Here, we showed that TRPV 1 is expressed in rat Sertoli cells and regulates an acid sensing Cl channel (ASCC). The expression of TRPV 1 in rat Sertoli cells was demonstrated by RT-PCR, immunostaining and calcium measurement experiments. ASCC activity was inhibited by capsaicin (IC 50 = 214. 3 1. 6 nM), nM), <b>olvanil</b> (IC 50 = 400 1. 7 pM) and resiniferatoxin (IC 50 = 9. 3 1. 5 nM) but potentiated by capsazepine (EC 50 = 5. 3 1. 3 mM) and ruthenium red (EC 50 = 2. 3 1. 5 mM). In the human airway epithelial cell line Calu- 3 in which ASCC can be detected but not TRPV 1, capsaicin and capsazepine were without any effect. Finally {{the application of the}} non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug ibuprofen prevented the control of ASCC by TRPV 1. Our study provides the first evidence for a regulation by TRPV 1 of an acid sensing chloride channel in rat Sertoli cells. TRPV 1 and ASCC may thus be considered as new potential physiological regulators of spermatogenesis and targets for pharmacological treatments of reproductive disorders as cryptorchidism, Sertoli cell tumors or torsion of the spermatic cord...|$|E
40|$|The endocannabinoid {{anandamide}} is {{an emerging}} potential signalling molecule in the cardiovascular system. Anandamide causes vasodilatation, bradycardia and hypotension in animals {{and has been}} implicated in the pathophysiology of endotoxic, haemorrhagic and cardiogenic shock, but its vascular effects have not been studied in man. Human forearm blood flow and skin microcirculatory flow were recorded using venous occlusion plethysmography and laser-Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI), respectively. Each test drug was infused into the brachial artery or applied topically on the skin followed by a standardized pin-prick to disrupt the epidermal barrier. Anandamide failed to affect forearm blood flow when administered intra-arterially at infusion rates of 0. 3 – 300 [*]nmol[*]min− 1. The highest infusion rate led to an anandamide concentration of approximately 1 [*]μM in venous blood as measured by mass spectrometry. Dermal application of anandamide significantly increased skin microcirculatory flow and coapplication of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) antagonist capsazepine inhibited this effect. The TRPV 1 agonists capsaicin, <b>olvanil</b> and arvanil all induced concentration-dependent increases in skin blood flow and burning pain when administered dermally. Coapplication of capsazepine inhibited blood flow and pain responses to all three TRPV 1 agonists. This study shows that locally applied anandamide is a vasodilator in the human skin microcirculation. The {{results are consistent with}} this lipid being an activator of TRPV 1 on primary sensory nerves, but do not support a role for anandamide as a circulating vasoactive hormone in the human forearm vascular bed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Among anti-hypertension drugs, calcium (Ca 2 +) antagonists cause gingival {{overgrowth}} {{as a side}} effect. We previously {{discovered that}} this side effect was due to elevation of the calcium concentration in the cytosol ([Ca 2 +]i). Ca 2 + entry through non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) and Ca 2 + release from intracellular Ca 2 + stores {{are involved in this}} [Ca 2 +]i elevation. Furthermore, we discovered that calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) participate in nifedipine-induced [Ca 2 +]i elevation. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been identified as NSCCs. In the present study, we undertook experiments to determine if TRPV 1 channels are present in gingival fibroblasts and to ascertain if nifedipine-activated NSCCs are TRPV 1 channels. Methods: Normal human gingival fibroblast Gin- 1 cells were used. The [Ca 2 +]i was measured using a video-imaging analysis system with the Ca 2 +-sensitive fluorescent dye fura- 2 /AM. Results: The NSCC inhibitor SKF 96365 significantly inhibited nifedipine-induced [Ca 2 +]i elevation. TRPV 1 channel agonists such as capsaicin, <b>olvanil</b> and resiniferatoxin concentration-dependently elevated the [Ca 2 +]i. The TRPV 1 channel activator anandamide concentration-dependently increased the [Ca 2 +]i. The TRPV 1 channel antagonists cap-sazepine, AMG 9810, iodoresiniferatoxin, ruthenium red, and SB 366791 significantly inhibited nifedipine-induced [Ca 2 +]i elevation. Conclusion: These results suggest that Ca 2 + entry through TRPV 1 channels is involved in the nifedi-pine-induced [Ca 2 +]i elevation seen in gingival fibroblasts.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{temperature}} dependency, saturability, selective inhibition, and substrate specificity, it has been proposed that an anandamide transporter exists. However, all of these studies have examined anandamide accumulation at long time points when downstream effects such as metabolism and intracellular sequestration are operative. In the current study, we have investigated the initial rates (< 1 min) of anandamide accumulation in neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells in culture and have determined that uptake is not saturable with increasing concentrations of anandamide. However, anandamide hydrolysis, after uptake in neuroblastoma cells, was saturable at steady-state time points (5 min), suggesting that fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) {{may be responsible for}} observed saturation of uptake at long time points. In general, arvanil, <b>olvanil,</b> and N-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) arachidonylamide (AM 404) have been characterized as transport inhibitors in studies using long incubations. However, we found these “transport inhibitors” did not inhibit anandamide uptake in neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells at short time points (40 sec or less). Furthermore, we confirmed that these inhibitors in vitro were actually inhibitors of FAAH. Therefore, the likely mechanism by which the transport inhibitors raise anandamide levels to exert pharmacological effects is by inhibiting FAAH, and they should be reevaluated in this context. Immunofluorescence has indicated that FAAH staining resides mainly on intracellular membranes of neuroblastoma cells, and {{this finding is consistent with}} our observed kinetics of anandamide hydrolysis. In summary, these data suggest that anandamide uptake is a process of simple diffusion. This process is driven by metabolism and other downstream events, rather than by a specific membrane-associated anandamide carrier...|$|E
40|$|Vasodilator {{responses}} to endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and anandamide in isolated arteries were investigated. A {{combination of the}} potassium channel blockers charybdotoxin and apamin inhibits EDHF-mediated relaxations. Experiments in which charybdotoxin or apamin was substituted with other potassium channel inhibitors indicated that small- and intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels contribute to EDHF-mediated relaxations. The possibility that EDHF is potassium ions was also examined. Potassium ions failed to mimic the action of EDHF and no evidence was found for involvement of Na+/K+ ATPase and inwardly rectifying potassium channels in EDHF-mediated responses. In {{the presence of the}} Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor ouabain, acetylcholine and KCl stimulated release of CGRP from sensory nerves. Relaxant {{responses to}} the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide were examined in isolated rat and guinea pig arteries. Cannabinoid receptors did not mediate anandamide-induced relaxations. Capsaicin pretreatment, the CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP 8 - 37 and the vanilloid receptor antagonist capsazepine inhibited anandamide-induced relaxations, indicating that vanilloid receptors on perivascular sensory nerves mediate the effects of anandamide. Anandamide also activated the cloned rat vanilloid receptor (VR 1). Effects of anandamide and related vanilloid receptor ligands in guinea-pig mesenteric arteries and main bronchi were compared. Capsaicin was equally potent in the two tissues, while anandamide, resiniferatoxin and <b>olvanil</b> were more potent vasodilators than bronchoconstrictors. Schild plots for capsazepine yielded similar pA 2 values in both tissues. Data simulations suggested that the differences in effects of the vanilloid receptor agonists might be explained by differences in agonist efficacies and receptor densities rather than by receptor heterogeneity...|$|E
40|$|The {{endogenous}} {{cannabinoid receptor}} agonist anandamide (AEA) {{and the related}} compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) are inactivated by transport into cells followed by metabolism by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The cellular uptake of AEA has been characterized in detail, whereas less {{is known about the}} properties of the PEA uptake, in particular in neuronal cells. In the present study, the pharmacological and functional properties of PEA and AEA uptake have been investigated in mouse Neuro- 2 a neuroblastoma and, for comparison, in rat RBL- 2 H 3 basophilic leukaemia cells. Saturable uptake of PEA and AEA into both cell lines were demonstrated with apparent KM values of 28 [*]μM (PEA) and 10 [*]μM (AEA) in Neuro- 2 a cells, and 30 [*]μM (PEA) and 9. 3 [*]μM (AEA) in RBL- 2 H 3 cells. Both PEA and AEA uptake showed temperature-dependence but only the AEA uptake was sensitive to treatment with Pronase and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The AEA uptake was inhibited by AM 404, 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG), R 1 - and S 1 -methanandamide, arachidonic acid and <b>olvanil</b> with similar potencies for the two cell types. PEA, up to a concentration of 100 [*]μM, did not affect AEA uptake in either cell line. AEA, 2 -AG, arachidonic acid, R 1 -methanandamide, Δ 9 -THC, and cannabidiol inhibited PEA transport in both cell lines. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin inhibited the AEA uptake but had very weak effects on the uptake of PEA. From these data, it can be concluded that PEA is transported in to cells both by passive diffusion and by a facilitated transport that is pharmacologically distinguishable from AEA uptake...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{inhibition of}} anandamide (AEA) hydrolysis by {{fatty acid amide}} hydrolase (FAAH) attenuates pain in animal models of osteoarthritis (OA) but has failed in clinical trials. This may have occurred because AEA also activates transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV 1), which contributes to pain development. Therefore, we investigated {{the effectiveness of the}} dual FAAH-TRPV 1 blocker OMDM- 198 in an MIA-model of osteoarthritic pain. We first investigated the MIA-induced model of OA by (1) characterizing the pain phenotype and degenerative changes within the joint using X-ray microtomography and (2) evaluating nerve injury and inflammation marker (ATF- 3 and IL- 6) expression in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of osteoarthritic rats and differences in gene and protein expression of the cannabinoid CB 1 receptors FAAH and TRPV 1. Furthermore, we compared OMDM- 198 with compounds acting exclusively on FAAH or TRPV 1. Osteoarthritis was accompanied by the fragmentation of bone microstructure and destroyed cartilage. An increase of the mRNA levels of ATF 3 and IL- 6 and an upregulation of AEA receptors and FAAH in the dorsal root ganglia were observed. OMDM- 198 showed antihyperalgesic effects in the OA model, which were comparable with those of a selective TRPV 1 antagonist, SB- 366, 791, and a selective FAAH inhibitor, URB- 597. The effect of OMDM- 198 was attenuated by the CB 1 receptor antagonist, AM- 251, and by the nonpungent TRPV 1 agonist, <b>olvanil,</b> suggesting its action as an "indirect" CB 1 agonist and TRPV 1 antagonist. These results suggest an innovative strategy for the treatment of OA, which may yield more satisfactory results than those obtained so far with selective FAAH inhibitors in human OA...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Anandamide, an {{endogenous}} lipid, activates both cannabinoid (CB(1)) and vanilloid (VR 1) receptors, both {{of which}} are co-expressed in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells. Activation of either receptor results in analgesia but the relative contribution of CB(1) and VR 1 in anandamide-induced analgesia remains controversial. Here we compare the in vitro pharmacology of recombinant and endogenous VR 1 receptors using calcium imaging, in clonal and DRG cells, respectively. We also consider the contribution of CB(1) and VR 1 receptors to anandamide-induced analgesia. METHODS: Using a Flurometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR), calcium imaging has been used to study the effects of several vanilloid and cannabinoid ligands in rat VR 1 -transfected HEK 293 (rVR 1 -HEK) cells and in DRG cells. The effect of pre-exposure of several vanilloid and cannabinoids has also been compared in DRG cells. RESULTS: The VR 1 agonists capsaicin, <b>olvanil,</b> (N-(4 -hydroxyphenyl-arachinoylamide) (AM 404) and anandamide caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2 +) ](i)), with similar temporal profiles in both rVR 1 -HEK and DRG cells, and potency (pEC(50)) values of 8. 25 (SEM 0. 11), 8. 37 (0. 04), 6. 96 (0. 06), 5. 85 (0. 01) and 7. 45 (0. 10), 7. 55 (0. 07), 6. 10 (0. 13), approximately 5. 5, respectively. These responses were inhibited by the VR 1 antagonist capsazepine (1 micro M). In contrast, application of synthetic cannabinoid antagonists failed to inhibit the anandamide-induced increase in [Ca(2 +) ](i). Reapplication of VR 1 agonists significantly inhibited a subsequent challenge to either capsaicin or anandamide in either cell type, whilst pre-exposure to cannabinoid agonists were without effect. CONCLUSION: Here we provide evidence that the pharmacology of recombinant rVR 1 receptors is similar to those endogenously expressed in DRG cells. Moreover, we have shown that VR 1, but not CB(1), receptors are involved in anandamide-induced responses in dorsal root primary neurones in vitro. Therefore, the analgesic properties of anandamide are likely to be mediated, at least in part, by VR 1 activation in DRG cells in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{contributions}} of brain cannabinoid (CB) receptors, typically CB 1 (CB type 1) receptors, to the behavioral effects of nicotine (NC) {{have been reported}} to involve brain transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) receptors, and the activation of candidate endogenous TRPV 1 ligands is expected to be therapeutically effective. In the present study, the effects of TRPV 1 ligands with or without affinity for CB 1 receptors were examined on NC-induced depression-like behavioral alterations in a mouse model in order to elucidate the "antidepressant-like" {{contributions of}} TRPV 1 receptors against the NC-induced "depression" observed in various types of tobacco abuse. Results Repeated subcutaneous NC treatments (NC group: 0. 3 mg/kg, 4 days), like repeated immobilization stress (IM) (IM group: 10 min, 4 days), caused depression-like behavioral alterations in both the forced swimming (reduced swimming behaviors) and the tail suspension (increased immobility times) tests, at the 2 h time point after the last treatment. In both NC and IM groups, the TRPV 1 agonists capsaicin (CP) and <b>olvanil</b> (OL) administered intraperitoneally provided significant antidepressant-like attenuation against these behavioral alterations, whereas the TRPV 1 antagonist capsazepine (CZ) did not attenuate any depression-like behaviors. Furthermore, the endogenous TRPV 1 -agonistic CB 1 agonists anandamide (AEA) and N-arachidonyldopamine (NADA) did not have any antidepressant-like effects. Nevertheless, a synthetic "hybrid" agonist of CB 1 and TRPV 1 receptors, arvanil (AR), caused significant antidepressant-like effects. The antidepressant-like effects of CP and OL were antagonized by the TRPV 1 antagonist CZ. However, the antidepressant-like effects of AR were not antagonized by either CZ or the CB 1 antagonist AM 251 (AM). Conclusions The antidepressant-like effects of TRPV 1 agonists shown in the present study suggest a characteristic involvement of TRPV 1 receptors in NC-induced depression-like behaviors, similar to those caused by IM. The strong antidepressant-like effects of the potent TRPV 1 plus CB 1 agonist AR, which has been reported to cause part of its TRPV 1 -mimetic and cannabimimetic effects presumably via non-TRPV 1 or non-CB 1 mechanisms support a contribution from other sites of action which may play a therapeutically important role in the treatment of NC abuse. </p...|$|E
