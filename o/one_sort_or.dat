5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E

As in the United States, European 0-6-0 locomotives were largely restricted to switching and station pilot duties, though they were also widely used on short branch lines to haul passenger and freight trains. On most branch lines, though, larger and more powerful tank engines tended to be favoured.|$|E
25|$|The {{cycle and}} motor {{manufacturing}} industries brought into existence {{a wide variety}} of subsidiary trades. Most notably these were general engineering, metal casting, drop forging, chain-making and the manufacture of instruments and gauges, machine tools, and all types of electrical equipment. The manufacture of aircraft, aero engines and related equipment also took place in Coventry as early as 1916, and during World War II the aircraft industry dwarfed all other local industries. With the outbreak of war many of the motor firms switched to aircraft work, and the whole of Coventry's industrial skills and resources turned to war production of <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, marine {{forensic}} investigators {{considered that}} {{an explosion in}} the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility. It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, of <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another, in the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines.|$|E

25|$|The {{first flight}} of the N-9M {{occurred}} on 27 December 1942 with Northrop test pilot John Myers at the controls. During the next five months, 45 flights were made. Nearly all were terminated by mechanical failures of <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another, the Menasco engines being {{the primary source of}} those problems. After roughly 22.5 hours of accumulated flight time, the first N-9M crashed approximately 12miles (19km) west of Muroc Army Air Base on 19 May 1943. The pilot, Max Constant, was killed as he attempted to recover the aircraft from a right-hand, 60° nose-down spin. The investigation found that Constant had suffered control reversal, the control column had been pressed against his chest during his recovery attempt from the steep spin, preventing him from parachuting to safety. Steps were taken to fix this problem and prevent it from happening on other N-9M test aircraft.|$|E

A decision was made {{that all of the}} shadowy layer of animal glue and [...] "lamp black", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts and painted definition by later restorers in attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that has been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted [...] "buon fresco" [...] would remain.|$|E
500|$|Films noir tend {{to revolve}} around heroes {{who are more}} flawed and morally {{questionable}} than the norm, often fall guys of <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as [...] "alienated"; {{in the words of}} Silver and Ward, [...] "filled with existential bitterness". Certain archetypal characters appear in many films noir—hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant. From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Out of the Past, and Kiss Me Deadly. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: Laura, The Killers, The Naked City, and Touch of Evil.|$|E

McCall Smith notes that his books are “certainly a bit different from the very realistic fiction that comes from Edinburgh” but believes that both styles equally reflect the nature of Edinburgh and Scotland: “I would say that a city’s literary nature needn’t be carved in stone.

That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out.

2500|$|Many {{newspapers}} did {{not initially}} {{report on the}} massacre at all, and those that did, in many cases, either referred to the prior first attack on 3 January and gave figures far more limited than those circulating elsewhere, or gave outright denials of <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>or</b> another.

There is an inherent ambiguity: -t may denote more than one grammatical category: masculine, feminine, or neuter gender.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} to a fusion system devoted to 3 D images interpretation. This task consists in identifying typical areas within the images {{to understand a}} complex phenomenon. Classical approaches consist of measuring the detection quality {{by means of a}} numerical indicator and then to find a set of parameters that increase the chosen indicator. End-users are able to express his satisfaction on an obtained detection. This satisfaction encompasses all the subjective aspects that are inherent to this kind of the evaluation. Then an approximate model linking the end-users satisfaction to the set of parameters could be reach. Such model is then used to compute a predictive satisfaction and the only a priori satisfactory detection can be tested. So each new predictive satisfaction must be compared with the previous <b>ones</b> to be <b>sorted</b> <b>or</b> ranked. The parameter adjustment problem {{can be seen as a}} decision problem. The objective is to avoid the computation of many fusions, because of the entire time consuming process. This paper addresses the MCDA and the multivariate analysis approaches to link the decision data (observations, attributes) with the satisfaction information in order to identify an interesting model linking the parameters to the detection...|$|R
