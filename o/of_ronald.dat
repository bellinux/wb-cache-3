5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film.

Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop <b>of</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E

Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims have low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious allegations about Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E

According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68percent, which matched those <b>of</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan and Franklin D.

Matlock was back in Moscow in 1974, serving in the number two position in the embassy for four years. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in early 1980 ended the period of reduced tensions. Matlock was assigned to Moscow again in 1981 as acting ambassador during the first part <b>of</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan's presidency. Reagan appointed him as ambassador to Czechoslovakia and later asked him to return to Washington in 1983 to work at the National Security Council, with the assignment to develop a negotiating strategy to end the arms race. When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, arms negotiations and summit meetings resumed. Matlock was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1987 and saw the last years of the Soviet Union before he retired from the Foreign Service in 1991.|$|E
