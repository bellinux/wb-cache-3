The measure was placed in an <b>omnibus</b> <b>bill</b> designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses {{on behalf of his}} party in support of the bill, but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.|$|E

With the advantage of grants of land, they vigorously marketed their properties, extolling the region as ideal for agriculture. An <b>omnibus</b> <b>bill</b> for statehood for North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington, titled the Enabling Act of 1889, was passed on February 22, 1889 during the administration of Grover Cleveland.

25|$|The <b>omnibus</b> <b>bill,</b> despite Clay's efforts, {{failed in}} a crucial vote on July 31 with the {{majority}} of his Whig Party and many Southern Democrats opposed. Clay announced on the Senate floor the next day that he intended to persevere and pass each individual part of the bill. Clay was physically exhausted; the tuberculosis that would eventually kill him had begun to take its toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in Newport, Rhode Island. Douglas separated the bills and guided them through the Senate. Each individual bill managed to pass, because it had the support not only of moderates, but of either the pro-slavery or anti-slavery senators, depending on who the bill was meant to favor. Combined, these two groups were able to crush the third.|$|E
25|$|Under Territorial Governor Thomas Meagher, Montanans held a {{constitutional}} convention in 1866 in a failed bid for statehood. A second constitutional convention {{was held in}} Helena in 1884 that produced a constitution ratified 3:1 by Montana citizens in November 1884. For political reasons, Congress did not approve Montana statehood until 1889. Congress approved Montana statehood in February 1889 and President Grover Cleveland signed an <b>omnibus</b> <b>bill</b> granting statehood to Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington once the appropriate state constitutions were crafted. In July 1889, Montanans convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution accepted by {{the people and the}} federal government. On November 8, 1889 President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed Montana the forty-first state in the union. The first state governor was Joseph K. Toole. In the 1880s, Helena (the current state capital) had more millionaires per capita than any other United States city.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the program}} {{received}} widespread support in Congress, Treasury officials opposed it. In a letter, Treasury secretary W.Michael Blumenthal wrote, [...] "I {{do not believe}} the U.S. Government should permit the erroneous impression to be created that it cannot or will not take the necessary steps to combat inflation and that the public therefore needs to buy gold as a hedge against inflation." [...] Blumenthal also believed that if the government were to sanction the striking of gold medallions, the public would believe that the Treasury was actively encouraging investment in gold. Despite these objections, the bill was attached to the bank <b>omnibus</b> <b>bill,</b> which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on November 10, 1978.|$|E

40|$|Theories {{of party}} power in Congress differ on the {{circumstances}} under which majority parties have the ability to shift policy outcomes away from the preferences of pivotal voters and toward the majority's preferred position. The theory of Pivotal Politics states that it is unlikely parties have such power. The theory of Conditional Party Government states that parties can influence policy outcomes when they are ideologically unified, while the Cartel theory suggests that parties can influence outcomes all of the time by controlling the agenda. 	In this dissertation, I propose and test three hypotheses addressing the extent of party power using an original dataset of the legislative history of federal appropriations bills and case studies of two time periods in Congress. Appropriations bills are an effective way to study trends in Congress because they must be passed every year. In the last three decades, Congress has shifted from its traditional method of passing the 13 bills that fund the federal government individually to packaging them together in massive "omnibus" bills. I show that the decision of party leaders to create <b>omnibus</b> <b>bills</b> is a form of agenda control that allows party leaders to meet a variety of goals ranging from protecting the majority party's reputation to adopting partisan policy. <b>Omnibus</b> <b>bills</b> help party leaders meet their goals because they are multidimensional, "must pass" bills that members are reluctant to oppose. They are particularly useful in the Senate, where they provide an effective counter to the ever present threat of a filibuster. 	I make three major arguments. First, I contend that the ability of a majority party to control the agenda with <b>omnibus</b> spending <b>bills</b> is independent of its degree of ideological diversity. In the last 30 years, <b>omnibus</b> <b>bills</b> have been used both when the majority party is ideologically diverse and when it is unified. Second, I contend that the likelihood a majority party will seek to control the agenda with <b>omnibus</b> <b>bills</b> depends on the ideological distance from the majority's median voter to other pivotal voters on the floor. These distances have varied over time with the ideological diversity and margin of control of the majority party. Large ideological gaps between pivotal voters are an indication that the floor is a challenging arena for the majority party and create an incentive to control the agenda. Third, I contend that the policy consequences of <b>omnibus</b> <b>bills</b> vary with the majority party's ideological diversity. Diverse parties are likely to use <b>omnibus</b> <b>bills</b> to "keep the trains running" by passing the budget, while unified parties are likely to use <b>omnibus</b> <b>bills</b> to pursue partisan policy goals. 	My findings expand our understanding of the motivations of members of Congress. Theories of Congress rooted in the reelection motive state that individual behavior, and by extension, the behavior of parties, is motivated primarily by the desire to improve prospects for reelection. Evidence from the history of appropriations bills over the last 30 years suggests that ideologically unified parties will use <b>omnibus</b> <b>bills</b> to pursue policy goals even if those goals create some additional risk of not being reelected...|$|R

500|$|Fillmore {{received}} the Whig vice presidential nomination in 1848 as Taylor's running mate, {{and the two}} were elected. He was largely ignored by Taylor, including in the dispensing of patronage in New York, on which Taylor consulted Weed and Seward. As vice president, Fillmore presided over angry debates in the Senate as Congress decided whether to allow slavery in the Mexican Cession. [...] Fillmore supported Henry Clay's <b>Omnibus</b> <b>Bill</b> (the basis of the 1850 Compromise) though Taylor did not. [...] After President Taylor died in July 1850, Fillmore dismissed the cabinet and changed the administration's policy. [...] The new president exerted pressure to gain {{the passage of the}} Compromise, which gave legislative victories to both North and South, and which was enacted by September. [...] The Fugitive Slave Act, expediting the return of escaped slaves to those who claimed ownership, was a controversial part of the Compromise, and Fillmore felt himself duty-bound to enforce it, though it damaged his popularity and also the Whig Party, which was torn North from South. [...] In foreign policy, Fillmore supported U.S. Navy expeditions to open trade in Japan, opposed French designs on Hawaii, and was embarrassed by Narciso López's filibuster expeditions to Cuba. He sought election to a full term in 1852, but was passed over by the Whigs in favor of Winfield Scott.|$|E

Fillmore abandoned Taylor's proposal to seek immediate admission of New Mexico, instead leaving it to Clay to craft a congressional compromise. But by July 31, shortly after Fillmore took office as president, Clay's bill was effectively dead. All the significant provisions had been deleted by amendment other than the organization of Utah Territory—one wag put it that the [...] "Mormons" [...] were the only remaining passengers on the Omnibus. Democratic Senator Stephen A.

2500|$|As vice president, Fillmore had {{presided over}} some of the most momentous and passionate debates in American history as the Senate debated whether to allow slavery in the western territories. The ongoing {{sectional}} conflict had already excited much discussion when on January 21, 1850, President Taylor sent a special message to Congress urging the admission of California immediately and New Mexico later, and that the Supreme Court settle the Texas boundary dispute. On January 29, Henry Clay introduced an <b>Omnibus</b> <b>bill</b> which combined the four diverse subjects under discussion. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of its conflicting northern and western territorial claims to the federal government in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. The status of slavery in the territories of the Mexican Cession would be decided by those living there; this doctrine of [...] "popular sovereignty" [...] would overturn the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had outlawed slavery in territory West of Missouri and North of the 36°30′ parallel. Taylor was unenthusiastic about the bill, and it languished in Congress. In May 1850, Fillmore, after hearing weeks of debate, informed Taylor that if senators divided equally on the bill, he would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor.|$|E
