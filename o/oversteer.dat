5|$|In {{the first}} {{run of the}} men's doubles luge {{competition}} on 17 February 2010, Austria's team of Tobias Schiegl and Markus Schiegl survived a crash on turn 16 where they came in at too high of an elevation. Tobias tried to correct the <b>oversteer</b> {{only to have the}} cousins collide {{on the opposite side of}} the ice wall, causing both to go airborne momentarily. Neither suffered any injury.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to <b>oversteer,</b> start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|Forsythe Racing {{teammates}} Tagliani and Carpentier rounded {{out the top}} ten qualifiers; Carpentier was {{hampered by}} an electrical problem which overheated his engine {{and was unable to}} improve his time when his blowoff valve opened {{between the first and second}} turns. Adrián Fernández was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was more than two-tenths of a second slower than Bräck. Fittipaldi's car developed a large amount of <b>oversteer</b> and reduced his pace in turn four and he took 12th. Jimmy Vasser and Oriol Servià took the 13th and 14th positions; Servià's car had <b>oversteer</b> after his first timed lap and drove into the pit lane where his crew made adjustments allowing him to drive faster for his second attempt. Nakano, 15th, had a large amount of understeer which slowed him in turn four. Dixon moved from his back-up car to his primary vehicle for qualifying and took 16th. Manning worked on his race setup but gearbox issues before the session prevented his team from focusing on a qualifying tune and he qualified in 17th. Mario Domínguez and Jourdain completed the qualifiers; Jourdain reduced his speed through the third and fourth turns after he oversteered and his slower pace prevented him from spinning.|$|E

50|$|The torque {{vectoring}} rear axle differential is designed and manufactured by Magna Powertrain, {{and is being}} offered on Audi A4, A5, A6 and their derivatives (including RS models). The Sport Differential selectively distributes torque to the rear axle wheels thereby generating a yaw moment, which improves handling and also stabilizes the vehicle when it <b>oversteers</b> or understeers, thereby increasing safety.|$|R
2500|$|The LFA {{appeared}} on Fifth Gear with presenter Tiff Needell {{driving the car}} around the race track performing hotlaps, powerslides and power <b>oversteers.</b> Needell described in detail the high-tech engineering used {{in the car and}} highly praised the 4.8 Liter V10's power and sound as well. Tiff declared [...] "people who purchased the LFA would be very happy when they get their cars". At the conclusion of the review, he stated [...] "for a weekend race track car, LFA is worth every penny".|$|R
5|$|MacPherson struts {{are used}} in the front suspension, and an unusual three-link De Dion tube/Watt's linkage is used in the rear. Front discs with {{anti-lock}} braking (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range. In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen-inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts and wider 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of <b>oversteer</b> caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or <b>oversteer.</b> When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or <b>oversteer.</b> Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E
25|$|Drifting is {{a driving}} {{technique}} where the driver intentionally <b>oversteers,</b> with loss of traction {{in the rear}} wheels or all tires, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner. Car drifting is caused when the rear slip angle {{is greater than the}} front slip angle, {{to such an extent that}} often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering).|$|R
5000|$|During {{pre-season}} testing journalists reported several {{reports of}} problems with the car's handling. It understeered travelling into the curve and <b>oversteered</b> as the car {{came out of the}} curve. Felipe Massa reported that the team needed to carry out substantial work {{in order to understand the}} car. Ferrari denied that the car was under-performing, but during the [...] both Alonso and Massa went off the track after struggling with the handling, and could only qualify 12th and 16th respectively. Alonso finished the race fifth, while Massa retired after a collision with Williams driver Bruno Senna.|$|R
50|$|Qualifying saw Mika Häkkinen on pole {{position}} with Michael Schumacher second, David Coulthard third, Rubens Barrichello fourth, Ralf Schumacher fifth and Heinz-Harald Frentzen sixth. During qualifying Schumacher took {{pole position}} for a brief moment, beating Häkkinen's time by 0.025 seconds. Häkkinen's final timed lap of the session however, was quick enough reclaim pole position. In the first 2 sectors of the circuit, Häkkinen was slower than Schumacher by 0.085 and 0.089 seconds respectively. A small mistake at turn 12 forced the Finn to run wide off the track for a moment, and as he exited the final corner onto the pit straight, the car <b>oversteered.</b> Despite these two errors, Häkkinen reclaimed pole position by 0.091 seconds.|$|R
5|$|Further {{down the}} field, {{there was an}} intense battle between Audi and Toyota for {{positions}} three to six. Audi struggled to find an optimum set-up for their cars as they secured fourth and sixth positions. They were separated by the two Toyota vehicles in third and fifth places. André Lotterer was slowed by another car on {{the start of his}} first timed lap and was affected by <b>oversteer</b> on his second lap of the circuit. Marcel Fässler took over the No. 7 Audi entry from Lotterer and abandoned his first attempt because his vehicle's rear-end became excessively light and later lost downforce behind two cars in Blanchimont corner which restricted the car to starting sixth. The two Rebellion Racing cars and the No. 4 ByKolles Racing CLM P1/01 rounded out the LMP1 qualifiers. Qualifying was stopped for ten minutes when the ByKolles car collided with the No. 43 Manor entry at La Source and debris coming from the former's rear bodywork littered the track at Radallion corner.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rain from}} Typhoon Phanfone made the track surface wet and reduced visibility. Starting {{from behind the}} safety car, the race was stopped after two laps and resumed 20 minutes later. Rosberg {{immediately}} fended off a passing manoeuvre by Hamilton heading into the first corner. His car then experienced <b>oversteer,</b> and Hamilton reduced the time deficit between them. Hamilton challenged Rosberg for the lead {{over the next four}} laps, overtook him on the 29th lap and pulled away. Jules Bianchi made contact with the rear of a tractor crane at Dunlop Curve on the 43rd lap that was tending to Adrian Sutil's car (which had crashed one lap earlier) and the race was prematurely ended three laps later. The race result was counted back two laps, and Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of <b>oversteer</b> in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E
50|$|When {{the race}} started, Hamilton {{accelerated}} faster than teammate Rosberg off the line, moving {{ahead of him}} by using {{the space between the}} pit wall heading into the first corner. Hamilton <b>oversteered</b> after leaving turn three and moved to the outside of the track. Rosberg attempted to retake the lead by going around the outside at the fourth turn, but Hamilton defended the position. Räikkönen overtook teammate Alonso around the inside at the first turn and then made contact with Magnuseen. Alonso continued with minor bodywork damage. Vergne was squeezed by Maldonado at the turn eight entry and attempted to pass him. Maldonado drove defensively and the two made contact. Vergne had a punctured right-rear tyre, along with rear wing and floor damage, and drove to the pit lane for repairs.|$|R
5000|$|The automobiles' suspension, brakes, and {{aerodynamic}} {{components are}} also selected to tailor the cars to different racetracks. A car that understeers {{is said to}} be [...] "tight," [...] or [...] "pushing," [...] causing the car to keep going up the track with the wheel turned all the way left, while one that <b>oversteers</b> {{is said to be}} [...] "loose" [...] or [...] "free," [...] causing the back end of the car to slide around, which can result in the car spinning out if the driver is not careful. The adjustment of front and rear aerodynamic downforce, spring rates, track bar geometry, brake proportioning, the wedge (also known as cross-weight), changing the camber angle, and changing the air pressure in the tires can all change the distribution of forces among the tires during cornering to correct for handling problems. Recently, coil bind setups have become popular among teams.|$|R
50|$|The Trough, In Reverse - The contestants, save Jakob, {{had done}} so badly on the trough, that the same {{challenge}} (on a slightly different course) will be done in reverse. As Andrew notes, {{the key to the}} challenge is to take wide turns to allow the car to swing when reversing around a curve, and adjusting the car's mirrors to ensure that the wheels stay on the concrete. Jakob does worse in reverse compared to forwards in the last episode, nearly losing his composure and failing the challenge outright. Arun, who also passed going forward, is told by Sanah to stop and think, but still <b>oversteers</b> and fails. Angelina fails to use her side mirrors, and uses Christine extensively for advice. Christine eventually caves, and handles the wheel for Angelina. Though the run is without incident, she fails as Christine effectively drove from the passenger seat. Mike, whose major issues is reversing, is slow and methodical, but does manage to pass after 21 attempts.|$|R
5|$|Although 47 {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Drivers who recorded their lap times early in the session were at an advantage because the track was cooler and thus gave more grip. Edwards felt his car had <b>oversteer</b> during his run. Kyle Busch won the third pole position of his career {{with a time of}} 29.613 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Edwards, who was 0.125 seconds slower and had the pole position until Kyle Busch's lap. Martin qualified third, Gordon fourth, and Mike Skinner fifth. Biffle, Scott Riggs, Earnhardt, Kurt Busch, and Sadler completed the top ten qualifiers. The four drivers that failed to qualify were A. J. Allmendinger, Joe Nemechek, John Andretti, and Sauter (who crashed at turn-two on his first qualifying lap). Burney Lamar withdrew from the race prior to qualifying. After the qualifier Busch said his team was aware of the car's potential which was displayed in Friday's sole practice session and the January test session; he was worried about his vehicle being very tight going into the first and second turns having been on the accelerator pedal throughout his fastest lap.|$|E
5|$|Bräck {{closed the}} gap with de Ferran over the next fifteen laps as they moved towards slower cars. Bräck got a run on de Ferran and overtook him {{at the bottom of}} the first turn to take over the lead on lap 46, while Andretti lost fourth place to Franchitti on the same lap. Jourdain spun leaving turn four because of his car {{generating}} <b>oversteer,</b> and slid down the frontstretch triggering the second caution on the 50th lap. Franchitti drove to the outside of the track in avoidance. Castroneves avoided hitting Jourdain's car, which remained {{at the bottom of the}} first turn and, though his vehicle lost one of its shock covers, he regained control of his car and continued. Fittipaldi reported to his team that he had a problem with either his gearbox or drivetrain and drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 53 becoming the race's second retirement. The leaders elected to make pit stops on the same lap under caution. Da Matta gained the most positions, moving from sixth to third, and Bräck remained the leader at the lap-57 restart. Bräck pulled away from the rest of the field, until de Ferran {{closed the gap}} between them by the start of the 80th lap.|$|E
5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although Hamilton {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead {{to half a}} second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more <b>oversteer</b> on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{practice}} sessions {{took place in}} warm weather conditions. In the first practice session, Buemi used the maximum of [...] available to him and recorded the fastest lap {{with a time of}} one minute and 8.151 seconds, almost six-tenths of a second faster than teammate Prost in second and Rosenqvist third. After leading the field for most of the session, López was fourth-fastest, ahead of Bird and Vergne. Mitch Evans, Heidfeld, di Grassi and Adam Carroll rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Daniel Abt stopped at the turn three exit, and later understeered into the turn-one run-off area, but was able to continue driving. Nelson Piquet Jr. <b>oversteered</b> into the turn four barrier. damaging his car's left-front corner. The session was later halted when Evans was stranded on the inside of turn nine and was extracted from the track after he could not resume driving. Dillmann's first car had gearbox problems and was required to wait for his second car to be ready before venturing out onto the circuit. Heidfeld was the fastest driver in the second practice session with a time of one minute and 8.070 seconds; his teammate Rosenqvist was second, ahead of Maro Engel in third. Di Grassi was fourth-fastest; Sarrazin was fifth and López sixth. Bird was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Buemi ninth and Oliver Turvey completed the top ten ahead of first qualifying.|$|R
25|$|Bird set {{the fastest}} overall lap {{time in the}} fourth group at one minute and 22.012 seconds, four-tenths of a second faster than the second-placed Heidfeld. Di Grassi set the third quickest lap with Abt and Prost the fourth group's two slowest participants. At the end of group qualifying, the lap times set by Bird, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Heidfeld and di Grassi allowed them to advance into super pole. Rosenqvist {{clinched}} his third pole position {{of the season with}} a time of one minute and 22.344 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row Bird who was two-tenths of a second slower than Rosenqvist and appeared to go fastest by improving on his in the first sector but drifted in turn seven and voiced his disappointment over the radio. Vergne gained {{most of his time in}} the first sector and was clean for the rest of his lap to secure third. Despite complaining about his state of his brakes, Heidfeld took fourth. Di Grassi locked his rear brakes entering the first turn and <b>oversteered</b> through the corner. He was unable to regain any time and could only muster fifth. After qualifying, Prost was demoted twenty places on the starting grid because he changed his battery and inverter following a car bay fire after the first race. However, Prost did not take the full penalty which meant he started from the pit lane and ten seconds were added to his race time.|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Evans paced the session, three-tenths of a second faster than Bird in second, and Frijns third. Evans' {{teammate}} Carroll and Engel (who stopped twice on track because of technical issues) were the group's two slowest drivers. Bird cited difficulty in gaining optium tyre temperature for his performance. Vergne used clear air and was the fastest driver in the second group with a late lap time that was two-tenths of a second faster than Buemi. Di Grassi, Piquet and Jérôme d'Ambrosio rounded out the top five. The third qualifying beginning was delayed when Vergne and Piquet were placed under investigation by the stewards for an irregularity. Félix da Costa stopped his car on the racing line at the turn one exit and the yellow flag was shown until he performed a restart, enabling him to keep driving. Rosenqvist was the fastest driver in the third group, with Stéphane Sarrazin and Duval finishing behind the Mahindra driver. López pushed hard and <b>oversteered</b> through the seventh turn, impacting the barrier, and damaging the rear-right corner of his vehicle. He stopped further down the track and the session was temporarily stopped. Félix da Costa was granted permission by race control to complete his timed lap but damaged his front-right suspension in an impact with the chicane's inside barrier. Both López and Félix da Costa started the race from the grid's ninth row.|$|R
5|$|Kenseth {{remained}} the {{leader at the}} lap-149 restart; he was followed by Gordon. The fifth caution was deployed twelve laps later when Carpentier was squeezed towards the backstretch outside wall by Newman, causing Carpentier to slide down the track and hit the inside wall. Ken Schrader was close by the incident but swerved to avoid damaging his car. During the caution, the leading drivers, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Gordon took the lead and maintained it at the lap-165 restart. Biffle and his teammate Kenseth drove alongside {{each other in a}} battle for second place on lap 166, until Biffle escaped and ran onto the apron on the next lap. Mayfield burst his right-front tire on lap 171, but no debris came off his car, avoiding the need for a caution. Six laps later, Biffle passed Kyle Busch to take fifth place. Riggs experienced <b>oversteer</b> in the fourth turn while running down the inside of Labonte; Franchitti ran into Riggs, causing the sixth caution on lap 179. All of the leaders, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Earnhardt led the field on the lap-183 restart; he was followed by Harvick and Edwards. Gordon moved into fifth place by lap 188. Harvick fell to fourth place when Edwards and Kenseth passed him.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in sunny and hot weather conditions Michael Schumacher clinched the first pole position of the season and the 24th of his career, with a time of 1:20.974 on his second run. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who set a lap 0.076 seconds slower in the closing seconds of qualifying. Barrichello qualified third, and felt that his car did not feel good having not made any changes. Coulthard secured fourth position, despite losing time early in qualifying because of a fuel pressure problem. He decided against taking his team's spare car set up for Häkkinen because he believed it would take up time and had to run more fuel throughout the remainder of the session. Ralf Schumacher qualified fifth and he was suffering from excessive <b>oversteer</b> which prevented him from setting a quicker lap time but was delighted with his starting position. Villeneuve secured sixth position and said he achieved the best from his car. Both Jordan drivers lined up the fourth row of the grid (with Trulli ahead of Frentzen) and believed they could have a better starting position because of windy conditions. de la Rosa and Irvine rounded out the top ten fastest drivers, with de la Rosa confident of finishing in a higher position in his home country. Later on Saturday afternoon, a fuel sample from de la Rosa's car was analysed and declared illegal by the FIA and Arrows announced that it would appeal the decision, allowing de la Rosa to retain his starting position. Button, eleventh, reported his car felt unstable due to the windy conditions. He was ahead of Verstappen in the slower of the two Arrows, Salo in the faster Sauber, and Fisichella. Herbert, fifteenth, lost his front wing mounted camera after hitting a kerb {{in the early part of}} qualifying and made a minor mistake which prevented him from starting higher up the field. Diniz had excessive <b>oversteer</b> and managed sixteenth place. Ricardo Zonta managed seventeenth after he was unable to find a set-up which suited him and his fastest time was nine-tenths of a second slower than teammate Villeneuve. Alesi qualified eighteenth, ahead of Wurz in nineteenth. Heidfeld had engine problems and had to use the spare Prost monocoque and took 20th position. The two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane qualified at the rear of the field in positions 21 and 22.|$|E
5|$|Buemi was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session; his best lap time of 1.38:586 was half a second off Vettel's pace in the second session. He was {{disappointed}} as he had Barrichello ahead of him driving towards turn 25 on his final timed lap which caused Buemi to reduce his speed and it cost him two tenths of a second. Rosberg took 12th position. Sutil had no grip {{in his car and}} qualified in 13th. His teammate Liuzzi clinched 14th place' he was affected by <b>oversteer</b> and struggled with driving on his car's soft tyres. Schumacher was unable to get his tyres working to his preference and was affected with a right-front brake problem which restricted him to qualifying in 15th. Schumacher's qualifying effort was criticised by the Formula One paddock. Pedro de la Rosa took 16th having struggled with a lack of grip on the super soft compound tyres. Jaime Alguersuari drove hard but experienced a lack of top speed and clinched 17th. Kamui Kobayashi failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session; he flat-spotted his front super soft compound tyres on his first timed lap which caused him to feel vibrations in his car. The two Lotus cars of Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen qualified in 19th and 20th positions, ahead of both Virgin drivers Lucas di Grassi and Timo Glock in 21st and 22nd. Both Hispania drivers lined up {{at the back of the}} field (with Karun Chandhok ahead of Senna).|$|E

5000|$|In May 2011, Williams FW16 {{designer}} Adrian Newey {{expressed his}} views on the accident: [...] "The honest truth {{is that no one}} will ever know exactly what happened. There's no doubt the steering column failed and the big question was whether it failed in the accident or did it cause the accident? It had fatigue cracks and would have failed at some point. There is no question that its design was very poor. However, all the evidence suggests the car did not go off the track as a result of steering column failure... If you look at the camera shots, especially from Michael Schumacher's following car, the car didn't understeer off the track. It <b>oversteered</b> which is not consistent with a steering column failure. The rear of the car stepped out and all the data suggests that happened. Ayrton then corrected that by going to 50% throttle which would be consistent with trying to reduce the rear stepping out and then, half-a-second later, he went hard on the brakes. The question then is why did the rear step out? The car bottomed much harder on that second lap which again appears to be unusual because the tyre pressure should have come up by then - which leaves you expecting that the right rear tyre probably picked up a puncture from debris on the track. If I was pushed into picking out a single most likely cause that would be it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Evans paced the session, three-tenths of a second faster than Bird in second, and Frijns third. Evans' {{teammate}} Carroll and Engel (who stopped twice on track because of technical issues) were the group's two slowest drivers. Bird cited difficulty in gaining optium tyre temperature for his performance. Vergne used clear air and was the fastest driver in the second group with a late lap time that was two-tenths of a second faster than Buemi. Di Grassi, Piquet and Jérôme d'Ambrosio rounded out the top five. The third qualifying beginning was delayed when Vergne and Piquet were placed under investigation by the stewards for an irregularity. Félix da Costa stopped his car on the racing line at the turn one exit and the yellow flag was shown until the driver performed a restart, enabling him to keep driving. Rosenqvist was the fastest driver in the third group, with Stéphane Sarrazin and Duval finishing behind the Mahindra driver. López pushed hard and <b>oversteered</b> through the seventh turn, impacting the barrier, and damaging the rear-right corner of his vehicle. He stopped further down the track and the session was temporarily stopped. Félix da Costa was granted permission by race control to complete his timed lap but damaged his front-right suspension in an impact with the chicane's inside barrier. Both López and Félix da Costa started the race from the grid's ninth row.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Hamilton set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at one minute and 35.078 seconds; Rosberg was second, and Bottas third. Button was fourth-fastest, ahead of Vettel and Räikkönen. Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an <b>oversteer</b> sent him into the turn-18 barrier. Kobayashi {{lost control of the}} rear end of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, and Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14, which brought out a second red flag; the session ended early, due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Massa was fourth-fastest; Bottas was fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Magnussen was seventh, Vergne eighth, Kvyat ninth and Button completed the top ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car. Although Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear end leaving turn 15, he avoided crashing into the wall.|$|E
5|$|On lap 25, Gordon passed Edwards {{between the}} third and fourth turns to move into second place and a second caution was issued shortly afterward. After the caution, all the teams made a ten-minute pit stop before the restart. McMurray led Gordon, Edwards, Johnson, and Biffle in the first lap of the rolling start before Gordon took the lead; one lap later, Edwards passed Kyle Busch to move into second place. On lap 28, Biffle, {{assisted}} by team mate Edwards, passed Gordon to take the lead. Bowyer experienced <b>oversteer</b> on lap 29, but regained control of his car. Two laps later, Bowyer spun sideways after he was hit by teammate Truex leaving the tri-oval; a third caution was issued, during which most of the leaders, including Biffle, made pit stops for fuel and tires. Earnhardt led the field back up to speed at the restart. McMurray reclaimed the lead on lap 38; Earnhardt tried to pass underneath McMurray going into the third turn two laps later, but McMurray kept the position. Truex passed McMurray on lap 44, with help from Earnhardt. By the 47th lap, Harvick had moved into the lead position; Kyle Busch collided with the wall, escaping with minor damage to the front of his car. He passed McMurray to reclaim the lead one lap later, with Gordon taking over first place by the start of lap 50. One lap later McMurray, aided by team mate Harvick, regained the lead.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel confident that he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and <b>oversteer</b> en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E
25|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished the session 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify. The {{second part of the}} qualifying session lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final part of the qualifying session determined the positions from first to tenth, deciding the pole position. Cars in the final qualifying session were not allowed to change tyres, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. Qualifying took place in warm weather conditions. Hamilton set the fastest laps in all three sessions to clinch his fifth pole position of the season, the 36th of his career, and his first since the Spanish Grand Prix with a time of one minute and 24.109 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Rosberg (running with a repaired gearbox) who recorded a lap 0.274 seconds slower than his teammate having improved on his first timed lap, but <b>oversteered</b> through the Ascari chicane, preventing him from achieving the pole position. The two Williams cars lined up in third and fourth (with Bottas ahead of Massa) and both drivers were unable to improve their fastest times on their second attempts. They were ahead of both McLaren drivers on the grid's third row with Magnussen faster than teammate Button; the latter lost time through the Lesmo corners on his final timed lap. Alonso was slightly slower than Vettel after his first run on the circuit, but improved slightly to secure seventh. He attributed his starting position to recording similar lap times on four sets of tyres used during qualifying. Vettel out-qualified teammate Ricciardo for the fourth time in the past six races to secure eighth with Ricicardo starting ninth. Pérez rounded out the top-ten qualifiers.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master's Thesis was to, through simulations, {{evaluate}} {{the advantages of the}} Direction Sensitive Locking Differential, DSLD, in various driving situations. The purpose was also to simulate situations that indicates possible risks of a mechanically locked differential. A vehicle model with chassis and drivetrain and a driver model that can follow a predefined path and given speed curves were developed in MATLAB/Simulink. Then a number of driving situations were simulated in MATLAB/Simulink showing different effects of the DSLD and how it affected the performance and maneuverability of the vehicle. The results of the simulations show that the DSLD preferably is positioned on the front axle in a four wheel driven vehicle and the DSLD makes the largest dierence in cornering ability and acceleration in a front wheel driven vehicle. The DSLD will both contribute to produce more power/grip/yaw when accelerating in corners as well as it will reduce yaw motion when in <b>oversteered</b> situations, such as the Sine with Dwell. No problems has been shown with the DSLD remaining locked in the a prefered direction. It has followed the quickest reactions of the driver and the fastest movements of the vehicle without any problems. The worst case simulation showed that even when the DSLD was forced to lock in the wrong direction, it wasn't any notable loss in cornering ability when unlocking it with a short brake activation. What needs to be developed further is the interactions and cooperation between the DSLD and the brake, chassis and powertrain/engine control and the other systems that already exists in a vehicle. By developing these interactions the maximum effect of the differential can be achieved and the risk that the systems will work against each other will be reduced. The main thing that is needed is a signal from the DSLD to the other systems with the information whether and how the differential is locked and then the other systems will have to take that into account...|$|R
40|$|Over-actuated systems, such as today's {{road vehicle}} configurations, have more motion {{actuators}} than controlled motions. For example, a passenger car has a combustion engine and four mechanical brakes, {{all of which}} can be used individually to correct any error in yaw rate when the vehicle becomes under- or <b>oversteered.</b> The over-actuation becomes even more obvious when the vehicle is configured with additional motion actuators such as electric motor(s). This is the case for Fuel Cell and Hybrid Electric Vehicles where blending between the use of different actuators is needed. This thesis proposes how a motion control system for over-actuated road vehicles can be made reconfigurable within the context of both offline and online adaptivity. Offline, the proposed control system is easily reconfigured to handle a wide range of vehicle configurations, with different types and numbers of motion actuators, without changing the control law for the desired ground motion of the vehicle. Online, the motion control system adapts its use of the motion actuators to the current conditions of the available actuators and their ability to generate tyre forces on the ground. Another online feature is the smooth arbitration between desired actuator use to both minimize energy consumption and assure vehicle stability. This smooth arbitration is especially important for vehicle configurations which have an energy buffer. The proposed motion control system uses control allocation which separates the control law for the ground motion from the distribution of the desired motion forces among the available actuators for the specific configuration. The optimization formulation of the control allocator considers the actuator limits in both position and rate of change. Through detailed modelling of different vehicle configurations and their actuators, drivetrains, and chassis, it was shown by simulation that the proposed motion control system is both offline and online reconfigurable. The results from different driving manoeuvres showed that the control allocator not only reconfigured the distribution when the actuators were saturated or limited by low road/tyre friction but also ensured that vehicle stability was upheld at all times. This was accomplished by prioritizing vehicle motion higher than energy management in the optimization formulation of the control allocator...|$|R
