40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mudded</b> weak {{interlayer}} is a geotechnical sandwich material exhibiting {{strain softening}} behavior, which {{plays an important}} part in the slope stability. The present work primarily focuses on <b>the</b> shear strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mudded</b> weak interlayer in rock slopes. To determine the peak and residual shear strengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mudded</b> weak interlayers, <b>the</b> particle flow code (PFC) is used to simulate the failure behavior during the direct shear tests. Laboratory investigations including uniaxial compression test, SEM, and 3 D deformation measurement are employed to calibrate the essential micro parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mudded</b> weak interlayer during the simulation process in PFC. The numerical model is built based on these parameters and both the peak and residual shear strengths can be predicted from the model. The prediction results show that the peak and residual internal friction angle are 19. 36 ° and 14. 61 °, while the peak and residual cohesion are 22. 33 [*]kPa and 2. 73 [*]kPa, respectively. Moreover, to validate the obtained peak and residual strengths, the results are compared with literature data. The peak and residual shear strengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mudded</b> weak interlayer can serve as an important benchmark to evaluate <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> side slopes and provide guiding suggestions for their reinforcement...|$|R

5|$|The many {{inhabitants}} of the tidal flats include lugworms, polychaete worms, sand hoppers and other amphipod crustaceans, and gastropod molluscs. These molluscs feed on the algae growing on the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> and include the tiny Hydrobia, an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000m−2.

5|$|The New Zealand mud snail , once {{endemic to}} New Zealand, has spread widely {{and has become}} naturalised and an {{invasive}} species in many areas including Australia, Tasmania, Asia (Japan, in the Garmat Ali River in Iraq since 2008), Europe (since 1859 in England), and North America (U.S. and Canada: Thunder Bay in Ontario since 2001, British Columbia since July 2007), most likely inadvertently during human activity. It can reach concentrations greater than 500,000 per m², endangering the food chain by outcompeting native snails and water insects for food, leading to sharp declines in native populations. There is evidence North American fishes are unable to digest the tiny but hard shells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> snail, and that their presence may result in poor growth outcomes for rainbow trout.|$|E

5|$|The {{relief efforts}} were {{hindered}} by the composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> {{which made it}} nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and {{days leading up to}} the eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds from Ruiz until it was too late.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In coastal areas, wave-mud {{interaction}} {{is an important}} mechanism <b>of</b> wave attenuation. <b>The</b> present study on mud-induced wave attenuation is settled in a system composed of an inviscid water layer and a mud layer, in which <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer is modeled by a two-layered viscoelastic model. In the two-layered model, the upper layer is described by a Maxwell model, which is fluid-like; the lower layer is described by a Kelvin-Voigt model, which is heavier, and solid-like. Including <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-layered <b>mud</b> model, {{a new set of}} Boussinesq-type equations for shallow water waves is established. Degenerating to <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> a single-layered <b>mud</b> model, <b>the</b> Boussinesq-type equations are equivalent to the results in literatures. Applying the Boussinesq-type equations to one-dimensional waves, <b>the</b> attenuation <b>of</b> linear sinusoidal waves and a solitary wave are studied. For linear sinusoidal waves, the damping rates are calculated and are found consistent with literature results. The damping is dominated by <b>the</b> lower <b>mud</b> layer, which is much thicker. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>mud</b> layer is important near resonance. For a solitary wave, an evolution equation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave amplitude is obtained. <b>The</b> attenuation <b>of</b> a solitary wave is again dominated by <b>the</b> lower <b>mud</b> layer and <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>mud</b> layer is small...|$|R
