6000|$|In spite, however, {{of these}} disagreeables, I should {{recommend}} any student to suffer them with Spartan courage, as the benefits he receives should repay him an hundredfold for them all. The {{life of the}} debating society is a handy antidote {{to the life of}} the class-room and quadrangle. Nothing could be conceived more excellent as a weapon against many of those peccant humours that we have been railing against in the jeremiad of our last [...] "College Paper"--particularly in the field of intellect. It is a sad sight to see our heather-scented students, our boys of seventeen, coming up to College with determined views--roués in speculation--having gauged the vanity of philosophy or learned to shun it as the middle-man of heresy--a company of determined, deliberate opinionists, not to be moved by all the sleights of logic. What have such men to do with study? If their minds are made up irrevocably, why burn the [...] "studious lamp" [...] in search of further confirmation? Every set opinion I hear a student deliver I feel a certain lowering of my regard. He who studies, he who is yet employed in groping for his premises, should keep his mind fluent and sensitive, keen to mark flaws, and willing to surrender untenable positions. He should keep himself teachable, or cease the expensive farce of being taught. It is to further this docile spirit that we desire to press the claims of debating societies. It is as a means of melting down this museum of premature petrifactions into living and impressionable soul that we insist on their utility. If we could once prevail on <b>our</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> feel no shame in avowing an uncertain attitude towards any subject, if we could teach them that it was unnecessary for every lad to have his opinionette on every topic, we should have gone a far way towards bracing the intellectual tone of the coming race of thinkers; and this it is which debating societies are so well fitted to perform.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: At IIT, {{we believe}} that the ability to work with {{different}} professions in a project-oriented setting is critical to today’s engineering education. InterProfession (IPRO) projects (a three-credit course) are integrated into our curriculum. Through these industry-sponsored projects, students will deal with the real world engineering problems. This allows <b>our</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> learn "the way we will work". This paper addresses the principle and practice of the IPRO through: (1). the basic structure of IPRO program (2). a comparison with other similar programs, (3). our experience with the IPRO project. From the experience with IPRO project, we can proposed the followings: the 3 Cs model for teamwork, teamwork cultivation, stress and confident management for project members, and leadership development...|$|R
