5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, {{which seeks to}} explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac {{the father of the}} naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort <b>of</b> <b>effect</b> Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into five volumes. Dioscorides {{organized}} the substances by certain similarities, such as their being aromatic, or vines; these divisions do not correspond to any modern classification. In David Sutton's view the grouping is by the type <b>of</b> <b>effect</b> on the human body.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area <b>of</b> <b>effect</b> damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E

5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a fixed axis, freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against attacks, and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various attacks, from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks. The player character's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks, which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter. Once the meter is full, the player character can perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic. Learned by leveling up a character, Artes can be both specifically directed and have a general area <b>of</b> <b>effect.</b> Four Artes can be assigned to each character, and each Arte can be assigned to a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each character can access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic attacks.|$|E

40|$|Chewing is {{crushing}} food {{not only}} to aid swallowing and digestion, but also to help stress relief and regulate cognitive function, especially in attention. It {{is well known that}} chewing gum is used for sleepiness prevention during work, learning, and driving, suggesting a link between chewing and sustained attention. We hypothesized that chewing elevates attention and/or alertness, leading to improvements in cognitive performance. We carried out a systematic review of the PubMed database. We inspected the attributes <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> on attention in studies investigating the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> chewing on attention or alertness conducted with pre-post design in healthy subjects, except elderly. We identified 151 references, 22 of which were included: 14 (64 %) showed positive attributes <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> on attention, 1 (5 %) showed negative attributes <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> on attention, 5 (23 %) showed both positive and negative attributes <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> on attention, and 2 (9 %) showed no significant attributes <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> on attention. Thus, positive attributes <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> chewing on attention, especially on sustained attention, were shown in over half of the reports. These effects also appeared with improvement in mood and stress relief and were influenced by time-on-task effect. Further studies are needed, but chewing could be useful for modifying cognitive function...|$|R
