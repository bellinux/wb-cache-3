40|$|The {{choice of}} the topic of this work is {{determined}} by the high social importance and importance of the sphere <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> and communal services {{for the development of the}} domestic economy in the face of sanctions restrictions. As a subject of research, a modern complex <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> and communal services, provided to owners and tenants <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> by economic entities in the sphere <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> and communal services, was chosen. The main purpose of this work was to substantiate the economic essence <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> and communal services in relation to the activities of economic entities in the sphere <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> and communal services, aimed at providing them to owners and tenants <b>of</b> <b>housing.</b> The methodology <b>of</b> the work was based on an analysis of the main provisions of the current regulatory and legislative documents, as well as a systematic analysis of the general and specific properties <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> and communal services.

About 50% of the houses in Caye Caulker were destroyed, with reports of only five dwellings still standing after the storm. In San Pedro, about 30% <b>of</b> <b>houses,</b> or at least 50, were wrecked. On Ambergris Caye, four airplanes were destroyed.
