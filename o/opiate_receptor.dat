It also has antitussive effects, and reduces the rewarding and analgesic effects of morphine, although it did not prevent the development of dependence.

5000|$|Grooming {{stimulates the}} release of beta-endorphin, which is one {{physiological}} reason for why grooming appears to be relaxing. Beta-endorphins are found in neurons in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Beta-endorphins {{are found to be}} opioid agonists. Opioids are molecules that act on receptors to promote feelings of relaxation, and reduce pain. [...] A study in monkeys shows the changes in opiate expression in the body, mirroring changes in beta-endorphin levels, influences desire for social grooming. In using <b>opiate</b> <b>receptor</b> blockades, which decrease the level of beta-endorphins, the monkeys responded with an increased desire to be groomed. In contrast, when the monkeys were given morphine, the desire to be groomed dropped significantly. Beta- endorphins have been difficult to measure in animal species, differently from oxytocin which can be measured by sampling cerebrospinal fluid, and therefore have not been linked as strongly with social behaviours.|$|E
50|$|Naloxone has an {{extremely}} high affinity for μ-opioid receptors {{in the central}} nervous system (CNS). Naloxone is a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) inverse agonist, and its rapid blockade of those receptors often produces rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms. Naloxone also has an antagonist action, though with a lower affinity, at κ- (KOR) and δ-opioid receptors (DOR). If administered in the absence of concomitant opioid use, no functional pharmacological activity occurs (except the inability for the body to combat pain naturally). In contrast to direct opiate agonists, which elicit opiate withdrawal symptoms when discontinued in opiate-tolerant people, no evidence indicates the development of tolerance or dependence on naloxone. The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but studies suggest it functions to produce withdrawal symptoms by competing for <b>opiate</b> <b>receptor</b> sites within the CNS (a competitive antagonist, not a direct agonist), thereby preventing the action of both endogenous and xenobiotic opiates on these receptors without directly producing any effects itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Clinical {{observation}} and experimental {{studies have indicated}} that a single exposure to morphine could induce tolerance and dependence. It has become a concern in clinical antinociceptive practice. However, the underling mechanism remains unknown. This study was designed to explore the changes of dopamine (DA) neuron activities in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) by employing a spectral analysis followed single morphine treatment. Results Acute morphine treatment significantly increased not only the firing rate and firing population but also the power of slow oscillation of DA neurons in naïve rats. These changes lasted at least for 3 days following the morphine treatment. During this period of time, responses of the DA neurons to subsequent morphine challenge were diminished. We further demonstrated a transient desensitization of <b>opiate</b> <b>receptors</b> as monitored by GTPγS binding to G-proteins. The present study provided first direct evidence for the temporal changes in the VTA DA neuron activities and <b>opiate</b> <b>receptors</b> desensitization. Conclusion Prolonged VTA DA neuron activation and <b>opiate</b> <b>receptors</b> desensitization followed single morphine exposure may underlie the development of dependence and tolerance that may associate with the acute analgesic tolerance and acute addiction of morphine. </p...|$|R

A variety of pharmacological antagonists (phentolamine, propranolol, methysergide, atropine, diphenhydramine, cimetidine, naloxone) did not modify any of the cerebral vascular effects produced by the opiates.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the activity of <b>opiate</b> <b>receptors</b> involved in the regulation of LH secretion in relationship to ovariectomy. Menstruating fertile (n = 5) and climacteric (n = 7) patients and postmenopausal (n = 5) women who underwent therapeutical bilateral ovariectomy were studied in the first week postsurgery and LH plasma levels were evaluated after naloxone (4 mg in bolus plus 4 mg infusion/ 90 min), LHRH (10 micrograms + 10 micrograms iv) and saline administration. Two groups of fertile (n = 6) and postmenopausal (n = 6) subjects were studied as controls. Since the LH responsiveness to naloxone was impaired in climacteric patients after ovariectomy, the test was repeated in 5 of them after 1 and 6 months of estrogen-gestagen treatment (conjugated estradiol + noretisterone acetate), showing a significant increase in all patients in both cases. In four subjects treated with only gestagen, naloxone was still unable to significantly modify LH plasma levels. These results indicate that ovariectomy affects the activity of <b>opiate</b> <b>receptors,</b> resulting in the first week postsurgery LH rise inversely related to basal LH levels.

40|$|Opiates are {{important}} regulators of reproductive {{function in the}} rat, potently inhibiting gonadotropin secretion. However, the role of opiates in the control of lordosis, hormone-dependent female sexual behavior, is less clear. While opiate agonists inhibit lordosis, antagonists do not consistently facilitate behavior. The {{purpose of the present}} experiments was to further investigate opiate regulation of lordosis, and to examine the role of other neurotransmitter systems in the actions of opiates. The opiate antagonist naltrexone was found to facilitate lordosis in estrogen-primed rats. Naltrexone facilitated behavior was compared to the facilitation of behavior by progesterone. The medial preoptic area (POA) was found to be important in the actions of naltrexone. The role of serotonergic systems in the opiate regulation of lordosis was examined. Lesions of hypothalamic serotonergic terminals blocked the inhibition of behavior by morphine. Naltrexone increased the rate of norepinephrine turnover, but decreased the rate of serotonin turnover in the POA. These changes were not seen {{in other areas of the}} brain. Both naltrexone and morphine increased the rate of serotonin synthesis in the POA. The dissociation between the rates of serotonin synthesis and turnover is discussed. Opiate regulation of serotonin turnover was indirectly assessed by examining changes in serotonin receptors after treatment with opiates. Opiates might be regulating serotonin release by actions at <b>opiate</b> <b>receptors</b> on serotonergic terminals in the POA. Levels of <b>opiate</b> <b>receptors</b> were measured after selective serotonergic lesions. Mu and delta <b>opiate</b> <b>receptors</b> in the POA were decreased after the lesion, suggesting that <b>opiate</b> <b>receptors</b> are located on serotonin terminals, and providing a neuroanatomical basis for opiate regulation of serotonin turnover.
