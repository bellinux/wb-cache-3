5|$|Note that in {{this case}} the Dvorak T-number (in this case T2.5) was simply used as a guide but <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> {{determined}} how the NHC decided to set the system's intensity.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>factors</b> {{that have}} {{hindered}} art criticism of Navajo textiles include the common distinction between fine art and applied {{art and the}} scholarly theory among some archaeologists and art historians that pure artistic expression cannot exist among non-literate peoples.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{of leisure}} have {{determined}} that observable patterns cannot be easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. The type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's immediate situation (presence or lack of family, age, and <b>other</b> <b>factors).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} not {{completely}} understood, but involves a T cell-mediated immune response triggered {{by a variety of}} factors.

5|$|This {{equation}} basically {{describes the}} existence of the jet stream, a westerly current of air with maximum wind speeds close to the tropopause which is (even though <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> are also important) the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole.|$|E
5|$|A British {{beekeeper}} successfully {{developed a}} strain of bees that are resistant to varroa mites. Russian honey bees also resist infestations of varroa mites but are still susceptible to <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> associated with colony collapse disorder, and have detrimental traits that limit their relevance in commercial apiculture.|$|E
5|$|A Lebanese {{passport}} does not, in itself, entitle {{the holder}} to enter another country. To enter another country, the traveler {{must comply with}} the visa and entry requirements of the other countries to be visited, which vary {{from country to country}} and may apply specifically to a particular passport type, the traveller's nationality, criminal history, health issues, evidence of sufficient funds, evidence of ticket for exit or many <b>other</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|E

50|$|This also degenerates to long multiplication: both {{coefficients}} of one factor are multipled by the sole coefficient of the <b>other</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|R
5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> working against the trait.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} arcade, the other main draw for the centers since the {{beginning}} was its animatronic show, until the mid-1990s. More recently, less attention {{has been placed on}} animatronics. However, there are now several different styles of animatronic shows in use within the company, depending on when the location opened, whether it was renovated, and <b>other</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or <b>other</b> <b>factors.</b> Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E

5|$|Among <b>other</b> <b>factors,</b> {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and vandalism have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava {{in the early to}} mid-2000s, the city was a setting in the 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed in the city and suburbs of Prague, the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|Besides visa requirements, most {{countries}} specify other requirements which preclude {{the entry of}} citizens of the Republic of Lebanon and other citizens into their country, for example the prospective entrant has a criminal history, health issues, evidence of sufficient funds, evidence of ticket for exit or many <b>other</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} {{is common}} in military usage, for military vehicles, for firing positions and other installations, and for individual soldiers, where uniforms, equipment such as helmets, and face paint {{may be used to}} break up outlines and features. Disruptive coloration, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> including shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E

40|$|Tat and Talysh are two less-widely-used Iranian {{languages}} {{indigenous to}} Azerbaijan. Sociolinguistic research revealed that both languages are being displaced {{in some communities}} but coexist with Azerbaijani in <b>others.</b> <b>Factors</b> contributing to these differences include isolation, ethnic diversity, and economic opportunity. One <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> contributing to displacement is a desire to see children excel in school. This could well {{be the most important}} factor breaking transmission {{from one generation to the}} next. In light of this, it is important to document the language and culture while they are vital. 1...|$|R

5|$|Failing {{to gather}} enough {{support for a}} floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats {{controlled}} both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994. Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many <b>other</b> <b>factors.</b> The First Lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44percent in April 1994 and 35percent by September 1994.|$|E
5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> that must be taken into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 Brookley Air Force Base {{was closed}} by the Department of Defense, dealing Mobile's economy a severe blow. The closing {{resulted}} in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> related to industrial restructuring ushered {{in a period of}} economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.|$|E
