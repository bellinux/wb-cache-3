5|$|Official {{religion}} {{involved a}} variety of rituals, based in temples. Some rites were performed every day, whereas others were festivals, taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity. The gods received their <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> daily ceremonies, in which their statues were clothed, anointed, and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor. These <b>offerings,</b> <b>in</b> addition to maintaining maat for the gods, celebrated deities' life-giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful.|$|E

5|$|A {{prominent}} {{tradition is}} that of the ship burial, where the deceased was laid in a boat, or a stone ship, and given grave <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> accordance with his earthly status and profession, sometimes including sacrificed slaves. Afterwards, piles of stone and soil were usually laid on top of the remains {{in order to create a}} tumulus.|$|E

5|$|The gods {{involved}} in a festival also received various <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, so {{it is likely that}} the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.|$|E
5|$|A small {{platform}} {{was added}} to the East Platform in the Early Classic, the surface of the platform possesses a series of holes that may have supported banners. The platform covered a large pit that contained the bodies of seventeen sacrificial victims, including men, women and children, possibly sacrificed during a dedicatory ceremony for the platform itself. In the 4th century AD the first version of Structure 5D-82 was built, {{to the north of the}} East Platform. In the second half of the 4th century six tombs were built in the East Platform. Ceramic <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> the tombs included effigy vessels representing monkeys and macaws. The high artistic and technical quality of the funerary <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> these tombs identify the deceased as members of Tikal's elite; they may have been members of a line of the ruling dynasty that lost power among the political upheaval of the late 4th century and included the kings K'inichMuwaanJol and ChakTokIch'aakI. With the entry of Siyaj K'ak' and the establishment of a new political order in the city, the focus of royal funerary rites was shifted from the Mundo Perdido to the North Acropolis.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's {{undergraduate}} and graduate programs are divided into six colleges. Collaboration among the colleges is frequent, as mandated {{by a number of}} interdisciplinary degree programs and research centers. Georgia Tech has sought to strengthen its {{undergraduate and}} graduate <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> less technical fields, primarily those under the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. That particular College has seen a 20% increase in admissions. Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer a Bachelor of Arts degree, only a Bachelor of Science.|$|E

The bank received a US$9.7 billion capital injection in 2007 from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (currently GIC Private Limited effective from July 2013), which {{remains one of the}} bank's largest shareholders. UBS also received capital from the Swiss government, further complemented by a series of equity <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> 2007, 2008, and 2009.|$|E
5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere. Mortuary <b>offerings,</b> <b>in</b> which {{family members or}} hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, the gifts to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.|$|E
5|$|The {{materials}} used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial <b>offerings.</b> <b>In</b> New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the membrane. Mulberry trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance—instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The Yakuts believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya {{believed}} in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities. These deities needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would act as go-betweens for their living descendants in dealings with the denizens of the supernatural realm. The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural realm were shamans. Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan (oracular) priests. Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the general concepts held by Maya society, and developed them into religious cults that justified their right to rule. In the Late Preclassic, the pinnacle of this process was the combination of ultimate political and religious power in the divine king, the k'uhul ajaw. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the belief system through archaeology, some indicators of ritual practice do leave physical traces. These include dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials and their associated funerary <b>offerings.</b> <b>In</b> addition, Maya art, architecture, and writing all assist in the reconstruction of ancient Maya beliefs; these can be combined with ethnographic sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.|$|E

25|$|The product gap—also {{called the}} segment or {{positioning}} gap—is {{that part of}} the market a particular organization is excluded from because of product or service characteristics. This may be because the market is segmented and the organization does not have <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> some segments, or because the organization positions its <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> a way that effectively excludes certain potential consumers—because competitive offerings are much better placed for these consumers.|$|E
