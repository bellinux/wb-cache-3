The theoretical part of the thesis presents the ways of practicing art activities for therapeutic purposes, the history of such activities, their forms and potential providers and users of these activities. There are also definitions of the notions of motivation, creativity and relaxation in general and with regard to artistic expression in particular, and methods and forms of work included by visual arts teachers {{in the learning process}} of art activities. The pedagogical and research part was carried out at the <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> <b>centre</b> Ince Mengeš, where I implemented the set objectives and attempted to increase motivation, creativity and relaxation of users by general and art methods of work...|$|R
40|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Centres</b> perform {{services}} of management, care and employment under special conditions for mentally handicapped adults. The {{quality of life}} of these people depends heavily on the professionalism of the staff working with them. It is important for them to educate constantly, to be prepared for changes, to identify with the objectives of the organization, and to work towards improving the quality of work. All these require a high degree of their motivation to work. The theoretical part of the dissertation deals with motivational attitudes of employees in <b>Occupational</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Centres.</b> Different motivation theories and motivation factors that affect their work are dealt with. It has been found out that the most motivated employees are the ones who reach the objectives of the organization and their personal objectives simultaneously. Managers play an important role at motivating employees as well. Despite of the fact that material rewarding is still a strong incentive (although a short-term one), the only truly effective incentive is intrinsic motivation. Only a manager who takes into account the knowledge of intrinsic motivation can expect the employees to co-operate, follow the jointly developed objectives, and feel good in the workplace. The empirical part with two questionnaires measures the employees' motivation and job satisfaction. It has been found out that differences in employees' motivation exist in terms of their age, working period, level of education, and workplace. Employees are satisfied with their direct manager and co-workers, and partly with the work they perform; however, they are not satisfied with their salary and promotion prospects. In addition to the scientific ground of the dissertation, it also has the value of professional application. The conclusion offers some guidelines to improve the employees' satisfaction and to stimulate motivation at work. It provides effective strategies which might lead to increased productivity and employees' satisfaction as well as to improved quality of service management, care and employment under special conditions, and thus to the higher {{quality of life of}} mentally handicapped adults. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Accumulation of {{physical}} activity throughout the day is recommended to reduce health risks and enhance quality of life. Yet, many epidemiologic studies measure leisure activity only, without assessment of <b>occupational</b> <b>activity.</b> The {{purposes of this study}} were to describe <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> and to quantify the association between <b>occupational</b> and leisure <b>activity</b> in 2991 African American and 8566 White middle-aged adults. METHODS: Physical activity was measured by the Baecke questionnaire in 1987 – 89 for participants 45 to 64 years of age in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. RESULTS: Reported <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> was greater among African American men and women compared to White men and women. Leisure activity was greater among White men and women compared to African American men and women. Work indices (range— 1 (low) to 5 (high)) were highest among African American women (2. 78) and men (2. 72), followed by White men (2. 55) and women (2. 45), adjusted for age, study center, body mass index, and perceived health status. Those with the highest <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> had lower participation in any sport or exercise than those with lower <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> across race-gender groups. CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests that studies relying solely on leisure activity may miss important information provided by <b>occupational</b> physical <b>activity...</b>|$|R

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{consistently}} demonstrated that either occupational or recreational physical activity is pro tective against colon cancer. However, {{it is unclear}} whether recreational activity is similarly protective among those who engage in high or low <b>occupational</b> <b>activity.</b> We therefore compared 440 male cases of colorectal cancer with 1164 male hospital patients. <b>Occupational</b> <b>activity</b> was defined according to job title, while recreational activity was assessed by questionnaire for three different periods of life. <b>Occupational</b> <b>activity</b> was protective with respect to colorectal cancer irrespective of whether one engaged in recreational activity at any different period of life. In contrast, recrea tional activity, performed at 20 - 44 years of age appeared to decrease colon cancer risk by 10 - 25 % irrespective of the in tensity of job activity. The present results suggest that, although we observed a larger effect with <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> than with recreational activity, middle-aged men may reduce their risk of colorectal cancer if they exercise when they are not working.

40|$|China has {{recently}} undergone rapid {{social and economic}} change. Increases in urbanization have led to equally rapid shifts toward more sedentary occupations through the acquisition of new technology and transitions away from a mostly agricultural economy. Our purpose was to utilize a detailed measure of urbanicity comprising 10 dimensions of urban services and infrastructure to examine its effects on the <b>occupational</b> physical <b>activity</b> patterns of Chinese adults. Longitudinal data were from individuals aged 18 - 55 from the years 1991 - 1997 of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (N= 4376 men and 4384 women). Logistic multilevel regression analyses indicated that men had 68 % greater odds, and women had 51 % greater odds, of light versus heavy <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> given the mean change in urbanization over the 6 -year period. Further, simulations showed that light <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> increased linearly with increasing urbanization. After controlling for individual-level predictors, community-level urbanization explained 54 % and 40 % {{of the variance in}} <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> for men and women, respectively. This study provides empirical evidence of the reduction in intensity of <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> with modernization. It is likely that urbanization will continue unabated in China and this is liable to lead to further transitions in the labor market resulting in additional reductions in work-related <b>activity.</b> Because <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> remains the major source of energy expenditure for adults, unless alternative forms are widely adopted, the Chinese population is at risk of dramatic increases in the numbers of overweight and obese individuals.

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{associations}} of physical activity with smoking and alcohol consumption. It examined whether these associations are due to people participating in organized sports (the sport hypothesis), and/or reflect the concentration of drinking and smoking in manual occupational groups (the occupation hypothesis). Methods Data from the 2003 Health Survey for England (n = 11, 617) were analyzed from a multilevel perspective. Four models were specified to examine the variation of heavy drinking, smoking, sports <b>activity,</b> and <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> across different sociodemographic groups; and four sets of analyses further explored the associations of sports and <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> with heavy drinking and smoking. Results Some support was found for both the sport and occupation hypothesis. Sports activity and heavy drinking were more prevalent among sportsclub members, and <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> and heavy drinking were more prevalent among manual occupational groups. Sportsclub membership accounted for some of the association between sports activity and heavy drinking; and occupational position partly accounted for the association between <b>occupational</b> <b>activity</b> and heavy drinking. The occupation hypothesis is the more likely explanation for the association between physical activity and smoking.

Results indicated that men participated more frequently in physical activities than women, and women were more active in <b>occupational</b> <b>activities,</b> such as housework and work as volunteers. Higher frequency of participation in <b>occupational</b> <b>activities</b> was associated with higher education, higher income, and higher functional status.

40|$|Background: Hospital based {{studies of}} {{occupational}} {{risk factors for}} knee disorders are complicated {{by the possibility of}} selective referral to hospital of people whose work is made difficult by their symptoms. AIMS: To explore the extent of such bias and to assess the association of meniscal injury with <b>occupational</b> <b>activities.</b> Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to a community sample of 2806 men aged 20 - 59 years in southern England. This asked about lifetime <b>occupational</b> and sporting <b>activities,</b> and any history of knee symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer. Rates of hospital referral were compared in symptomatic men according to their <b>occupational</b> <b>activities.</b> In a nested case-control investigation, the <b>occupational</b> <b>activities</b> of 67 men who reported meniscectomy were compared with those of 335 controls. Results: Among 1404 men who responded to the questionnaire, the lifetime prevalence of knee symptoms was 54 %, and in 70 % of cases the symptoms had started suddenly, usually while playing sport. Symptomatic men whose work entailed kneeling or squatting {{were more likely to be}} referred to an orthopaedic surgeon than the average (28 % and 31 % versus 24 %), especially if they experienced locking of the knee (69 % and 73 % versus 43 %). In the nested case-control study, meniscectomy was associated with playing soccer and work that involved regular kneeling or squatting. Coclusions: Results suggest that hospital referral for knee symptoms is influenced to some extent by patients' <b>occupational</b> <b>activities.</b> Playing soccer is confirmed as a strong risk factor for knee cartilage injury...|$|R
