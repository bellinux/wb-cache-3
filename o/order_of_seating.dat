5000|$|In Russian history, Mestnichestvo (Ме́стничество, from , a position) was a feudal {{hierarchical}} system in Russia from the 15th to 17th centuries. Mestnichestvo was a complicated system of seniority which dictated which government posts a boyar could occupy. It {{was based on}} the individual's seniority within an extended Russian aristocratic family on the one hand, and on the order of precedence of the families, on the other. The hierarchy of families was calculated based on the historical records of senior appointments, going back to 1475. For example, the Odoevskys clan was ranked higher than the Buturlins, but a senior Buturlin could be appointed to a position equivalent to that occupied by a junior member of the Odoevsky family. The mestnichestvo seniority system was most visibly represented in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>seating</b> of the boyars at the tsar's table. The clans jealously guarded their status. This often led to bitter disputes and physical violence among nobles about their ancestry and their services to the monarch. According to eminent Russian 19th century historian Vasily Klyuchevsky, [...] "you could beat a boyar up, you could take away his property, you could expel him from government service, but you could never make him accept an appointment or a seat at the tsar's table lower than what he is entitled to." ...|$|E
5000|$|William C. Sturtevant {{wrote about}} the Nootka in [...] "Handbook of North American Indians: Northwest Xoast":"Kinship and {{hereditary}} rank were fundamental {{in the organization of}} Nootkan society. Kinship terminology is lineal in parents' generation and Hawaiian in ego's generation, consistent with ambilineal descent and the option to shift residence. The generations are consistently distinguished, and within ego's generation, senior and junior lines are distinguished. Parents' older and younger siblings' children are called by the terms used for own older and younger siblings, and the distinction continues in subsequent generations, so that an old man might call a boy 'older brother' if the boy's grandparent was the older sibling of his own grandparent. This usage is consistent with the importance of primogeniture. Brother and sister treated one another with reserve, especially while unmarried. Those called brother and sister could not marry, even if remote cousins, but if kinship was so remote that links could not be traced it was possible [...] "to marry one's own", usually to get back hereditary rights that had left a descent line. Parent-child relations were close, and grandparent-grandchild especially close, as children often stayed with grandparents. Aunts and uncles were like parents, and one helped oneself to their things without asking. With parents-in-law there was great familiarity. Step-father and step-daughter kept their distance. Descent was ambilateral and kinship traced in any line allowed an individual to claim membership in more than one local group. Residence with a given group activated membership in it as a kinsman, and while there the individual gave it his loyalty and participated in its activities. Although residence was mainly patrilocal, in the long run there was no set rule. People were constantly moving between groups. Rank was closely linked with kinship, positions, such as chief, being inherited by primogeniture. A chief (the native term, hawii, also means 'wealthy upper class') was simply the highest-ranking member of a kin group of whatever level. Rank was founded on inherited rights called tupa'ti, thought of as property, which governed the ownership and use of practically everything of value. Tupa'ti, depending on their nature, could be inherited by an eldest son, shared by several children, held by an eldest daughter until her marriage and then transferred to her brother, or given to a son-in-law as common alternatives. There was a sense of patrimony of rights in a local group to be kept as intact as possible as it passed down through successive chiefs. The inheritance of tupa'ti tended to be through males. Over generations a number of descent lines developed in a group in a ranked relationship made explicit at feasts and potlatches in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>seating,</b> serving, and gift receiving. Rank was also constantly embodied in the place occupied in the big house. The top chief and house owner occupied the right rear (right for one facing the entrance), the next in rank, a brother or other close kinsman, the left rear. In between might be the head's married sons. Left and right front corners belonged to the third and fourth ranked. Middle sides could be for fifth and sixth ranked. Such interior locations were hereditarily owned. By the entrance were the slaves, mostly war captives, who were significant as trade objects, protective attendants, and even sacrificial victims. Commoners (were either those living with a chief, often quite close relatives, or less definitely associated transients along the sides. They always belonged to some chief who addressed them as kin. Even secondary chiefs were mascim (commoner) to a head chief. Although rank was graded continuously, an upper stratum could be distinguished consisting of indisputable chiefs with potlacht seats and titles to resource sites plus closely associated supporters, generally immediate relatives. Chiefs were the nuclei of Nootkan society; they owned practically everything and ideally did not work but directed followers. A chief and his family wore richer dress, abalone and dentallum ornaments, sea otter or fur-trimmed robes, and decorated rain hats and owned powerful symbols. For the use of resource sites the chief collected a tribute in kind, of no fixed amount, with which he could give a feast. However, big sea or land mammals belomged to the hunter who gave a feast with his catch. A chief's sons and younger brothers were subsidiary chiefs, war chiefs, and speakers, but the eldest son nominally took the top position while still a youth to ensure succession, the father continuing to actually run affairs. Some younger brothers of chiefs became independent chiefs through conquest of other groups. Other avenues to chiefship were potlatching or marriage to a woman of high rank. A chief and his more distantly related commoners were interdependent, the maintenance of his high standing resting on the support of the commoners, who in return had their children named ceremonially, were assisted in marriages, often lent privileges for social use and even granted minor rights. The chief of a group was regarded as a father looking after his children, authoritarian but beneficent".Irving Goldman thought that the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast could be related to the Polynesians. He wrote:"For reasons that remain to be discovered, the Indian tribes of this area Coast share formal principles of rank, lineage, and kinship with Pacific islanders. The Kwakiutl, especially, seem very close to what I have designated as the [...] "traditional" [...] Polynesian society. They share with Polynesians a status system of graded hereditary ranking of individuals and of lineages; a social class system of chiefs ("nobles"), commoners, and slaves; concepts of primogeniture and seniority of descent lines; a concept of abstract supernatural powers as special attributes of chiefs; and a lineage system that leans toward patriliny, but acknowledges the maternal lines as well. Finally, Kwakiutl and eastern Polynesians, especially, associate ambiguity of lineage membership with [...] "Hawaiian" [...] type kinship, a fully classificatory system that does not distinguish between maternal and paternal sides, or between siblings and cousins".Ranking by matrilineal primogeniture (the nephews of a man by an elder sister rank higher than his nephews by a younger sister) prevailed among the Natchez.|$|E

40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} describes vibrations {{that are}} transferred from a supporting surface {{to the human}} body. Low back injury is a major health issue amongst heavy machine operators and seat selection is important for reducing vibration exposure. Modeling the vibration attenuation properties <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> is one approach for predicting the performance <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> in different vibration environments. An efficient neural network (NN) algorithm identified the vibration attenuation properties <b>of</b> five suspension <b>seats</b> that are commonly used in the Northern Ontario mining sector. Each <b>of</b> the NN <b>seat</b> models strongly predicted vertical seatpan r. m. s. accelerations from the chassis accelerations and a measure of driver anthropometrics. We implemented the developed NN models to evaluate the performance <b>of</b> industrial <b>seats</b> {{for a variety of}} skidders from the forestry sector and load-haul-dump vehicles from the underground mining environment. Our results demonstrated that seat selection is not universal. The performance and rank <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>seats</b> varied between vibration environments based on the calculated equivalent daily exposure (A(8)) values. We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of specific vibration frequency components on the predicted daily exposure values. This analysis revealed that each <b>of</b> the industrial <b>seats</b> responded differently to specific vibration frequencies and explained why the seat selection algorithm matched particular seats to specific vibration environments. We also evaluated the performance of the new No-JoltTM air-inflated cushion with multi-axis vibration exposures and vertical jolt exposures. The vibration attenuation properties were assessed for two seat suspensions (with relatively good and poor initial performance) when their foam cushions were replaced with the air-inflated cushion. The air cushion only improved the vibration attenuation properties <b>of</b> the <b>seat</b> that initially had good performance. We also observed that operator’s anthropometrics and sex influenced the performance of the air-inflated cushion in certain cases when vibration environment includes jolt exposures. All of our findings emphasize the importance of matching the specific seat/cushion to the particular vibration environment in order to reduce heavy machine operators’ vibration exposure and minimize their health risks...|$|R

This paper demonstrates how the precedence order, i. e. {{the order in which}} different types <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> are filled by applicants, has quantitative effects on dis-tributional objectives comparable to priorities in the celebrated deferred acceptance algorithm. While Boston’s school choice plan gives priority to neighborhood applicants for half <b>of</b> each school’s <b>seats,</b> the intended effect of this policy is lost because <b>of</b> the precedence <b>order.</b> Despite widely held impressions about the importance of neighborhood priority, the outcome of Boston’s implementation of a 50 - 50 school split is nearly identical to a system without neighborhood pri-ority.
