5000|$|Another [...] "test" [...] used {{to check}} if {{the evil eye}} was cast {{is that of the}} oil: under normal conditions, olive oil floats in water, as it is less dense than water. The test of the oil is {{performed}} by placing one drop of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glass of water, typically holy water. If the drop floats, the test concludes there is no evil eye involved. If the drop sinks, then it is asserted that the evil eye is cast indeed. Another form of the test is to place two drops of olive oil into a glass of water. If the drops remain separated, the test concludes there is no evil eye, but if they merge, there is. There is also a third form where in a plate full of water the [...] "healer" [...] places three or nine drops of oil. If the oil drops become larger and eventually dissolve in the water there is evil eye. If the drops remain separated from water in a form of a small circle there isn't. The first drops are the most important and the number of drops that dissolve in water indicate the strength of the evil eye.|$|E

40|$|Flavor is an {{important}} quality criterion for virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> The identifi cation of the compounds causing the fl avor or off-fl avor therefore is the key for quality control. Their ana-lysis <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> usually requires more or less cumbersome sample preparation like liquid/liquid extraction, solid phase extraction or distillation techniques, often with the draw-back of organic solvent use. Headspace and purge & trap methods do not use organic solvents, but their analyte range is restricted to the volatiles and therefore characterizes more the compounds contributing to aroma/smell of a sample, not the fl avor/taste.

This is an epoxide-containing commercial polymethacrylic carrier with suitable characteristics for enzyme immobilization. The immobilized lipase suitable for pentyl octanoate synthesis has been prepared by a direct lipase binding to polymers via their epoxide groups.

Exemplary is the case of extra-virgin olive oil.

First of all, binary blends of twelve olive oils and one sunflower oil were studied, in order to evaluate the variability associated to the fatty acids profile of olive oils (Monfreda, Gobbi, & Grippa, 2012). In this study, binary blends of twelve olive oils with four types of seeds oils (peanut, corn, rice and grape seed oils) were evaluated. These four groups of blends were analysed and processed separately, each group consisting of 36 samples with 40 %, 50 % and 60 % of olive oil content. Chemometric tools were also applied to the global data set (180 samples, including those analysed in the previous paper). Outstanding results were achieved, showing that the proposed method would be capable to discriminate blends with a difference in concentration of olive oil lower than 5 % (a standard error of prediction of 3. 97 % was obtained with PLS). Therefore blends containing 45 % and 55 % of olive oil were also analysed with the current method and added to the data sets for chemometric assessment with supervised tools. SIMCA still provided good models; however the best performance was achieved by processing each group of binary blends (consisting of 60 samples) separately, rather than applying SIMCA to the overall data set (300 samples).
