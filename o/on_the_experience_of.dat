5|$|The walled towns {{were planned}} {{out in a}} regular fashion, drawing both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> {{equivalent}} bastides in France and on various English planned settlements. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside the walls. The towns had varying levels of success. Measured in terms of burgages, town properties rented from the Crown by citizens, Conwy had 99 around 1295, and Caernarfon had 57 in 1298. Harlech lagged badly behind in terms of growth, and the town had only 24 and a half burgages in 1305. The castles were entrusted by Edward to constables, charged to defend them and, in some cases, also empowered to defend the town walls as well. Permanent garrisons of soldiers were established, 40 at Caernarfon, 30 at Conwy and 36 at Harlech, equipped with crossbows and armour. The castles and towns were all ports and could be supplied by sea if necessary, an important strategic advantage as Edward's navy had near total dominance around the Welsh coastline. The castles were each equipped with a rear or postern gate {{that would allow them}} to resupplied directly by sea even if the town had fallen.|$|E

25|$|The IITs had {{initially}} a quota system, but the quota system was scrapped and the modified scheme described below {{was introduced in}} 1983.

The logic cited for this procedure is that IITs being Institutes of National Importance, {{there should not be}} any compromise on the quality of students studying in them; accordingly, students admitted through the reserved quota have no relaxation in requirements for passing courses or getting the degree. They are, however, allowed to complete the program at a slower pace (take longer to get the degree).|$|E

Justice Marshall asserts: “It is the nature of (a) Constitution that only its great outlines be marked”. It is a document intended “to endure for ages” and therefore, it has to be interpreted not merely {{on the basis of the}} intention and understanding of the its framers but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> its working effectively, in the existing social and political context.|$|E
