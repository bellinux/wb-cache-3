5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and <b>one</b> <b>had</b> been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false <b>one</b> <b>had</b> also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside.

In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He {{moved his family}} from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no <b>one</b> <b>had</b> found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E

5|$|Besides the patrols {{made during}} this {{deployment}} in northwestern waters, Yorktown conducted routine operations such as target practices. Among the officers {{assigned to the}} ship {{at that time was}} Lt. Bradley Fiske, a young officer who had invented and constructed a practical telescopic gunsight. Fiske's sight had been tested in Baltimore and had favorably impressed that ship's officers—including her commander, Captain Winfeld S. Schley. Evans, however, had not taken a liking to Fiske's newfangled gadget but nevertheless consented to allow a second test on board Yorktown (the first <b>one</b> <b>had</b> failed miserably). On the afternoon of 22 September 1892, during scheduled target practice, Fiske's invention worked as designed and elicited praise from Evans. As Fiske himself later wrote in the United States Naval Institute's magazine Proceedings, modern naval gunnery had its birth not in the British Navy but in the American—off Unalaska on 22 September 1892, in Yorktown.|$|E

5|$|Carrington and Johnson {{speculated that}} Leigh was {{assaulted}} {{by the group}} of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being raped, and was murdered by Webster and two others {{because they were afraid}} she would tell other people.

5|$|Encouraged by a friend, {{she went}} to Paris to become a writer but had little success. While in Paris Eberhardt met the widow of Marquis de Morès. Although deMorès was {{reportedly}} murdered by Tuareg tribesmen in the Sahara, no <b>one</b> <b>had</b> been arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt {{was familiar with the}} area where deMorès died, she hired her to investigate his murder. The job benefited Eberhardt, who was destitute and longed to return to the Sahara. She returned to Algeria in July 1900, settling in El Oued. According to Sahara expert R. V. C. Bodley, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate deMorès' death; Bodley considered this due to a combination of the unwillingness of the French to co-operate in an investigation and Eberhardt's fatalism rather than deliberate dishonesty. Word eventually got back to the deMorès widow about Eberhardt's lackluster investigation, and she subsequently cut off her funding.|$|E
