5|$|Business M-17 (Bus. M-17) was a {{business}} route designation used along a section of highway from 1945 until 1956. It was routed along Washtenaw and Michigan avenues and Ecorse Road in the Ypsilanti area. At {{the time of its}} commissioning, M-17 was moved to a freeway bypass of downtown Ypsilanti. It was later decommissioned in 1956 when the freeway bypass was completed west around the south side of Ann Arbor. M-17 was moved back to its original routing through downtown Ypsilanti, supplanting Bus. M-17 when US12/US112 supplanted M-17 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b>|$|E
5|$|But in 1960, Jacob Dekema, the {{district}} highway engineer, stated {{that due to}} lower traffic on US 80, {{the completion of the}} freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971. Construction of the section of US 80 from Magnolia Avenue to Third Street was contracted for $2.7 million in April. That year, work continued <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway,</b> and in August, only one traffic signal was left on the highway west of El Cajon, at Ward Road. In August, Dekema announced that bids for the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month; once that was completed, the entire freeway west of El Cajon would be complete. Eastbound lanes between US 395 and Fairmount Avenue opened on November 23.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the freeway}} began in 1975 {{in the two}} states. Due to a chronic lack of funding, {{construction}} in Ohio was stalled between 1976 and 1981. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio was able to restart construction, and by 1983, both states had completed construction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b> The three-level diamond interchange with concurrent highways U.S. Route 250 (US250) and West Virginia Route 2 (WV2) on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was thought to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia's Interstate Highway System at the time of construction. On average, between 25,500 and 37,840vehicles use the highway daily.|$|E

5|$|Route 21 {{was created}} in 1927 to run from Newark to Belleville. In 1948, the route was {{extended}} north to Paterson. In the 1950s construction began <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> portion of Route 21 and it was completed in stages between Chester Avenue in Newark and Monroe Street in Passaic between 1958 and 1973. Plans were made to extend the freeway north to Interstate 80 in Elmwood Park; however, they were opposed by residents living {{on the east side}} of the Passaic River. In the 1980s, another northern extension of the Route 21 freeway was proposed to U.S. Route 46 in Clifton; this section was built between 1997 and 2000. The surface portion of Route 21 through Newark underwent many improvements in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E
5|$|A north–south freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic {{to bypass the}} city of Detroit. This plan {{was included in the}} 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> through downtown Detroit.|$|E

5|$|Dedicated bus lanes {{have existed}} on the Kwinana Freeway {{since the late}} 1980s, when a project {{was set up to}} {{decrease}} bus commuters' travel times into Perth from suburbs south of the Swan River. In 1987, Main Roads Western Australia and Transperth trialled a contraflow bus lane along the Kwinana Freeway, from the Canning Interchange to the Narrows Interchange. The lane operated between 7:00 am and 9:30 am, the period with the most traffic congestion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b> After two months, the results were examined, and the agencies decided to build an additional bus lane on the northbound carriageway. The construction included bus-only ramps {{at the beginning and end}} of the lane. The works were mainly funded by Transperth, which contributed $8.22 million out of the $10.23 million total cost. The remaining $2.01 million was provided by Main Roads Western Australia. The bus lane opened on 20 November 1989, and received an Institute of Engineers award for engineering excellence.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a freeway linking Scituate with suburban Warwick, the proposed alignment of Route 37 was later shortened to an alignment linking I-295 with I-95. Construction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> began in 1963 and was completed by 1969. An eastward extension across upper Narragansett Bay was proposed in 1966; this proposal would have extended Route 37 north to I-195 and I-295 in Attleboro, Massachusetts, completing a beltway around the city of Providence. This extended route was approved and given the I-895 designation in 1968, but the extension was ultimately canceled by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT). In the 1980s, Route 37 was included in proposals for an eastward extension of Interstate 84 from Hartford, Connecticut to Rhode Island, but this alignment was also canceled. RIDOT has long-range plans to extend Route 37 east to Route 117 in Downtown Warwick, but plans for a westward extension have been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{completed}} the freeway bypass of the Ann Arbor–Ypsilanti in 1956, then moved the M-17 designation back to Washtenaw Avenue, Michigan Avenue and Ecorse Road, removing Bus. M-17 in the process. US12 and US112 replaced the BYPUS112 designation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b> The former US112 designation through downtown Ypsilanti was {{converted to a}} BUSUS112 designation, including sections concurrent with M-17. Another change was made to the Ann-Arbor section of the highway as it was truncated to end at US23. The 1962 completion of the US23 freeway through the Ann Arbor area by MSHD moved the western terminus of M-17 west to meet the new freeway at the current terminus. The eastern terminus was progressively scaled back starting in 1968. The US25 concurrency was removed and the terminus was moved to M-39/Southfield Road in Allen Park. A second truncation scaled the terminus back to US12, the current eastern endpoint.|$|E

5|$|Though the National Freeway was {{designated}} as US48, as {{the completion of}} the freeway neared, the possibility of the freeway being designated as an Interstate Highway came up. In the 1980s, the project to improve US50 between Washington, D.C., and Annapolis to Interstate Highway standards had been assigned the designation of I-68. MDSHA, however, later concluded that adding additional route shields to the US50 freeway would not be helpful to drivers, since about half the freeway already had two route designations (US50 and US301) and drivers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> were already familiar with the US50 designation. This made the designation to be applied to that freeway more flexible, and so in 1989, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the organization composed of the various state departments of transportation that decides route numbering in the United States, approved MDSHA's request to renumber the US50 freeway from I-68 to I-595. That same year, AASHTO approved changing US48's designation to I-68. This change took effect upon {{the completion of the}} last section of the National Freeway, on August 2, 1991.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) is a {{business}} loop serving Pontiac and Auburn Hills. It uses portions of former Business M-24 (Bus. M-24) through town. The highway starts as an eight-lane freeway at an interchange on I-75 in Bloomfield Township. The freeway continues past an interchange with Opdyke Road to end at Square Lake Road, dropping to six lanes. BL I-75 continues to M-1 at Woodward Avenue. Square Lake Road continues to the west as Bus. US24, BL I-75 turns northwesterly along the eight-lane divided Woodward Avenue, running concurrently with Bus. US24 into downtown Pontiac. At {{the south side of}} downtown, Woodward drops to six lanes the two directions of Woodward Avenue split and form a four-lane loop. The Woodward Avenue Loop encircles downtown Pontiac, and it is crossed by the eastbound direction of M-59 running on Huron Street. One block north, the westbound direction of M-59 runs along University Drive and turns to follow BL I-75/Bus. US24 (Woodward Avenue Loop). The loop intersects Perry Street another block further north, and BL I-75 turns northeasterly onto the two-way Perry Street. BL I-75 passes through residential areas and a minor business area along the four-lane Perry Street. Outside of the downtown area, Perry Street widens to include a center turn lane. North of Walton Boulevard in Auburn Hills, the street name changes to Lapeer Road. BL I-75 intersects Opdyke Road a couple hundred feet west of I-75 before crossing the freeway. Lapeer Road continues as a six-lane, divided roadway to the ramps of a double trumpet interchange, where the BL I-75 designation ends. The roadway however, continues as M-24 providing access to the Palace of Auburn Hills. On average each day in 2013, 9,829vehicles use the business loop between the two M-59 junctions, and 73,795vehicles do so <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> stub east of Opdyke Road, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
5|$|The first {{segment of}} what later became I-94 within the state, the Willow Run Expressway, was built near Ypsilanti and Belleville in 1941, with an easterly {{extension}} to Detroit in 1945. This expressway was initially numbered M-112. In the mid-1950s, {{state and federal}} officials planned an Interstate to replace the original route of U.S. Highway12 (US12). By 1960, the length of I-94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo. Two years later, the US12 designation was dropped from the freeway. Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed {{most of the rest of}} the route, including the remaining sections between Detroit and Port Huron which superseded the routing of US25. The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed its connection across the state line. Since completion, I-94 has remained relatively unchanged; a few interchanges have been rebuilt, a second span was constructed for the Blue Water Bridge, and in 1987, a plane crashed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> during take off from the airport in Detroit. The routing of I-94 is notable for containing the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States, connecting to the Lodge Freeway (M-10), and for comprising the first complete border-to-border toll-free freeway in a state in the United States. The highway has one auxiliary route, I-194, which serves downtown Battle Creek, and eight business routes. Various segments have been dedicated to multiple people and places.|$|E
