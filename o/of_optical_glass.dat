25|$|The {{most common}} type <b>of</b> <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> is crown glass, which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating {{would have to be}} made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a crown glass surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|E
2500|$|Thorp was a [...] "scientific and {{mechanical}} genius". In pursuit {{of his childhood}} interest in astronomy, he developed considerable skills in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> and both reflector and refractor telescopes. He also created celluloid diffraction grating replicas, polarising solar eyepieces and prominence spectroscopes that were widely used, as well as objective prisms. His high resolution diffracting grating replicas were significant advances of the ideas developed by Henry Rowland, whilst his multi-slit spectroscope {{was the first to}} enable the showing of both celestial and terrestrial objects and has formed the basis for the present day spectrohelioscope. Father Aloysius Cortie, of Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, was one whom achieved good results from an example of the objective prisms. Eventually owning houses in Whitefield and also in Prestatyn, North Wales, he constructed observatories at each of these and favoured the [...] Cooke equatorial telescope for his own observations. This device was fitted with a photo-visual objective, a spectroscope and other attachments that enabled it to be used for photography.|$|E
