5|$|The Diocletianic or Great Persecution was {{the last}} and most severe {{persecution}} <b>of</b> <b>Christians</b> in the Roman Empire. In 303, the Emperors Diocletian, Maximian, Galerius, and Constantius issued a series of edicts rescinding the legal rights <b>of</b> <b>Christians</b> and demanding that they comply with traditional Roman religious practices. Later edicts targeted the clergy and ordered all inhabitants to sacrifice to the Roman gods (a policy known as universal sacrifice). The persecution varied in intensity across the empireweakest in Gaul and Britain, where only the first edict was applied, and strongest in the Eastern provinces. Persecutory laws were nullified by different emperors at different times, but Constantine and Licinius's Edict of Milan (313) has traditionally {{marked the end of}} the persecution.|$|E

5|$|The first {{persecution}} by an emperor occurred under Nero, and {{was confined}} {{to the city of}} Rome. Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD64, some among the population held Nero responsible and that the emperor attempted to deflect blame onto the Christians. After Nero, a major persecution occurred under the emperor Domitian and a persecution in 177 took place at Lugdunum, the Gallo-Roman religious capital. A surviving letter from Pliny the Younger, governor of Bythinia, to the emperor Trajan describes his persecution and executions <b>of</b> <b>Christians.</b> The Decian persecution of 246–251 was a serious threat to the Church, but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance. Diocletian undertook what was to be the most severe persecution <b>of</b> <b>Christians,</b> lasting from 303 to 311.|$|E
