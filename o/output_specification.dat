5|$|The {{project has}} been criticised for its delayed {{completion}} date; in 2009 the Department for Transport confirmed that Network Rail was developing High Level <b>Output</b> <b>Specification</b> options for the station, with an estimated date for the re-opening of the platforms of 2014, seven years after their closure. The cost of maintaining the disused platforms up to late 2010 was found via a Freedom of Information request to have been £4.1million. South West Trains subsequently confirmed that platform 20 would be brought back into use in 2014, hosting certain services to and from Reading, Windsor, Staines and Hounslow. These would be 10-car trains newly formed from refurbished SWT and former Gatwick Express rolling stock. Platform 20 reopened in May, with access via platform 19, and platforms 21 and 22 in October after steps were constructed over the former Eurostar entrance to access the platforms.|$|E

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on the {{challenges}} faced by the public and private sectors in developing <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> for Australian public private partnership (PPP) projects. In particular, this study aims to examine how the stakeholders (including facilities managers) should cater for future changes in <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> and make them flexible enough to meet the evolving project objectives. Design/methodology/approach– The research is based on 19 semi‐structured interviews with key stakeholders from the public and private sectors in three States of Australia where PPP procurement has been used, including New South Wales (NSW), Queensland and Victoria. The results are triangulated with relevant literature for supports and contrasts. Findings– For PPP projects, a good set of <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> is conducive to the achievement of value for money, innovation, risk transfer, whole life asset performance through a clear abatement regime and an effective linkage of performance criteria to the payment mechanism. For existing specifications, it was found that too many and complex KPIs were specified, which were difficult to monitor, measure and implement by the client. Very prescriptive specifications hindered innovations and did not allow appropriate risk allocation. Further, the research study suggests that after the global financial crises, the private sector had less appetite to take the patronage risks in road and rail PPP projects. To mitigate these pitfalls, it is imperative that <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> need to be aligned with the type of PPP projects they represent; in particular foreseeable changes should be addressed by some pre‐agreed framework to facilitate negotiation. Originality/value– The significant contribution of this research is the identification of the common issues faced in drafting <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> for Australian PPP projects. Stakeholders of future PPP projects should find the lessons useful for achieving value for money and appropriate risk transfer, stating the user requirements through clear and concise <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> rather than input or prescriptive specifications in procuring social and economical PPP projects. Their relationships with facilities management are highlighted. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

25|$|The Manchester hub {{report was}} {{published}} in 2010 by Network Rail, examining possibilities of how the rail network in Manchester could be improved amid large passenger growth to and from Manchester. Network Rail proposed a £560 million scheme which would alleviate rail bottlenecks across northern England in 2011.

2500|$|In June 2011, Peter Dearman of Network Rail {{suggested}} that the third-rail network {{will need to be}} converted into overhead lines. He stated, [...] "Although the top speed is 100 mph, the trains cannot go over 80 mph well and 25% of power is lost from heat". Agreeing that conversion would be expensive, he said that the third rail network is at the limit of its power capability, especially as trains become more advanced in technology. The July 2012 Department for Transport High Level <b>Output</b> <b>Specification</b> for Network Rail Control Period 5 includes the conversion of the South Western Main Line between [...] and [...] from 750 V DC third rail to 25 kV AC overhead as part of a scheme to improve rail freight capacity from Southampton Port. This conversion is a pilot scheme to develop a business case for full conversion of the third rail network. The ORR has also stated that on safety grounds, third rail 750V DC has a limited future.|$|E

40|$|Linear {{regulators}} have <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> {{far superior to}} switch-mode techniques, except for the overall efficiency. This efficiency limitation can be overcome by applying a very low frequency supercapacitor circulation technique at the input side of a low dropout regulator IC. The technique was proven in 12 V to 5 V versions, and, can be easily applied to other power supplies such as 5 to 3. 3 V or 5 to 1. 5 V versions required by various processors. The paper outlines the concepts and experimental results related to this technique. With the commercial LDO chips available with output current ratings up to 10 A, and, thin profile supercapacitors available are with DC voltage ratings from 2. 3 V to 5. 5 V, the technique assists developing medium current linear regulators which could compete with present day switch-mode power supplies in efficiency and compactness, maintaining the superior <b>output</b> <b>specifications</b> of a linear regulator...|$|R

40|$|A public private {{partnership}} {{is an alternative}} to procurement of the facility by the public sector, using funding from tax revenues or public borrowing. In a typical public sector procurement, the public authority sets out the specifications and design of the facility, calls for bids on the basis if this detailed design, and pays for construction of the facility by a private sector contractor. The public authority has to fund {{the full cost of}} construction, including cost overruns. Operation and maintenance of the facility are handled by the public authority and the contractor takes no responsibility for the long term performance of the facility after the construction warranty period has expired. In a public private partnership, on the other hand, the authority specifies its requirements in terms of outputs, which set out the public services which the facility is intended to provide, but which do not specify how these are to be provided. It is then left to the private sector to design, finance, build and operate the facility to meet the longterm <b>output</b> <b>specifications.</b> The project company receives payments {{over the life of the}} PPP contract, which are supposed to repay the financing costs and give a return to investors.
