5|$|Thomas {{came to be}} {{appreciated}} as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning {{a living as a}} writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts.

His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E

5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literary</b> sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Rabearivelo {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} librarian at the Cercle de l'Union social club. That same year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the Malagasy language. He began to correspond {{with a wide range}} of writers around the world, including André Gide, Paul Valéry, Jean Amrouche, Paul Claudel, and Valery Larbaud, and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar. By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island. In 1924 he took a job as a proofreader at the publishing house Imprimerie de l'Imerina, a position he would continue to occupy for the rest of his life. In 1921 he befriended high-level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature, including Robert Boudry, the colony's financial manager, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar's postal magistrate and founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literary</b> magazine 18° Latitude Sud.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literary</b> {{magazine}} Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E

In December 1959 {{he became a}} vice president of the Union of Polish Writers (Związek Literatów Polskich, ZLP). He also published in the magazine Świat (1951–1969). In 1962 he was the last president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literary</b> discussion society, Klub Krzywego Koła. In 1966 he was {{a vice president of}} the PEN Club. While in the late 1940s and 1950s he focused mostly on journalistic activity, later he turned to writing popular history in book format. In the 1960s he wrote his most famous works, historical books about history of Poland – the Kingdom of Poland in the times of the Piast dynasty, the Jagiellonian dynasty, and the era of elected kings (the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth). His book on Jagiellonian Poland was recognized as the best book of the year by the readers.|$|E

His ideas were based on European civilization; for him, the development of a country was rooted in education. To this end, he founded Argentina's military and naval colleges.|$|E

5|$|The first {{description}} of the roughtail stingray was published by American naturalist Samuel Mitchell {{in one of the}} earliest North American works on ichthyology, a short treatise on the fishes of New York in the 1815 first volume of Transactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Literary</b> and Philosophical Society of New York. Mitchell based his account on specimens caught off Long Island, though did not designate any types, and named the new species Raja centroura, from the Greek centoro ("pricker") in reference to its thorns. Subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Dasyatis. This ray may also be referred to as rough-tailed stingray, rough-tailed northern stingray, or thorny stingray.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} Indonesian novels {{published}} by the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies Balai Pustaka were often written to show intergenerational conflict and conflict between traditional (adat) and modern culture. These novels, published beginning in the 1920s, spearheaded the use of Indonesian as a national language. This national awakening, which was also realised through political actions, was followed in July 1933 with the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literary</b> magazine Poedjangga Baroe (New Writer). The literary magazine, which Belenggus author Armijn Pane helped establish, was the first written mainly in Indonesian and with exclusively Indonesian editors.|$|E
5|$|The poem, {{written in}} free verse in 206 lines, uses many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literary</b> {{techniques}} {{associated with the}} pastoral elegy. It {{was written in the}} summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning {{in the aftermath of the}} assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president, Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death. Instead, Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including the symbols of the lilacs, a drooping star in the western sky (Venus), and the hermit thrush, and employs the traditional progression of the pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death. The poem also addresses the pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War (1861–1865) which ended only days before the assassination.|$|E

5|$|New, {{adjoining}} roads gradually {{began to}} appear, such as Lamesley Road, which later became Kells Lane, and Low Fell Road, which became Beaconsfield Road and Belle Vue Bank. In January 1841, local poet Thomas Wilson bought land on Durham Road and opened literary rooms which were opened in November 1841. The upper section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literary</b> rooms {{was used as}} a school for local children until the opening of a new school on a site at Kells Lane in 1895. In the 1880s there was a decade of intensive building and the population of the village increased accordingly. The relative tranquility of the village, coupled with scenic views of surrounding hills and countryside, attracted rich industrialists from nearby NewcastleuponTyne, seeking an alternative to the dirt and noise of industrial Newcastle and Gateshead. These individuals duly built and lived in mansion property in the area. One such property, Heathfield, was a mansion located on Durham Road which was built and owned by a wealthy chemical manufacturer who kept bears in his substantial adjoining grounds.|$|E
5|$|Sociology of literature, film, and art is {{a subset}} of the {{sociology}} of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Literary</b> Field (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} library was the Zusho-ryō ("Bureau of Archives") {{established}} by the Taihō Code from 701. Attached to the Daigaku-ryō, it oversaw the custody (collection and preservation) and transmission of Buddhist and Confucian books from the Nara period, until its destruction by fire in the mid-Heian period (11th century). Collection depended largely on the copying of texts held elsewhere. In addition to the Zusho-ryō, books were also copied at imperial palace libraries, private libraries of aristocrats, temple libraries and at libraries of organs of the state. In the Heian period, the majority of works held in libraries (both those produced in China and those copied in Japan) consisted of Chinese works and scholarly collections were dominated by Chinese secular works. At {{the end of the}} Heian period, the great fire of Kyoto in 1177, and the burning of temples by the Taira in 1180, destroyed a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literary</b> heritage. During the Kamakura period, the warrior class founded new libraries such as the Kanazawa Bunko.|$|E
