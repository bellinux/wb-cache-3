5|$|Because the <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus {{in areas where}} it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries.

50|$|Discredited HIV/AIDS origins {{theories}} {{include several}} iatrogenic theories, such as Edward Hooper's 1999 claim that early <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccines,</b> contaminated with a chimpanzee virus, caused the Central African outbreak.|$|R
5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine.</b> It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The first {{polio vaccine}} was the inactivated polio vaccine. It was {{developed}} by Jonas Salk and came into use in 1955. The <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{was developed by}} Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961. They are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Clinical disease, including paralysis, caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is indistinguishable from that caused by wild polioviruses. This is believed to be a rare event, but outbreaks of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), caused by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), have been reported, and tend to occur in areas of low coverage by OPV, presumably because the OPV is itself protective against the related outbreak strain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> (OPV) is an {{attenuated}} vaccine, {{produced by}} {{the passage of the}} virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E
5|$|The inactivated <b>polio</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{are very}} safe.

5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest. Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility. The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{is highly}} {{effective}} and inexpensive (about US$0.10 per dose, or US$0.30 per child) and its availability has bolstered efforts to eradicate polio.

5000|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccines</b> were {{developed}} in the late 1950s by several groups, including those led by Albert Sabin, Hilary Koprowski and H. R. Cox.

The name of the vaccine strain was [...] "CHAT" [...] after [...] "Charlton", {{the name of the}} child who was the donor of the precursor virus. The Sabin, Koprowski and Cox vaccines were clinically tested in millions of individuals and found to be safe and effective.

25|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many industrialized countries. Czechoslovakia became the first country in the world to scientifically demonstrate nationwide eradication of poliomyelitis in 1960. In 1962—just one year after Sabin's <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> (OPV) was licensed in most industrialized countries—Cuba began using the oral vaccine in a series of nationwide polio campaigns. The early success of these mass vaccination campaigns suggested that polioviruses could be globally eradicated.

40|$|Abstract Background Timely {{vaccination}} {{is important}} to induce adequate protective immunity. We measured vaccination timeliness and vaccination coverage in three geographical areas in South Africa. Methods This study used vaccination information from a community-based cluster-randomized trial promoting exclusive breastfeeding in three South African sites (Paarl in the Western Cape Province, and Umlazi and Rietvlei in KwaZulu-Natal) between 2006 and 2008. Five interview visits were carried out between birth and up to 2 years of age (median follow-up time 18 months), and 1137 children {{were included in the}} analysis. We used Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis to describe vaccination coverage and timeliness in line with the Expanded Program on Immunization for the first eight vaccines. This included Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), four <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccines</b> and 3 doses of the pentavalent vaccine which protects against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B. Results The proportion receiving all these eight recommended vaccines were 94 % in Paarl (95 % confidence interval [CI] 91 - 96), 62 % in Rietvlei (95 %CI 54 - 68) and 88 % in Umlazi (95 %CI 84 - 91). Slightly fewer children received all vaccines within the recommended time periods. The situation was worst for the last pentavalent- and <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The hazard ratio for incomplete vaccination was 7. 2 (95 %CI 4. 7 - 11) for Rietvlei compared to Paarl. Conclusions There were large differences between the different South African sites in terms of vaccination coverage and timeliness, with the poorer areas of Rietvlei performing worse than the better-off areas in Paarl. The vaccination coverage was lower for the vaccines given at an older age. There is a need for continued efforts to improve vaccination coverage and timeliness, in particular in rural areas.

25|$|Herd {{immunity}} is {{an important}} supplement to vaccination. Among those individuals who receive <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine,</b> only 95 percent will develop immunity. That means five of every 100 given the vaccine will not develop any immunity and will be susceptible to developing polio. According to the concepts of herd immunity this population whom the vaccine fails, are still protected by the immunity of those around them. Herd immunity can only be achieved when vaccination levels are high. It is estimated that 80–86 percent of individuals in a population must be immune to polio for the susceptible individuals to be protected by herd immunity. If routine immunization were stopped, the number of unvaccinated, susceptible individuals would soon exceed the capability of herd immunity to protect them.|$|E
25|$|Two {{additional}} {{challenges are}} found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus. First, most polio infections are asymptomatic or result in minor symptoms, with less than 1% of infections leading to paralysis and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen. And since 2000, {{there have been a}} number of outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, following mutations or recombinations in the attenuated strain used for the <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine,</b> which have raised the necessity of eventually switching to the more expensive inactivated polio vaccine. The risk of vaccine-derived polio will persist long after the switch to inactivated vaccine, since a small number of chronic excretors continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral vaccine.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 {{there were}} 1,315 cases of {{poliomyelitis}} reported worldwide. Over 60% of cases (874) occurred in India; while in Nigeria, {{the number of}} polio cases fell dramatically, from 1,122 cases reported in 2006 to 285 cases in 2007. Officials credit the drop in new infections to improved political control in the southern states and resumed immunisation in the north, where Muslim clerics led a boycott of vaccination in late 2003. Local governments and clerics allowed vaccinations to resume {{on the condition that}} the vaccines be manufactured in Indonesia, a majority Muslim country, and not in the United States. Turai Yar'Adua, wife of recently elected Nigerian president Umaru Yar'Adua, made the eradication of polio one of her priorities. Attending the launch of immunization campaigns in Birnin Kebbi in July 2007, Turai Yar'Adua urged parents to vaccinate their children and stressed the safety of <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E
40|$|The simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) {{of the common}} chimpanzee is widely acknowledged as the direct ancestor of HIV- 1. There is increasing historical evidence that during the late 1950 s, kidneys were routinely excised from central African chimpanzees by scientists who were collaborating with the <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> research of Dr Hilary Koprowski, and sent - inter alia - to vaccine-making laboratories in the USA and Africa, and to unspecified destinations in Belgium. While {{there is no direct}} evidence that cells from these kidneys were used as a substrate for growing Dr Koprowski's <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccines,</b> there is a startling coincidence between places in Africa where his CHAT vaccine was fed, and the first appearances in the world of HIV- 1 group M and group-M-related AIDS. Because of the enormous implications of the hypothesis that AIDS may be an unintended iatrogenic (physician-caused) disease, it is almost inevitable that this theory will engender heated opposition from many of those in the scientific establishment, and those with vested interests...|$|R

40|$|Complete genomic {{sequences}} of a non-redundant set of 70 recombinants between three serotypes of attenuated Sabin polioviruses {{as well as}} location (based on partial sequencing) of crossover sites of 28 additional recombinants were determined and compared with the previously published data. It is demonstrated that the genomes of Sabin viruses contain distinct strain-specific segments that are eliminated by recombination. The presumed low fitness of these segments could be linked to mutations acquired upon derivation of the vaccine strains and/or may have been present in wild-type parents of Sabin viruses. These “weak” segments contribute to the propensity of these viruses to recombine {{with each other and}} with other enteroviruses as well as determine the choice of crossover sites. The knowledge of location of such segments opens additional possibilities for the design of more genetically stable and/or more attenuated variants, i. e., candidates for new <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The results also suggest that the genome of wild polioviruses, and, by generalization, of other RNA viruses, may harbor hidden low-fitness segments that can be readily eliminated only by recombination...|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} {{first decade of}} the 21st century, {{conservative}} religious leaders in northern Nigeria, suspicious of Western medicine, advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The boycott was endorsed by the governor of Kano State, and immunization was suspended for several months. Subsequently, polio reappeared in a dozen formerly polio-free neighbors of Nigeria, and genetic tests showed the virus was the same one that originated in northern Nigeria. Nigeria had become a net exporter of the polio virus to its African neighbors. People in the northern states were also reported to be wary of other vaccinations, and Nigeria reported over 20,000 measles cases and nearly 600 deaths from measles from January through March 2005. In 2006, Nigeria accounted for over half of all new polio cases worldwide. Outbreaks continued thereafter; for example, at least 200 children died in a late-2007 measles outbreak in Borno State.|$|E
500|$|A {{concern is}} the {{presence}} of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses. The <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> is not perfect: while the genetic characteristics are carefully balanced to maximize efficacy and minimize virulence, it is possible for the polio virus in the oral vaccine to mutate. [...] As a result, persons given the <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> can acquire acute or chronic infections; or can transmit (circulate) mutated virus to other people. It is likely that circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases will exceed wild-type cases in the near future, making it desirable to discontinue use of the <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> as soon as safely possible.|$|E
500|$|Specific {{strains of}} each {{serotype}} {{are used to}} prepare vaccines against polio. Inactive polio vaccine [...] is prepared by formalin inactivation of three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney or Brunenders (PV1), MEF-1/Lansing (PV2), and Saukett/Leon (PV3). <b>Oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccine</b> [...] contains live attenuated (weakened) strains of the three serotypes of poliovirus. Passaging the virus strains in monkey kidney epithelial cells introduces mutations in the viral IRES, and hinders (or attenuates) {{the ability of the}} virus to infect nervous tissue.|$|E

40|$|Background: Supplementary {{immunization}} activity (SIA) campaigns provide {{children with}} an additional dose of measles vaccine and deliver other interventions, including vitamin A supplements, deworming medications, and <b>oral</b> <b>polio</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the full SIA delivery platform in South Africa (SA). Design: We used an epidemiologic cost model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the 2010 SIA campaign. We used province-level campaign data sourced from the District Health Information System, SA, and from planning records of provincial coordinators of the Expanded Programme on Immunization. The data included {{the number of children}} immunized with measles and <b>polio</b> <b>vaccines,</b> the number of children given vitamin A supplements and Albendazole tablets, and costs. Results: The campaign cost $ 37 million and averted a total of 1, 150 deaths (95 % uncertainty range: 990 - 1, 360) - This ranged from 380 deaths averted in KwaZulu-Natal to 20 deaths averted in the Northern Cape. Vitamin A supplementation alone averted 820 deaths (95 % UR: 670 - 1, 040); measles vaccination alone averted 330 deaths (95 % UR: 280 - 370) - Incremental cost-effectiveness was $ 27, 100 (95 % UR: $ 18, 500 - 34, 400) per death averted nationally, ranging from $ 11, 300 per death averted in the Free State to $ 91, 300 per death averted in the Eastern Cape. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness of the SIA child health delivery platform varies substantially across SA provinces, and it is substantially more cost-effective when vitamin A supplementation is included in the interventions administered. Cost-effectiveness assessments should consider health system delivery platforms that integrate multiple interventions, and they should be conducted at the sub-national level...|$|R
