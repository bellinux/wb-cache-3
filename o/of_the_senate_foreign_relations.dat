During October 1969, Senator Stuart Symington (D-MO) chaired hearings of the Subcommittee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee on Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad. The testimony of subpoenaed witnesses revealed the history of U.S. involvement in the covert commitment to Laos. Due to the closed nature of the sessions and its heavily censored transcript, however, {{the nature and extent}} of that commitment was still very little understood by the American public.|$|E

25|$|Cramer said {{achieving}} a Republican-majority Senate {{could result in}} the removal of controversial Democratic Senator J.

25|$|In 1870 he was {{a member}} of the {{commission}} sent by President Grant to inquire into the practicability of the annexation of Santo Domingo. President Grant wished to annex the island. He was opposed in this effort by Sen.Charles Sumner, a longtime friend and ally of Howe's. In the end, the committee sided with Sumner in opposition to the proposed annexation. Grant was so enraged at having his plans thwarted that he arranged to have Sumner removed from his chairmanship as head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiative}} {{was named after}} United States Secretary of State George Marshall, {{who served as the}} United States Army Chief of Staff during WWII. The plan had bipartisan support in Washington, where the Republicans controlled Congress and the Democrats controlled the White House with Harry S. Truman as president. The Plan was largely the creation of State Department officials, especially William L. Clayton and George F. Kennan, with help from the Brookings Institution, as requested by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee. Marshall spoke of an urgent need to help the European recovery in his address at Harvard University in June 1947. The purpose of the Marshall Plan was to aid in the economic recovery of nations after WWII and to reduce the influence of communist parties within them. In order to combat the effects of the Marshall Plan, the USSR developed its own economic plan, known as the Molotov Plan. It was not as effective as the Marshall Plan, and in some ways contradictory to Eastern Bloc countries that served alongside the Axis powers in WWII.|$|E

25|$|President Grant was livid at the treaty's {{failure to}} pass the Senate and blamed Sen. Sumner's {{opposition}} for the defeat; Grant having believed Sumner had originally agreed to support the treaty at their January 2, 1870 meeting. Grant then retaliated by firing U.S. Ambassador to Britain, John Lothrop Motley, Sen. Sumner's close friend. Then in March 1871, President Grant having influence in the Senate got his allied Senators to remove Sumner as Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee. President Grant {{was able to get}} Congress to allow an investigation Commission to be sent and make an objective assessment as to whether annexation would be beneficial to both the United States and the Dominican Republic. The Commission, sent in 1871, included civil rights activist Frederick Douglass and reported favorably on the annexation of the Dominican Republic to the United States. The Commission, however, failed to generate enough enthusiasm in the Senate to overcome opposition to Dominican Republic annexation. The whole affair never took into account the wishes of the Dominican people who desired to remain independent.|$|E
25|$|Sumner, {{opposed to}} American imperialism in the Caribbean and fearful that {{annexation}} {{would lead to}} the conquest of the neighboring black republic of Haiti, became convinced that corruption lay behind the treaty, and that men close to the president shared in the corruption. As chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee, Sumner initially withheld his opinion on the treaty on January 18, 1870. Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State, Bancroft Davis, that U.S. Naval ships were being used to protect Báez. Sumner's committee voted against annexation and at Sumner's suggestion and quite possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or the president from embarrassment, the Senate held its debate of the treaty behind closed doors in executive session. Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14, 1870, and May 31, 1870. In closed session, Sumner spoke out against the treaty; warning that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals, noting the chronic rebellion that took place on the island, and the risk that the independence of Haiti, recognized by the United States in 1862, would be lost. Sumner stated that Grant's use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of International law and unconstitutional. Finally, on June 30, 1870 the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the required 2/3 majority for treaty passage.|$|E

500|$|In {{a private}} conference with President Grant, Fish agreed {{to support the}} Santo Domingo {{annexation}} if President Grant sent Congress a non-belligerency statement not {{to get involved with}} the Cuban rebellion against Spain. Charles Sumner, chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee, was against the treaty, believing that Santo Domingo needed to remain independent, and that racism against U.S. black citizens in the South needed to be dealt with in the continental United States. Sumner believed that blacks on Santo Domingo did not share Anglo-American values. [...] On January 10, 1870 Grant submitted the Santo Domingo treaty to the United States Senate. Fish believed Senators would vote for annexation only if statehood was withdrawn; however, President Grant refused this option. [...] The Senate took its time deliberating, and finally rejected the treaty on June 30, 1870. [...] Eighteen Senators led by Charles Sumner defeated the treaty. Pres. Grant, angered at Sumner's refusal to support the treaty, fired Sumner's friend J. Lothrop Motley, Grant's ambassador to England, for disregarding Fish's instructions regarding the Alabama Claims. Grant believed that Sumner had in January 1870 stated his support for the Santo Domingo treaty. Sumner was then deprived of his chairmanship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee in 1871 by Grant's allies in the Senate.|$|E

500|$|In foreign policy, Lincoln's {{main goal}} was to stop {{military}} aid from countries abroad to the Confederacy. Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. At times Seward was too bellicose, so for balance Lincoln stuck a close working relationship with Senator Charles Sumner, the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee. The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the Trent, {{on the high seas}} and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer James G. Randall has dissected Lincoln's successful techniques: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the year}} between his {{swearing-in}} and the 1898 Spanish–American War, Foraker was an enthusiastic supporter of Cuban independence from Spain.

[...] Foraker was impatient with McKinley's policy towards Spain, decrying the President's State of the Union communication to Congress in December 1897 and his so-called [...] "war message", which some deemed insufficiently bellicose, in April 1898.

500|$|The small Republican {{majority}} in the Senate made Irreconcilable votes necessary to Lodge's strategy, and he met with Borah in April 1919, persuading him {{to go along with}} the plan of delay and reservations as the most likely to succeed, as it would allow the initial popular support for Wilson's proposal to diminish. Neither senator really liked or trusted the other, but they formed a wary pact to defeat the treaty. Lodge was also chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee and he delayed the treaty by convening a lengthy series of hearings, presiding over a committee packed with Irreconcilables, including Borah. As these hearings continued in the summer of 1919, Wilson undertook a speaking tour by train to get the public to press the Senate for ratification, a tour that ended in his collapse.

500|$|Owen's later {{views on}} {{international}} affairs did not escape controversy. [...] Though initially a firm {{supporter of the}} Treaty of Versailles, including its assertion of German responsibility for the outbreak of [...] World War I, during 1923 his views changed radically {{under the influence of}} [...] "revisionist" [...] studies, including the publication of extensive (though incomplete) materials from the diplomatic archives of the pre-War Tsarist Russian Foreign Office. [...] He made a major speech in the Senate on 18 December 1923 attributing primary responsibility for the war to France and (especially) Russia rather than Germany. [...] Owen hoped that a public revisiting of the issue of war guilt might encourage reversal of some of the penal clauses imposed on Germany under the Versailles settlement, and pave the way to reconciliation between Germany and France, but his attempts to promote a Senate investigation of the war guilt question were narrowly defeated, largely along party lines — with many of his fellow Democrats concerned not to undermine the reputation of Woodrow Wilson — while an expert report prepared by the Legislative Research Service of the Library of Congress, though broadly supportive of Owen's arguments, was in the event never published as it was considered unlikely to obtain the support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee. [...] In 1926, following his retirement from the Senate, Owen was to publish a book advancing his revisionist thesis, under the title: The Russian Imperial Conspiracy, 1892-1914: The Most Gigantic Intrigue of all Time.|$|E
