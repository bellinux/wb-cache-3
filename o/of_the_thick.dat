5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box {{in the corner of}} the room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E

5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred {{over the course of}} billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the plants depicted in the stele fragment are either poppies or pomegranate flowers, however, classical archaeologists and historians of ancient Greek art discuss different species in the literature: German scholar Ernst Langlotz (1895–1978) thought that the women were holding a type of rose; Picard recognizes the symbolism of Demeter and Kore and identifies the flowers as a species of poppy, possibly the opium poppy, the Oriental poppy, or the Iranian poppy. Careful examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> 'stems' fails to resemble that of the flowers. German scholar Eugen Petersen (1837–1919) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones (talus bones from goats or sheep used {{to play the game}} of jacks) in their left hand and roses in the right hand; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones, not flowers.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} insoforms of NKCC2 created by {{alternative}} splicing (NKCC2A, B and F). Each {{one of these}} insoforms is expressed at different portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> ascending limb and they have different affinity for sodium that correlates with its localization. The insoform F is more predominant in the deeper portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> ascending limb, where the sodium concentration is very high. NKCC2F is the isoform with the lowest affinity for sodium and this allows the cotransporter to work at this sodium rich environment. Conversely, NKCC2B is expressed at the more superficial portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> ascending limb and the macula densa, {{and it has the}} highest affinity for sodium. This permits NKCC2B to function in this sodium-depleted environment without saturating. The NKCC2A isoform shows an intermediate distribution and affinity for sodium. In this way, NKCC2 is able to function properly along the range of sodium concentrations found along the thick ascending limb.|$|E

25|$|NKCC2 is {{specifically}} found in cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> ascending limb {{of the loop}} of Henle and the macula densa in nephrons, the basic functional units of the kidney. Within these cells, NKCC2 resides in the apical membrane abutting the nephron's lumen, which is the hollow space containing urine. It thus serves both in sodium absorption and in tubuloglomerular feedback.|$|E

As a Red Button extra, each episode had an accompanying 10-minute documentary titled Out <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thick</b> of It broadcast immediately afterwards {{and on the}} BBC Comedy website, which featured cut scenes, specially written scenes and, later, discussion of the programme by the series' writers, makers and with figures involved in British politics.|$|E
25|$|A {{pilot for}} an American version <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thick</b> of It was {{produced}} {{as a candidate}} for the 2007–08 season on ABC. The ABC pilot, also titled The Thick of It, was developed for American audiences by writers Mitch Hurwitz and Richard Day and followed a low-level member of the United States Congress and his staff. Iannucci had a production credit on the show, but he was not otherwise involved. The pilot was produced by Sony Pictures Television and BBC Worldwide and directed by Christopher Guest.|$|E

25|$|On 30 January, Sir Hugh Rose led a {{detachment}} of the 2nd Brigade, including the 3rd Bombay Europeans {{in pursuit of}} their enemy who were routed at the River Beena by the 3rd Bombay Europeans. The 3rd Bombay Europeans charged and drove the enemy out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> jungle. This was quickly followed by the 3rd Bombay Europeans occupying the fort at Barodia. In his report back to England, Sir Hugh Rose singled out the 3rd Bombay Europeans and their C.O. Lt. Col. Liddell for praise. 5 men of the 3rd Europeans were injured in the engagement.|$|E
25|$|The thick {{ascending}} limb of {{the loop}} of Henle begins at the deeper portion of the renal outer medulla. Here, the urine has a relatively high concentration of sodium. As urine moves towards the more superficial portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> ascending limb, NKCC2 is the major transport protein by which sodium is reabsorbed from the urine. This outward movement of sodium {{and the lack of}} water permeability in the thick ascending limb, creates a more diluted urine. According to the stoichiometry outlined above, each molecule of sodium reabsorbed brings one molecule of potassium and two molecules of chloride. Sodium goes on to be reabsorbed into the blood, where it contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|By about 4 p.m., {{all three}} Ottoman ships {{of the line}} and most of the large frigates of the first line had been despatched. This left the mass of smaller vessels {{in the second and third}} lines at the mercy of the Allied ships of the line, all of which were still operational. During the ensuing massacre, Codrington tried twice to order a ceasefire, but his signals were either {{invisible}} because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> smoke or ignored in the heat of the battle. Within the following two hours, virtually the entire Ottoman fleet was destroyed, despite the signal bravery of the Ottoman crews, which was praised by Codrington himself in his dispatches. Three quarters were sunk: many of them, dismasted but still afloat and reparable, were blown up or set on fire by their own crews to prevent them falling into Allied hands.|$|E

25|$|The name Clayoquot (pronounced “Clah-quot”) is an anglicized {{version of}} Tla-o-qui-aht, the largest {{nation in the}} Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) First Nations, whose people have resided in the Clayoquot Sound region near Tofino and Ucluelet {{for at least the}} last 2000 years. The Clayoquot Slope site lies about 1250 m below sea level and {{approximately}} 20km landward of the toe of the Cascadia subduction zone. The Cascadia subduction zone is the area at which the Juan de Fuca plate is subducting (descending) beneath the North American plate. This is a zone where much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> layer of sediments deposited on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge are scraped off and accreted as the tectonic plates converge (move together). As sediments thicken and compact from accretion, pore waters are expelled from the sediment, and gases — primarily biogenic methane — contribute to the formation of gas hydrates in the upper few hundred metres of the sediment. At this site, a cold vent, known as Bullseye Vent, has formed along with significant concentrations of gas hydrates.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the case}} {{is the single most}} {{expensive}} part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of wear and tear on the barrel. Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the resizing operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away {{from the rear of the}} case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.|$|E
500|$|Consequently, {{the ratio}} of the lengths of long sides to short sides in the (isosceles) Robinson triangles is :1. It follows that {{the ratio of}} long side lengths to short in both kite and dart tiles is also :1, as are the length ratios of sides to the short {{diagonal}} in the thin rhomb t, and of long diagonal to sides in the thick rhomb T. In both the P2 and P3 tilings, {{the ratio of the}} area of the larger Robinson triangle to the smaller one is :1, hence so are the ratios of the areas of the kite to the dart, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> rhomb to the thin rhomb. (Both larger and smaller obtuse Robinson triangles {{can be found in the}} pentagon on the left: the larger triangles at the top [...] the halves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> rhomb [...] have linear dimensions scaled up by [...] compared to the small shaded triangle at the base, and so the ratio of areas is 2:1.) ...|$|E
