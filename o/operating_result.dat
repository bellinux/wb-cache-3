5000|$|Since its {{transformation}} to a {{joint stock}} company in August 1992, ČSA has never paid dividends. The sale of a minority share to Air France was a fiasco leading to withdrawal of the French airline. Subsequently, Antonín Jakubše and Miroslav Kůla stabilised the company and enlarged its fleet. In September 2003, Miroslav Kůla was fired. New CEO, ex-minister Jaroslav Tvrdík, agreed with the unions to increase wages by a third and announced [...] "unprecedented" [...] enlargement of the fleet. In 2005, the financial situation sharply deteriorated. Although the sale of two ATR planes improved the <b>operating</b> <b>result</b> by CZK 198 million, the operating loss was almost half a billion Czech crowns and the Government of Jiří Paroubek replaced Jaroslav Tvrdík with Radomír Lašák. The airline generated further operating losses, despite revenue of CZK 2.1 bn {{from the sale of}} almost all real estate and CZK 1.2 bn from sales of planes. In 2005-2010, ČSA generated an operating loss of CZK 3.4 bn; without long-term asset sales revenues, the operating loss would have been twice as large. The gross margin did not even cover the personnel expenses.|$|E

40|$|It {{is always}} a problem to choose one or more {{indicators}} or to construct a model that reflects the achieved <b>operating</b> <b>result.</b> Companies {{all over the world}} have developed numerous models assessing excellence from various aspects in order to estimate the achieved <b>operating</b> <b>result</b> or overall business excellence.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explains the current process involved in establishing stabilized {{rates for the}} Naval Aviation Depot (NADEP) Cherry Point, North Carolina. Existing data were examined to aid in understanding the process for determining stabilized rates, workload standards, and workload allocation. Additionally, this research provides {{an analysis of the}} inputs to the rate setting process to determine which has the most influence on the financial <b>operating</b> <b>result.</b> A general history of working capital funds is provided and an explanation of the financial and management goals of the Navy Working Capital Fund are spelled out. An assessment of existing methods was based on variance analysis between projected results and actual results. The variance analysis suggests that the current methods used for determining workload standards consistently underestimate the number of hours required to complete the work. Finally a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which input variable has the most influence on the net <b>operating</b> <b>result.</b> The sensitivity analysis suggests that changes to workload norms have the most influence on the bottom line at the NADEP.
