40|$|We have {{completed}} a preliminary study using filter media tests and filter qualification tests {{to investigate the}} effect of shelf-life on HEPA filter performance. Our media studies showed that the tensile strength decreased with age, but the data were not sufficient to establish a shelf-life. Thermogravimetric analyses demonstrated that one manufacturer had media with low tensile strength due to insufficient binder. The filter qualification tests (heated air and overpressure) conducted on different aged filters showed that filter age is not the primary factor affecting filter performance; materials and the construction design have a greater effect. An unexpected finding of our study was that sub-standard HEPA filters have been installed in DOE facilities despite existing regulations and filter qualification tests. We found that the filter with low tensile strength failed the <b>overpressure</b> <b>test.</b> The same filter had passed the heated air test, but left the filter so structurally weak, it was prone to blow-out. We recommend that DOE initiate a filter qualification program to prevent this occurrence...|$|E

40|$|Liquid {{and solid}} rocket motor {{propulsion}} systems create an overpressure wave during ignition, {{caused by the}} accelerating gas particles pushing against or displacing the air contained in the launch pad or launch facility and by the afterburning of the fuel-rich gases. This wave behaves as a blast or shock wave characterized by a positive triangular-shaped first pulse and a negative half-sine wave second pulse. The pulse travels up the space vehicle and {{has the potential of}} either overloading individual elements or exciting overall vehicle dynamics. The latter effect results from the phasing difference of the wave {{from one side of the}} vehicle to the other. This overpressure phasing, or delta P environment, because of its frequency content as well as amplitude, becomes a design driver for certain panels (e. g., thermal shields) and payloads for the Space Shuttle. The history of overpressure effects on the Space Shuttle, the basic overpressure phenomenon, Space Shuttle overpressure environment, scale model <b>overpressure</b> <b>testing,</b> and techniques for suppressing the overpressure environments are considered...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the literature on design stresses in silos revealed that limiting stress analysis is traditionally used in the design of silos for static lateral stresses, and that overpressures due to the unloading process are allowed for by empirical overpressure factors. It is hypothesized that dilation (volume increase due to shear strain) of the stored material may be a rational explanation for <b>overpressures.</b> <b>Tests</b> in a specially constructed triaxial apparatus indicate that maize, wheat and barley dilate during standard triaxial shear tests, whereas oats, which has higher void ratios, does not. The tests also show that the Mohr failure envelopes are not linear, as normally assumed, but are concave downwards. General expressions for the compression loading tangent modulus and the Mohr failure envelope are developed, and the parameters for the four grains, each at three bulk densities, evaluated. For the maize, wheat and barley, the highest friction angles and initial tangent moduli and the lowest failure strains occur at the intermediate bulk densities. Standard and constant volume tests indicate that stress-strain characteristics are more dependent upon grain packing and stress history, whereas frictional behavior is more dependent upon the geometry and surface roughness of the individual grains...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{explosive}} blasts {{can produce}} functional debilitation {{in the absence}} of brain pathology detectable at the scale of current diagnostic imaging. Transient (ms) overpressure components of the primary blast wave are considered to be potentially damaging to the brain. Astrocytes participate in neuronal metabolic maintenance, blood-brain barrier, regulation of homeostatic environment, and tissue remodeling. Damage to astrocytes via direct physical forces has the potential to disrupt local and global functioning of neuronal tissue. Using an ex vivo brain slice model, we tested the hypothesis that viable astrocytes within the slice could be injured simply by transit of a single blast wave consisting of overpressure alone. A polymer split Hopkinson pressure bar (PSHPB) system was adapted to impart a single positive pressure transient with a comparable magnitude to those that might be present inside the head. A custom built test chamber housing the brain tissue slice incorporated revised design elements to reduce fluid space and promote transit of a uniform planar waveform. Confocal microscopy, stereology, and morphometry of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity revealed that two distinct astrocyte injury profiles were identified across a 4 hr post-test survival interval: (a) presumed conventional astrogliosis characterized by enhanced GFAP immunofluorescence intensity without significant change in tissue area fraction and (b) a process comparable to clasmatodendrosis, an autophagic degradation of distal processes that has not been previously associated with blast induced neurotrauma. Analysis of astrocyte branching revealed early, sustained, and progressive differences distinct from the effects of slice incubation absent <b>overpressure</b> <b>testing.</b> Astrocyte vulnerability to overpressure transients indicates a potential for significant involvement in brain blast pathology and emergent dysfunction. The testing platform can isolate overpressure injury phenomena to provide novel insight on physical and biological mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to analyse the {{abnormal}} incidents on the drill pipe. The reason for this research is to apply the learned theories into the reality by building an automated rig and detect the problems. Also, to participate in Drillbotics competition 2016. Drillbotics 2016 is an international competition arranged by Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) that {{is a part of}} the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), to encourage students to build a small and fully automated rig to drill safety and efficiency a rock sample as vertically and fast as possible. Using literature backgrounds of circumstances combined with theories makes it easier to get an estimated overview of the failures that might occur while applying different drilling parameters. Moreover, which parameters used in term of drilling to drill more safety without failures. The analysis that performed based on the design such twisting, buckling, vibration and leakage, and <b>overpressure</b> <b>testing.</b> Optimising the rotational speed and weight on bit applied; reduces problems such twisting, buckling and vibrational movements. The choice of the rotational speed and the weight on bit is based on the type of drill pipe materials which is the weakest component of the drill string, with respect to the maximum yield and ultimate torque of the drill pipe material. The next step is to build the design and see if it is working properly with the chosen values. <b>Tests</b> like leakage, <b>overpressure,</b> and over-torque performed after calibrating the load cells to evaluate the reaction of the real-time controller, to be able to stop the rotation in case of: - Low circulation pressure, leakage - High circulation pressure, overpressure - Over-torque, sticking Later buckling tests by applying weight on the 2. 2 0 mm thick and 1 m long pipe, to determine the maximum weight that buckles the pipe. In the end, vibrations are observed after rotating at 180 rpm. The rig design is working fine and safe in term of torque, buckling and circulation system, but there are quite high vibrations that made it difficult to read the signal from the accelerometers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExperiments were {{conducted}} in 90 ̊ bend with C 3 H 8 /Air premixed gas to study the explosion suppression characteristics of aluminum silicate wool in different locations and lengths. The macrostructure of aluminum silicate wool was observed thanks to the scanning electron microscope (SEM for short) {{before and after the}} experiment. The suppression mechanism of aluminum silicate wool was analyzed according to both the experimental data and SEM. The results indicate that, explosion <b>overpressures</b> of <b>testing</b> points in the intrados of the bend are lower than those in the extrados positions, which decline firstly and then rise. The overpressure in the bend shows a trend of firstly decreasing and then increasing again with the increase of the distance between aluminum silicate wool and ignition source. The aluminum silicate wool is a kind of three-dimensional porous and skeleton structure with high elastic property and specific area seen from SEM. Moreover, the collapse of the space in the skeleton structure and the fracture of the fibers could absorb energy from explosion effectively and hence attenuate the explosion overpressure...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} overpressure {{throughout the}} Abadan Plain Basin and evaluates pore pressure in this basin using conventional petroleum industry methods, {{as well as}} two new proposed pore pressure prediction methods. Overpressures in the Abadan Plain Basin are primarily exist within carbonates, whereas most previously published overpressure analysis has been undertaken in shale-dominated clastic rocks. Overpressure in this basin is encountered in two main zones, primarily the Gachsaran and Gadvan/Fahliyan formations. South-west to north-east oriented thickening and shortening, as result of Arabia-Eurasia collision, has affected the pressure regime within the Gachsaran Formation, but seemed ineffectual to the Gadvan and Fahliyan overpressures. In order to analyse <b>overpressure</b> origins and <b>test</b> conventional pore pressure prediction methods, a discrimination scheme was applied to remove the impact of lithology on the log recordings, resulting in isolating the minor shale interbeds within, and as a representative of, the carbonate sequences. Disequilibrium compaction was identified as the primary origin of overpressure in the Abadan Plain Basin. Eaton’s (1972) pore pressure prediction method was applied on the filtered shale data with an exponent of 1. 0 for sonic velocity, 0. 1 for resistivity, and 5 for density data. Bowers’ (1995) method was also tested and, while it accurately predicted pore pressure in the Gadvan and Fahliyan formations, it underestimates pore pressure in shallower formations. This thesis also introduces a new ‘compressibility method’ for pore pressure prediction, developed by the author, that uses porosity-compressibility correlations. This new ‘compressibility method’ provided reliable pore pressure prediction results in the studied wells. Alternatively, overpressure as a result of sediment compaction is also estimated using Biot’s (1941) general theory of three-dimensional consolidation. A generalised compaction model was constructed, and the resulting modelled pore pressure provides a reasonable estimate of observed pore pressure. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{authors have}} done a series of {{measurements}} with mixtures of Argon, CF 4 and CH 4 {{to demonstrate that the}} mixture chosen for RunII (84 % Argon, 8 % CH 4, 8 % CF 4) is not flammable. The tests were conducted in the Meson Detector Building in a test cell similar in construction to a cell of a Muon PDT. In order to establish the viability of the test set-up, they first repeated the demonstration that P- 10 gas (90 % Argon, 10 % CH 4) is in fact flammable, contrary to the classification by the US DOT. US DOT regulation 173. 115 defines flammable gas as: (1) is ignitable (at 14. 7 psi) when in a mixture of 13 % or less with air; or (2) has a flammability range (at 14. 7 psi) with air of at least 12 % regardless of the lower explosive limit (LEL). P- 10 has a LEL of about 40 % and a flammability range of about 10 %, so P- 10 is not flammable according to the US DOT definition. The point here is that the DOT classifications are to serve the DOT's function to ensure transportation safety, and are not necessarily appropriate for other situations. The first configuration of their test cell, however, apparently failed to ignite P- 10. With the guidance of Bill Nuttall of CERN, they modified their test cell to make it more like the standard flammability testing setups, with a large viewing window and a spark gap {{in the middle of the}} cell. In this second configuration P- 10 was easily and reliably ignitable. After becoming more familiar with the visible indicators of combustion of P- 10 (water vapor cloud formation, pressure changes and gas venting) they retested with the initial configuration, and found that the mixture actually had been burning, and that they had just missed all the indications. The data from CERN showed that P- 10 burns rather slowly, with about a one second rise time for the pressure to reach the maximum of four atmospheres <b>overpressure.</b> In the <b>tests</b> they saw no signs of any flame, but only a water vapor cloud. Some preliminary tests with the same cell using Argon-Ethane and air had a much more impressive burn, with rapid venting and a red flash clearly visible...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) in American soldiers exposed to a blast wave has created an urgent need {{to better understand the}} effects of blast wave insult to the head. Developing techniques that can experimentally simulate well controlled blast waves in a laboratory environment is a critical component of the research efforts towards this goal. For this work, a 4 -in. cylindrical uniform shock tube and a nonuniform shock tube combining a 4 -in. cylindrical gas driver with a 9 -in. square driven section have been developed. The hosting laboratory, gas handling system, multichannel data acquisition systems, and the related network and software for computerized remote operation were also developed. These shock tubes were designed for generating shock waves with the overpressure and underpressure profiles mimicking those of the Friedlander wave. This wave form is a commonly used representation of the typical blast wave-form in an open-field. Tests have been performed to validate the designs and to characterize the shock waves generated by the two devices. The results of experiments with the 4 -in. shock tube show that shock waves with sub-microsecond rise times can be reliably generated with the membrane burst mechanism used. Various thicknesses of Dura-Lar® (biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate) were examined as a membrane material, the burst pressure was found to depend linearly on the number of sheets used. It was also found that the shock front propagation speed and amplitude agree with the one-dimensional shock wave theory for ideal gas even at the tube wall indicating a planar wave front in the shock tube. Hence, the device can be used to accurately calibrate pressure sensors mounted through the wall. The 9 -in. square shock tube is a novel set-up. It enables the use of flat windows, which are necessary for digital imaging, optical measurements and provides sufficient space and versatile sample mounting for in-tube blast testing not feasible with the cylindrical design. It also employs a unique adjustable reflector near the tube exit to achieve underpressure profile control, which is critical for blast testing of animal models. Systematic testing has been performed for this device. Although the transitional flow between the driver and the driven section is multi-dimensional, the test results show that an essentially planar shock wave is formed before entering the test section. The peak overpressure and wave profile were found to vary with location. The correlation between the membrane burst pressure and the peak <b>overpressure</b> in the <b>test</b> section was determined experimentally. These experiments have demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the Friedlander type of blast wave can be generated in such a shock tube with a right combination of driver gas, driver length, burst pressure, and reflector position. The setup can thus be a powerful tool for TBI-related studies...|$|R
