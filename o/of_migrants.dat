40|$|This article {{contributes}} {{to an understanding}} of how different institutional contexts produce similar outcomes as regards the employment <b>of</b> <b>migrant</b> workers in care work. It examines how the employment <b>of</b> <b>migrant</b> care workers in both the familial provision of care and the formal provision of care services for older people is shaped, first, by the marketisation of care and, second, by immigration controls. The analysis draws on data on the employment <b>of</b> <b>migrant</b> care workers by families in Italy and by providers of residential and home care services in the UK. It is argued that marketisation processes and immigration controls have contributed to the employment <b>of</b> <b>migrant</b> workers across so-called informal/formal types of care provision, and irregular/regular types of care work and migration. While the institutional contexts in which migrant care labour is located may differ, converging outcomes are evident regarding the structural positioning <b>of</b> <b>migrant</b> workers within the provision of care for older people...|$|R

This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this {{can be attributed to}} an influx <b>of</b> <b>migrants</b> or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent.
