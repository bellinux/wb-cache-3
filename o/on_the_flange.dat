40|$|AbstractThere {{is a lot}} {{of local}} {{corrosion}} damage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>flanges</b> under rail sleepers in the plate girder railway bridges. Since the sleepers are put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>flanges</b> directly, <b>the</b> corrosion at the boundary progresses faster and causes a lack of <b>the</b> <b>flange</b> thickness through erosion, wet conditions among others due to contact of sleepers. Consequently, the strength of the plate girder decreases. Since the local corrosion often occurs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>flange</b> under <b>the</b> sleepers, evaluation of the remaining strength of the plate girder with such corrosion damage is a very important problem for the maintenance. This paper presents an evaluation method for the remaining strength of a plate girder with local corrosion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>flange</b> under sleepers, in which the remaining strength can be derived easily based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> buckling stress of <b>the</b> upper <b>flange</b> with lack of thickness due to corrosion. The ultimate behavior of the plate girder with corrosion is analyzed using the non-linear finite element method, and also some loading tests are conducted. In order to discuss the applicability of the evaluation formula, a comparison of the remaining strengths with the experimental and FEM results is made and it is concluded that the remaining strength can be accurately evaluated by the presented method...|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{the depth}} of the girder is no less than 1/15 the span, and for a given load bearing capacity, a depth of around 1/12 the span {{minimizes}} the weight of <b>the</b> girder. Stresses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flanges</b> near <b>the</b> centre of the span are greater than {{near the end of the}} span, so the top and bottom flange plates are frequently reinforced in the middle portion of the span.

These are typically uniformly spaced along the girder with additional stiffeners over the supports and wherever the bridge supports concentrated loads.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Wood I-joists {{is a kind}} of wood-based {{engineering}} material which was widely used in wood construction. As it is in fact, the property of I-joists are influenced not only by shear stress but also by a part of normal stress when they are taking into application. In this study, the effects of different factors were evaluated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tensile property of the wood I-joists. The factors include the depth of <b>the</b> tanks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flanges,</b> <b>the</b> amount of glue spread and adhesive type. The method of orthogonal test was used in the process of the experiment design, and tensile test were taken during the experiment at the aim of testing the property of the I-joists using a universal mechanical testing machine. Ultimately, it has been discovered that the factor of adhesive type is the most influential one in the three factors which had been listed. So this paper offers the optimal fabrication technology of the I-joists to make it is possible for the increase of reliability when wood I-joists are taken into application...|$|R

50|$|Uneven {{pressure}} {{can be caused}} by a variety of factors. First is the human factor: asymmetric application of the bolt preload, this can cause uneven pressure. Theoretically when the flanges are pressed, the sealing surfaces are absolutely parallel, in practice however, the centerline of a pipeline cannot be absolutely concentric, and tightening the bolts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flange</b> moment makes the flange a discontinuity. With asymmetric connections, the seal surfaces will be more or less deformed and the pressure reduced, the running load, prone to leakage. Third, the density of bolt arrangement has an obvious impact on the pressure distribution, the closer the bolts, the more uniform the pressure.|$|E

50|$|Tighten {{the bolts}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flange.</b> Due to vibration, {{temperature}} changes, {{and other factors}} such as spiral wound gasket stress relaxation, the bolt tension will gradually decrease, resulting in loss of torque, causing a leak. In general longer bolts and smaller diameters of bolt are better at preventing the loss of torque. A long thin bolt is {{an effective way to}} prevent torque loss. Heating for {{a certain period of time}} to stretch the bolt, and then maintaining a given torque, is very effective in preventing the loss of torque. When the gasket is thinner and smaller there will be a greater loss of torque. In addition, prevent strong vibration of the machine and the pipe itself, and isolate them from adjacent equipment vibration. Impacts on the sealing surface are not meaningless. Not impacting the tightened bolts can prevent the loss of torque.|$|E

5000|$|Upon {{its release}} {{the engine was}} noted {{as one of the}} best diesel engines (for cars and light vans) in the world with its high power output and {{refinement}} it made all other diesel engines seem agricultural. [...] It was also particularly light, with a ready-to-run XUD9 weighing 157 kg, 15% less than a comparable diesel of the previous generation. However, if the cooling system is neglected or improperly bled after filling - needing a raised filling level because the expansion tank is not the highest point in the system - the engine has a tendency to blow its head gasket. A simple solution is to use a plastic soft drink bottle with the bottom removed, fitted with a rubber O ring seal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flange</b> at the cap end for filling. Because radiators (typical life 100,000 miles), generally have only just sufficient cooling capacity when new, in order to help get the engine to operating temperature quickly, silting causes significant problems. Coolant changes to maintain corrosion inhibitors (and stop silting) are critical on this engine. Nonetheless due to the high volume of cars manufactured with this engine spare parts are plentiful and well priced.|$|E
5000|$|Wheels {{sometimes}} need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, {{and then}} the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed {{on the left side}} of the grinder from the operator's viewpoint, with wheel rotation [...] "toward" [...] the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas on the other side the nut is right-handed. [...] "In other words, to remove the nut, it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation." [...] Holding the wheel against the wrench's turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is on either side of the wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel flange from bearing directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flange.</b> The wheel's inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a bushing (sleeve) to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves gently tapping it with a fingernail or tool handle (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell's ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "hoarse" [...] sound (failing to [...] "sing") indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the ring test, the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel flanges, and nut are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, {{and then the}} grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.|$|E
