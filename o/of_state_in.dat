5|$|As Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>in</b> the Obama {{administration}} from 2009 to 2013, Clinton {{responded to the}} Arab Spring, during which she advocated the U.S. military intervention in Libya. She helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, {{in an effort to}} force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Leaving office after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.|$|E

He served as Speaker of the House from 1817 to 1819, and was appointed as Adair's Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>in</b> 1820. He moved to Frankfort, the state capital, so that he could attend to the duties of his office, but fell ill with a fever in August 1823 and died in office on September 1.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{was active}} in {{organizing}} the Whig Party from {{the remnants of the}} defunct National Republican Party in 1834. On July 4, 1834, he called to order the party's first organizational meeting in the state at Cove Spring, Kentucky. He was chosen as chair of the committee on resolutions and in a speech on July 5, bitterly condemned President Jackson. Later in 1834, Kentucky governor James T. Morehead appointed Crittenden Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State.</b> <b>In</b> the August elections, Whigs won a majority in both houses of the General Assembly. When the Assembly convened, they elected Crittenden to the U.S. Senate over Democrat James Guthrie by a vote of 94–40.|$|E

30|$|The {{second part}} of the {{analysis}} investigates the portion <b>of</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the assignment setting to the occurrence frequency. We observe differences between the number <b>of</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the assignment setting and the occurrence frequency. Moreover, we examine the differences for each number of violated constraints. In the low-frequency violated constraints, if the portion of occurrence frequency is higher than the number <b>of</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the assignment setting, then it expresses that learners arrange states that have low error rate. In addition, in the high-violated constraints, if the portion of occurrence frequency is lower than the number <b>of</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the assignment setting, then it shows that learners avoid solutions that potentially have high error rate. Hence, this analysis will support providing the answer to our first research question.|$|R

She was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as Secretary of Transportation in 1983, and was the Secretary of Labor during the tenure of George H. W. Bush—Reagan's successor. Czechoslovakia-born Madeleine Albright became the first foreign-born woman to serve in the Cabinet when she was appointed Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>in</b> 1997. Her appointment also made her the highest-ranking female Cabinet member at that time. Condoleezza Rice was appointed Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>in</b> 2005, and thus became the highest-ranking woman in the United States presidential line of succession in history.

In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number of 230873. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was awarded the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that these {{appointments}} were considered possible because the Irish Free State continued to recognise the British monarch as its official head <b>of</b> <b>state.</b> <b>In</b> 1937, however, the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution, rendering the Crown's position in Irish affairs ambiguous. The ambiguity was resolved 12 years later when the Irish Free State formally declared itself a republic and left the British Commonwealth. The basis for such appointments thus ceased and no further ones have been made.|$|E

5|$|Karmal was {{appointed}} Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, synonymous with vice head <b>of</b> <b>state,</b> <b>in</b> the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a PDPA Central Committee meeting {{voted in favor}} of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to Prague. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (with the consent of the Afghan government) to stabilize the country.|$|E
