As of October 2010, {{there are three}} such rest area operators on the A3 motorway: INA, Nafta Promet and INA Osijek Petrol. The rest area operators {{are not permitted to}} sub-lease the fuel operations. Most of the A3 motorway rest areas are accessible to both directions of traffic. There are however rest areas which are available only to the eastbound traffic (e.g. Lužani and Brodski Stupnik rest areas) or to westbound traffic <b>only,</b> <b>like</b> Slaven and Staro Petrovo Selo rest areas. Furthermore, some rest areas offer different types of amenities to each direction of the traffic. The rest areas normally operate 24hours per day, 7days per week, except Stari Hrastovi (eastbound) rest area, which is open from 7am to 6pm.|$|E

5|$|So {{immigrants}} who had newly acquired land were not enfranchised as were not {{most of the}} rural ethnically Polish farmers, who still held land by way of lease or feudal fief <b>only</b> <b>like</b> serfs or vassals of their landlords, unlike Prussia proper where serfdom had been abolished in 1807 and 1810. Immigrant farmers from the Holy Roman Empire (such as the Bambrzy) or later from member states of the German Confederation, had usually remained free peasants, causing their stronger representation within the eight members elected by peasants, {{of a total of}} 48. With regard to ethnicity, most of the nobility representatives were Polish, peasantry representatives were balanced, and the townsfolk representatives were mostly German. The first sejm included 22 Poles and 26 Germans, and most of the subsequent elections produced an almost even split between the Poles and the Germans. A major issue of the Sejm was the abolition of serfdom, which would enlarge the number of Polish speaking landowners and after ten years allow their participation in Sejm elections.|$|E

25|$|From 1 October 1960, all-coach DC-6Cs plying the London—Bermuda—Nassau route were {{replaced}} with Britannias featuring a 98-seat, three-class layout comprising 14 first-class, 66 economy and 18 Skycoach seats (British residents <b>only).</b> <b>Like</b> its predecessors, these were Bermudan-registered. An additional weekly all-Skycoach operation using a 113-seat Britannia 310 commenced on 10 October 1960. All revenues — including those from first-class passengers — were shared with BOAC. Schedules were complemented by additional Britannia and DC-6 charters {{during the peak}} summer season.

25|$|Tiên Sơn cave {{is located}} in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. The cave was {{discovered}} by a local inhabitant by accident in 1935. It {{is located in}} Sơn Trach Commune in Bố Trạch. The entry mouth of Tiên Sơn is 1km from Phong Nha cave, {{at an altitude of}} 200 m. This cave is 980 m in length. A 10 m deep hole is situated 400 m from the entry mouth, then a 500 m long underground cave, dangerous for tourists and open to professional expeditionists <b>only.</b> <b>Like</b> Phong Nha cave, this cave features spectacular stalactites and stalagmites shaped like several fairy-tales. Stalactite and stalagmite columns and walls here create strange sounds like that of gong and drum if they are knocked with the hand. According to British cave scientists, Tiên Sơn cave was created tens of million years ago when a water current holed this limestone mount in Kẻ Bàng. Following a series of landforms and movement of rocks, this mass was levered or lowered, blocking the current and creating what is now Tiên Sơn cave while the underground river redirected its current to Phong Nha cave. Although Phong Nha and Tiên Sơn caves are located next to each other, there are no linking grottos between them.|$|E

500|$|The EPA {{official}} rating {{issued in}} November 2010 included separate fuel economy ratings for all-electric mode and gasoline-only mode, {{with an overall}} combined city/highway gasoline-electricity fuel economy rating of [...] equivalent (MPG-e). To address the variability of the fuel economy outcome depending on miles driven between charges, EPA {{also included in the}} Volt's fuel economy label a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios driven between a full charge, and a never-charge scenario. According to this table the Volt's fuel economy goes up to [...] equivalent (MPG-e) if driven [...] between full charges. Also, in recognition of the multiple operating modes that a plug-in hybrid can be built with (all-electric, blended, and gasoline-only), for the new fuel economy and environment label that will be mandatory in the U.S. beginning in model year 2013, EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug-in hybrids. One label is for extended-range electric vehicles, like the Chevy Volt, with two modes: all-electric and gasoline-only; and a second label for blended mode that includes a combination of all-electric, gasoline and electric operation, and gasoline <b>only,</b> <b>like</b> a conventional hybrid vehicle.|$|E
500|$|Johnny Loftus of Allmusic {{classified}} [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] as a nu metal song. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{concluded that}} the song [...] "take things to a more over-the-top, theatrical level." [...] Scott Juba of The Trades rated the song with A, and wrote: [...] "As far as the band's single, 'Everybody's Fool', is concerned, it is a song about the stinging betrayal of deception and the refusal to become blinded by deceit any longer. There is a defiance in Lee's voice that gives the track a bold edge, and the song's heavy drums and soaring guitars further enhance the strong sound. The band surely has another chart topping hit on their hands." [...] Simon Cusens of ABC Online gave the song 3 out of 5 stars calling it [...] "a cold, sad and angry song that I would <b>only</b> <b>like</b> to listen to without it being repeated again." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "rolling acoustic guitar and billowing synthesizers {{pave the way for}} the harsh power chords that open the song" [...] adding that Lee's voice was [...] "disembodied" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Perfect by nature/ Icons of self-indulgence/ Just what we all need/ More lies about a world that/ Never was and never will be." ...|$|E
500|$|Julian Cope {{wrote in}} Krautrocksampler that Tago Mago [...] "sounds <b>only</b> <b>like</b> itself, like no-one before or after", and {{described}} the lyrics as delving [...] "below into the Unconscious". Dummy called it [...] "a genre-defining work of psychedelic, experimental rock music." [...] Critic Simon Reynolds described the record's sound as [...] "shamanic avant-funk." [...] Tago Mago finds Can changing to a jazzier and more experimental sound than previous recordings, with longer instrumental interludes and fewer vocals; this shift {{was caused by the}} dramatic difference between Suzuki and the band's more dominant ex-singer Mooney. On the album, Can took sonic inspiration from sources as diverse as jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and from electronic avant-garde music. The album was also inspired by the occultist Aleister Crowley, which is reflected through the dark sound of the album as well as being named after Isla de Tagomago, an island which features in the Crowley legend. Czukay reflects that the album was [...] "an attempt in achieving a mystery musical world from light to darkness and return". The group has referred to the album as their [...] "magic record". The tracks have been described as having an [...] "air of mystery and forbidden secrets". Tago Mago is divided into two LPs, the first of which is more conventional and structured and the second more experimental and free-form.|$|E

Erlewine called it [...] "excellent" [...] and favored it over the tracks of Survivor (2001), Destiny's Child's previous album. Although considered a great transition for Beyoncé, Vibe disagreed, stating that the song debuted a tepid beginning for Beyoncé, who had high anticipations for a solo-career. Contactmusic.com named the contributions by Beyoncé on the movie's soundtrack as a highlight of the album. Rob Boss of Walmart called Beyoncé [...] "alluring" [...] while reviewing her performance on the soundtrack and comparing it to her performance in the movie itself. Dismissing Beyoncé's acting by stating [...] "she should stick to singing and leave the acting to the actors," [...] Boss called her performance on the song intense and stated that the opening track [...] "Work It Out" [...] was a reason enough to include Beyoncé in the film. Rob Fitzpatrick [...] of New Musical Express gave the song a mixed to positive review, writing that it sounds not <b>only</b> <b>like</b> a perfect imitation or replication of classic funk, but also like a derivation of various other sources and motifs. John Mulvey, writing for the same magazine, considered [...] "Work It Out" [...] {{to be the best}} tune Beyoncé had recorded since [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), and he further commented, [...] "it's Beyoncé yowling, testifying and wigging out in only slightly-studied retro fashion that's most striking." ...|$|E
