50|$|A voltage doubler uses {{two stages}} to {{approximately}} double the DC voltage {{that would have}} been obtained from a single-stage rectifier. An example of a voltage doubler is found in the input stage of switch mode power supplies containing a SPDT switch to select either 120 V or 240 V supply. In the 120 V position the input is typically configured as a full-wave voltage doubler by opening one AC connection point of a bridge rectifier, and connecting the input to the junction of two series-connected filter capacitors. For 240 V operation, the switch configures the system as a full-wave bridge, re-connecting the capacitor center-tap wire to the <b>open</b> <b>AC</b> terminal of a bridge rectifier system. This allows 120 or 240 V operation {{with the addition of a}} simple SPDT switch.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The Baculoviridae {{comprise}} {{a diverse group}} of occluded DNA viruses that contain large double-stranded DNA genomes of 80 - 180 kb and may encode up to 180 gene products. To understand how baculoviruses replicate and process their genomes and the gene products that are involved in these events, a series of mutant virus constructs were generated using the Autographa californica multinucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) genome propagated as a bacteria artificial chromosome (bacmid). The gene products investigated were very late expression factor- 1 (VLF- 1), DNA polymerase, alkaline nuclease, the single-stranded DNA binding protein (DBP), and those encoded from the <b>open</b> reading frames, <b>Ac</b> 101, Ac 142, and Ac 144. Using the Spodoptera frugiperda cell line as a tissue culture model system, bacmid constructs lacking any of the open reading frames encoding these seven gene products were shown to be non-infectious. In addition, based on a series of assays to determine the cause for the non-infectious phenotype, it was revealed that VLF- 1, a putative recombinase and transcriptional activator was also an essential structural component of the capsid and appeared to possess an enzymatic function related to its role as a recombinase during the final stages of DNA encapsidation. A bacmid lacking the alkaline nuclease gene was able to replicate DNA to normal levels, however, this construct produced aberrant genomes and defective nucleocapsids, suggesting that alkaline nuclease was involved in processing viral genomes during replication. Similarly, analysis of a bacmid lacking the single-stranded DNA binding protein DBP revealed that, although not absolutely required for DNA synthesis, DNA synthesis was reduced in the absence of DBP and no unit-length genomes could be detected from transfected cell extracts. Moreover, although not a structural component of budded virus, the DBP knockout was deficient in nucleocapsid production which is predicted to result from a defect in genome maturation. Finally, the gene products encoded by <b>open</b> reading frames <b>Ac</b> 101, Ac 142, and Ac 144, while expendable for DNA synthesis, were shown to be components of the nucleocapsid from budded virus, and bacmids lacking these gene products were deficient in nucleocapsid production...|$|R

This phase delay is also obtained by evaluation of the measured force and flux variation in the E-core actuator, both with and without permanent magnet on the middle tooth.

40|$|Abstract—Because of its accuracy, pattern {{matching}} technique {{has recently been}} applied to Internet security applications such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-virus, and anti-malware. Among various famous {{pattern matching}} algorithms, the Aho-Corasick (AC) can match multiple pattern strings simultaneously with worst-case performance guarantee and is adopted in both Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) and Snort intrusion detection <b>open</b> sources. The <b>AC</b> algorithm is based on finite automaton which can be implemented straightforwardly with a two-dimensional state transition table. However, the memory requirement prohibits such an implementation when the total length of the pattern strings is large. The ClamAV implementation limits {{the depth of the}} finite automaton and combines with linked lists to reduce memory requirement. The banded-row format is adopted to compress the state transition table and used as an alternative pattern matching machine in Snort. In this paper we present a novel implementation which requires small memory space and achieves high throughput performance. Compared with the banded-row format, our proposed scheme achieves 39. 7 % reduction in memory requirement for 5, 000 patterns randomly selected from ClamAV signatures. Besides, the processing time of our proposed scheme is, on the average, 83. 9 % of that of the banded-row format for scanning various types of files. Compared with the ClamAV implementation with the same 5, 000 patterns and files, our proposed scheme requires slightly more memory space but achieves 80. 6 % reduction in processing time on the average.

Long term deterioration models of road surfacing condition are used in predicting network proportions that require resurfacing at different years. The latter can be then used in estimating required budgets. Such models can be also used for indicating network level of service {{that can be achieved}} under different budget scenarios. The objective of the research study reported herein is to develop deterioration models for five types of pavement bituminous surfacing using subjective condition data. They include dense graded asphalt (<b>AC),</b> <b>open</b> graded asphalt (OGA), ultra-thin asphalt (UTA), Seal (chip seal) and GEO (chip seal with geotextile underlay).

The data collected for AC, OGA and UTA include cracking, stone loss, texture loss, deformation and patching. For Seal and GEO, binder condition and level data are also collected. The condition ratings of the distresses are then combined into a single measure referred to as Surface Inspection Rating (SIR). Deterioration models of SIR as a function of surface age are developed for the five surfacing types using Markov Chains. These models are validated and the reasonableness of their predictions is assessed based on practical experience and engineering judgement.

30|$|In {{the water}} {{treatment}} for the potable water production, the adsorption on activated carbons remains an attractive challenge for the environmental protection. Activated carbon (AC) is composed of a substantially amorphous carbon material (Bansal et al. 1988; Bouchemal et al. 2012; Tawfik Saleh 2015), delivering highly porous texture, a large specific surface area, a good adsorption capacity and a thermal stability (Skodras et al. 2008; Li et al. 2013; Alswat et al. 2016). Recent developments in the physical adsorption have highlighted the applications of AC. In this regard, the adsorption of gases (Wang et al. 2012; Abiko et al. 2010; Balarak et al. 2017), the uptake of organophosphorus pollutants (Jayson et al. 1982), the retention of bacteriologic pollutants in aqueous electrolytes (Oya et al. 1993), the elimination of heavy metals (Lu et al. 2014; Gomez-Eyles et al. 2013) and chromate photoreduction (Dermèche et al. 2017) are mainly documented in the <b>open</b> literature. <b>AC</b> is also used in bleaching and deodorization of certain liquids and can further play a role as catalyst support in heterogeneous catalysis (Polcaro et al. 1993; Qi et al. 2012). As the water quality is more stringent by the World Health Organization, an increased interest was focused on adsorbents (Ghasemian et al. 2015), zeolites (Mekatel et al. 2015; Lemraski and Palizban 2015), clays (Boutra et al. 2017) and activated carbons (Belhamdi et al. 2016; Merzougui et al. 2011) which are widely summarized in review articles. The porosity of AC is crucial for the adsorption and remains improperly explored; it is developed after pyrolysis of the carbon precursor under inert atmosphere. Thus, the adsorption capacity is usually insufficient for the utilization to which it was designated and developing the porous texture of AC remains a priority goal. So, {{the first part of}} our work is devoted to the influence of chemical and physical activations using ZnCl 2 and CO 2 flow on the porous texture of AC obtained from Algerian dates pits. The elaboration of activated carbons is applied for the elimination of inorganic pollutants. In this respect, Cr(VI) is a hazardous compound, selected for the pollution tests, in aqueous media for the adsorption on AC. Chromate comes mainly from tanneries, plating and battery factories and gives rise to large-scale pollution. Therefore, {{the second part of the}} work aims at determining the water decontamination by photocatalysis (Saleh and Gupta 2012; Gupta et al. 2012). Indeed, the adsorption yield increases the abatement but becomes inefficient at low concentrations. At this level, the photocatalysis is a clean alternative for the water decontamination which reduces the chromate ions to less harmful forms (Cr 3 +) by photoelectrons (Rekhila et al. 2016). In this regard, the semiconductors with medium forbidden band are promising for the exploitation of a large part of the solar energy (Rekhila et al. 2013). The study focuses on the HCrO 4 − reduction under visible light on the hetero-system ZnCo 2 O 4 /TiO 2. The charge transfer occurs iso-energetically and TiO 2 acts a bridge between the conduction band (CB) of ZnCo 2 O 4 and adsorbed HCrO 4 − ions. Nano-crystallites produce larger active surface areas with more photoelectrochemical sites, and the spinel ZnCo 2 O 4 was prepared by chemical route at lower temperatures. It was selected because of its low cost, light absorption in the visible region and environmentally friendly characteristics (Guo et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of short-lived 223 Ra often involves a second measurement for supported activities, which represents 227 Ac in the sample. Here we exploit this fact, presenting {{a set of}} 284 values on the oceanic distribution of 227 Ac, which was collected when analyzing water samples for short-lived radium isotopes by the radium delayed coincidence counting system. The present work compiles 227 Ac data from coastal regions all over the northern hemisphere, including values from ground water, from estuaries and lagoons, and from marine end-members. Deep-sea samples from a continental slope off Puerto Rico and from an active vent site near Hawaii complete the overview of 227 Ac near its potential sources. The average 227 Ac activities of nearshore marine end-members range from 0. 4 dpm m− 3 at the Gulf of Mexico to 3. 0 dpm m− 3 in the coastal waters of the Korean Strait. In analogy to 228 Ra, we find the extension of adjacent shelf regions to play a substantial role for 227 Ac activities, although less pronounced than for radium, due to its weaker shelf source. Based on previously published values, we calculate an <b>open</b> ocean 227 <b>Ac</b> inventory of 1. 35 * 1018 dpm 227 Acex in the ocean, which corresponds to 37 moles, or 8. 4 kg. This implies a flux of 127 dpm m− 2 y− 1 from the deep-sea floor. For the shelf regions, we obtain a global inventory of 227 Ac of 4. 5 * 1015 dpm, which cannot be converted directly into a flux value, as the regional loss term of 227 <b>Ac</b> to the <b>open</b> ocean {{would have to be}} included. Ac has so far been considered to behave similarly to Ra in the marine environment, {{with the exception of a}} strong Ac source in the deep-sea due to 231 Paex. Here, we present evidence of geochemical differences between Ac, which is retained in a warm vent system, and Ra, which is readily released [Moore, W. S., Ussler, W. and Paull, C. K., 2008 -this issue. Short-lived radium isotopes in the Hawaiian margin: Evidence for large fluid fluxes through the Puna Ridge. Marine Chemistry]. Another potential mechanism of producing deviations in 227 Ac/ 228 Ra and daughter isotope ratios from the expected production value of lithogenic material is observed at reducing environments, where enrichment in uranium may occur. The presented data here may serve as a reference for including 227 Ac in circulation models, and the overview provides values for some end-members that contribute to the global Ac distribution...|$|R
