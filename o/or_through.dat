All of their interactions are over a viewscreen <b>or</b> <b>through</b> communicators and their scenes were filmed four months apart, although a draft script had Khan defeating Kirk in a swordfight.

5|$|Before the {{emergence}} of the holiness movement in the mid-19th century and Pentecostalism in the early 20th century, most denominations believed that Christians received the baptism with the Holy Spirit either upon conversion and regeneration <b>or</b> <b>through</b> rites of Christian initiation, such as water baptism and confirmation. Since the growth and spread of Pentecostal and charismatic churches, however, the belief that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is an experience distinct from Christian initiation has come into increasing prominence.|$|E
