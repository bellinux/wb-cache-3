25|$|If a {{compression}} {{scheme is}} lossless—that is, {{you can always}} recover the entire original message by decompressing—then a compressed message has the same quantity of information as the original, but communicated in fewer characters. That is, it has more information, or a higher entropy, per character. This means a compressed message has less redundancy. Roughly speaking, Shannon's source coding theorem says that a lossless compression scheme cannot compress messages, on average, {{to have more than}} <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> information per bit of message, but that any value less than <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> information per bit of message can be attained by employing a suitable coding scheme. The entropy of a message per bit multiplied by the length of that message is a measure of how much total information the message contains.|$|E

40|$|We have {{implemented}} a synthesis-for-test algorithm to implement orthogonal scan paths in data path logic. Orthogonal scan paths [Avra 92] facilitate {{the sharing of}} the functional and the test logic, thereby reducing the overhead of the scan features. Traditional scan paths, shown in Figure 1, connect individual flip-flops within a register and then connect the registers, e. g., <b>bit</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> register one is connected to <b>bit</b> two <b>of</b> register <b>one,</b> and <b>bit</b> two is connected to <b>bit</b> three <b>of</b> register <b>one,</b> and so on until the last <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> register <b>one</b> is connected to <b>bit</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> register two. An orthogonal scan path, shown in Figure 2, is orthogonal to the traditional scan path. The flip-flops are connected in the scan path so that <b>bit</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> register <b>one</b> connects to <b>bit</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> register two, and <b>bit</b> two <b>of</b> register <b>one</b> connects to <b>bit</b> two <b>of</b> register two, and likewise for all the <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the register. In this way, the scan path follows the normal data path flow, but is orthogonal to the traditional [...] ...|$|R

However, the {{gross bit rate}} and the baud value are equal only when there are only two levels per symbol, representing 0 and 1, meaning that each symbol of a data transmission system carries exactly <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> data; for example, {{this is not the case}} for modern modulation systems used in modems and LAN equipment.|$|E
25|$|A {{spindle motor}} {{in the drive}} rotates the {{magnetic}} medium at a certain speed, while a stepper motor-operated mechanism moves the magnetic read/write head(s) radially along {{the surface of the}} disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid. Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated (5¼") or disk insertion was complete (3½"). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This small signal is amplified and sent to the floppy disk controller, which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.|$|E

Initially the band were mainly {{concerned}} with the sound quality, describing the presentation of the album's tracks in surround sound as [...] "radical, like the change from mono to stereo". The group directed the surround sound mix themselves, instructing audio engineers to move instruments and vocal parts between speakers: [...] "We want that <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> sound to travel from the centre, over our heads and finish on my right shoulder ...

Ciaran has described this process as [...] "not always a nice position to be in" [...] when, for example, they had to reject music videos they weren't happy with. The band asked different directors to make music videos for each song having tried unsuccessfully to make a film to accompany their 1999 album Guerrilla themselves. According to singer Gruff Rhys the band [...] "tended to go for illustrators who could [...] cheaply using Flash ... and artists who like to work". The directors were asked to make the visuals as [...] "extreme as possible" [...] in an effort to avoid making videos that looked like just [...] "another pop promo ... like MTV" [...] and, according to Ciaran, had to [...] "work even harder at creating something interesting" [...] due to the limited budget available. Many of those who made videos for the DVD release had no previous experience of making films resulting in a [...] "really fresh ... kind of scruffy" [...] end product. According to Rhys the band made separate music videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional videos that were more like adverts for the songs. Rhys {{has stated that}} the Super Furry Animals felt that fans placed too much emphasis on the videos on Rings Around the World rather than concentrating on the music, as a result of which the band used [...] "really bland images" [...] on the DVD release of their next album Phantom Power.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{consider}} {{the example of}} a coin toss. Assuming the probability of heads {{is the same as the}} probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be. This is because there is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if we have to choose, the best we can do is predict that the coin will come up heads, and this prediction will be correct with probability 1/2. Such a coin toss has <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, one binary-outcome with equiprobable values has a Shannon entropy of [...] bit. Similarly, one trit with equiprobable values contains [...] (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{usual in}} the {{computer}} industry to specify password strength in terms of information entropy, measured in bits, a concept from information theory. Instead of the number of guesses needed to find the password with certainty, the base-2 logarithm of that number is given, which is the number of [...] "entropy bits" [...] in a password. A password with, say, 42 bits of strength calculated in this way would be as strong as a string of 42 bits chosen randomly, say by a fair coin toss. Put another way, a password with 42 bits of strength would require 242 attempts to exhaust all possibilities during a brute force search. Thus, adding <b>one</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> entropy to a password doubles the number of guesses required, which makes an attacker's task twice as difficult. On average, an attacker will have to try half of the possible passwords before finding the correct one.|$|E
