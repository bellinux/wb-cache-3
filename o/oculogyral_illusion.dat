40|$|Thirty-six {{airline pilots}} and 56 nonpilots were tested to {{determine}} their sensitivity to rotation. A staircase procedure {{was used to determine}} <b>oculogyral</b> <b>illusion</b> and perception of rotation thresholds, in a precision rotation device. The results indicated that (1) {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups for either threshold measure, (2) the thresholds for the <b>oculogyral</b> <b>illusion</b> were significantly lower than the perception of rotation thresholds for both groups, and (3) changes in threshold as a function of age were minimal for 91 of the men. The validity and results of the tests are discussed with regard to the pilot's use of motion information in control tasks for aircraft and simulators...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent to}} which perceptual judgements within egocentric and exocentric frames of {{reference}} are subject to illusory disturbances and long term modifications is discussed. It is argued that well known spatial illusions, such as the <b>oculogyral</b> <b>illusion</b> and induced visual motion have usually been discussed without proper attention being paid to the frame of reference within which they occur, and that {{this has led to}} the construction of inadequate theories and inappropriate procedures for testing them...|$|E
40|$|Nine college age males, all {{prone to}} motion sickness, were {{subjects}} {{in an experiment}} designed to test adaptation to motion. Subjects were placed in a slow rotation room (SRR) for varying intervals and asked to perform headward movements. Degree of adaptation to the SRR was measured {{in the framework of}} 3 categories: reduction of ataxia, reduction of <b>oculogyral</b> <b>illusion,</b> and reduction of epiphenomena, which includes symptoms of motion sickness. 'Satisfactory' adaptation was acquired and retained in 7 of the 9 subjects. Tables are presented summarizing the results...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the oculogyro {{illusion}} of the relative motion of a spot fixed {{with respect to the}} subject during subject rotation and of a fixed striped peripheral visual field under different levels of illumination on perceptions of rotation about a vertical axis are investigated. Subjects were seated in a rotatable flight trainer cockpit with visual fields consisting of darkness, a dim peripheral field, and a bright peripheral field, all fixed with respect to the subject, and subject perceptual thresholds, frequency responses and sensations of displacement and velocity were measured during trainer rotation at constant and varying angular accelerations. The perception of angular acceleration is found to exhibit a significantly lower threshold and a reduced latency time in the illuminated visual fields which was independent of the level of illumination. Subjective frequency responses showed a higher gain in the illuminated presentations, while subjective displacements during triangular velocity stimuli exhibited no difference for the different visual cues. Finally, magnitude estimations of the after-rotation associated with deceleration from a constant velocity showed a greater rising speed, larger velocity and longer duration under illumination. Results show that, for low accelerations, the visual input enhances sensitivity to self-motion, an effect explained by the <b>oculogyral</b> <b>illusion...</b>|$|E
