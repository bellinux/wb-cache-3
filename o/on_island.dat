He is known also for his {{pioneering}} work <b>on</b> <b>island</b> biogeography, which relates species richness to island size, an important consideration in nature conservation. Wilson however favours group selection over the Neo-Darwinian kin selection as an explanation of co-operation in social animals.|$|E

5|$|Sea turtles nest <b>on</b> <b>island</b> {{beaches in}} the park. Park staff {{actively}} assist turtle nesting by removing debris from beaches that might pose {{an obstacle to}} adults and hatchlings. Loggerhead turtles {{are the most common}} sea turtle species and account for nearly all of the turtle nests in the park. Nest sites are identified by daily morning beach patrols and are protected with mesh screen against the predation by abundant raccoon population. Nest protection efforts have reduced predation from 100% of nests disturbed per year to no disturbed nests in 2007, with a more usual average of more than 50% nest disturbance in most years. In 2012 one undisturbed nest was found and protected, five partially disturbed nests were protected, and one nest was destroyed by predators. The threatened eastern indigo snake is also present on the island.|$|E

5|$|The great spotted kiwi, great grey kiwi, or roroa (Apteryx haastii) is {{a species}} of kiwi endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. The great spotted kiwi, {{as a member of}} the ratites, is flightless. It is the largest of the kiwi. The rugged {{topography}} and harsh climate of the high altitude, alpine, part of its habitat render it inhospitable to a number of introduced mammalian predators, which include dogs, ferrets, cats and stoats. Because of this, populations of this species have been less seriously affected by the predations of these invasive species compared to other kiwi. Nonetheless, there has been a 43% decline in population in the past 45 years, due to these predators and habitat destruction. This has led it to be classified as vulnerable. There are less than 16,000great spotted kiwis in total, almost all in the more mountainous parts of northwest Nelson, the northwest coast, and the Southern Alps. A minority live <b>on</b> <b>island</b> reserves.|$|E
5|$|Wallace, {{following}} {{on earlier}} work by de Candolle, Humboldt and Darwin, made major contributions to zoogeography. Because of {{his interest in}} the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to the geographical distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in South America and then in the Malay archipelago. While in the archipelago he identified the Wallace line, which runs through the Spice Islands dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a New Guinea/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote The Geographical Distribution of Animals, which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, Island Life, in 1880 that focused <b>on</b> <b>island</b> biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by Philip Sclater for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.|$|E

25|$|As Patriarch Cyril {{had three}} priorities: the {{recovery}} of the patriarchal finances, the fight against Catholic positions and the instruction of the monks. To improve the finances he raised taxes on the metropolitan bishops and relieved the little parishes: this action was quite successful but made him unpopular among the bishops. He strongly supported the need to re-baptise all converts, and especially women, because he considered the Armenian and Catholic baptisms as not valid. These positions created discontent among the metropolitans, who deposed him in May 1751 and reinstalled the moderate Paisius II in his place.

40|$|When {{isolated}} from predators, costly {{and no longer}} functional anti-predator behaviour should be selected against. Predator naiveté is often pronounced <b>on</b> <b>islands,</b> where species are found with few or no predators. However, isolation <b>on</b> <b>islands</b> involves other processes, such as founder effects, that might be responsible for naiveté or reduced anti-predator behaviour. We report the first comparative evidence that, in macropodid marsupials, isolation <b>on</b> <b>islands</b> {{may lead to a}} systematic loss of ‘group size effects’—a behaviour whereby individuals reduce anti-predator vigilance and allocate more time to foraging as group size increases. Moreover, insular animals forage more, and are less vigilant, than mainland ones. However, we found no evidence that animals on the mainland are ‘flightier’ than those <b>on</b> <b>islands.</b> Remarkably, we also found no evidence that isolation from all predators per se is responsible for these effects. Together, these results demonstrate that anti-predator behaviour may indeed be lost or modified when animals are isolated <b>on</b> <b>islands,</b> but it is premature to assume that all such behaviour is affected...|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} report further claims neither {{growth retardation}} nor pituitary dwarfism could {{be responsible for}} the unique skull and short stature (however, no reason is provided); instead, Brown et al. suggest insular dwarfing of H. erectus as a result of selective pressures acting <b>on</b> <b>island</b> populations. This theory posits that the tropical rainforests present on the island tend to be a calorically impoverished environment, causing a dietary strain on hominins, especially in the absence of agriculture. Because of reduced resources, an advantage is placed on individuals who are smaller with lower energy requirements. This selection can also greatly affect sensory organs such as the brain, which could explain the small endocranial volume present in H. floresiensis.|$|E
