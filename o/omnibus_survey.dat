40|$|OBJECTIVE: This paper {{reports on}} a study of dental anxiety among adults aged 60 years living {{independently}} in Britain. DESIGN: A national cross-sectional study carried out {{with the assistance of}} the Office for National Statistics' <b>Omnibus</b> <b>Surveys</b> in 1999. SETTING: Data was collected by face to face interviews with older people in their homes. MEASUREMENTS: Data on dental anxiety were collected from 973 subjects by means of face to face interviews and was measured by the Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) (Corah, 1969). In addition, data on dental service use and oral health status (self-reported) was collected. RESULTS: The mean DAS score was 8. 4 (sd 3. 5), and 13 % (129) of subjects were classified as dentally anxious (DAS > or = 13). DAS scores were associated with numerous socio-demographic factors (P < 0. 01), self-reported oral health status (P < 0. 01) and dental service (P < 0. 01) factors. A series of regression analyses revealed that dental anxiety was a significant predictor of a number of behavioural and oral health outcomes. CONCLUSION: One in eight older people in Britain are dentally anxious and this is associated with their use of services and oral health status (self-reported). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{changes in}} the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in South Australia between 1991 and 1993. DESIGN AND SETTING: Survey of women aged 40 years and over, as part of the 1991 and 1993 South Australian Health <b>Omnibus</b> <b>Surveys</b> (household interviews); 868 were interviewed in 1991 and 790 in 1993. OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of HRT use. RESULTS: In 1993, 19. 0 % of women aged 40 years and over were taking HRT and 28. 5 % had ever taken it (currently or in the past). The highest rates were in the 50 - 54 years age group (46. 2 % current use and 57. 8 % ever use). Between 1991 and 1993 there was a 40 % {{increase in the number of}} women taking HRT and a significant increase (P < 0. 01) in the median duration of therapy, from 38 to 54 months.

40|$|Objectives: This study compares a functionalist (quantitative) {{versus a}} {{hermeneutic}} (qualitative) approach to assessing {{the impact of}} oral health on life quality in two United Kingdom national surveys. Methods: The vehicles {{for this study were}} two Office for National Statistics' <b>Omnibus</b> <b>Surveys</b> completed in 1998 and 1999. In both studies a random probability sample of 3000 household addresses was selected from the British Postcode Address File (PAF). The data were collected by face-to-face interviews with respondents in their homes about how their oral health status affected their quality of life employing a qualitative, hermeneutic approach (1998) and a functionalist, quantitative approach using a battery of questions (1999). Results: Irrespective of study design, in both studies it was apparent {{that the majority of the}} public perceived their oral health as affecting their life quality (P > 0. 05). Likewise, both approaches identified that oral health affected life quality most frequently through physical aspects of oral health rather than social or psychological. However, using the hermeneutic approach, respondents were less likely to cite that their oral health affected specific aspects of their oral health compared to when a battery of questions were used (P < 0. 01). Furthermore, socio-demographic variations in oral health-related quality of life were more apparent when a battery of questions were employed compared to an open-ended approach. Conclusions: Different approaches to assessing oral health-related quality of life yield similar findings in terms of prevalence of oral health's impact and affected ways (domains). However, the different methods influenced the ability to identify socio-demographic disparities. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objective: There is {{conflicting}} evidence {{as to whether}} depression prevalence is increasing or is stable. Although birth cohort analysis studies show increasing prevalence, longitudinal studies do not. To date there are no published Australian studies providing long-term estimates of depression prevalence. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the increasing depression prevalence hypothesis in an Australian context. Method: Data from the 1998 and 2004 South Australian Health <b>Omnibus</b> <b>Surveys</b> were reanalysed. In each survey there were 3000 participants who were interviewed. The data were weighted to achieve representativeness prior to analysis. Depression status was classified by the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders scale (the PRIME-MD) into major, other and no depressions. Both univariate and multivariable analyses were used to examine depression trends over time and to adjust the data for significant background variables. Results: There was no significant increase in the proportion of cases classified with major depression between 1998 and 2004; there was, however, a significant decrease in other depression. The overall unadjusted prevalence of major depression was 7. 4 % (6. 8 % in 1998 and 8. 0 % in 2004) and for other depression it was 9. 5 % (10. 6 % in 1998 and 8. 4 % in 2004). The highest levels of depression, both major and other, were observed among females aged 1529 years, and the lowest levels among those aged] 50 years. The strongest predictor of depression was poor overall health status. Conclusion: It is time for the conventional wisdom that depression is increasing to be reconsidered, and for a more realistic perspective, developed from evidence-based analyses, to be accepted.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{changes in}} the prevalence of major depression between 1998, 2004 and 2008 in South Australia. Methods: Face-to-face Health <b>Omnibus</b> <b>surveys</b> were conducted in 1998, 2004 and 2008 with approximately 3000 participants aged 15 years and over, who were random and representative samples of the South Australian population. Each survey used the same methodology. Outcome measures were: major depression as detected by the Mood module of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders instrument; mental health literacy by recognition and exposure to classical symptoms of depression; and health status using the SF- 36 Physical and Mental Component summaries. Results: There was {{a significant increase in}} the prevalence of major depression from 6. 8 % (95 %CI: 5. 9 % – 7. 7 %) to 10. 3 % (95 %CI: 9. 2 % – 11. 4 %; X² 24. 59, p < 0. 001) between 1998 and 2008. Significant increases were observed in males aged 15 – 29 and females aged 30 – 49 years. There was no significant increase in any other sub-group. The strongest predictor of major depression was health status. Participants with poor/fair mental health literacy were 37 % less likely to be classified with major depression. Conclusions: The prevalence of major depression increased significantly in South Australia over the last decade and there was a reduction in mental health status and an increase in persons reporting poor health. Unexpectedly, having poor or fair mental health literacy was significantly protective for major depression. Ideally, public health initiatives should result in an improvement in health, but this did not appear to have occurred here. Robert D. Goldney, Kerena A. Eckert, Graeme Hawthorne and Anne W.

This study, which consisted of a sample survey and two qualitative surveys of sub-samples, covered the socio-economic circumstances, age, employment, income, marital status, living arrangements and housing (only the sample survey is held at the Data Archive). The study explored respondents' physical, financial and affective relationships with their former partner and non resident children, and also their feelings about their rights and responsibilities as fathers and the opportunities and constraints surrounding their relationship. The study also sought to explain respondents' level of contact with their children and the odds of paying child support {{in relation to their}} circumstances and present relationships. Main Topics : The dataset contains 1650 cases of men identified by NOP/OPCS <b>Omnibus</b> <b>surveys</b> as fathers with non resident dependent children. 619 cases contain the interview responses of those fathers agreeing to participate in the survey of non resident fathers. The Omnibus data contains information about the non resident fathers. It was used to establish if the 619 fathers interviewed in the follow-up survey were a representative sample of the 1650 non resident fathers identified. It was necessary to weight the survey sample using the Omnibus data.

40|$|Aim To examine {{fears about}} dying in an ethnically diverse {{population}} sample, {{and a more}} homogeneous population sample, aged 65 and over. Methods Personal interviews with people aged 65 + living at home responding to two Office for National Statistics <b>Omnibus</b> <b>Surveys</b> in Britain, and two Ethnibus Surveys of ethnically diverse populations in Britain. Results Ethnically diverse respondents {{were more likely than}} British population respondents to express fears about dying on all measures used. Respondents in both samples with better, compared with worse, quality of life had significantly reduced odds of having extreme fears of dying (ethnically diverse sample, OR 0. 924 (95 % CI 0. 898 to 0. 951); British population sample, OR 0. 981 (95 % CI 0. 966 to 0. 996); both p< 0. 001). In the latter sample only, older age was protective (OR 0. 957; 95 % CI 0. 930 to 0. 985; p< 0. 001), whereas in the Ethnibus sample, having a longstanding illness (OR 2. 024; 95 % CI 1. 158 to 3. 535; p< 0. 05) and having more relatives to help them (OR 1. 134; 95 % CI 1. 010 to 1. 274; p< 0. 05) increased fears about dying. Conclusions Enabling older people to express fears about dying is likely to be important when planning supportive end-of-life care. Practitioners should not assume that fears about dying are the same in different social groups, or that extensive family support is protective against such anxiety. Older people from ethnic minorities had more anxieties about dying than others, and were more likely to express fears the more extensive their family support. These findings have implications for commissioners and practitioners of primary and secondary care...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} two aims, first {{to examine the}} {{feasibility}} of using an <b>omnibus</b> <b>survey</b> to estimate the prevalence and characteristics of families who home educate and secondly to provide an empirical contribution to recent research on home education in the UK. Because there is no statutory requirement for families who home educate to register with the Local Authority, there are no nationally representative data on the prevalence and characteristics of the home educating population in this country. Therefore gathering data from a fully randomised sample of home educating families would be prohibitively expensive. In this study we used a national <b>omnibus</b> <b>survey</b> {{to collect data on}} the homeschooling experiences of over 6000 households from across the UK, of whom 52 were found to have engaged in homeschooling. Our findings estimate that around 1 % of families with dependent children have home educated either on a full or part-time basis. Provision of home education was often episodic and reflects the diversity of the home educating population. While the findings presented here largely confirm previous work on home education in the UK, other work tends to be based largely in the home educating community and often lacks a comparison with the general population.

OBJECTIVES: To use {{representative}} population {{surveillance data}} {{to monitor and}} project changes in the prevalence of diabetes for different age and body mass index (BMI) groups. STUDY DESIGN: Representative, annual, face-to-face South Australian Health <b>Omnibus</b> <b>Surveys,</b> 1991 - 2003 (n= 3000 per year). METHODS: Trends in self-reported diabetes prevalence by age group and BMI were examined. Separate projections were {{made on the basis}} of predicted changes in population demography and diabetes prevalence. RESULTS: The age-sex standardized absolute prevalence of self-reported diabetes among people aged 15 years and over increased from 3. 5 % in 1991 to 6. 7 % in 2003. If this current trend continues, the prevalence is expected to increase to 10. 5 % by 2016. The prevalence of diabetes was significantly higher among those classified as obese (6. 5 % in 1991 to 12. 2 % in 2003) than those with normal BMI. The greatest relative percentage increase in prevalence between 1991 and 2003 (169 %) was seen among people aged 15 - 39 years. Taking both age group and BMI classification into account, the greatest relative percentage increases over this time were seen among those with normal BMI aged 60 years or older (148 %), and those who were obese and aged less than 60 years (139 %). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of diabetes and obesity increased significantly between 1991 and 2003. Population ageing and an increase in diabetes prevalence in the future will further increase the burden of diabetes. Future increases in diabetes prevalence are not inevitable, however, if investments are made in public health prevention programmes, particularly those addressing obesity. C. R. Chittleborough, J. F.

40|$|The Shirley Glasstone Hughes Trust Fund (SGHTF) instigated a {{research}} agenda-setting process {{to ensure its}} primary research commissioning was targeted at the topics of most relevance to primary dental care practitioners. Overall, the objective was to reduce barriers to evidence-based dentistry practice. A web-based system generated research topic nominations, and a resource- constrained rapid evidence review process produced Evidence Summaries for use by practitioners and research commissioners, launched in May 2009. Nine Evidence Summaries {{were published in the}} British Dental Journal, and SGHTF used these outputs to inform research commissioning. This health services mixed methods research aimed to evaluate the implementation of the SGHTF research agenda-setting process. Feasibility and effectiveness of setting up and running the web-based system, and implementation of the newly-designed rapid review process was assessed using a range of component studies: semi-structured interviews with research commissioners; quantitative and qualitative assessment of the reviewer's activity diaries; quantitative assessment of dental practitioners' research topic nominations and voting (online topic prioritisation); postal surveys (as part of the British Dental Association's national <b>Omnibus</b> <b>Surveys)</b> to dentists, and an e- survey to research commissioners to assess usefulness and relevance of research topics generated and rapid reviews completed. The findings showed that both the web-based system and the rapid review process were feasible. However, levels of engagement with the former by dentists were modest, due to the implementation approach. Evidence Summaries were found to be of relevance and useful to practitioners and research commissioners. Similar organisations seeking to enhance evidence-based practice are encouraged to draw upon relevant expertise at an early stage in planning new initiatives. Full appreciation of what communication is possible through online means, how it fits into their mission overall, and what is involved, is required at the outset to achieve successful on line stakeholder relationship building.
