5|$|A {{critical}} and commercial success in 1990, Fear <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Planet sold two {{million copies in}} the United States and received rave reviews from critics, many of whom named {{it one of the}} year's best albums. Its immediate success contributed significantly to the popularity of Afrocentric and political subject matter in hip hop and the genre's mainstream resurgence at the time. Since then, it has been viewed as one of hip hop's greatest and most important records, as well as being musically and culturally significant. In 2003, Fear <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Planet was ranked number 300 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2005, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} and has {{according to some}} reports been common in relatively recent times. As with lead, bismuth poisoning can result in the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> deposit on the gingiva, known as a bismuth line. Poisoning may be treated with dimercaprol; however, evidence for benefit is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Fear <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Planet debuted {{at number}} 40 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart. It also charted for 10 weeks and reached number {{four in the}} United Kingdom, while in Canada, it charted for 28 weeks and reached number 15. By July 1990, it had sold 1.5 million copies in the US, where it {{ultimately}} peaked at number 10 and charted for 27 weeks on the Top Pop Albums. After 1991, when the tracking system Nielsen SoundScan began tracking domestic sales data, Fear <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Planet sold 561,000 additional copies by 2010.|$|E
5|$|Fear <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone. Recorded during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E

5|$|Although the State Arms {{were granted}} in 1969, {{municipal}} heraldry {{had already been}} using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with a black swan as a charge {{in the first quarter}} and black swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, black swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms granted by the Crown have included a representation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> swan, presumably acknowledging the allegiance of each municipality to the state.|$|E

5|$|During 1888, Jingyuen was repainted {{along with}} the rest of the Chinese Navy, {{changing}} from the all grey scheme she had sailed from England with, to a combination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hull, white above the waterline and buff coloured funnels, typical of the Victorian era. In May 1889, Jingyuen and the Beiyang Fleet were moved to fortify Weihaiwei (now Weihai). During the summer of that year, she was part of the flotilla led by Admiral Ding Ruchang, which travelled to Chefoo (now Yantai), Chemlupo (now Incheon, South Korea), and the Imperial Russian Navy base of Vladivostok. On the return leg of the journey, they stopped at Fusan (now Busan, South Korea).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A “clean ” <b>black</b> hole is <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole in vacuum {{such as the}} Schwarzschild black hole. However in real {{physical}} systems, {{there are}} matter fields around <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole. Such <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole is called <b>a</b> “dirty <b>black</b> hole”. In this paper, the effect of matter fields on the black hole and the greybody factor is investigated. The results show that matter fields make <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole smaller. They can increase the potential energy to <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole to obstruct Hawking radiation to propagate. This causes the greybody factor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dirty <b>black</b> hole {{to be less than}} that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clean <b>black</b> hole...|$|R

Initially she offered him her daughter then her granddaughter who was six years old. The four other women were named as co-conspirators in her confession.|$|E
5|$|Strange Days is a 1995 American {{science fiction}} thriller film {{directed}} by Kathryn Bigelow, written by James Cameron and Jay Cocks, and produced by Cameron and Steven-Charles Jaffe. It stars Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Juliette Lewis, and Tom Sizemore. Set {{in the last}} two days of 1999, the film follows the story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> marketeer of SQUID discs, recordings that allow a user to experience the recorder's memories and physical sensations, as he attempts to uncover the truth behind the murder of a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Trident {{contains}} peristyle panels {{with the}} motif <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> dolphin situated around a red anchor and black tridents against a white background. The theme {{suggests that the}} owners of the house were somehow connected to maritime pursuits. These simple, two-dimensional mosaics stand in contrast to the multicolored, finely-detailed, three-dimensional Hellenistic mosaics of figures and motifs. They are perhaps comparable or even linked to the black-and-white pavement mosaics that appear in Roman Italy some decades later.|$|E

Black can easily get several pieces around the white king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4.

If White tries to defend with h2–h3, this may allow the Bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open the h-file.|$|E
