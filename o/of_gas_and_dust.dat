At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E

They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> often {{visible to the naked}} eye.|$|E
5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear.

Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E

Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active.

Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed at a couple of dozen of them. The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record must come from plume deposits.|$|E
5|$|The various {{planets are}} thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the {{disc-shaped}} cloud <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> left over from the Sun's formation. The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar. Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (planetesimals) of ~10kilometres (km) in size. These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year {{over the course of the}} next few million years.|$|E

5|$|When a {{protostar}} {{is formed}} from {{the collapse of}} a giant molecular cloud <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an exothermic nuclear fusion process that converts hydrogen into helium.|$|E
5|$|When the {{terrestrial}} planets were forming, they remained {{immersed in a}} disk <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b> The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets.

Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration, but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving the planets in their current orbits.|$|E
