5|$|A low {{pressure}} {{system on the}} tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward. Convection became more organized, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 11, based on reports from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path. A trough of {{low pressure}} near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 22. Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an eye feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 28 over Spain.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave accompanied with a {{low pressure}} system moved {{off the coast of}} Africa <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. <b>On</b> <b>August</b> 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 28. The wave crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 30 while located 335miles (540km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 14, moved westward as a disorganized system, and passed through the Cape Verde islands <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 15. <b>On</b> <b>August</b> 17, a weak {{area of low pressure}} developed in the system about 750miles (1,200km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Convection increased over the western portion of the wave axis, and the system began to become better organized <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 18 while located about 1,250miles (2,000km) east of the Lesser Antilles. However, convection around the system diminished <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 19, and later that day it began to move through the Lesser Antilles. Despite favorable upper-level winds and falling atmospheric pressures, there were initially no signs of a circulation at the surface. Convection again increased early <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 20, and it gradually became better organized. Based on a ship's wind report of the system, it is estimated the wave developed into Tropical Depression Nine <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 21 while located about 260miles (415km) south of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 11 and gradually organized. The next day, an atmospheric circulation developed. Based on this, this system {{was classified as}} Tropical Depression Nine <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 13. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hilary. The system gradually accelerated to the northwest and reached its peak strength <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 15 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It became a depression <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 16, turned {{a little bit more}} westward, and dissipated <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death or damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} a tropical depression over the central Caribbean Sea around 12:00 UTC <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 23. Trekking west-northwestward, the system strengthened into a tropical storm about 24 hours later. It gradually intensified, and reach hurricane status south of Jamaica <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 25. The hurricane then curved northwest and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 27. Early the following day, the cyclone made landfall near Cancún, Quintana Roo, with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The storm weakened to a Category 1 during its brief transit across the Yucatán Peninsula, before re-intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico late <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 28. The hurricane quickly strengthened, and attained its peak intensity <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). However, nearing the Texas Gulf Coast, the storm waned in intensity, and was only a Category 1 hurricane {{by the time it}} made a final landfall near Matagorda, Texas, <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 30. Continuing inland, the hurricane weakened, and degenerated into a remnant low over New Mexico <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 31.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted {{for a few more}} days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 14, 1998. It traveled westward, and <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 19 spawned the tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Bonnie. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 25. The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low-level circulation over southern Mexico. A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the low-level circulation, and after persisting for several days developed a smaller low-level circulation <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 29 about 575miles (925km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. <b>On</b> <b>August</b> 31, the two primary areas of convection were well-removed from the center. By early on September 1, despite a lack of convective organization, the low-cloud circulation was sufficiently well-defined that the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E, or the tenth tropical depression of the season, about 350miles (565km) south of Cabo San Lucas. In real time, the National Hurricane Center first upgraded the system 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 19, accompanied with spiral bands of convection around an area of low pressure. A large circulation quickly developed once it reached the Atlantic Ocean, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Four late <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 19 while located 345mi (555km) southeast of Cape Verde. Initial forecasts predicted for great intensification, including one forecast for the depression to strengthen to a hurricane within three days. However, the depression remained disorganized, and slowly intensified to attain tropical storm status <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 22.|$|E

5|$|A {{vigorous}} upper-level low developed west of Alberto <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 7 and August 8. This {{caused an}} increase in vertical shear, weakening the hurricane down to a tropical storm <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 9. The low also caused the storm {{to turn to the}} northwest. However, <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 10, Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again. It then moved in a gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between August 11 and August 12. Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 11, passing about 345mi (555km) east of the island. The strong storm became a Category3 major hurricane <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 12 and reached its second and highest peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), and a 60mi (95km) wide eye was observed. Alberto was an unusual storm in that it reached its peak intensity at a high latitude, north of 35˚N, after it had re-curved. The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper-level westerlies <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 13 and August 14, while moving east-northeastward. Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 14.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 16. Deep convection increased over the wave upon entering the Pacific, and early <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E
5|$|After {{a rather}} lengthy lull punctuated by only Tropical Depression Seven-E, a {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Eight-E <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 21.

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late <b>on</b> <b>August</b> 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E
