5|$|A {{number of}} Egyptian commanders wanted {{to carry out}} a general war to regain at least a {{significant}} part of the Sinai. This view was notably held by the Minister of War, General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek. However, in January 1972 Sadek acknowledged that Egypt's Armed Forces were not ready for a land reclamation war before some five to ten years. Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating all <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sinai.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (<b>or</b> <b>most)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|During the transition, many <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is {{that the federal government}} would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{hold that}} many <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statements and events {{described in the}} Mishnah and Talmud usually occurred more or less as described, {{and that they can}} be used as serious sources of historical study. In this view, historians do their best to tease out later editorial additions (itself a very difficult task) and skeptically view accounts of miracles, leaving behind a reliable historical text. See, for example, the works of Saul Lieberman, David Weiss Halivni, Avraham Goldberg and Dov Zlotnick.|$|E
25|$|The Windows Registry {{contains}} multiple sections where {{modification of}} key values allows software {{to be executed}} automatically when the operating system boots. Spyware can exploit this design to circumvent attempts at removal. The spyware typically will link itself from each location in the registry that allows execution. Once running, the spyware will periodically check {{if any of these}} links are removed. If so, they will be automatically restored. This ensures that the spyware will execute when the operating system is booted, even if some (<b>or</b> <b>most)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> registry links are removed.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} several equivalent characterizations, {{some of which}} provide a natural distinction between boundary points and interior points, and hence should prove useful for computations.

25|$|Efficiency {{is further}} {{impaired}} in the transportation of agricultural {{products from the}} farms to the actual markets. According to figures from the Commerce Department, up to 25% {{of fruits and vegetables}} rot before being sold, compared to around 5% in a typical developed country. As intermediaries cannot sell these rotten fruits they pay farmers less than they would if able to sell all <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruits and vegetables. This reduces farmer’s revenues although the problem is caused by post-production inefficiencies, which they are not themselves aware of during price negotiations with intermediaries.|$|E
25|$|For example: A person seeks donations. That {{person may}} find another person willing to donate a {{substantial}} sum. However, {{if the person}} seeking the donations met the person donating, not {{for the purpose of}} collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, we cannot say that it is by chance.|$|E
25|$|From 1642 until 1705, {{and from}} 1750 to the 1950s, the Dalai Lamas or their regents headed the Tibetan {{government}} (or Ganden Phodrang) in Lhasa which governed all <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tibetan plateau {{with varying degrees}} of autonomy under the Qing Dynasty of China, up to complete sovereignty, which was rejected by both the People's Republic of China and Republic of China. This Tibetan government also enjoyed the patronage and protection of firstly Mongol kings of the Khoshut and Dzungar Khanates (1642–1720) and then of the emperors of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1720–1912).|$|E

25|$|The EMS {{division}} was rocked by leadership scandals in 2004 and 2005. In August 2004, D.C. {{emergency medical services}} officials breached confidential patient records by taking them home, a blatant violation of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. EMS Medical Director Dr. Fernando Daniels III was terminated, and city investigators said that many <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EMS division's 35 managers could be fired. Daniels' successor, Dr. Clifford H.

25|$|Other drugs {{related to}} {{hydroxyzine}} are cyclizine, buclizine, and meclizine, and they share all <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benefits, indications, contraindications, cautions, and {{side effects of}} hydroxyzine. The second-generation antihistamine cetirizine is in fact one of the metabolites of hydroxyzine produced in the human body. Unlike hydroxyzine, cetirizine is not reported to appreciably cross the blood-brain barrier, {{but it has been}} reported to be associated with dystonic reactions as well as sedation. Therefore, it has a narrower spectrum of effects, making it an effective antihistamine but removing {{some or all of the}} anxiolytic and other psychoactive properties, but it may cause dystonic reactions and drowsiness in some patients.|$|E

25|$|The Germani tribes which Caesar {{had earlier}} named {{in this region}} were the Eburones, the Condrusi, the Paemani (or Caemani), the Caeroesi, and the Segni.

The other tribes are thought to have lived further south, in what is today Wallonia, or else just over the border in Germany - the Condrusi in the modern Condroz, near the Segni, and the Caeroesi in the Eifel forest region of Germany.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, DNA {{tests have}} {{demonstrated}} substantially less inter-marriage {{in most of}} the various Jewish ethnic divisions over the last 3,000 years than in other populations. The findings lend support to traditional Jewish accounts accrediting their founding to exiled Israelite populations, and counters theories that many <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's Jewish populations were founded by entirely gentile populations that adopted the Jewish faith, as in the notable case of the historic Khazars. Although groups such as the Khazars could have been absorbed into modern Jewish populations — in the Khazars' case, absorbed into the Ashkenazim — it is unlikely that they formed {{a large percentage of the}} ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews, and much less that they were the genesis of the Ashkenazim.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} device performing the computations is synced with a clock that is running at frequencies {{on the order}} of mega-hertz (MHz) to giga-hertz (GHz). However, due to hardware pipelining, and complexity of some instructions, some operations take multiple clock cycles to complete. Therefore, it is not always necessary to sample the signal at such a high clock rate. It is often possible to get information on all <b>or</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operations while sampling {{on the order of}} kilo-hertz (kHz). Different devices leak information at different frequencies. For example, Intel’s Atom processor will leak keys during RSA and AES encryption at frequencies between 50MHz and 85MHz. Android version 4.4’s Bouncy Castle library implementation of ECDSA is vulnerable to key extraction side channel attacks around the 50kHz range.|$|E
