40|$|Background: Filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus niger {{are well}} known for their {{exceptionally}} high capacity for secretion of proteins, organic acids, and secondary metabolites and they are therefore used in biotechnology as versatile microbial production platforms. However, system-wide insights into their metabolic and secretory capacities are sparse and rational strain improvement approaches are therefore limited. In order to gain a genome-wide view on the transcriptional regulation of the protein secretory pathway of A. niger, we investigated the transcriptome of A. niger when it was forced to overexpression the glaA gene (encoding glucoamylase, GlaA) and secrete GlaA to high level. Results: An A. niger wild-type strain and a GlaA <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain,</b> containing multiple copies of the glaA gene, were cultivated under maltose-limited chemostat conditions (specific growth rate 0. 1 h- 1). Elevated glaA mRNA and extracellular GlaA levels in the <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain</b> were accompanied by elevated transcript levels from 772 genes and lowered transcript levels from 815 genes {{when compared to the}} wild-type strain. Using GO term enrichment analysis, four higher-order categories were identified in the up-regulated gene set: i) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane translocation, ii) protein glycosylation, iii) vesicle transport, and iv) ion homeostasis. Among these, about 130 genes had predicted functions for the passage of proteins through the ER and thos...|$|E
40|$|Regulators of the WhiB-like (wbl) {{family are}} playing {{important}} role in the complex regulation of metabolic and morphological differentiation in Streptomyces. In this study, we investigated the role of wblI, a member of this family, in the regulation of secondary metabolite production in Streptomyces lividans. The over-expression of wblI was correlated with an enhanced biosynthesis of undecylprodigiosin and actinorhodin and with a reduction of the biosynthesis of yCPK and of the grey spore pigment encoded by the whiE locus. Five regulatory targets of WblI were identified using in vitro formaldehyde crosslinking and confirmed by EMSA and qRT-PCR. These included the promoter regions of wblI itself, two genes of the ACT cluster (actVA 3 and the intergenic region between the divergently orientated genes actII- 1 and actII- 2) and that of wblA, another member of the Wbl family. Quantitative RTPCR analysis indicated that the expression of actVA 3 encoding a protein of unknown function {{as well as that of}} actII- 1, a TetR regulator repressing the expression of actII- 2, encoding the ACT transporter, were down regulated in the WblI <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain.</b> Consistently the expression of the transporter actII- 2 was up-regulated. The expression of WblA, that is known to have a negative impact on ACT biosynthesis, was strongly down regulated in the WblI <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain.</b> These data are consistent with the positive impact that WblI over-expression has on ACT biosynthesis. The latter might result from direct activation of ACT biosynthesis and export and from repression of the expression of WblA, a likely indirect, repressor of ACT biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Methylobacterium extorquens AM 1 is a facultative {{methylotroph}} {{capable of}} growth on both single-carbon and multi-carbon compounds. The ethylmalonyl-CoA (EMC) pathway {{is one of}} the central assimilatory pathways in M. extorquens during growth on C 1 and C 2 substrates. Previous studies had shown that ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase functioned as a control point during the transition from growth on succinate to growth on ethylamine. In this study we overexpressed ecm, phaA, mcmAB and found that upregulating ecm by expressing it from the strong constitutive mxaF promoter caused a 27 % decrease in growth rate on methanol compared to the strain with an empty vector. Targeted metabolomics demonstrated that most of the central intermediates in the ecm <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain</b> did not change significantly compared to the control strain; However, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) was 4. 5 -fold lower and 3 -hydroxybutyryl-CoA was 1. 6 -fold higher. Moreover, glyoxylate, a toxic and highly regulated essential intermediate, was determined to be 2. 6 -fold higher when ecm was overexpressed. These results demonstrated that overexpressing ecm can manipulate carbon flux through the EMC pathway and divert it from the carbon and energy storage product PHB, leading to an accumulation of glyoxylate. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomics discovered two unusual metabolites, alanine (Ala) -meso-diaminopimelic acid (mDAP) and Ala-mDAP-Ala, each over 45 -fold higher in the ecm <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain.</b> These two peptides were also found to be highly produced in a dose-dependent manner when glyoxylate was added to the control strain. Overall, this work has explained a direct association of ecm overexpression with glyoxylate accumulation up to a toxic level, which inhibits cell growth on methanol. This research provides useful insight for manipulating the EMC pathway for efficiently producing high-value chemicals in M. extorquens...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rhodopseudomonas palustris (R. palustris) is {{a purple}} non-sulfur anoxygenic phototrophic {{bacterium}} {{that belongs to}} the class of proteobacteria. It is capable of absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide and converting it to biomass via the process of photosynthesis and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Transketolase is a key enzyme involved in the CBB cycle. Here, we reveal the functions of transketolase isoforms I and II in R. palustris using a systems biology approach. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By measuring growth ability, we found that transketolase could enhance the autotrophic growth and biomass production of R. palustris. Microarray and real-time quantitative PCR revealed that transketolase isoforms I and II were involved in different carbon metabolic pathways. In addition, immunogold staining demonstrated that the two transketolase isoforms had different spatial localizations: transketolase I was primarily associated with the intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) but transketolase II was mostly distributed in the cytoplasm. Comparative proteomic analysis and network construction of transketolase over-expression and negative control (NC) strains revealed that protein folding, transcriptional regulation, amino acid transport and CBB cycle-associated carbon metabolism were enriched in the transketolase I <b>over-expressed</b> <b>strain.</b> In contrast, ATP synthesis, carbohydrate transport, glycolysis-associated carbon metabolism and CBB cycle-associated carbon metabolism were enriched in the transketolase II <b>over-expressed</b> <b>strain.</b> Furthermore, ATP synthesis assays showed {{a significant increase in}} ATP synthesis in the transketolase II <b>over-expressed</b> <b>strain.</b> A PEPCK activity assay showed that PEPCK activity was higher in transketolase <b>over-expressed</b> <b>strains</b> than in the negative control strain. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our results indicate that the two isoforms of transketolase in R. palustris could affect photoautotrophic growth through both common and divergent metabolic mechanisms...|$|R

Highly-coupled proteoliposomes were prepared containing purified transhydrogenase from beef-heart mitochondria. Using the same technique, the H+/H− ratio was close to 1. 0 for these proteoliposomes. It is suggested that the mechanistic H+/H− ratio is indeed unity, but that a low ratio is obtained in wild-type chromatophores because of inhomogeneity in the vesicle population...|$|R

Since the activity of pitrilysin is confined to substrates smaller than proteins, it can be described as an endopeptidase of the 'oligopeptidase' type, and like other such enzymes, it did not interact with alpha 2 -macroglobulin.

Using GO term enrichment analysis, four higher-order categories were identified in the up-regulated gene set: i) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane translocation, ii) protein glycosylation, iii) vesicle transport, and iv) ion homeostasis. Among these, about 130 genes had predicted functions for the passage of proteins through the ER and those genes included target genes of the HacA transcription factor that mediates the unfolded protein response (UPR), e. g. bipA, clxA, prpA, tigA and pdiA. In order to identify those genes that are important for high-level secretion of proteins by A. niger, we compared the transcriptome of the GlaA overexpression strain of A. niger with six other relevant transcriptomes of A. niger. Overall, 40 genes were found to have either elevated (from 36 genes) or lowered (from 4 genes) transcript levels under all conditions that were examined, thus defining the core set of genes important for ensuring high protein traffic through the secretory pathway. Conclusion We have defined the A. niger genes that respond to elevated secretion of GlaA and, furthermore, we have defined a core set of genes that appear to be involved more generally in the intensified traffic of proteins through the secretory pathway of A. niger. The consistent up-regulation of a gene encoding the acetyl-coenzyme A transporter suggests a possible role for transient acetylation to ensure correct folding of secreted proteins. </p...|$|E

Pure methylase is obtained at a yield of 30 mg per gm of cell paste. Measurements of the molecular weight and subunot stoichiometry show that the enzyme is a trimeric complex of 162 kDa consisting of two subunits of HsdlM (58 kOa) and one subunit of HsdS (46 kDa). The purified enzyme can methylate a DMA fragment bearing its cognate recognition sequence. Binding of the methylase to synthetic DNA fragments containing either the EcoR 124 recognition sequence GAAN 6 RT-CG, or the recognition sequence GAAN 7 RTCG of the related enzyme EcoRH 24 / 3, was followed by fluorescence competition assays and by gel retardation analysis.

RaxH is a typical transmembrane histidine protein kinase (HK), whereas RaxR is its concomitant response regulator (RR). Here, we report the isolation of soluble, active amounts of recombinant His-tagged full-length RaxH and RaxR following growth of Escherichia coli <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strains</b> {{in the presence of}} sorbitol and glycine betaine. Full-length His-RaxH showed similar autophosphorylation activities to that of a truncated version of the protein (His-t-RaxH), lacking the N-terminal transmembrane region. Transphosphorylation assays revealed that only full-length RaxH was able to induce phosphorylation of His-RaxR, indicating that the N-terminal region of RaxH may be required for transphosphorylation of RaxR. Using site-directed mutagenesis we also demonstrated that residues histidine 222 in RaxH and aspartate 51 in RaxR are essential for phosphorylation activities of these proteins.

We demonstrate that expression of SenX 3 -RegX 3 is controlled in response to growth conditions, although the absolute changes are small. Global gene expression profiling of a RegX 3 deletion strain and wild-type strain in different culture conditions (static, microaerobic, anaerobic), as well as in an <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain</b> identified a number of genes with changed expression patterns. Among those were genes previously identified as differentially regulated in aerobic culture, including ald (encoding alanine dehydrogenase) cyd,encoding a subunit of the cytochrome D ubiquinol oxidase, and gltA 1, encoding a citrate synthase. Promoter activity in the upstream regions of both cydB and gltA 1 was altered in the RegX 3 deletion strain. DNA-binding assays confirmed that RegX 3 binds to the promoter regions of ald, cydB and gltA 1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.

Moreover, AHL QS systems in P. putida strains are diverse in the type of AHLs they produce and the phenotypes that they regulate. Results We identified an unpaired LuxR solo (QS luxR homolog that occurs without the corresponding luxI homolog), which is highly conserved in both the AHL producing and non-AHL producing P. putida strains that we analyzed. In this study we report the cloning and functional characterization of this unpaired LuxR homolog designated PpoR. An AHL binding assay showed that PpoR protein binds to 3 -oxo-C 6 -HSL. Studies using a ppoR promoter- lacZ reporter fusion revealed that it exhibits stringent growth phase dependent expression. Functional interaction of PpoR with the endogenous complete AHL QS systems of P. putida WCS 358 (PpuI/R system) and PpoR was also investigated.

R. rubrum strains were bioengineered to overexpress individually or in various combinations, six PHA biosynthetic genes (phaC 1, phaA, phaB, phaC 2, phaC 3, and phaJ), and the resulting nine <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strains</b> were evaluated to assess the effect on PHA content, and the effect on growth. These experiments were designed to genetically evaluate: 1) the role of each apparently redundant PHA polymerase in determining PHA productivity; 2) identify the key gene(s) within the pha biosynthetic operon that determines PHA productivity; and 3) the role of phaJ to support PHA productivity. The result of overexpressing each PHA polymerase-encoding gene indicates that phaC 1 and phaC 2 are significant contributors to PHA productivity, whereas phaC 3 has little effect. Similarly, over-expressing individually or in combination the three PHA biosynthesis genes located in the pha operon indicates that phaB is the key determinant of PHA productivity. Finally, analogous experiments indicate that phaJ does not contribute significantly to PHA productivity. These bioengineering strains achieved PHA productivity of up to 30 % of dry biomass, which is approximately 2. 5 -fold higher than the non-engineered control strain, indicating the feasibility of using this approach to produce value added bio-based products...|$|R

Two hundred colonies that exhibited potential phytase activity were selected for further study.

40|$|In mammals, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway {{signaling}} {{is important}} for the growth and homeostasis of extracellular matrix, including basement membrane remodeling, scarring, and bone growth. A conserved BMP member in Caenorhabditis elegans, DBL- 1, regulates body length in a dose-sensitive manner. Loss of DBL- 1 pathway signaling also results in increased anesthetic sensitivity. However, the physiological basis of these pleiotropic phenotypes is largely unknown. We created a DBL- 1 <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain</b> and show that sensitivity to anesthetics is inversely related to the dose of DBL- 1. Using pharmacological, genetic analyses, and a novel dye permeability assay for live, microwave-treated animals, we confirm that DBL- 1 is required for the barrier function of the cuticle, a specialized extracellular matrix. We show that DBL- 1 signaling is required to prevent animals from forming tail-entangled aggregates in liquid. Stripping lipids off the surface of wild-type animals recapitulates this phenotype. Finally, we find that DBL- 1 signaling affects ultrastructure of the nematode cuticle in a dose-dependent manner, as surface lipid content and cuticular organization are disrupted in animals with genetically altered DBL- 1 levels. We propose that the lipid layer coating the nematode cuticle normally prevents tail entanglement, and that reduction of this layer by loss of DBL- 1 signaling promotes aggregation. This work provides a physiological mechanism that unites the DBL- 1 signaling pathway roles of not only body size regulation and drug responsiveness, but also the novel Hoechst 33342 staining and aggregation phenotypes, through barrier function, content, and organization of the cuticle...|$|E

It was found that to ensure arrays of high quality, protocols applying the arrays should include DNase treatment of RNA samples. additional RNA filtration purification steps, {{and the use of}} gene specific primers in the formation of labeled cDNA through reverse transcription. After implementing these procedures, the accuracy and reproducibility of the array data were validated. The microarrays were used to explore the effects of the over-expression of the key anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase and the use of different medium carbon source compositions, both of which have been shown to influence the yields of biomass on carbon and of lysine on biomass. Three different strains of C. glutamicum that were grown on six different minimal medium formulations that varied in their balance of glucose and lactate were assayed by isolating total mRNA samples from cultures in three different phases of growth and lysine production. Genes associated with glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway showed decreased transcript concentrations as the available carbon source was shifted from glucose to lactate, while those associated with the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate bypass demonstrated increased transcription. As the cultures stopped generating biomass and began generating lysine, mRNA of genes associated with lysine synthesis and export was measured at elevated concentrations. (cont.) Reduced gene expression trends seen for aspartokinase and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase suggest that the enzymes are bottlenecks to lysine production, particularly when pyruvate carboxylase is over-expressed and lactate is the available carbon source. This <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain</b> also had higher transcription levels of the genes of biotin synthesis. and lower transcription levels of the acyl-coA carboxylases dtsRl, dtsR 2, accC, and accD. Other results implied that malic enzyme is co-expressed with pyruvate carboxylase to better allow cultures grown on lactate to produce NADPH in the absence of significant pentose phosphate pathway flux. Also, the transcriptional and flux profiles of a pair of C. glutamicum strains grown on two different medium compositions of isotopically labeled glucose and lactate were determined simultaneously from the same set of actively growing and lysine-producing cultures. Flux maps {{for each of the four}} combinations of strain and medium {{were constructed}} using calculations derived from metabolite balances and GC-MS measurements of the isotopic distributions within biomass hydrolysates of the pseudo-steady-state cultures. Comparisons of the two sets of data showed that 19 of 28 pairs of flux and transcription measurements had trends with good agreement with one another. Different pathways of the metabolic network were found to be controlled via transcription in varying degrees. On average, the Embden- Meyerhof-Parnas pathway was shown to be less likely to be regulated though transcription than the pathways of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and central carbon anaplerosis. (cont.) In the split pathway available to the cells for producing lysine, the succinylation branch showed an increase in flux for only the case of a pyruvate carboxylase <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain</b> that was grown on lactate, while the alternate dehydrogenation branch showed a complementary decrease in flux. These flux changes were matched by changes in transcription that only occurred for the same culture and growth medium.

40|$|Overexpression of P-gp efflux pumps is {{believed}} to be responsible for multidrug resistance of mammalian cancer cells. Inhibition of these pumps is expected to increase the efficacy and decrease the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. The non-ionic triblock copolymer Pluronic P 85 is reported to inhibit mammalian P-gp efflux pumps, leading to higher intracellular drug concentrations. An analogous, well-characterized efflux transporter, Pdr 5 p, has been identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but the effect of Pluronic copolymers on this transporter has not been studied. We have examined the inhibitory effects of P 85 on three strains of S. cerevisiae: a pdr 5 deletion strain, a PDR 5 <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain,</b> and the PDR 5 wild-type strain using the hydrophilic Pdr 5 p substrate cycloheximide (CHX) as a model antifungal “drug”. Yeast cells were grown {{in the presence of a}} range of CHX (0 - 0. 3 mcg/ml) and P 85 (0 - 10 mg/ml). After incubation for 24 hrs at 30 °C, the ability of P 85 to inhibit Pdr 5 efflux activity was examined as a function of cellular growth (as determined by absorbance at 600 nm). Our results indicate that P 85 lowers the minimal inhibitory concentration of cycloheximide in both the PDR 5 wild-type and PDR 5 over-expressing strains, while having no effect on the pdr 5 deletion strain. This shows that P 85 can increase intracellular concentrations of CHX by inhibiting the Pdr 5 transporter. Our results in S. cerevisiae are consistent with reported observations in mammalian cells. Further investigations are being performed to (1) see if pluronics F 127, L 64, and L 81 also inhibit Pdr 5 using substrates CHX and itraconazole (ITZ), a hydrophobic antifungal drug, and (2) determine whether solubilization of ITZ in P 85 micelles influences its antifungal activity...|$|E

A marked bioaccumulation of Cd, As, Hg and Zn was observed in the <b>strain</b> <b>over-expressing</b> MBP-MT in the cytoplasm, whereas Cu was accumulated to higher levels when MBP-MT was over-expressed in the periplasm. Metal export systems may {{also play a role}} in this bioaccumulation. To illustrate this, we over-expressed MBP-MT in the cytoplasm of two mutant strains of E. coli affected in metal export. The first, deficient in the transporter ZntA described to export numerous divalent metal ions, showed increasing quantities of Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb being bioaccumulated. The second, strain LF 20012, deficient in As export, showed that As was bioaccumulated in the form of arsenite. Furthermore, high quantities of accumulated metals, chelated by MBP-MT in the cytoplasm, conferred greater metal resistance levels to the cells in the presence of added toxic metals, such as Cd or Hg, while other metals showed toxic effects when the export systems were deficient. The <b>strain</b> <b>over-expressing</b> MBP-MT in the cytoplasm, in combination, with disruption of metal export systems, could be used to develop strategies for bioremediation...|$|R
40|$|Many {{strains of}} Acinetobacter baumannii have been {{described}} as being able to form biofilm. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) control gene expression in many regulatory circuits in bacteria. The aim of the present work was to provide a global description of the sRNAs produced both by planktonic and biofilm-associated (sessile) cells of A. baumannii ATCC 17978, and to compare the corresponding gene expression profiles to identify sRNAs molecules associated to biofilm formation and virulence. sRNA was extracted from both planktonic and sessile cells and reverse transcribed. cDNA was subjected to 454 -pyrosequencing using the GS-FLX Titanium chemistry. The global analysis of the small RNA transcriptome revealed different sRNA expression patterns in planktonic and biofilm associated cells, with some of the transcripts only expressed or repressed in sessile bacteria. A total of 255 sRNAs were detected, with 185 of them differentially expressed in the different types of cells. A total of 9 sRNAs were expressed only in biofilm cells, while the expression of other 21 coding regions were repressed only in biofilm cells. Strikingly, the expression level of the sRNA 13573 was 120 times higher in biofilms than in planktonic cells, an observation that prompted us to further investigate the biological role of this non-coding transcript. Analyses of an isogenic mutant and <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strains</b> revealed that the sRNA 13573 gene is involved in biofilm formation and attachment to A 549 human alveolar epithelial cells. The present work serves as a basis for future studies examining the complex regulatory network that regulate biofilm biogenesis and attachment to eukaryotic cells in A. baumannii ATCC 17978...|$|R

A series of structurally-related low molecular mass compounds was synthesized using combinatorial chemistry of a cyclobutene-dione (squarile) core. These compounds were screened for their inhibition of plasma membrane Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters responsible for efflux pump-mediated drug {{resistance in the}} fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that specifically overexpress the MFS pump CaMdr 1 p or the ABC transporter CaCdr 1 p were used in primary screens and counterscreens, respectively, and to detect inhibition of glucose-dependent Nile Red efflux. Efflux pump inhibition, activity as pump substrates and antifungal activity against yeast and clinical isolates expressing efflux pumps were determined using agarose diffusion susceptibility assays and checkerboard liquid chemosensitization assays with fluconazole. The screen identified five structurally-related compounds which inhibited CaMdr 1 p. Two compounds, A and B, specifically chemosensitized AD/CaMDR 1 to FLC in a pH-dependent fashion and acted synergistically with FLC in checkerboard liquid MIC assays but compound B had limited solubility. Compound A chemosensitized to FLC the azole-resistant C. albicans strain FR 2, which over-expresses CaMdr 1 p, inhibited Nile Red efflux mediated by CaMdr 1 p but not CaCdr 1 p and was not toxic to cultured human cells. A minor growth-inhibitory effect of B on AD/CaMDR 1, but not on AD/CaCDR 1 and AD/CaCDR 2, indicated that compound B may be a substrate of these transporters. The related compound F {{was found to have}} antifungal activity against the three pump <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strains</b> used in the study.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{filamentous}} actinomycete Microbispora ATCC-PTA- 5024 {{produces the}} lantibiotic NAI- 107, {{which is an}} antibiotic peptide effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. In actinomycetes, antibiotic production {{is often associated with}} a physiological differentiation program controlled by a complex regulatory and metabolic network that may be elucidated by the integration of genomic, proteomic and bioinformatic tools. Accordingly, an extensive evaluation of the proteomic changes associated with NAI- 107 production was performed on Microbispora ATCC-PTA- 5024 by combining two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and gene ontology approaches. RESULTS: Microbispora ATCC-PTA- 5024 cultivations in a complex medium were characterized by stages of biomass accumulation (A) followed by biomass yield decline (D). NAI- 107 production started at 90 h (A stage), reached a maximum at 140 h (D stage) and decreased thereafter. To reveal patterns of differentially represented proteins associated with NAI- 107 production onset and maintenance, differential proteomic analyses were carried-out on biomass samples collected: i) before (66 h) and during (90 h) NAI- 107 production at A stage; ii) during three time-points (117, 140, and 162 h) at D stage characterized by different profiles of NAI- 107 yield accumulation (117 and 140 h) and decrement (162 h). Regulatory, metabolic and unknown-function proteins, were identified and functionally clustered, revealing that nutritional signals, regulatory cascades and primary metabolism shift-down trigger the accumulation of protein components involved in nitrogen and phosphate metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis/maturation, lipid metabolism, osmotic stress response, multi-drug resistance, and NAI- 107 transport. The stimulating role on physiological differentiation of a TetR-like regulator, originally identified in this study, was confirmed by the construction of an <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain.</b> Finally, the possible role of cellular response to membrane stability alterations and of multi-drug resistance ABC transporters as additional self-resistance mechanisms toward the lantibiotic was confirmed by proteomic and confocal microscopy experiments on a Microbispora ATCC-PTA- 5024 lantibiotic-null producer strain which was exposed to an externally-added amount of NAI- 107 during growth. CONCLUSION: This study provides a net contribution to the elucidation of the regulatory, metabolic and molecular patterns controlling physiological differentiation in Microbispora ATCC-PTA- 5024, supporting the relevance of proteomics in revealing protein players of antibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of cyclic AMP (cAMP), nearly 50 {{years ago by}} Sutherland radically altered the appreciation of metabolic regulation. Since then the presence of cAMP and its tremendous physiological impact has been demonstrated in many prokaryotic systems. In fact, virulence mechanisms of several pathogens known today exploit cAMP dependent pathways. Interestingly the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv, the causative agent of tuberculosis, encodes as many as 16 adenylyl cyclases (enzymes that convert ATP to 3 ’, 5 ’-cAMP) and 10 cyclic-nucleotide binding proteins. Recent reports show that bacterial-derived cAMP manipulates host signaling for bacterial survival, suggesting an important role for cAMP in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. A large number of non-pathogenic species of mycobacteria also share and conserve several of these cAMP metabolism genes, suggesting that cAMP is not only important for pathogenesis but also may play a critical physiological role in the genus. The work carried out in this thesis aims at {{a better understanding of}} the role of cAMP by studying the adenylyl cyclases and cyclic AMP receptor proteins (CRPs) from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a non-pathogenic member of the genus. Intracellular cAMP levels in a cell are precisely maintained by modulating the activities of the adenylyl cyclases (cAMP synthesising enzymes), the phosphodiesterases (cAMP hydrolysing enzymes) and the secretion machinery, if any. To assess the role of cAMP in mycobacteria, cAMP levels were measured in M. smegmatis during growth and under various stress conditions. The results show that cAMP levels peak at log phase of growth and decline thereafter. Under acidic conditions or on perturbing the cell-wall, cellular cAMP levels are altered, which indicate a possible role of cAMP in stress adaptation. Earlier work in our laboratory has led to the identification of multiple adenylyl cyclases in the mycobacterial genomes. These cyclases are similar in sequence to the mammalian enzymes and several of them have been shown to be active in vitro displaying a diverse range of biochemical properties. The M. smegmatis genome encodes 10 adenylyl cyclase-like genes. In order to understand the role of cAMP in M. smegmatis, individual cyclases were analysed for their biochemical properties and physiological functions. The work presented in this thesis is concerned with the functional characterization of MSMEG_ 3578 and MSMEG_ 3780, two of the several adenylyl cyclases from M. smegmatis. MSMEG_ 3578 encodes for a protein that comprises two transmembrane domains, an extracellular receptor-like domain, a membrane anchoring HAMP domain and an intracellular cyclase domain. The cyclase domain is closely related to mammalian cyclases but lacks the canonical residues that are critical for the catalysis of class III cyclases. Interestingly, the stop codon of this gene overlaps with the start codon of the downstream gene, MSMEG_ 3579 (a putative cyclic nucleotide gated mechanosensitive ion channel), suggesting a functional link between the two genes. The conservation of this gene pair across the mycobacterial genus indicates the importance of this putative receptor-effector pair in the physiology of mycobacteria. Additionally, microarray analysis by various groups have shown that this gene pair in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is differentially regulated in conditions that mimic stress the bacteria may experience during infection. In order to ascertain the physiological role of MSMEG_ 3578, a knock-out M. smegmatis strain was generated and tested for growth and cAMP defects. The knock-out strain showed growth and cAMP profiles similar to the wild-type strain. Over-expression of MSMEG_ 3578 in M. smegmatis resulted in a significant rise in cAMP levels. Interestingly, over-expression of the MSMEG_ 3578 adenylyl cyclase in E. coli did not lead to an elevation in cAMP levels indicating that other mycobacterial proteins may be required for the activity of MSMEG_ 3578 in vivo. In agreement with this, the purified adenylyl cyclase domain of MSMEG_ 3578 was found to be biochemically inactive in vitro. Additionally, the <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strain</b> has altered colony morphology as compared to the wild type strain. Perturbation of cAMP levels by over-expression of other cyclases also leads to a similar colony morphology phenotype, indicating the phenotype to be controlled by cAMP in general rather than by a specific cyclase in the cell. MSMEG_ 3780 is a highly conserved, biochemically active adenylyl cyclase, speculated to play a house-keeping function in M. smegmatis. Its orthologs from M. tuberculosis (Rv 1647) and M. leprae (ML 1399) have been biochemically characterized earlier in our laboratory. To unravel the role of this gene in vivo, the ∆MSMEG_ 3780 strain was tested for growth and cAMP defects under various conditions. The deletion strain did not show any difference in growth rate or morphology when compared to the wild-type strain. However it showed a reduction in intracellular cAMP levels at the log-phase of growth. Reintroduction of the MSMEG_ 3780 gene in the deletion strain restored cAMP to wild-type levels, thus indicating a crucial role for this adenylyl cyclase in the maintenance of intracellular cAMP levels during logarithmic growth. In order to investigate the regulation of the MSMEG_ 3780 gene, its promoter activity was tested under various stress-conditions. Acid-stress specifically resulted in the repression of the MSMEG_ 3780 promoter activity, a condition which also leads to a decrease in cAMP levels in the cells. Further evidence for the susceptibility of the MSMEG_ 3780 gene to acid-stress was obtained when the ∆MSMEG_ 3780 strain failed to reduce intracellular cAMP content upon sustained acid-stress conditions. Since Rv 1647 shares similar biochemical properties with MSMEG_ 3780 and can also heterodimerize with the MSMEG_ 3780 protein in vitro, it was interesting to test whether the M. tuberculosis ortholog could functionally complement MSMEG_ 3780. To assess this, a complement strain was generated that contained the Rv 1647 gene under the control of MSMEG_ 3780 promoter, integrated into the genome of ∆MSMEG_ 3780 strain. Rv 1647 protein was able to restore the cAMP phenotype seen on acid stress as well as the cAMP levels in the mutant strain at the log phase of growth. This study indicated the role of cAMP and MSMEG_ 3780 in acid adaptation and also suggested a non-redundancy of adenylyl cyclases in mycobacteria, where different individual cyclases may have unique functions in the cells. Since Rv 1647 could complement the cAMP defective phenotype in ∆MSMEG_ 3780, this suggests functional parallels between the proteins from the two species. Bacterial adaptation to environmental stress is brought about by a rapid change in its gene expression profile. Cyclic AMP plays an important role by binding to and activating a transcriptional factor, cAMP receptor protein or CRP. We have identified two CRPs from M. smegmatis, viz., MSMEG_ 0539 and MSMEG_ 6189 that possess high similarity at the amino acid level (78 % overall sequence identity). The CRP ortholog from M. tuberculosis, Rv 3676 has been characterized structurally, biochemically and functionally earlier. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that CRPs in M. smegmatis were present during all phases of growth. Both the CRPs were cloned, expressed and shown to bind cAMP. Since the DNA binding domains of Rv 3676 and the two M. smegmatis CRPs are nearly identical, the CRPs from M. smegmatis were predicted to bind similar target sequences. Interestingly, a CRP site was identified in the promoter of the MSMEG_ 3780 gene, suggesting a possible feed-forward or feed-back loop, where the enzymatic product of the adenylyl cyclase now governs its own gene expression. We performed Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assays (EMSAs) with M. smegmatis lysates to show that CRP binds to the MSMEG_ 3780 promoter at the CRP site. Subsequent Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed that CRP binding to the MSMEG_ 3780 promoter occurred in vivo. To investigate the role of CRP in the regulation of the MSMEG_ 3780 gene, luciferase reporter assays with the wild-type and CRP site mutant promoters were carried out. Results suggest that CRP regulates the MSMEG_ 3780 gene under osmotic stress. However, CRP did not play any role in basal expression of MSMEG_ 3780 during growth. To assess which CRP of the two is functionally linked to the MSMEG_ 3780 promoter, we carried out a footprint assay with purified CRPs. It was intriguing to note that both the CRPs were in fact able to bind the promoter albeit under different conditions. Whereas MSMEG_ 6189 bound the promoter both in the presence and absence of cAMP, MSMEG_ 0539 bound the promoter only in the presence of cAMP. MSMEG_ 6189 thus deviates from the accepted CRP paradigm that seeks an absolute requirement of cAMP for specific DNA binding. The present study identifies cAMP as an important stress signal in M. smegmatis. Using MSMEG_ 3780 as a model gene, the role of cAMP in mycobacteria was studied. The two divergent CRPs that were characterized may function and dictate cAMP-mediated and perhaps independent functions in cells. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence for the important role of cAMP in the general physiology and stress adaptation in M. smegmatis...|$|E

The merP <b>over-expressed</b> <b>strain</b> harboring Gram-positive merP had 142, 84 and 33 % increase for Cu 2 +, Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + adsorption capability, respectively, over that of merP-free host cells.

Multi-metal biosorption experiments {{showed that the}} affinity of metal biosorption by the recombinant strains decreased {{in the order of}} Cu > Pb > Cd. Peptides containing the amino acid sequences of metal-binding motif for both heterogeneous MerP proteins were chemically synthesized and covalently immobilized on Celite carriers to examine their metal-binding ability.

These results may show that MerP with adjoining cysteines seems to be more effective in binding metals than that with two separated cysteines. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I was testing two {{established}} ageing theories in C. elegans. One {{was about the}} role of oxidative damage, induced via the Fenton reaction, in C. elegans ageing. In my other project I was investigating the role of sirtuins, NAD+- dependent histone deacetylases, in ageing. The oxidative damage theory predicts that reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a main cause of ageing. Iron can generate ROS via the Fenton reaction, indicating that iron homeostasis might protect against aging. Ferritins, iron storage proteins, regulate the iron concentration by storing excess iron. C. elegans has two ferritin genes, ftn- 1 and ftn- 2. Long-lived daf- 2 mutants show an increase in ftn- 1 mRNA levels, indicating that ftn- 1 might contribute to longevity assurance. I tested the role of ftn- 1 in longevity assurance and found that reduced ftn- 1 levels did not affect daf- 2 mutant longevity or wildtype life span, nor did over-expression of ftn- 1 increase life span. Changing iron levels via ftn- 1 over-expression or iron chelator treatment led to resistance to oxidative stress, but had no effect on ageing. Overall, our results show that ferritin does not contribute to longevity assurance, and imply that oxidative damage, induced via the Fenton reaction is not a determinant of aging in C. elegans. Over-expression of sirtuins has been reported to increase life span in yeast, C. elegans and Drosophila. Rumours and contradictory findings caused us to re-test the effects of sirtuin over-expression on ageing. We found that backcrossing the two mainly used sir- 2. 1 <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strains</b> LG 100 and NL 3909, to wildtype background abolished the increase in life span, without changing the over-expression of sir- 2. 1.

In this study, two hydrogenase subunit <b>over-expressed</b> <b>strains,</b> K. oxytoca HP 1 /hycE and K. oxytoca HP 1 /hycG, were constructed to further enhance K. oxytoca hydrogen production. Hydrogenase activity, hydrogen molar yield (HMY) and HPR from glucose under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were assessed for the recombinant strains. In K. oxytoca HP 1 /hycE, the HMY, HPR and hydrogenase activity under anaerobic condition was increased by 90. 5 %, 93. 5 % and 2. 10 fold, relative to the wild-type strain. In K. oxytoca HP 1 /hycG, the respective increases were 31. 7 %, 33. 3 %, 1. 55 fold, relative to the wild-type. Thus, over-expression of hydrogenase subunit may significantly enhance hydrogen production in dark-fermentation strains. The anaerobic HMY of K. oxytoca HP 1 /hycE reached 3. 43 mol-H- 2 /mol-glucose. Furthermore, under oxygen stress conditions, the natural hydrogen production capacity of wild-type K. oxytoca HP 1 was enhanced by over-expression of its hydrogenase subunits. Next, the hycE or hycG gene from K. oxytoca HP 1 was transformed into E. coli DH- 5 alpha to analyze the oxygen-tolerant role of the hydrogenase subunits. Under oxygen stress the recombinant strains E. coli DH- 5 alpha/hycE and E. coli DH- 5 alpha/hycG were capable of hydrogen production, unlike the wild-type strain.

40|$|The ampA gene encodes a {{secreted}} {{protein that}} modulates cell adhesion, actin polymerization, endocytosis, and cell migration. AmpA is secreted into the supernatant during development, and remains cell associated during growth. AmpA loss in growing cells {{results in an}} increase in cell adhesion, and a reduction in F actin. Over expression of AmpA reduces adhesion and increases F actin. As a result of these changes in the cytoskeleton and in adhesion, I have shown AmpA influences cell migration. AmpA knockout cells are defective in migration on top of agar compared to wild type. AmpA over expressing cells migrate better than wild type on top of agar. This defect in the knockout can be rescued by placing the cells in a 3 D environment where they migrate under agar. Knockout cells migrate better than wild type under these conditions and over expressing cells migrate about the same as wild type. In order to visualize actin dynamics in live cells, wild type, AmpA KO and AmpA <b>over-expressing</b> <b>strains</b> were created containing an actin binding domain fused to GFP. In stationary cells, over expressers make more actin rich endosomal cups, which form repeatedly in the same area of the membrane, leading to an increased rate of endocytosis. Knockout cells have significantly reduced F-actin, but make relatively normal endosomal cups. In order to determine how AmpA affects these processes, localization analyses were performed. Immuno-fluorescence analysis using AmpA tagged to the Tap tag and to mRFP show that AmpA is localized in possible vesicles throughout the cell and also show some localization with calnexin, an ER marker, at discrete sites surrounding the nucleus. These sites co-localize with p 25, a marker for an endosomal recycling compartment. AmpA can also be found at the cell periphery under certain staining conditions. Some vesicles should be secretory vesicles, but results indicate that AmpA on the surface is endocytosed back into the cells. This indicates that AmpA is likely bound to the membrane through an interaction with its receptor where it could possibly regulate cell adhesion and actin polymerization. It is actively endocytosed and proceeds through the membrane recycling pathway...|$|R

However, there is increasing evidence for clinical therapy failures in patients suggesting the existence of drug resistance in these classes of drug.

In order to begin to understand the mechanisms of resistance, we undertook a difference-gel electrophoresis (DIGE) approach combined with mass spectrometry to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in sulfadiazine-resistance strains of the parasite. Naturally resistant strains TgA 103001 (Type I), TgH 32006 (Type II) and TgH 32045 (Type II variant) were compared to sensitive strains RH (Type I) and ME- 49 (Type II) using DIGE and the modulated proteins analyzed using LC–MS/MS. In total, 68 differentially expressed protein spots were analyzed by mass spectrometer and 31 unique proteins, including four hypothetical proteins, were identified. Among the differentially expressed proteins, 44 % were <b>over-expressed</b> in resistant <b>strains</b> and 56 % were <b>over-expressed</b> in sensitive <b>strains.</b> The virulence-associated rhoptry protein, ROP 2 A, was found in greater abundance in both naturally resistant Type II strains TgH 32006 and TgH 32045 compared to the sensitive strain ME- 49.
