Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not believe {{in the existence of}} any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E

Finally, 3.2 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive workplace accommodations have had their disability since birth compared to 5.2 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive accommodations.

There is some slight variation; for example, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have a flexible schedule {{are more likely to have}} a bachelor’s degree or higher than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> receive help with transportation, have a personal care attendant or personal assistant, or receive help with child or family care.

25|$|People with SPD are {{sometimes}} sexually apathetic, {{though they do}} not typically suffer from anorgasmia. Their preference to remain alone and detached may cause their need for sex {{to appear to be}} less than that <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have SPD. Sex often causes individuals with SPD to feel that their personal space is being violated, and they commonly feel that masturbation or sexual abstinence is preferable to the emotional closeness they must tolerate when having sex.

25|$|A {{very small}} number of Modern Orthodox congregations accept some such arguments, but very few Orthodox congregations or {{authorities}} accept all or even most of them.

JOFA refers to congregations generally accepting such arguments as Partnership Minyanim.

25|$|In {{the case}} of nudity in front <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not {{normally}} occupy the same private space, that will usually depend on whether the outsider is comfortable with the nudity and whether the nudity is reciprocated, as in {{the case of}} social nudism. Social nudism may take place in any private social context, such as at one's home with friends or with acquaintances at a nudist facility or event, such as a naturist club, community center, resort or other facility. To generate an atmosphere of fun at a social gathering and lighten the social atmosphere, or to heighten the sexual atmosphere and ease those present into some state of nudity, organisers of a social gathering may organise party games, which may involve some level of nudity, such as strip games, for example strip poker, which can be played by single-sex groups or by mixed groups.|$|E
25|$|Traditional fixed {{markets in}} the city have been {{steadily}} losing their client base.

Over fifty percent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> shop at these markets are over the age of thirty five, with younger and more affluent shoppers preferring supermarkets, which are generally cleaner and better maintained. Markets that have had supermarkets or other chain stores open nearby have seen salves drop as much as fifty percent. This has led to the abandonment of many fixed market stalls and about twenty percent of these {{markets in the}} Mexico City area have been abandoned altogether. Although still important, the percentage of foodstuffs sold through basic markets has declined to only about twenty percent in Mexico City. Of the 317 markets, 248 offer fresh produce. Many stands have been replaced by those selling prepared foods such as tortas, juices, unlicensed movies and music, and other items.|$|E
25|$|The Fard Salah {{are all of}} the {{compulsory}} Muslim prayers - {{the five}} daily prayers, {{as well as the}} Friday prayer (Salat al-Jumu'ah) and the Eid prayers (Eid prayers). Non-performance of any these prayers renders one a non-Muslim according to the stricter Hanbali madhhab of Sunni Islam, while the other Sunni madhhabs simply consider doing so a major sin. However, all four madhhabs agree by consensus that denial of the compulsory status of these prayers invalidates the faith <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> so, rendering them non-Muslim. Fardh prayers (as with all fard actions) are further classed as fard al-ayn (obligation of the self) and fard al-kifayah (obligation of sufficiency). Fard al-Ayn are actions considered obligatory on individuals, for which the individual will be held to account if the actions are neglected. Fard al-Kifayah are actions considered obligatory on the Muslim community at large, so that if some people within the community carry it out no Muslim is considered blameworthy, but if no one carries it out, all incur a collective punishment.|$|E

500|$|It {{is thought}} that Laverdure's actions may have been {{influenced}} by a school of thought, advocated by General Charles Mangin, that bold movements would intimidate the North African tribes into submission. [...] This school of thought was critical of Lyautey's campaign of negotiation backed up by the threat of military power, arguing that it cost too many casualties and that a bolder commander should be appointed instead. [...] Mangin's opinions had many advocates among the French officers of the colonial forces in Morocco, keen to end the war quickly and transfer to the Western Front, were praised by newspapers, books and journal articles in France and had the support of part of the Chamber of Deputies. [...] Lyautey believed that he had to constantly battle against this school of thought and could not hope to defeat the men who followed it as they were [...] "self-satisfied with its infallibility and convinced of the pitiful inferiority <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not submit to it blindly".|$|E
500|$|Jim Rickards, in his 2011 book [...] {{argues that}} the {{consequences}} of the Fed's attempts to prop up economic growth could be devastating for American national security. Though Rickard's book is largely concerned with currency war as competitive devaluation, it uses a broader definition of the term, classing policies that cause inflation as currency war. Such policies can be seen as metaphorical warfare against those who have monetary assets in favor <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not, but unless the effects of rising inflation on international trade are offset by a devaluation, inflationary policies tend to make a country's exports less competitive against foreign countries. In their review of the book, Publishers Weekly said: [...] "Rickards's first book is an outgrowth of his contributions and a later two-day war game simulation held at the Applied Physics Laboratory's Warfare Analysis Laboratory. He argues that a financial attack against the U.S. could destroy confidence in the dollar. In Rickards's view, the Fed's policy of quantitative easing by lessening confidence in the dollar, may lead to chaos in global financial markets." [...] Kirkus Reviews said: [...] "In Rickards' view, the world is currently going through a third currency war ("CWIII") based on competitive devaluations. CWII occurred in the 1960s and '70s and culminated in Nixon's decision to take the dollar off the gold standard. CWI followed World War I and included the 1923 German hyperinflation and Roosevelt's devaluation of the dollar against gold in 1933. Rickards demonstrates that competitive devaluations are a race to the bottom, and thus instruments of a sort of warfare. CWIII, he writes, is characterized by the Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing, which he ascribes to what he calls [...] "extensive theoretical work" [...] on depreciation, negative interest rates and stimulation achieved {{at the expense of other}} countries. He offers a view of how the continued depreciation and devaluation of the dollar will ultimately lead to a collapse, which he asserts will come about through a widespread abandonment of a worthless inflated instrument. Rickards also provides possible scenarios for the future, including collaboration among a variety of currencies, emergence of a world central bank and a forceful U.S. return to a gold standard through an emergency powers–based legal regime. The author emphasizes that these questions are matters of policy and choice, which can be different." ...|$|E
