5|$|Walton's last {{work of the}} 1940s was {{his music}} for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On {{the advice of the}} BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's {{relations}} with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies {{his or her}} decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister. The judge must also report to the Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his or her agent. If a judge intends to report {{a person who was}} neither a party to the proceedings nor a candidate claiming he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have been declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him. However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to his or her orders and without his or her sanction or connivance, or that of his or her election agents, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, the election is not void.|$|E

25|$|The first defender should {{usually be}} the player {{closest to the}} {{opponent}} holding possession, but needs {{to be at the}} defending side of him in order to do an effective job. He <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> keep a distance of about 2 metres, although the ideal distance will vary with each situation. The point is to pressure the opponent as much as possible without giving him a large possibility of a dribble. As a dribble isn't as dangerous when the defending team is well organised, the distance may be shorter in these cases. Analogously, the distance should be increased if the defence is poorly organised.|$|E

25|$|A {{party to}} a {{proceeding}} {{should have the}} right to access documentation which had been produced by the other party to the proceedings. It would be wrong if such documents were not shown to the other party at all. If a party to the proceedings needs time to study or make copies of the documents, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be allowed to do so. However, as the High Court opined in Teng Cheng Sin v. Law Fay Yuen (2003), if a party does not request for copies of documents or for time to study the documents, a complaint of this nature will carry much less weight.|$|E
25|$|Sex {{education}} may be taught informally, {{such as when}} someone receives information from {{a conversation with a}} parent, friend, religious leader, or through the media. It may also be delivered through sex self-help authors, magazine advice columnists, sex columnists, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when schools or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person what he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others. Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.|$|E

In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. In response to passing the legislation, Clinton stated that [...] "when someone is a victim, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> {{be at the center of}} the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in." ...|$|E

500|$|Rothbard {{consistently}} {{advocated for}} {{abolition of the}} subpoena power, court attendance, contempt of court powers, coerced testimony of witnesses, compulsory jury duty, and the bail system, arguing that all these functions of the judiciary were violations of natural rights and American common law. He instead advocated that until a defendant is convicted he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not be held in prison or jails, writing [...] "except in those cases where the criminal has been caught red-handed and where a certain presumption of guilt therefore exists, {{it is impossible to}} justify any imprisonment before conviction, let alone before trial. And even when someone is caught red-handed, there is an important reform that needs to be instituted to keep the system honest: subjecting the police and the other authorities to the same law as everyone else. If everyone is supposed to be subject to the same criminal law, then exempting the authorities from that law gives them a legal license to commit continual aggression. The policeman who apprehends a criminal and arrests him, and the judicial and penal authorities who incarcerate him before trial and conviction—all should be subject to the universal law." [...] Rothbard argued that police who make wrongful arrests or indictments should be charged with kidnapping.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example is}} the use of actuarial models to assess the risk of sex offense recidivism.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} non-maleficence is {{embodied}} by the phrase, [...] "first, do no harm," [...] or the Latin, primum non nocere. Many consider {{that should be}} the main or primary consideration (hence primum): that it is more important not to harm your patient, than to do them good. This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no (or only acceptable levels of) harm. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, [...] "The treatment was a success, but the patient died." [...] It is not only more important to do no harm than to do good; {{it is also important to}} know how likely it is that your treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful—he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.|$|E
