40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss our {{insights}} into several key problems in <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Rectangle <b>Bands</b> (RRBs). We have combined three independent sets of observations {{in order to try}} to define the constraints guiding <b>the</b> <b>bands.</b> We provide a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bands</b> and review <b>the</b> evidence for a molecular origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bands.</b> <b>The</b> extent, composition, and possible absorption effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bands</b> are discussed. Comparison spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strongest <b>band</b> obtained at three different spectral resolutions suggests that an intrinsic line width of individual rotational lines can be deduced. Spectroscopic models of several relatively simple molecules were examined in order to investigate where the current data are weak. Suggestions are made for future studies to enhance our understanding of these enigmatic bands. status: publishe...|$|R
