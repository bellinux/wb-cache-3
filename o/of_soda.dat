5|$|In 1920, {{the demand}} for soft drinks {{significantly}} increased {{as a result of}} the prohibition against alcohol in the United States that began on January 29, 1920. The Grapico product was so successful by 1920, that Grapico specifically was listed in the Louisiana law among generic items, Coca-Cola, and RC Cola as items to be taxed: Section 22 of Act No. 233 of 1920, which read:That all persons, associations of persons, firms and corporations engaged in the sale <b>of</b> <b>soda</b> water, ice cream, confections, soda pop, Coca Cola, Chero-Cola, Grapico or other similar soft drinks or beverages or refreshments, shall pay license based on the gross annual sales, and such licenses are hereby fixed and graded as follows.|$|E
5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate <b>of</b> <b>soda,</b> is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E
5|$|After {{donating}} {{money to}} public television, Marge receives complimentary ballet tickets. She asks Homer to accompany her, {{and much to}} Marge's surprise he agrees, confusing ballet with a circus. On {{the day of the}} ballet, however, he inadvertently gets his arm stuck in a vending machine while trying to steal a can <b>of</b> <b>soda</b> from it and then gets his other arm stuck in a candy machine, and so is unable to attend the ballet. In disbelief about Homer's story, Marge invites her neighbor, Ruth Powers to attend with her. They both enjoy themselves and arrange to go out again the next night. Marge and Ruth's friendship annoys Homer, who feels Marge should be spending time with him instead. However, ignoring Homer's protests, Marge and Ruth visit bars and clubs in Springfield, and Ruth later shows Marge how to use a pistol.|$|E

This strategy is effective at getting customers to co-create the product, and engaging customers with the brand.|$|R

In 1925, the German Bayer became part of IG Farben, a conglomerate of former dye companies; IG Farben's brands of Aspirin and, in Latin America, the caffeinated Cafiaspirina (co-managed with Sterling Products) competed with less expensive aspirins such as Geniol.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the effect <b>of</b> caustic <b>soda</b> on {{the intensity of}} gassing {{in the production of}} non-autoclaved aerated concrete. It has been found out that adding 0. 8 and 1. 0 percent <b>of</b> caustic <b>soda</b> increases the amount of released hydrogen by 20 - 40 %. This is due to caustic soda increasing the alkalinity of the medium, which intensifies gassing. Exceeding the optimum amounts <b>of</b> caustic <b>soda</b> rapidly increases the elastic strength and worsens the ‘swelling’ of the AC mixture. Physico-mechanical tests of aerated concrete samples showed a considerable improvement in properties compared to the control composition...|$|R
