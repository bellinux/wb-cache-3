5000|$|As {{telecommunication}} services are highly regulated and billing systems are complicated, an industry emerged as did standards (EMI) {{to simplify the}} process of taking the third party telephone records and placing those charges onto the 1400 US LEC bills. In the 1990s there were many long distance telecommunication providers, <b>operator</b> <b>assisted</b> telecommunication <b>service</b> providers, IXCs, and so forth who wanted to avert or defer the cost of implementing a costly billing system of their own, and by doing so, get to market more quickly. IXCs also understood that a single bill to the customer was desired. Companies like ZPDI, USBI, Integretell, Enhanced Billing Services (ESBI), OAN, ACI and many others emerged to reduce the integration complexities of these many to many relationships.|$|R

40|$|A method using {{optimal control}} results as input to <b>operator</b> <b>assist</b> systems, {{automatic}} functions and autonomous construction machine control is presented. This method complements the vast research within autonomy {{to achieve the}} most fuel efficient solution from results that are already available from concept evaluation and system optimization in early development. The optimal control results are validated and compared to an extensive empirical study to ensure realization in real applications. The optimal control method is based on dynamic programming and finds the global optimum in regards to fuel efficiency [ton/l] at a given productivity [ton/h]. The wheel loader is used as an example due to the complex nature of the system, where the driveline and working hydraulics must work together throughout the work cycle. The main focus in this paper is how to transfer results from the optimal control calculations done offline, with high computational power, to algorithms {{that can be used}} online in <b>operator</b> <b>assist</b> systems, automatic functions and autonomous machine control. The primary result is that the method and algorithms presented in this paper works. The secondary results is that the optimal control solution shows around 15 % higher fuel efficiency compared to the highest fuel efficiency measured among real operators in the extensive empirical measurement. The operator with the highest measured fuel efficiency has 20 - 30 % higher average fuel efficiency than the fleet implying that the optimal control results, if used in <b>operator</b> <b>assist</b> systems, automatic functions and autonomous machine control, can increase the average fleet fuel efficiency by up to 35 - 45 %, depending on operator and application...|$|R

A modern LTL semantics that applies for both finite and infinite traces is considered. We introduce specialized operators (syntax and semantic) that help specifying properties over propositional scopes, where each scope constitute a subset of states that satisfy a propositional logic formula. These <b>operators</b> <b>assist</b> the user in specifying the properties more easily and intuitively. I...|$|R

We design two new feature descriptors for higher feature descriptiveness, namely the rotation-invariant Gabor-local binary patterns (RGLBP) texture descriptor and multi-coordinate histogram of oriented gradients (MCHOG) gradient descriptor. Each image patch is then labeled based on its feature approximation from reference image patches...|$|R
