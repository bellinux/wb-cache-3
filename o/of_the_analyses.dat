In phylogenetic taxonomy, Velociraptorinae is usually defined as [...] "all dromaeosaurs more closely related to Velociraptor than to Dromaeosaurus." [...] However, dromaeosaurid classification is highly variable. Originally, the subfamily Velociraptorinae was erected solely to contain Velociraptor. Other analyses have often included other genera, usually Deinonychus and Saurornitholestes, and more recently Tsaagan. However, several studies published during the 2010s, including expanded versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> that found support for Velociraptorinae, have failed to resolve it as a distinct group, but rather have suggested it is a paraphyletic grade which gave rise to the Dromaeosaurinae.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{evidence}} suggests that increasing the severity of a punishment does not have much deterrent effect on crime, while increasing the certainty of punishment does. Clearly, enhancing the severity of punishment will have little impact on people who do not believe they will be apprehended for their actions. A study by Canadian criminologist Paul Gendreau brought together the results of 50 different studies of the deterrent effect of imprisonment involving over 300,000 offenders. The report said: [...] "None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> found imprisonment reduced recidivism. The recidivism rate for offenders who were imprisoned as opposed to given a community sanction was similar. In addition, longer sentences were not associated with reduced recidivism. In fact the opposite was found. Longer sentences were associated with a 3% increase in recidivism. This finding suggests some support for the (opposing) theory that prison may serve as a ‘school for crime’ for some offenders".|$|E

2500|$|The nasalisation of vowels and consonants in Mixtec is an {{interesting}} phenomenon that has had various analyses. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> agree that nasalization is contrastive {{and that it is}} somewhat restricted. In most varieties, it is clear that nasalization is limited to the right edge of a morpheme (such as a noun or verb root), and spreads leftward until it is blocked by an obstruent (plosive, affricate or fricative in the list of Mixtec consonants). A somewhat more abstract analysis of the Mixtec facts claims that the spreading of nasalization is responsible for the surface [...] "contrast" [...] between two kinds of bilabials ( [...] and , with and without the influence of nasalization, respectively), between two kinds of palatals ( [...] and nasalized —often less accurately (but more easily) transcribed as —with and without nasalization, respectively), and even two kinds of coronals ( [...] and , with and without nasalization, respectively). Nasalized vowels which are contiguous to the nasalized variants are less strongly nasalized than in other contexts. This situation is known to have been characteristic of Mixtec for at least the last 500 years since the earliest colonial documentation of the language shows the same distribution of consonants.|$|E

In addition, we have found the rain-induced intermediate ion bursts frequently. The rain effect was detected on 163 days by means of negative ions and on 105 days by positive ones. Another interesting phenomenon among the charged aerosol particles was the appearance and existence of intermediate ions during the snowfall. We observed this phenomenon 24 times with negatively charged particles and 21 times with positively charged ones during winter months (October–April).

Objectives: <b>The</b> main goal <b>of</b> this research has been to study the stickiness and attractiveness of Slovenian municipalities regarding <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> parameters to support local labour commuting policy. Methods/Approach: <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> parameters to <b>the</b> labour commuting flows has been studied in the extended gravity model. <b>The</b> change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> parameters on commuting flows has been studied separately for each year in <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> period.
