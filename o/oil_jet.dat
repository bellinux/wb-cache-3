2500|$|Economist Arnold Kling {{said the}} bill [...] "maximizes {{rent-seeking}} (favoritism toward particular businesses) and minimizes carbon reduction". Other economists {{have argued that}} the bill will create significant financial costs. The Wall Street Journal accused the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of significantly underestimating the bill's ultimate costs, pointing out supposed flaws in its calculations. The Wall Street Journal also suggested that the bill's costs would disproportionately affect lower-income households, for which the CBO estimates did not account. The New York Times reported that the bill's provisions to levy tariffs on Chinese imports due to carbon emissions could provoke a trade war. The Competitive Enterprise Institute argued that the bill was essentially the [...] "largest tax hike in world history". The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the petroleum and natural gas industry, said the bill would place [...] "disproportionate burden on all consumers of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating <b>oil,</b> <b>jet</b> fuel, propane and other petroleum products", and by 2035, it would cause gasoline prices in excess of $4.00 per gallon by today's standards.|$|E

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study was}} performed with 120 -mm bore angular-contact ball bearings having a nominal contact angle of 20 deg. The bearings either had an inner- or an outer-race land riding cage. Lubrication was by recirculating <b>oil</b> <b>jets.</b> The <b>oil</b> <b>jets</b> either {{had a single}} or dual orifice. Thrust load, speed, and lubricant flow rate were varied. Test results were compared with those previously reported and obtained from bearings of the same design which were under-race lubricated but run under the same conditions. Jet lubricated ball bearings were limited to speeds less than 2, 500, 000 DN. Bearings having inner-race land riding cages produced lower temperatures than bearings with outer-race land riding cages. For a given lubricant flow rate dual orifice jets produced lower bearing temperatures than single orifice jets. However, under-race lubrication produced under all conditions of operation lower bearing temperatures with no apparent bearing speed limitation...|$|R

40|$|An Advanced Counter-Rotating (CR) Gearbox was {{designed}} and fabricated to evaluate gearbox efficiency, durability and weight characteristics for emerging propfan-powered airplanes. Component scavenge tests showed that a constant volume collector had high scavenge effectiveness, which was uneffected by added airflow. Lubrication tests showed that gearbox losses could be reduced by controlling the air/oil mixture and by directing the <b>oil</b> <b>jets</b> radially, with a slight axial component, into the sun/planet gears...|$|R
50|$|Oil {{pressure}} {{is an important}} factor in the longevity of most internal combustion engines. With a forced lubrication system (invented by Frederick Lanchester), oil is picked up by a positive displacement oil pump and forced through oil galleries (passageways) into bearings, such as the main bearings, big end bearings and camshaft bearings or balance shaft bearings. Other components such as cam lobes and cylinder walls are lubricated by <b>oil</b> <b>jets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The cost of fuel hedging {{depends on}} the {{predicted}} future price of fuel. Airlines may place hedges either based on future prices of jet fuel or on future prices of crude oil. [...] Because crude oil {{is the source of}} jet fuel, the prices of crude <b>oil</b> and <b>jet</b> fuel are normally correlated. However, other factors, such as difficulties regarding refinery capacity, may cause unusual divergence in the trends of crude <b>oil</b> and <b>jet</b> fuel.|$|R
50|$|Under some conditions, a {{different}} 5-speed transmission problem arose. Second gear could overheat and break, causing the transmission to lock. An <b>oil</b> <b>jet</b> {{was added to}} lubricate this gear but this did not solve the third gear clutch problem. The addition of the Honda transmission cooler with the towing package still allows transmission fluid temperatures that are too high. But it was required along with a power steering cooler for any towing, or the warranty would be void. The Acura CL, TL, MDX and Honda Accord suffered similar problems.|$|E
50|$|Also {{unlike the}} Chevrolet inline 6, Ford {{products}} used {{high oil pressure}} for lubrication for the main and rod bearings, as do all modern vehicle combustion engines. While this offered no special performance advantage it did eliminate a complex <b>oil</b> <b>jet</b> system in the oil pan. As a side benefit to a prospective purchaser of a used vehicle, this also enabled {{the condition of the}} connecting rod and main bearings to be determined indirectly by observation of the analog oil pressure gauge after the vehicle was warmed up, provided that oil of normal viscosity was in use.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, relations have continued to strengthen from both parts. The Maltese Government in collaboration with MCAST has offered scholarships to Libyan students. Discussions on Illegal Migrations also have been undergoing. On September 2013, a deal was struck for Malta to procure crude oil, refined <b>oil,</b> <b>jet</b> fuel and LPG at a fixed price. Some issue on and oil exploration area, claimed by both countries, have been discussed by both parties, agreeing for joint oil exploration by both countries. Malta will also help Libya in transport and civil aviation. The Libyan government was keen on improving links {{between the two countries}} including oil and gas, education, including a rehabilitation of the Ta' Giorni Institute, and other aspects.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to their predecessors, the Gen III engines feature lighter cast-iron blocks, {{as well as}} higher compression ratios. These engines also implement DCVCP (Double Continuous Variable Cam Phasing technology, a variant of VVT), piston cooling by <b>oil</b> <b>jets,</b> and an integrated catalytic converter. Non-turbocharged variants feature the TwinPort (Variable-length intake manifold) technology.The drive belt for the camshafts is wider and stronger than before, and water pump is not driven by it anymore which improves reliability.|$|R
50|$|ACS techs {{regularly}} come {{in contact}} with hazardous chemicals and materials, which include: Polyurethane paints, Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), Zinc chromate paint primers, <b>oils,</b> <b>jet</b> fuel, paint strippers, and paint thinners. ACS techs are also exposed to noise, fumes, dust, odors, carcinogenic materials, and UV (welding) flashes. ACS techs use personal protective equipment (PPE) {{to reduce the risk of}} injury, but additional medical tests are used to monitor a technicians health above what is standard for most other Canadian Forces trades.|$|R
50|$|Most manual {{transmissions}} rely on {{splash lubrication}} although some five speed Rover gearboxes did incorporate an oil pump. The problem with splash lubrication {{is that it}} is speed dependent. There are centrifugal effects, hydrodynamic effects and effects from the gears working as pumps. If a gearbox is fitted with Perspex windows and run on a test rig these effects can be observed. As the gearbox is run through its rev range, the oil jets will switch over and move around. Research on the Austin Maxi 1500 gearbox showed that one of the ball races was running dry at 80 mph. The solution was to alter the casting to include a small projection that would intercept the main <b>oil</b> <b>jet</b> that was present at 80 mph and disperse it. This small modification enabled the later Maxi 1750 gearbox to be relatively trouble free. Four speed gearboxes seldom show these problems because at top speed (and maximum power) they are basically a solid shaft and the gears are not transmitting power.|$|E

A displacement increase which produced more horsepower, along with three variable power modes and KTRC. Kawasaki traction control and ignition-management system that was lifted from the ZX-10R. Also with cosmetic updates and incremental chassis upgrades and suspension revised internals. There was also a slipper clutch added for the first time. The motor gets cylinder heads with polished ports and cams with more lift and longer duration. Piston are lighter with added compression that get cooled by a new <b>oil</b> <b>jet</b> system. Stronger connecting rods and crankshaft {{as well as a}} stronger tensioner and cam chain. while the transmission gets heat treated surface gears. Also {{in an effort to make}} the motorcycle run cooler, and therefore be more durable, they added a second radiator fan. Larger head pipes and larger mufflers with a less restrictive air filter all improve response.

25|$|The heat source, {{contained}} within the firebox, is the energy released by the combustion, typically of a solid or liquid fuel, creating a by-product of hot combustion gases. If wood, coal or coke is used as the combustion material it is introduced through a door, typically by a fireman, onto a set of grates where ashes fall away from the burning fuel.

50|$|While {{addressing}} reliability {{issues in}} Suzuki's only turbo charged bike, the XN85, the SACS system was first conceived by Mr. Estuo Yokouchi, who looked to World War II-era aircraft for inspiration. Like air-cooled motorcycles, radial engines {{used in many}} early aircraft suffered from heat and reliability issues. To overcome these problems, aircraft engineers often used <b>oil</b> <b>jets</b> aimed {{at the bottom of}} an engine's pistons to carry away excess heat. Following their example, Yokouchi decided to apply the approach to motorcycles. The result was a success.|$|R

5000|$|As well as pottery, {{ceramics}} {{produced in}} Camulodunum {{also include a}} large tile industry, oil lamps and figurines. The colonia was also a major centre of glass production, and glass moulds (including a complete example) have been discovered in the town. Glass was produced throughout the Roman period of Camulodunum, including in the late 4th century, and glass-making waste was discovered at Culver Street from the mid-1st century. [...] Bone carving for ornamentation, metal working and jewellery making were also practiced, and a coin mint operated in the colonia. Archaeological excavations suggest that the period between 150 and 250 saw {{the largest number of}} active workshops in the colonia. The town was at the centre of a largely rural economy, with archaeological evidence of agricultural buildings in the colonia including the large buttressed tower granary found in the Southern part of the town, in use for much of the 2nd century, with a nearby corn-drying oven. Many ovens have been located in excavations around the town. A system of watermills appears to have operated along Salary Brook near Ardleigh {{to the north of the}} settlement, and other watermills may have operated on the Colne at the modern site of Middle Mill in Castle Park. Oysters from the Colne Estuary and Mersea Island have been an important food source throughout much of Colchester's history, and large dumps (some 0.5m thick) of oyster shells have been found at Balkerne Hill from the Roman period, along with mussels, whelks, cockles, carpet shells, winkle and scallop; fish imported from the River Colne and coast are represented by herring, plaice, flounder, eel, smelt, cod, haddock, gurnard, mullet, dragonet, dab, and sole. As well as the Sheepen river port, Roman roads lead to Mistley on the Essex bank of the River Stour and to a cluster of Roman-era buildings at West Mersea, both of which may also have possessed ports for the colonia. Imports of dates, wine (including Falernian wine), olive <b>oil,</b> <b>jet,</b> marble and other goods from across the Roman Empire have been found in Colchester, including a locally made amphora with an inscription suggesting that it held North African palm-tree fruit products. The trade in salt from local Red Hills also appears to have continued on from the Iron Age in the Roman period, but with more sophisticated evaporation kilns. Small numbers of tiles were imported from Eccles in Kent by Roman settlements in South-East Britain, including Camulodunum, for a brief time in the First Century, as was Kentish Ragstone for building.|$|E
