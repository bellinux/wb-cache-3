5|$|Despite the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall beginning in 1961, which increased tensions between East and West, Brundage was successful in securing a joint German team for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Nevertheless, the East Germans, supported by IOC members from Warsaw Pact nations, aspired to have their <b>own</b> <b>team.</b> They made a major breakthrough when the IAAF (led by the Marquess of Exeter, the former Lord Burghley) recognized a separate East German team beginning with the 1966 European Athletics Championships. The East Germans did their best to get Brundage's support, and, at the IOC session at Mexico City in 1968, they were granted full membership, with their <b>own</b> <b>team</b> under their own flag, which they displayed on West German soil four years later at the Opening Ceremony at Munich. Brundage, while finally supporting full membership for East Germany, considered the matter a defeat for Olympic ideals.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{foundation}} of IFK Göteborg, the dominant club in the Gothenburg area was Örgryte IS, which was considered a middle and upper class club. IFK became popular amongst the working class, creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their <b>own</b> <b>team,</b> and the opponents. However, this proved a hard task for supporters of the Gothenburg teams. Local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.|$|E

5|$|During 1989 Prost {{began to}} {{contemplate}} starting his <b>own</b> <b>team,</b> as {{his relationship with}} his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and John Barnard, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join Benetton. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with Guy Ligier about buying his Ligier team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993. In 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people began to assume that a Prost-Renault team would be formed in the near future. Renault refused Prost's request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.|$|E
5|$|Honda had {{previously}} competed in Formula One as a constructor when they purchased British American Racing in 2006, before selling {{the team to}} Brawn GP ahead of the 2009 season. With the sport introducing a brand-new engine formula in 2014 and Mercedes, their engine-supplier, establishing their <b>own</b> <b>team,</b> McLaren sought a new engine supplier {{with a view to}} a long-term relationship. The partnership with Honda was first announced in May 2013, and the RA615H engine spent the next eighteen months in development. The team used Mercedes' PU106A Hybrid engine in the McLaren MP4-29 throughout the 2014 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1988, he {{was put on the}} {{transfer}} list and came close to joining American club Portland Timbers, before injury put negotiations on hold. A £1million price tag also deterred a great deal of potential interest. In view of Whiteside's medical reports, Ferguson rejected bids of £500,000 from Osasuna of Spain and from Ron Atkinson's new club Sheffield Wednesday, before accepting a bid of £600,000 (with £150,000 to follow if Whiteside reached 50 games) from Everton in July 1989. This was to the dismay of some of the club's supporters, who felt that there was still hope that he had a future at Old Trafford. Ferguson intended to build his <b>own</b> <b>team</b> having signed midfield duo Neil Webb and Mike Phelan, and also in the hunt for other players including Paul Ince, Gary Pallister and Danny Wallace.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Evo {{returned to his}} family, who had escaped the agricultural devastation of 1980's El Niño storm cycle by relocating to the Tropics of Cochabamba in the eastern lowlands. Setting up home {{in the town of}} Villa 14 de Septiembre, El Chapare, using a loan from Evo's maternal uncle, the family cleared a plot of land in the forest to grow rice, oranges, grapefruit, papaya, bananas and later on coca. It was here that Morales learned to speak Quechua, the indigenous local language. The arrival of the Morales family was a part of a much wider migration to the region; in 1981 El Chapare's population was 40,000 but by 1988 it had risen to 215,000. Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing coca, which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the key ingredient in cocaine. Evo joined the local soccer team, before founding his <b>own</b> <b>team,</b> New Horizon, which proved victorious at the August 2nd Central Tournament. The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often talked of it in speeches and regularly visited.|$|E
5|$|Henrik {{entered the}} final game of the regular season, on 10 April against the Calgary Flames, one point behind Alexander Ovechkin for the NHL scoring lead. In a pre-game ceremony, he was awarded the Canucks' Cyclone Taylor Trophy, Cyrus H. McLean Trophy and Molson Cup as the team's most {{valuable}} player, leading scorer and three-star selection leader, respectively. He then went on to record four assists in a 7–3 win to finish the season with 112points, passing Ovechkin for the season lead, while also breaking Pavel Bure's franchise record of 110points, set in 1992–93. Ovechkin failed to register a point in his last game the next day, earning Henrik the League scoring title and making him the first Art Ross Trophy winner in Canucks history. With a League-leading 83assists, he also surpassed his <b>own</b> <b>team</b> record of 71assists in one season. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Henrik added 14 points in 12 games. He scored the winning goal in game four against the Los Angeles Kings with under three minutes to go in regulation to tie the series at two games each. The Canucks went on to eliminate the Kings in six games before being ousted by the Blackhawks the following round for the second consecutive year.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Johnson missed most of {{the season}} with a knee injury, and New York dropped to 4–10, {{resulting}} in Tarkenton being traded back to the Vikings. The Giants rallied somewhat in 1972 to finish 8–6. Journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton) led the league in completion percentage and had his best season. Other standouts and Pro Bowl selections that year were running back Johnson, who rushed for 1,182 yards (breaking his <b>own</b> <b>team</b> record) and caught 45 passes, tight end Bob Tucker, who followed up his 1971 NFC-leading 59-catch season with 55 in 1972, and defensive stars Jack Gregory and John Mendenhall. The Giants boasted the top offense in the NFC and after a season-finishing 23–3 win at Dallas to secure their second winning campaign in three years, the future looked bright. However, after the 1972 season, New York would endure one of the worst periods in its history.|$|E

5|$|Rain {{affected}} the third Test; {{on the second}} day, Australia declared having scored 200 for nine in their first innings. In reply, England lost regular wickets as the effects of rain made the pitch almost impossible to bat on. Several critics, including members of his <b>own</b> <b>team,</b> suggested Allen should have declared to force Australia to bat when the pitch remained very difficult. Allen considered the risk to be too great and did not declare until the score had reached 76 for nine. Bradman then reversed his batting order to protect his main batsmen until the conditions eased; the tactic worked, as he and Jack Fingleton shared a partnership of 346 for the sixth wicket. Bradman scored 270 and England were defeated by 365 runs. In the fourth Test, Australia were bowled out for 288 in their first innings, when several of Allen's tactical moves worked well. England replied with 330, and Australia scored 433 in the second innings. Needing to score 392 to win, England were bowled out for 243, and the series was level at 2–2.|$|E
5|$|The NBA All-Rookie Team is {{an annual}} National Basketball Association (NBA) honor given since the 1962–63 NBA season {{to the top}} rookies during the regular season. Voting is {{conducted}} by the NBA head coaches; who {{are not allowed to}} vote for players on their <b>own</b> <b>team.</b> The All-Rookie Team is generally composed of two five-man lineups, a first team and a second team. The players each receive two points for each first team vote and one point for each second team vote. The top five players with the highest point total make the first team, with the next five making the second team. In the case of a tie at the fifth position of either team, the roster is expanded. If the first team consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players with the potential for more expansion in the event of additional ties. Ties have occurred several times, most recently in 2012, when Kawhi Leonard, Iman Shumpert, and Brandon Knight tied in votes received. No respect is given to positions. For example, the first team had four forwards, and one guard in 2008, while the first team had four centers (two of which were forward-centers) and one guard in 2016.|$|E
