5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first deduction {{that can be made}} from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the regular}} Confederate {{military}} had a paper strength of 6,000 personnel, the first 100,000 volunteers from all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> {{participated in a}} variety of dress. Many were from state militia outfits, which had their own state-issued uniforms. In the early battles, some Confederate units that wore dark blue uniforms were often mistaken on the field of battle for the enemy. Conversely, many Union units that were originally militia units went to war wearing gray.|$|E

5|$|Floodlights were erected at {{the ground}} in 1956 and the £9,000 cost nearly sent the club into bankruptcy. However, Norwich's success in the 1958–59 FA Cup (where as a Third Division club they reached the semi-final, losing to First Division Luton Town after a replay) secured the {{financial}} status of the club and provided sufficient funds for a cover to be built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Stand. In 1963, the record was set for attendance at Carrow Road: a crowd of 43,984 watched a sixth round FA Cup match against Leicester City, and the South Stand was covered shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, settler Galen Clark {{discovered}} the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia at Wawona, an indigenous encampment {{in what is}} now the southwestern part of the park.

5|$|Northerners {{assumed that}} Fillmore, hailing from a free state, was an {{opponent}} of the spread of slavery. Southerners {{accused him of being}} an abolitionist, which he hotly denied. Fillmore responded to one Alabamian in a widely published letter that slavery was an evil, but one that the federal government had no authority over. Taylor and Fillmore corresponded twice in September, with the general happy that the crisis <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Carolinians was resolved. Fillmore, for his part, assured his running mate that the electoral prospects for the ticket looked good, especially in the Northeast.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Cecil in Mayof 1989 caused devastating {{floods in}} central Vietnam, killing 751people. The storm {{developed}} as a tropical depression <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea on May22. Tracking north-northwestward, the system steadily intensified, attaining peak winds of 110km/h (70mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed Cecil to have been slightly stronger with one-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph). The storm made landfall near Hoi An, Vietnam late on May24 and quickly weakened. The system later dissipated over Laos on May26.|$|E
5|$|The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was {{originally}} constructed in 1874 {{as part of}} the South Branch Bridge (or alternatively, the Romney Bridge), a larger two-span Whipple truss bridge conveying the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) across the South Branch Potomac River near Romney. The larger Whipple truss bridge replaced an 1838 wooden covered bridge that was destroyed during the American Civil War. In 1874, T. B. White and Sons were charged with the construction of a Whipple truss bridge <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Branch; that bridge served travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years until a new bridge was constructed in 1937.|$|E

5|$|The China Meteorological Administration {{released}} {{a press release}} after the storm and gave four reasons for the extensive damage. First, the storm decelerated after landfall and maintained its identity for 120hours while moving south of due west. Secondly, the storm was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern semicircle. Also, the storm interacted with the active monsoon <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and more prone to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} widespread rainfall in the Southeastern United States, {{accompanied by}} gale-force winds along the coast, and ships reported severe conditions at sea. High tides occurred around St. Augustine, Florida, washing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Street Causeway. Winds {{from the storm}} dispersed large amounts of dead grass from marshes in the area. No significant damage was reported due to thorough warnings before the cyclone. A 2005 reanalysis of the storm made some minor changes to its listing in the official hurricane database, setting back the time of formation and raising the peak intensity.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Kelly was a weak but {{destructive}} {{tropical storm}} that struck the Philippines in June1981. A tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression {{east of the}} Philippines on June28. It tracked westward, reaching tropical storm on June30 before hitting the central Philippines. Kelly weakened over the islands, but re-strengthened <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea, nearly attaining typhoon status on July2. The system passed through the southern Hainan Island on July3. The cyclone then crossed the Gulf of Tonkin as a weakening tropical storm, and made landfall in northern Vietnam on July4 as a tropical storm. Kelly dissipated two days later inland.|$|E

5|$|Xangsane made {{landfall}} in the Philippines, battering {{the northern}} islands with torrential rains and strong winds, and causing widespread flooding and landslides. After passing over Manila and emerging <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea, the typhoon made a second landfall in central Vietnam, also causing flooding and landslides {{there and in}} Thailand. The storm was responsible for at least 279 deaths, mostly in the Philippines and Vietnam, and at least US$747 million in damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels from all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> of England were pressed into service {{to aid in the}} Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1904 {{season the}} New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) {{suspended}} Gallaher from playing after a disagreement over a claim for expenses he had submitted to the Auckland Rugby Football Union for travel to play in the match against the British Isles. Eventually the matter was resolved when, under protest, Gallaher repaid the disputed amount. This settlement, coupled with his performance in 26–0 North Island win <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Island in the pre-tour trial, allowed Gallaher to be considered for selection for New Zealand's 1905–06 tour of Europe and North America. The NZRFU had been trying to secure an invitation to send a team to Britain for some time, and were finally able to secure satisfactory financial guarantees to proceed in 1905. This was the first representative New Zealand team to undertake such a tour, though a privately organised team, the New Zealand Natives, had preceded them in 1888–89.|$|E
