5|$|NY146 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the time, NY146 began at modern NY443 in Berne and followed what is now NY156 northeast to Altamont while modern NY146 west of Altamont was part of NY156. The alignments of the two routes were flipped in the late 1930s. Other minor realignments have <b>occurred</b> <b>since,</b> most notably near Mechanicville.|$|E
5|$|SR163 was re-designated in 1991 along Pearl Street from SR16 in Tacoma to the Point Defiance ferry terminal. The route was {{extended}} onto the Point Defiance–Tahlequah Ferry serving Vashon Island in 1994. No major revisions have <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> 1994 to the highway's route.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. The attack {{is considered to}} be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> then. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, SH-19 was {{established}} through southern Caddo County, {{taking over the}} east–west section of SH-58. Thus, SH-58 was truncated to where it intersected with SH-19 (the present day western end of their concurrency). SH-58 was extended to its present terminus north of Hydro the next year. The highway was further extended in 1964, bringing the southern terminus to its present location near Medicine Park. No further routing changes have <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> then.|$|E
5|$|The New Horizons spacecraft, {{en route}} to Pluto and the Kuiper belt, flew by the Jovian system and Io on 28 February 2007. During the encounter, {{numerous}} distant observations of Io were obtained. These included images of a large plume at Tvashtar, providing the first detailed observations of the largest class of Ionian volcanic plume since observations of Pele's plume in 1979. New Horizons also captured images of a volcano near Girru Patera {{in the early stages}} of an eruption, and several volcanic eruptions that have <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> Galileo.|$|E
5|$|The West Pier Trust {{now owns}} the pier and has {{proposed}} various plans to renovate it. Some schemes have been opposed by local residents {{and the owners}} of the nearby Palace Pier, who have claimed unfair competition. The pier gradually collapsed during the early 21st century. Major sections collapsed in late 2002, and two fires in March and May 2003 left little of the original structure. Subsequently, English Heritage declared it to be beyond repair. Structured demolition took place in 2010 {{to make way for the}} observation tower i360; further structural damage from storms has <b>occurred</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{season began}} with the {{formation}} of Tropical Depression One-E on June 1 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Paka on December 22. The season can alternatively be considered to end on December 6, the day Tropical Storm Paka crossed the international dateline. No named storms formed in May, three in June, four in July, four in August, five in September, one in October, and one in November. Very unusually, a tropical storm formed in December, after the season ended. The other two times this feat <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> the satellite era began in 1971 were in 1983 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|Upon June Byers's {{retirement}} in 1956, {{it was held}} primarily (and operated) by Lillian Ellison under her ring name, The Fabulous Moolah, who first won the championship in a battle royal in September 1956. In 1983, the title was sold by Ellison to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where it became the WWF Women's Championship. The World Wrestling Federation recognized Moolah as the reigning champion but did not recognize any of the title changes that had <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> Moolah was first awarded the title. The NWA continued the title without Moolah after her title was renamed the WWF Women's Championship.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic storms are {{becoming}} more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization, “recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions.” Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996–2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs. The most damaging single storm is the 1926 Miami hurricane, with $157billion of normalized damage.|$|E

5|$|Chapter 8, Money, {{describes}} the internal debate at CBC regarding how {{to cover a}} $70 million loss in advertising revenue from the 2008-2009 recession with the government unwilling to cover the deficit or allow CBC to incur debt. Ultimately, they decided on cutting 400 jobs, {{reducing the number of}} episodes ordered, and selling excess real estate. Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the consolidation of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did not endorse Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process. In the final chapter Stursberg notes the changes that have <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> his departure and predicts the demise of CBC Sports as it loses NHL rights to CTV/TSN.|$|E
5|$|Multiple realignments of {{the road}} that is now Alt US40 have <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> it was {{originally}} built as the National Road. Most such realignments are minor, such as to bypass an old bridge, but some have significantly affected the path {{of the road}}. One such realignment occurred in 1834, when a new route for the National Road was built through the Cumberland Narrows. The previous route had followed the Braddock Road, a route which is now followed by MD49. The route following Braddock Road passed over Haystack Mountain and was much steeper than the newer route through the Narrows. The route through the Narrows allowed the road to bypass this steep mountain ascent. The stone arch bridge built across Will's Creek for the new alignment remained in service until 1932, when a new bridge which is the present bridge across Will's Creek replaced it. The old bridge was torn down during the construction of the Will's Creek flood control system in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common method of scoring in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrences– since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or {{about once a week}} under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by the defense is also possible, though highly unlikely; although this has never occurred, it is the only possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E

5|$|The 1964 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured {{the highest number}} of U.S.-landfalling hurricanes since 1933. The season officially began on June15, and lasted until November30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season was slightly above average, with twelve total storms and six hurricanes. All of the hurricanes strengthened into major hurricanes, an event that had not <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> 1930. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed on June2, almost two weeks before the official start of the season. Striking Florida on June6, the storm brought localized flooding to portions of Cuba and the Southeastern United States, leaving about $1million in damage. The next storm, also unnamed, developed near the end of July; it did not impact land.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines {{were part}} of the reserve forces for the Battle of Iwo Jima and were {{committed}} to the action five days after D-Day. Among the Marines who distinguished themselves on Iwo Jima was Private Wilson D. Watson who received the Medal of Honor. After the island was secured, the unit was sent back to Guam where they underwent training for a possible invasion of the Japanese mainland. The invasion never <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> hostilities between Japan and the United States came to an end. The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines was sent to Camp Pendelton where, in December 1945, it was once again disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The heavy toll on {{breeding}} birds, {{together with}} loss of habitat through drainage and collection by nineteenth-century trophy hunters and egg collectors, {{meant that the}} species became almost extinct in England by the 1880s, although recolonisation in small numbers has <b>occurred</b> <b>since</b> 1963. The draining of wetlands from the 1800s onwards in southern Sweden {{has resulted in the}} ruff's disappearance from many areas there, although it remains common in the north of the country. The use of insecticides and draining of wetlands has led to a {{decrease in the number of}} ruff in Denmark since the early 1900s. There are still areas where the ruff and other wetland birds are hunted legally or otherwise for food. A large-scale example is the capture of more than one million waterbirds (including ruffs) in a single year from Lake Chilwa in Malawi.|$|E
