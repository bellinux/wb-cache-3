500|$|Larter {{appeared}} in Glamour along with fellow actresses Rachel Bilson and Diane Lane in 2007. When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better now because I feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As you get <b>older,</b> <b>you</b> get better.... Look at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The reason is because they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

500|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{came from}} Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhie (1976). On being {{inspired by the}} classic, Karan quoted, [...] "What appealed to me {{was the fact that}} the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew <b>older.</b> <b>You</b> could say that Kabhi Kabhie is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. It will look different, feel different." [...] Similarly, Karan added an extra [...] "e" [...] to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was [...] "frothy and bubble-gummish", this one was [...] "more classy and sophisticated". He added that there would be [...] "plenty of drama" [...] in this film too, but handled more maturely.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the <b>older</b> <b>you</b> get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Mario Motta, {{president}} of the Massachusetts Medical Society, [...] "... glare from bad lighting is a public-health hazard—especially the <b>older</b> <b>you</b> become. Glare light scattering in the eye causes loss of contrast and leads to unsafe driving conditions, much like the glare on a dirty windshield from low-angle sunlight or the high beams from an oncoming car." [...] In essence bright and/or badly shielded lights around roads can partially blind drivers or pedestrians and contribute to accidents.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{love the}} fact that on one side, with acting, you can be a child—acting is {{wonderful}} for its innocence and the fun[...] [...] On the other side, producing is fun for all the adult kinds of things you do. You deal in business, you deal with the creative forces. As an adult who continues to get <b>older,</b> <b>you</b> like the adult risks. It's flying without a net, taking chances and learning. I was never good in economics or business—had no business background, you know, and I like it.|$|E
2500|$|As Thicke {{explained}} to the Breakfast Club, [...] "The album is called Blurred Lines. I've realized as I've gotten older that we all think we're living either in a black or white world, or on a straight path, {{but most of us}} are living right in between those straight lines. And everything you thought you knew, the <b>older</b> <b>you</b> get, you realize, 'Damn, I don't know nothing about this. I better pay attention, I better listen and keep learning.' So I think that, that's what I've been realizing these past few years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gan Ning {{was unhappy}} with Huang Zu and wanted to leave him, but was worried that Huang would not allow it, so he felt very frustrated. Su Fei was aware of Gan Ning's intention, so he invited him for drinks and said, [...] "I {{recommended}} you to Huang Zu many times, but he doesn't {{want to give you}} important responsibilities. Days pass by and people become <b>older.</b> <b>You</b> should make plans for the future and find someone who truly appreciates your talents." [...] Gan Ning paused for a moment before replying, [...] "That's what I've in mind, but I can't find an excuse to leave." [...] Su Fei then said, [...] "I'll suggest to Huang Zu to appoint you as the Chief (長) of Zhu County (邾縣; northwest of present-day Huanggang, Hubei). The initial phase is difficult, but after you reach it, it'll be much easier for you to decide where to go from there." [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Great." [...] Huang Zu approved Su Fei's suggestion. Gan Ning managed to gather a few hundred men who were willing to follow him, and they headed towards Zhu.|$|E
