40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} the {{relative}} <b>orbital</b> <b>elements</b> of two satellites flying in formation can be estimated making use of inter-satellite range measurements only. Since the determination of relative <b>orbital</b> <b>elements</b> does not require the orientation of the relative orbit with respect to absolute inertial space to be resolved, as would be the case for absolute <b>orbital</b> <b>elements,</b> the question arises whether relative range measurements alone can be sufficient {{to solve the problem of}} interest. Providing an answer to this question is both of academic and practical interest, especially for formation flying missions utilizing very small satellites that are limited in their capabilities. To this end, a linearized relative dynamics model is implemented using an iterative batch least-squares algorithm to estimate rectilinear relative positions and velocities, which are subsequently converted to relative <b>orbital</b> <b>elements</b> for a number of test cases. Furthermore, the observability of the system is analyzed to investigate which relative <b>orbital</b> <b>elements</b> are most observable. Space EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{main point}} {{of this paper is}} to {{evaluate}} the perturbations in <b>orbital</b> <b>elements</b> of a low Earth orbiting satellite. The outcome of a numerical orbit integration process is the position and velocity vectors of satellite in an inertial coordinate system. The velocity and position vectors are converted into the corresponding <b>orbital</b> <b>elements.</b> Perturbations in a satellite motion affect the <b>orbital</b> <b>elements</b> in the sense of Keplerian motion. In this paper after introducing the perturbing forces acting on a satellite, the method of converting the position and velocity into the <b>orbital</b> <b>elements</b> is presented, and finally the perturbations in <b>orbital</b> <b>elements</b> of the low Earth orbiting satellite of CHAMP are evaluated. The numerical results show that, disregarding the geopotential perturbing forces, the air drag is the most predominant among other perturbing forces: rotational deformation, solar radiation, third body effect, solid Earth tide, ocean tide, and general relativity arranged by their magnitude respectively...|$|R

50|$|The SM-65D Atlas, or Atlas D, was {{the first}} {{operational}} version of the Atlas missile. It first flew on 14 April 1959. Atlas D missiles were also used for orbital launches, both with upper stages, such as the RM-81 Agena, and on their own as a stage and a half vehicle. The Atlas D {{was used for the}} <b>orbital</b> <b>element</b> of Project Mercury, launching four manned Mercury spacecraft into low Earth orbit.

50|$|Without {{perturbations}} {{these elements}} would be constant, {{and are therefore}} ideal to base the theories on. With perturbations they slowly change, and one takes as many perturbations in the calculations as possible or desirable. The results are the <b>orbital</b> <b>element</b> at a specific time, {{which can be used}} to compute the position in either rectangular coordinates (X,Y,Z) or spherical coordinates: longitude, latitude and heliocentric distance. These heliocentric coordinates can then fairly easily be changed to other viewpoints, e.g. geocentric coordinates. For coordinate transformations, rectangular coordinates (X,Y,Z) are often easier to use: translations (e.g. heliocentric to geocentric coordinates) are performed through vector addition, and rotations (e.g. ecliptic to equatorial coordinates) through matrix multiplication.|$|E

Short pulses of laser light beamed from a spacecraft can reflect off of tiny particles in the atmosphere and back to a telescope aligned with the spacecraft laser. By precisely timing the lidar 'echo,' and by measuring how much laser light is received by the telescope, scientists can accurately determine the location, distribution {{and nature of the}} particles.

50|$|Modern GPS {{receivers}} work somewhat similarly in {{that they}} also correlate a received PN bit stream (at 1.023 Mbit/s) with a local reference to measure distance. But GPS is a receive-only system that uses relative timing measurements from a set of satellites to determine receiver position while the Apollo USB is a two-way system that can only determine the instantaneous distance and relative velocity. However, an orbit determination program can find the unique spacecraft state vector or <b>orbital</b> <b>element</b> set that most closely matches (usually in a least squares sense) a set of range, range-rate (relative velocity) and antenna look angle observations made {{over a period of}} time by one or more ground stations assuming purely ballistic spacecraft motion over the observation interval.|$|E

A full analytical solution to the effects including their direct perturbations and mixed perturbations due to the Newtonian oblateness (J(2)) perturbation and the Schwarzschild solution is obtained using the quasi-mean <b>orbital</b> <b>element</b> method analogous to the Kozai&# 39;s mean <b>orbital</b> <b>element</b> one.

40|$|The recent {{addition}} of autonomous formation flying spacecraft to the world’s satellite fleet provides new motivation to study feedback control techniques. In this thesis, we develop nonlinear orbit control laws {{for use in}} spacecraft orbital maneuvers, and spacecraft formation flying. We apply these new control laws {{to a number of}} sample maneuvers, including formation establishment and formation keeping maneuvers for NASA-Goddard’s Leonardo-BRDF formation, and coupled orbit, and attitude maneuvers for HokieSat, a spacecraft designed, and built by students at Virginia Tech to fly in the Ionospheric Observation Nanosatellite Formation (ION-F). To provide target orbit states for feedback control, we develop and apply an algorithm to calculate a formation master orbit representing the geometric center of the formation. We also define a new technique for choosing <b>orbital</b> <b>element</b> feedback gains which appropriately scales the gains for orbit maintenance, and provides an excellent starting point for gain optimization. The <b>orbital</b> <b>element</b> feedback control law, augmented by mean motion control, and applied with appropriate gains, forces asymptotic convergence to a spacecraft target orbit, for a large variety of spacecraft maneuvers.
