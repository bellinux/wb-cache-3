5|$|The {{recording}} finished as the forty-fourth {{album of}} the Billboard 200 of 1995 and finished at number 123 on the Billboard 200 albums of 1996. Two years after Selena's murder, Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>and</b> Siempre Selena (1996) occupied {{the third and fourth}} slots respectively on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. Dreaming of You sold 420,500 copies between 1997 and 1999, and sold 190,000 units in 1997 alone. The biopic Selena (1997) contributed to a 65% increase of sales for Dreaming of You for that year. Dreaming of You sold half a million copies in Texas. Some Texas retailers criticized sale figures for the state because the album had sold poorly at their music stores. By December 1995, Dreaming of You had sold two million copies in the U.S. and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of two million copies. Within ten months of its release, the album was nearing triple-platinum status; it was eventually certified 35×platinum (Latin field) by the RIAA, denoting shipment of 3.5 million units. It remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S. with five million copies sold worldwide as of January 2015. A percentage of the proceeds from the album's sales was donated to the Selena Scholarship Fund.|$|E

500|$|Bundy also {{confided in}} Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit.

[...] Bundy told Hagmaier that he {{considered}} himself to be an [...] "amateur", an [...] "impulsive" [...] killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his [...] "prime" [...] or [...] "predator" [...] phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974.

He ordered his dragoons to take a bridge; they failed and suffered severe casualties. D'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers—heavy cavalry of big men on big horses—thundered over the bridge and scattered the Russian rear guard. As the retreating infantry fled, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers captured four guns and two standards. Napoleon was so pleased with d'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers that he embraced the six-foot man in front of his division the next day. In his own turn, d'Hautpoul was so pleased that he announced first, to have such a compliment, he must be willing to die for his emperor, and second, to his troops: [...] "The Emperor has embraced me on behalf of all <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> I am so pleased with you that I kiss all your arses." ...|$|E

Perone compared it to the '90s American dance music scene and commented on how the [...] "techno aspect of the piece is muted; however, Selena's voice is electronically processed {{for part of the}} recording." [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] incorporates [...] "rhythmic shifts from accentuation on off-beats to accentuation on the beat". The [...] "hey, ho" [...] is a reference to American soul singer Ray Charles' call and response 1950s single [...] "What'd I Say", used under a [...] "Latin-style drumbeat".|$|E
