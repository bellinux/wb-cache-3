Of the railway trip, Yeats {{wrote in his}} memoirs, [...] "when <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> railway journey together—we were {{to spend the day}} at Kent—she gave the long passionate kiss of love, I was startled & a little shocked". They went on to share more passionate kisses in art galleries and at her home.|$|E
2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] I think that was the second thing Ed and I wrote together. It came out of a jam in the studio and Ed didn't really have any lyrics. He came up with some ideas right there on the spot, and that's what we recorded. For some reason, it didn't make it on Ten. I was kind of bummed at the time. I really wanted it to be <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> record. But at the time, I was really young and just happy to be around this situation, so I did whatever.|$|E

All these qualities were integrated in Dick (Richard) Baxter in harmonious combination. – Monroe Leigh ...|$|E

2500|$|The two new {{tracks were}} {{produced}} by Brandon Friesen, {{who has also}} been overseeing sessions for the band's next studio album. Consisting of songs written by Pritchard while the other band members spent time with their families, the new album is deemed {{to be more of}} a band effort, as opposed to Listen which was constructed individually. [...] "This one’s very much 'us' – all rehearsing songs, all arranging songs, all playing together. It’s got the same sort of energy that we had <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> couple of albums, which we were probably running away from a little bit for a while, but now we’ve gone back to it," [...] said Pritchard. [...] "Brandon Friesen, our producer, has taken more of a production role than me, so I won’t be taking the credit. On Listen, me and Inflo worked together everyday. But this one’s been much more of a band record. It’s been far more collaborative." ...|$|E

You must stop the assault <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>First</b> Amendment rights. Your silence sends a message that police brutality is acceptable. Banks got bailed out. We got sold out." [...] The crowd quickly drowned the protesters out with chants of “Obama!” Obama then responded, [...] "I appreciate you guys making your point. Let me go ahead and make mine." [...] Later in the speech, Obama said, “Families like yours, young people like the ones here today— including the ones who were just chanting at me— you’re the reason that I ran for office in the first place.” ...|$|E

[...] At {{the time she was}} cast as Sue, Lynch was already committed to do a Damon Wayans pilot for ABC.

From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout [...] "Wah! Wah!" [...] in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Anurodh. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then, {{and did not want to}} work with him." [...] Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishore was very reluctant to sing [...] "Waada Tera Waada" [...] in Dushman and suggested to Laxmikant-Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishore meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishore that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this, Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.|$|E
