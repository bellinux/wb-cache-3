5|$|Although {{the wind}} power {{industry}} {{was affected by}} the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> power will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050.

40|$|According to {{the actual}} {{measurement}} data, probability models <b>of</b> horizontal <b>wind</b> load were ob-tained based on wind velocity statistic and power spectral density function <b>of</b> fluctuating <b>wind</b> ve-locity through stochastic sampling and using spectrum analysis method. Through the comparison of two models, probability models <b>of</b> horizontal <b>wind</b> load based on probability models <b>of</b> fluc-tuating <b>wind</b> velocity were obtained by revising the mean and variance <b>of</b> fluctuating <b>wind</b> veloci-ty. Results show that the variance takes lower value when the power spectral density function <b>of</b> fluctuating <b>wind</b> velocity is used to obtain the probability model <b>of</b> horizontal <b>wind</b> load. The qua-dratic term <b>of</b> fluctuating <b>wind</b> velocity takes a small contribution value in total wind load with almost no contribution to the model <b>of</b> horizontal <b>wind</b> load.

5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E

50|$|The north area of Brazil embraces a {{great part}} of the Amazon Basin, {{representing}} the largest extension of hot and humid forest on the planet. The region has a low elevation (0 to 200 m) and is crossed by the Equator. There are four main systems of atmospheric circulation that act in the area, they are: system <b>of</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> Northeast (NE) to East (E) of the Atlantic South and Azores, subtropical anticyclones, generally stable in nature; system <b>of</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> West (W) of the mass equatorial continental (mEc); system <b>of</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> North (N) of the Convergence Intertropical (CIT); and system <b>of</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> South (S) of the Polar anticyclone.
