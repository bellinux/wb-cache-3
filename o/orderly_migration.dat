However, the precise functional significance of this well-established <b>orderly</b> neuronal <b>migration</b> remains largely unclear. Here, {{we show that}} strong electrical synapses selectively form between RGPs and their newborn progeny and between sister excitatory neurons in ontogenetic radial clones at the embryonic stage. Interestingly, the preferential electrical coupling between sister excitatory neurons, but not that between RGP and newborn progeny, is eliminated in mice lacking REELIN or upon clonal depletion of DISABLED- 1, which compromises the inside-out radial neuronal migration pattern in the developing neocortex. Moreover, increased levels of Ephrin-A ligand or receptor that laterally disperse sister excitatory neurons also disrupt preferential electrical coupling between radially aligned sister excitatory neurons. These results suggest that RGP-guided inside-out radial neuronal migration facilitates the initial assembly of lineage-dependent precise columnar microcircuits in the neocortex...|$|R

50|$|Excessive {{body hygiene}} {{of the ear}} canals can result in {{infection}} or irritation. The ear canals require less body hygiene care than {{other parts of the}} body, because they are sensitive, and the body system adequately cares for these parts. Most of the time the ear canals are self-cleaning; that is, there is a slow and <b>orderly</b> <b>migration</b> of the skin lining the ear canal from the eardrum to the outer opening of the ear. Old earwax is constantly being transported from the deeper areas of the ear canal out to the opening where it usually dries, flakes, and falls out. Attempts to clean the ear canals through the removal of earwax can actually reduce ear canal cleanliness by pushing debris and foreign material into the ear that the natural movement of ear wax out of the ear would have removed.Excessive application of soaps, creams, and ointments can also adversely affect certain of the natural processes of the skin. For examples, soaps and ointments can deplete the skin of natural protective oils and fat-soluble content such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and external substances can be absorbed, to disturb natural hormonal balances.|$|E

40|$|<b>Orderly</b> cell <b>migration</b> is {{essential}} for embryonic development, efficient wound healing and a functioning immune system and the dysregulation of this process leads {{to a number of}} pathologies. The speed and direction of cell migration is critically dependent on the structural organization of focal adhesions in the cell. While it is well established that contractile forces derived from the acto-myosin filaments control the structure and growth of focal adhesions, how this may be modulated to give different outcomes for speed and persistence is not well understood. The tropomyosin family of actin-associating proteins are emerging as important modulators of the contractile nature of associated actin filaments. The multiple non-muscle tropomyosin isoforms are differentially expressed between tissues and across development and are thought to be major regulators of actin filament functional specialization. In the present study we have investigated the effects of two splice variant isoforms from the same α-tropomyosin gene, TmBr 1 and TmBr 3, on focal adhesion structure and parameters of cell migration. These isoforms are normally switched on in neuronal cells during differentiation and we find that exogenous expression of the two isoforms in undifferentiated neuronal cells has discrete effects on cell migration parameters. While both isoforms cause reduced focal adhesion size and cell migration speed, they differentially effect actin filament phenotypes and migration persistence. Our data suggests that differential expression of tropomyosin isoforms may coordinate acto-myosin contractility and focal adhesion structure to modulate cell speed and persistence...|$|R

5000|$|The latest wave of Turkish {{emigration}} {{began with}} the mass exodus in 1989, known as the [...] "big excursion", when the Bulgarian Turks fled to Turkey in order to escape a campaign of forced assimilation. This marked a dramatic culmination of years of tension among the Turkish community, which intensified with the Bulgarian government's assimilation campaign {{in the winter of}} 1985 that attempted to make ethnic Turks change their names to Bulgarian Slavic names. The campaign began with a ban on wearing traditional Turkish dress, and speaking the Turkish language in public places, followed by the forced name-changing campaign. By May 1989, the Bulgarian authorities began to expel the Turks; when the Turkish government's efforts to negotiate with Bulgaria for an <b>orderly</b> <b>migration</b> failed, Turkey opened its borders to Bulgaria on 2 June 1989. However, on 21 August 1989, Turkey reintroduced immigration visa requirements for Bulgarian Turks. It was estimated that about 360,000 ethnic Turks had left for Turkey, though more than a third subsequently returned to Bulgaria once the ban on Turkish names had been revoked in December 1989. Nonetheless, once the Bulgarian communist regime fell, and Bulgarian citizens were allowed freedom of travel again, some 218,000 Bulgarians left the country for Turkey. The subsequent emigration wave was prompted by continuously deteriorating economic conditions; furthermore, the first democratic elections in 1990 won by the renamed communist party resulted in 88,000 people leaving the country, once again, most of them being Bulgarian Turks. By 1992, emigration to Turkey resumed at a greater rate. However, this time they were pushed by economic reasons since the country’s economic decline affected especially ethnically mixed regions. The Bulgarian Turks were left without state subsidies or other forms of state assistance and experienced deep recession. According to the 1992 census, some 344,849 Bulgarians of Turkish origin had migrated to Turkey between 1989 and 1992, which resulted in significant demographic decline in southern Bulgaria.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{growth of}} the urban labor force {{exceeded}} even {{the growth rate of}} industrial employment, with surplus workers taking low-paying service jobs, many Mexican laborers migrated to the United States where wages were higher. During World War II, Mexico-United States relations had improved significantly from the previous three decades. The Bracero Program was set up with <b>orderly</b> <b>migration</b> flows were regulated by both governments. However. many Mexicans could not qualify for the program and migrated north illegally, without permission from their own government and without sanction from the U.S. authorities. In the post-war period as the U.S. economy boomed and as Mexico's entered a phase of rapid industrialization, the U.S. and Mexico cooperated closely on illegal border crossings by Mexicans. For the Mexican government, this loss of labor was [...] "a shameful exposure of the failure of the Mexican Revolution to provide economic well-being for many of Mexico's citizens, but it also drained the country of one of its greatest natural resources, a cheap and flexible labor supply." [...] The U.S. and Mexico cooperated closely to stop the flow, including the 1954 program called Operation Wetback.In the years following World War II, President Miguel Alemán Valdés's (1946-52) full-scale import-substitution program stimulated output by boosting internal demand. The government raised import controls on consumer goods but relaxed them on capital goods, which it purchased with international reserves accumulated during the war. The government spent heavily on infrastructure. By 1950 Mexico's road network had expanded to 21,000 kilometers, of which some 13,600 were paved. Large-scale dam building for hydroelectric power and flood control were initiated, most prominently the Papaloapan Project in southern Mexico. In recent years, there has been a re-evaluation of such infrastructure projects, particularly their negative impact on the environment.Mexico's strong economic performance continued into the 1960s, when GDP growth averaged about 7 percent overall and about 3 percent per capita. Consumer price inflation averaged only 3 percent annually. Manufacturing remained the country's dominant growth sector, expanding 7 percent annually and attracting considerable foreign investment. Mining grew {{at an annual rate of}} nearly 4 percent, trade at 6 percent, and agriculture at 3 percent. By 1970 Mexico had diversified its export base and become largely self-sufficient in food crops, steel, and most consumer goods. Although its imports remained high, most were capital goods used to expand domestic production.|$|E

40|$|Fish populations often {{comprise}} the largest biomass in a productive marine ecosystem. They typically play {{an essential role}} in inter-trophic energy transport, and serve as a mainstay for human consumption comprising roughly 16 % of the animal protein consumed by the world's population. Despite their ecological importance, there is substantial evidence that fish populations are declining worldwide, motivating the need for an ecosystem approach to fisheries management through ecosystem scale sensing of fish populations and behavior. In this Thesis, it is shown how the recently developed Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS) technique can be used to (1) quantify the acoustic scattering response of fish and remotely infer their physiological characteristics to enable species classification, and (2) remotely assess shoaling populations and quantify their group behavior in a variety of oceanic ecosystems. Shoal dynamics is studied by developing a novel Minimum Energy Flow (MEF) method to extract velocity and force fields driving motion from time-varying density images describing compressible or incompressible motion. The MEF method is applied to experimentally obtained density images, spanning spatial scales from micrometers to several kilometers. Using density image sequences describing cell splitting, for example, we show that cell division is driven by gradients in apparent pressure within a cell. By applying MEF to fish population density image sequences collected during the OAWRS 2003 experiment in the New Jersey strataform, we quantify (1) inter-shoal dynamics such as coalescence of fish groups over tens of kilometers, (2) fish mass flow between different parts of a large shoal and (3) the stresses acting on large fish shoals. Observations of fish shoals made during the OAWRS 2006 experiment in the Georges Bank are used to confirm general theoretical predictions on group behavior believed to apply in nature irrespective of animal species. By quantifying the formation processes of vast oceanic fish shoals during spawning, it is shown that (1) a rapid transition from disordered to highly synchronized behavior occurs as population density reaches a critical value; (2) organized group migration occurs after this transition; and (3) small sets of leaders significantly influence the actions of much larger groups. Several species of fish, birds, insects, mammals and other self propelled particles (SPPs) are known to group in large numbers and exhibit <b>orderly</b> <b>migrations.</b> The stability of this orderly state of motion in large SPP-groups is studied by developing a fluid-dynamic theory for flocking behavior based on perturbation analysis. It is shown that an SPP group where individuals assume the average velocity of their neighbours behaves as a fluid over large spatial scales. The existence of a critical population density above which perturbations to the orderly state of motion are damped is also shown. Further, it is shown that disturbances can propagate within mobile groups at speeds much higher than that of the individuals, facilitating rapid information transfer. These findings may explain how large shoals of fish and flocks of birds are able to stay together and migrate over large distances without breaking up. Fish shoals are ubiquitous in continental shelf environments and so are a major cause of acoustic clutter in long-range Navy sonars. It is shown that man-made airfilled cylindrical targets have very different spectral acousic scattering response than fish, {{so that they can be}} distinguished using multi-frequency measurements. It is also shown that the use of the Sonar Equation to model scattering from the man-made targets leads to large errors differing by up to an order of magnitude from measurements. A Greens' Theorem-based full-field model that describes scattering from vertically extended cylindrical targets in range-dependent ocean waveguides is shown to accurately describe the statistics of the targets' scattered field measured during OAWRS 2001, 2003 and 2006 experiments. Measurements of infrasound made during the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami event that occured on December 26, 2004 have suggested that large-scale tsunamis may produce deep-infrasonic signals that travel thousands of kilometers in the atmosphere. By developing an analytical model to describe air-borne infrasound generation by tsunamis and applying it to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, it is shown that the mass flow of air caused by changes in sea-level due to a tsunami can generate infrasound of sufficient amplitude to be picked up thousands of kilometers away. The possibility of detecting tsunamis via seismic means is also examined by developing an analytical model for quantifying very low frequency (0. 01 - 0. 1 Hz) Rayleigh waves generated by a tsunami. by Srinivasan Jagannathan.

40|$|Excerpt] Since the 1980 s, {{the number}} of Asians {{migrating}} for employment has tripled to {{more than three million}} annually. This large flow of workers has enormous consequences for the migrants and their countries of origin and destination. Migrants achieve dramatic boosts in their incomes, and their home countries benefit from remittances, which amount to billions of dollars for the region as a whole, and in many countries dwarf official development assistance and foreign direct investment. At the same time, destination countries’ economies are boosted by the arrival of hardworking and flexible labour forces. However, migration also has costs. Migrant workers can be exposed to exploitation and discrimination – especially the increasing numbers of women migrants who are vulnerable to labour trafficking. For source countries, the income from remittances has to be offset against the departure of many of their most energetic and skilled workers who could be contributing to national development. How can the Asia-Pacific region maximize the benefits of labour migration and minimize the costs? The International Labour Organization (ILO), the only international body with a specific mandate for international labour migration, can assist countries in their efforts to create more <b>orderly</b> and equitable <b>migration</b> systems. This booklet and the accompanying CDROM offer an introduction to the services that ILO can offer.

40|$|According to this review, since 1998 {{there has}} been a growing number of non-citizens working in Australia without {{permission}} and that their presence is very often organised by intermediaries who abuse and exploit these workers. Australia has a remarkably effective system of border control but since at least 1998 many of those who enter lawfully then proceed to take jobs and commence work when their visas do not permit work. It is not possible to calculate the total numbers of non- citizens working in Australia when they do not have permission but the minimum must be in the order of 50, 000 and the cohort from which the maximum must be drawn is {{the hundreds of thousands of}} non-citizens who enter Australia on tourist, business, working holiday-maker and student visas. Although the problem is of relatively recent origin it was not curbed at its commencement and there might now be in excess of 100, 000 non-citizens working without permission. In simple numerical terms it is the most significant problem facing Australian migration authorities; albeit a small number when compared with the total number of non-citizens who enter as visitors. The Government is concerned about the consequences of having significant numbers of non-citizens working without lawful permission. Those consequences include the vulnerability of such workers to severe exploitation, the distortion of the labour market and the tendency for their presence to be associated with cash industries and abuses of Australia’s taxation, employment and welfare laws. The absence of an effective deterrent against the employment of non-citizens who do not have permission to work is an abrogation of Australian sovereignty and a contradiction of the otherwise <b>orderly</b> pattern of <b>migration</b> and the refugee and humanitarian relief programs. It sends a message that will encourage vulnerable people to take any risk and use any means to enter Australia in the belief that they will be able to work and earn good money.

This paper outlines broad themes and specific recommendations that the Global Compact on Refugees should adopt on how to strengthen the global refugee protection system. The recommendations fall into several categories: (1) responsibility sharing {{for the protection of}} refugees; (2) filling in protection gaps; (3) balancing and replacing deterrence strategies with protection solutions; (4) refugee resettlement; and (5) building refugee self-sufficiency. Some of the key recommendations include: • the development of a responsibility-sharing formula to respond to large movements of refugees; • the development of an early warning system to identify and respond to nations in crisis; • the adoption of principles included in the Nansen and Migrants in Countries of Crisis initiatives; • the use of temporary protection measures to protect populations that flee natural disaster; • the adoption of model processes that ensure safe and voluntary return; • cooperation between destination and transit countries to expand refugee protections; • the provision of asylum and due process protections at borders; • the use of development assistance to ensure the self-sufficiency of refugees; • the adoption of a goal to resettle 10 percent of the global refugee population each year; • the establishment of a refugee matching system between refugees and resettlement countries; and • the adoption of coherent strategies, involving all sectors, to address large movements of refugees.

40|$|International {{migration}} of workers is growing. The global economic slowdown {{of the late}} 2000 s and the early 2010 s put a brake on employment opportunities in many countries across the world, and the crisis is not fully behind us. Nonetheless, the number of labor migrants is still increasing, and this publication shows that 2015 {{may well be a}} peak year for labor migration from Asian countries, both within the region and toward OECD countries outside of Asia. Neither political shifts nor persistent low oil prices have yet put a dent in the legal movement of Asian workers to employment in other countries. These large-scale flows are nothing new, yet policies are in flux, both for the management of labor migration and for the protection of migrant workers. Asian countries are making constant adjustments to their policies to better match the flows of migrant workers to the needs of their countries, to protect migrant workers, and to strengthen compliance mechanisms. There is increasing attention to migrant workers in multilateral frameworks. Two of the UN Sustainable Development Goals targets relate directly to the need to lower costs borne by migrant workers, especially those who leave their families to support them by working temporarily abroad. There has been a growing focus on fair recruitment practices—those which do not charge fees and related costs to migrants and allow them to keep a greater share of their earnings. Another important issue in protecting workers is to ensure that they are not exploited at the workplace, and this extends equally to those who are undocumented. The publication provides evidence on the extent of irregular migration in Asia. Reducing irregular migration requires a comprehensive approach, and cannot be limited to immigration enforcement measures only. The need to improve labor protections for all workers can be matched with mechanisms to ensure that legal matching between workers and employers can occur without exorbitant costs, and that appropriate channels are in place for <b>orderly</b> and safe <b>migration.</b> One of the most vulnerable groups of labor migrants are women working in domestic work and home-based care work, particularly since their work is often not recognized as real work with economic value, and as they work in isolation in the household of employers. The chapter in this year’s publication highlights the importance of gender responsiveness in managing labor migration and in developing policies to protect all migrant workers. Since 2011, the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have organized an annual Roundtable on Labor Migration in Asia. Since 2013, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has also participated, and the three organizations have put together an annual report on the themes of the roundtable. The February 2016 event, held in Tokyo, focused on Safeguarding Labor Migrants from Home to Workplace. The question of how best to ensure that migrants are not subject to harm as they move abroad to work is one on which governments in Asia are working, on behalf of their own citizens and those who have come as migrants. This publication is intended to help make a contribution to the work of policy planners, experts, and practitioners in the region...|$|R
