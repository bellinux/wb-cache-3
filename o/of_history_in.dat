5|$|The Swiss {{historian}} Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) in his The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860), by contrast, {{defined the}} Renaissance as {{the period between}} Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance {{the emergence of the}} modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential {{in the development of the}} modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. However, Buckhardt has been accused of setting forth a linear Whiggish view <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>in</b> seeing the Renaissance as the origin of the modern world.|$|E

After the Arbiter's defeat, Joker and Tiz speak with Arecia and show her the memories of Class Zero {{and the people of}} Orience to make her reconsider restarting the experiment. After speaking with Machina and Rem, Arecia decides to abandon the experiment and returns the two to human form. In an alternate ending, Arecia chooses to remove the crystals from Orience's history, creating a new timeline where the war never occurred and the world's population can live happily.|$|E

5|$|Renovation {{began in}} 1994 under the {{direction}} of architect Gerhard Spangenberg, with the objective of returning the building so far as possible to its original condition while not ignoring the events of the more recent past. The first priority was the removal of iron girders, particle board, and chipboards. Relics of the GDR period deemed worthy of preservation were placed either in the Museum of German History in the former Prussian arsenal or in the House <b>of</b> <b>History</b> <b>in</b> Bonn. The original murals and reliefs, painted over and enclosed during the GDR period, were then restored. The fountain in the Klosterstraße vestibule was accurately recreated. Four bronze bear sculptures by Ignatius Taschner were returned from the Märkisches Museum and reinstalled on replacement stone columns in the Judenstraße vestibule. Exterior restoration of the building required either restoration or replacement with replicas of some 180 sculptural elements from the tower, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures, and one of the columns, which had bomb damage and had merely been patched. In addition, the original mansard roof was reconstructed in 1998/99 on the west, main facade facing Jüdenstraße. The technical facilities were also updated, including ventilation equipment, elevators, lighting, and plumbing. It proved impossible to use the tower for offices because it lacked the second exit required by safety regulations. This was later rectified by the addition of office space in the roof cavity.|$|E

Correlation <b>of</b> gene <b>histories</b> <b>in</b> {{the human}} genome determines the {{patterns}} of genetic variation (haplotype structure) and is crucial to understanding genetic factors in common diseases. We derive closed analytical expressions for the correlation <b>of</b> gene <b>histories</b> <b>in</b> established demographic models for genetic evolution and show how to extend the analysis to more realistic (but more complicated) models of demographic structure. We identify two contributions to the correlation <b>of</b> gene <b>histories</b> <b>in</b> divergent populations: linkage disequilibrium, and differences <b>in</b> the demographic <b>history</b> <b>of</b> individuals <b>in</b> the sample. These two factors contribute to correlations at different length scales: the former at small, and the latter at large scales.
