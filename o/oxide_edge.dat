25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate <b>oxide</b> <b>edge</b> (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very different from what we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E

This novel structure is successfully fabricated by spacer formation, partial wet etching of a gate oxide, and in situ vacuum encapsulation. The {{electrical characteristics}} of the GAA poly-Si TFTs with vacuum cavities are superior to those of traditional GAA poly-Si TFTs because the vacuum cavity serves as an offset region to decrease the leakage current in the OFF state and as a field-induced drain (FID) to sustain the on-current in the ON state. In addition, regardless of whether static or dynamic electrical stress is imposed on these devices, the GAA poly-Si TFTs with vacuum cavities exhibit superior reliability to traditional ones owing to the simultaneous reduction of vertical and lateral electric fields near the drain junction during bias stressing due to the greater equivalent gate oxide thickness on the gate electrode edges.

40|$|Halogen lamp {{annealing}} (Heatpulse 210 T) {{has been}} successfully applied to combine the following tasks in a single step: the reflow of LPCVD PSG layers, the recrystallization of doped poly-Si interconnections, the formation of shallow n~-junctions using the same poly-Si as diffusion source. Recrystalllzed in situ P-doped poly-Si layers had a resistivity of 0. 6 - 0. 8 mt~-cm, as low as the best reported values obtained on after-doped samples. An FTIR analysis of the PSG layers revealed structural changes leading to continuous modification of their optical properties during the annealing step it-self, which, consequently, determines their annealing efficiency. Obtained results can contradict expectations {{on the basis of}} well-established furnace annealing performance of the structures. In particular, the P-concentration dependence of the PSG reflow can be dominated by the above effects, and recrystallization f poly-Si can also depend on the PSG coating on the top.

40|$|Self-aligned silicidation is a {{well-known}} process to reduce the source, drain, and gate parasitic resistances of submicron metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. This process is particularly useful for devices built on very thin Si layer (similar to 1000 Angstrom or less) on insulators. Since the amount of Si available for silicidation {{is limited by the}} thickness of the Si layer, once the Si in the source and drain region is fully consumed during silicidation, excessive silicide formation could lead to void formation near the silicide/silicon interface beneath the <b>oxide</b> <b>edge.</b> In this article, we study the effects of different metals (Ti, Ni, Co, and Co/Ti bilayer) with varying thickness on the formation of voids.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the simulation of the contrast in X-ray section topographs due to the strains induced in silicon single crystals by various types of technologically relevant crystal defect. A general introduction to the field of X- ray topography is presented, illustrating that this technique is well suited to the characterisation of defect induced strain in highly perfect crystals. A review of X-ray dynamical theory is given, culminating in Takagi's equations for a crystal containing a defect. Techniques for simulating X-ray section topographs, based on Takagi's equations, are discussed. Computer simulation of section topographs has been used throughout this work to deduce the microscopic strains from the X-ray topographic images. The volume of oxygen precipitates in MCZ silicon was found to increase linearly as lnT, where T is the annealing temperature of the sample. Results suggest {{that the vast majority of}} precipitates which survive to maturity are nucleated at approximately the same time, subsequently growing at the same rate. An industrial role for simulation in conjunction with experiment is proposed, in the evaluation of the precipitate depth and the deformation parameter, C, representing the precipitate strain magnitude. The technological relevance of these two quantities is discussed. The effect of surface relaxation on the structure of images due to precipitates has been investigated. The critical depth (_z(_crit)) at which the effect of surface relaxation became negligible was found to increase linearly with lnC. Simulations have been generated for crystals containing oxygen precipitate distributions, with denuded zones. Characteristic image features have been discussed. Studies on precipitate resolvability revealed that the critical separation for two precipitates to be just resolved increases linearly as lnC. An extensive study of intrinsic gettering has been undertaken, in terms of decorated dislocations. The strain distribution due to precipitate decoration was modelled by the cylindrical inclusion model. It was shown that even for very low precipitate strains, precipitate decoration is distinguishable from the associated dislocation by section topography. Hence, an industrial role is proposed for simulation, in conjunction with experiment, in the parameterisation of the strain induced by decorated dislocations. To fully explore the use of the cylindrical inclusion model in this way, the variation in the inclusion strain magnitude was determined as a function of the precipitate strain and density, and the size of the precipitate distribution. It was found that the strain magnitude of the equivalent cylindrical inclusion must increase more rapidly relative to the precipitate deformation parameter for low-order reflections than for high-order reflections. Decorated dislocations have been shown to be resolvable by section topography even in the most dislocation-rich sihcon samples. The industrial usefulness of this characteristic is discussed. A study was made of the critical deformation parameter, C(_crit), for decorated dislocations to be just resolved, as a function of the separation, k, of the dislocations. For k greater than about 45 µm, the variation of In(C(_crit) with k was linear. For smaller separations, the linearity breaks down because of the increasingly important strain contribution due to the dislocations. The strains induced by oxide films and devices in the silicon substrates onto which they are formed have been investigated. Experimental section topographs of <b>oxide</b> <b>edge</b> regions and devices on silicon have been simulated, and the visibility of the extra set of fringes found in simulations by another worker has been examined. The variation in image structure with device position on the entrance and exit surfaces has been investigated. An absolute minimum on device width detectable by section topography of lµm has been found. However, this minimum was found to depend on device-induced strain, and for values of strain characteristic of contemporary devices, the minimum detectable device width was found to be at least 3. 5 µm. This is above the limits set by the geometric and other constraints of the experimental technique. A thorough study has been made of the cancellation of opposing strains due to opposite edges of a device. The total distortion induced by the device was found to be minimised by reducing the device width and increasing the force per unit length, 5, along the device edges. Quantitative information has been obtained on this process. It was found that the fractional increase in lattice parameter at a fixed point, due to device-induced strain, increases linearly with S, with increasing gradient for increasing device width. It was shown that the narrower the device, the faster the relative fall-off in fractional increase in lattice parameter with increasing displacement from one edge of the device...|$|E

Hence, the relationship between surface charge and surface potential on edge surfaces cannot be described using the Gouy−Chapman relation, because of a spillover of negative electrostatic potential from the basal surface onto the edge surface. While surface complexation models can be modified to account for these features, a predictive fit of experimental data was not possible until recently, because of uncertainty regarding the densities and intrinsic pKa values of edge functional groups.

The surface charge and ion adsorption characteristics of the receiving soil will {{play an important role in}} the success of this disposal strategy. The surface charge characteristics of 6 soils with contrasting chemical and physical properties were studied using charge balance principles. The point of zero net proton charge density, point of zero salt effect and point of zero net charge, and the concentrations of permanent and variable charge as a function of pH, were determined for each soil. The presence and magnitude of permanent negative surface charge was largely dependant on clay mineralogy. All soils displayed increasing negative surface charge density with increasing pH. The magnitude of increase for any particular soil was dependent on the type and amount of colloids exhibiting variable surface charge. The increased negative surface charge was attributed to the ionisation of functional groups on organic matter, hydrous Fe and Al <b>oxides,</b> and <b>edge</b> sites of kaolinite and smectite. The variation in surface charge with pH conformed to charge balance principles for soils containing a mixture of both permanent and variable surface charge, but not for soils containing predominantly permanent surface charge. Proton-consuming processes (e. g. adsorption on permanent charge sites, neutralisation of inherent alkalinity) influenced the overall charge balance, particularly for soils with predominantly permanent surface charge. Ammonium adsorption from landfill leachate was measured as a function of pH for each soil type. Increased negative surface charge resulted in increased ammonium adsorption, and for most soils the preference of the newly created adsorption sites for ammonium remained relatively constant. Since many soils contain a mixture of colloids with permanent and variable surface charge, these charge characteristics and their effect on individual soil properties, contaminant availability, and contaminant mobility must be taken into account when evaluating the suitability of land for wastewater re-use.

We illustrate that the interpretation of injection experiments is ambiguous for time-resolved optical measurements (TA and time-resolved luminescence) because nonradiative recombination processes at the oxide−QD interface have the same spectroscopic signature as electron injection.
