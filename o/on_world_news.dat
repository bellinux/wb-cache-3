5|$|The early 1990s {{also served}} up {{a series of}} {{difficult}} experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings. On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in Newsday. The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton {{was having an affair with}} Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen. In January 1994, he locked horns with his executive producer <b>on</b> <b>World</b> <b>News</b> Tonight, Emily Rooney. The public firing of Rooney made national headlines, and put Jennings on the defensive.|$|E

25|$|Schieffer led the CBS Evening News {{to become}} the #2 evening news broadcast, ahead of ABC's World News Tonight. The death of anchor Peter Jennings in 2005 coupled with the {{adoption}} of a dual-anchor format <b>on</b> <b>World</b> <b>News</b> Tonight and life-threatening injuries suffered by Bob Woodruff when an Iraqi military convoy he rode in hit a road-side bomb, leaving Elizabeth Vargas as sole anchor, in January 2006 put the ABC News division in flux. When Charles Gibson was appointed as anchor of World News Tonight, ABC regained stability and momentum to regain the #2 spot. Bob Schieffer's final broadcast of the CBS Evening News occurred on August 31, 2006. Russ Mitchell filled in for the following two nights (September 1 and 4), after which he was succeeded on September 5 by Katie Couric.|$|E

At {{the peak of}} his popularity, Jennings was named [...] "Best Anchor" [...] by the Washington Journalism Review in 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992. The Radio and Television News Directors Association awarded Jennings its highest honor, the Paul White Award in 1995, in recognition of his lifetime contributions to journalism.

The Simpson trial was the number-one news story for NBC and CBS in 1995, while at ABC, coverage of the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina dominated the newscast. Jennings stated in a 1996 interview that he was satisfied that ABC came in third in terms of O.J. coverage. [...] "I'm very pleased that it didn't crowd out {{as much of the}} rest of the world <b>on</b> <b>World</b> <b>News</b> Tonight as it did on other broadcasts," [...] he said.

40|$|Understanding topic {{hierarchies}} in text {{streams and}} their evolution patterns over time {{is very important}} in many applications. In this pa-per, we propose an evolutionary multi-branch tree clustering method for streaming text data. We build evolutionary trees in a Bayesian online filtering framework. The tree construction is formulated as an online posterior estimation problem, which considers both the likeli-hood of the current tree and conditional prior given the previous tree. We also introduce a constraint model to compute the conditional prior of a tree in the multi-branch setting. Experiments <b>on</b> real <b>world</b> <b>news</b> data demonstrate that our algorithm can better incorporate his-torical tree information and is more efficient and effective than the traditional evolutionary hierarchical clustering algorithm...|$|R
500|$|In late March, viewers started {{noticing that}} Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and {{unhealthy}} during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored World News Tonight {{for the last}} time; his failing health also prevented him from covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message <b>on</b> <b>World</b> <b>News</b> Tonight {{that he had been}} diagnosed with lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. [...] "As some of you now know, I have learned {{in the last couple of}} days that I have lung cancer," [...] he said. [...] "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit." [...] Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.|$|E
500|$|Politics {{dominated}} {{network news}} in 1992. Jennings moderated the final debate among the Democratic presidential candidates in March, and anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is Ross Perot? and a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June. On September 9, 1992, ABC {{announced that it}} would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged sound bites. [...] "We're aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put {{at least some of the}} blame on us," [...] Jennings told viewers <b>on</b> <b>World</b> <b>News</b> Tonight. [...] "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television." [...] After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, D.C. junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte.|$|E

40|$|From {{climate change}} {{to the war on}} terror, from {{financial}} meltdowns to forced migrations, from pandemics to world poverty and from humanitarian disasters to the denial of human rights, these and other global crises represent the dark side of our global age.

When represented within today’s <b>world</b> <b>news</b> ecology such ‘global crises’ can also shape processes of globalization — deepening our sense of globality and, possibly, contributing to what Ulrich Beck’s discerns as a ‘cosmopolitan outlook’ (Beck, 2006). With too few exceptions, however, researchers have yet to theorize and examine today’s endemic, interpenetrating and proliferating global crises or their complex dependencies <b>on</b> the <b>world’s</b> <b>news</b> media and emergent forms of global journalism.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{evolutionary}} multi-branch tree clustering method to model hierarchical topics and their evolutionary patterns over time. The method builds evolutionary trees in a Bayesian online filtering framework. The tree construction is formulated as an online posterior estimation problem, which well balances both the fitness {{of the current}} tree and the smoothness between trees. The state-of-the-art multi-branch clustering method, Bayesian rose trees, is employed to generate a topic tree with a high fitness value. A constraint model is also introduced to preserve the smoothness between trees. A set of comprehensive experiments <b>on</b> real <b>world</b> <b>news</b> data demonstrates that the proposed method better incorporates historical tree information and is more efficient and effective than the traditional evolutionary hierarchical clustering algorithm. In contrast to our previous method [32], we implement two additional baseline algorithms to compare them with our algorithm. We also evaluate {{the performance of the}} clus-tering algorithm based on multiple constraint trees. Furthermore, two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our algorithm in helping users understand the major hierarchical topic evolutionary patterns in text data.
