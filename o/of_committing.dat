5|$|Although this {{represented}} {{a huge number}} of available aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) was still recovering from losses suffered at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June. While units were largely reconstituted in terms of quantity by this time, pilot quality was in clear decline. Moreover, though the overall number of planes committed to battle by 12October dwarfed any force that Japan had previously fielded in the air, the U.S. Navy's Fast Carrier Force was capable <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> a much larger, significantly better-trained force.|$|E
30|$|The status {{evaluation}} {{considers the}} existing commits in each repository individually. Due {{to the nature}} of DVCS, old data is almost never deleted, and commits are cumulative. Thus, if commit N is created over commit N – 1, the existence <b>of</b> <b>commit</b> N in a given repository implies that commit N – 1 also exists in the repository. In this way, by using set theory, it is possible to subtract the set <b>of</b> <b>commits</b> in the local repository from the set <b>of</b> <b>commits</b> in its peers, resulting in the set <b>of</b> <b>commits</b> not pulled yet. In this case, local repository will be behind its peers (arrow down in Fig. 8). Conversely, subtracting the sets in the inverse order will result in the set <b>of</b> <b>commits</b> not pushed yet, meaning that local repository is ahead of its peers (arrow up). When both sets are empty, local repository is synchronized (green checkmark in Fig. 8) and when both sets have elements, it is both ahead and behind its peer (arrow up and down in Fig. 8).|$|R

5|$|In 1945, {{after the}} Soviets drove the Germans out of Poland, Dangić was {{captured}} by the Red Army and extradited to Yugoslavia's new Communist authorities. Accused <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> war crimes, he was immediately arrested and charged. Dangić was then tried, found guilty by a court in Sarajevo and sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad on 22 August 1947. According to the indictment against Mihailović and others, Dangić was awarded the Order of the Star of Karađorđe by the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{on the recommendation of}} Mihailović.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Castro {{joined the}} Party of the Cuban People (Partido Ortodoxo), founded by veteran {{politician}} Eduardo Chibás. A charismatic figure, Chibás advocated social justice, honest government and political freedom, while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though Chibás came {{third in the}} 1948 general election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf. Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers and Castro soon received a death threat urging {{him to leave the}} university, but refusing and beginning to carry a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends. In later years, anti-Castro dissidents accused him <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> gang-related assassinations at the time, but these remain unproven.|$|E

5|$|The President of Croatia enjoys immunity—the {{president}} {{may not be}} arrested, nor can any criminal proceedings be instituted against the president without prior consent from the Constitutional Court. The only case in which immunity does not apply is if {{the president has been}} caught in the act <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> a criminal offense, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for more than five years. In such a case the state body that has detained the president must notify the President of the Constitutional Court immediately.|$|E
5|$|The general's {{stance on}} human rights issues has also been quite controversial. It has been {{reported}} that he was behind the Army's refusal to provide any information on the 1984 massacre at the village of Putis. Requests issued on June 2008 by prosecutor Rubén López for a detailed report on the military personnel deployed there at that time were answered the following month by the Defense Ministry stating that the Army did not have any information on the subject in its archives. Donayre also joined a campaign to raise funds to defend armed forces personnel accused <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> human rights abuses during the internal conflict in Peru.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} at Hill 303 {{would be only}} one of {{the first of a series}} of atrocities the U.S. forces accused North Korean soldiers <b>of</b> <b>committing.</b> In late 1953 the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations, led by Joseph McCarthy, conducted an investigation of up to 1,800 reported incidents of war crimes allegedly committed throughout the Korean War. The Hill 303 massacre was one of the first to be investigated. Survivors of the incident were called to testify before the committee, and the U.S. government concluded that the North Korean army violated the terms of the Geneva Convention, and condemned its actions.|$|E

5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the plan was that, politically at least, it abandoned most of eastern Belgium to the Germans. Militarily it would put the Allied rear {{at right angles to}} the French frontier defences; while for the British, their communications located at the Bay of Biscay ports, would be parallel to their front. Despite the risk <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> forces to central Belgium and an advance to the Schedlt or Dyle lines, which would be vulnerable to an outflanking move, Maurice Gamelin, the French commander, approved the plan and it remained the Allied strategy upon the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Germans {{allowed the}} Judenrat {{to set up}} a {{judicial}} system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from the jail, or leaving the ghetto without leave. In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility for carrying out the death sentence imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into the ghetto. The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the BEA's {{preliminary}} report, the investigation into Lubitz found he had been treated for suicidal tendencies prior to his training as a commercial pilot and had been temporarily denied a US pilot's license because of these treatments for depression. The final report of the BEA confirmed the preliminary report's findings, saying the co-pilot began showing symptoms of psychotic depression. For five years, Lubitz had frequently been unable to sleep {{because of what he}} believed were vision problems; he consulted over forty doctors and feared he was going blind. Motivated by the fear that blindness would cause him to lose his pilot's licence, he began conducting online research about methods <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> suicide before deciding to crash Flight 9525.|$|E
5|$|Néstor {{established}} {{a law firm}} that Cristina joined in 1979. The firm worked for banks and financial groups that filed eviction lawsuits, which had a growing rate at the time because the 1050 ruling of the Central Bank had increased the interest rates for mortgage loans. The Kirchners acquired twenty-one land lots at cheap prices as {{they were about to}} be auctioned. Their law firm defended military personnel accused <b>of</b> <b>committing</b> crimes during the Dirty War. Forced disappearances were common at the time, but unlike other lawyers the Kirchners never signed a habeas corpus. Julio César Strassera, prosecutor in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas against the military, critizised the Kirchners' lack of legal actions against the military, and considered their later interest in the issue a form of hipocrisy.|$|E

Policing in London was—and still is—divided between two forces: the Metropolitan Police with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the City of London Police with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9km2) of the city centre.
