He has been hired as a {{supervisor}} at another plantation, not far from his <b>old</b> <b>place</b> of work. He searches for Siti and the couple's children, but none of his old coworkers know where they are. Unbeknownst to van Kempen, his children have been raised as natives and wear the traditional clothes, although they have also received a Western education. Adolf has become a hunter, while Annie stays {{at home with their}} mother.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 15th and early 16th centuries, the Hussey family owned the manor of Old Sleaford. John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford was {{executed}} for treason {{for his part}} in the Lincolnshire Rising. The manor and his residence at <b>Old</b> <b>Place</b> reverted to the Crown and were later sold to Robert Carre. George Carre or Carr from Northumberland had settled in Sleaford by 1522 when he was described as a wool merchant. His son Robert bought Hussey's land and the castle and manor of New Sleaford from Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. His eldest surviving son Robert, founded Carre's Grammar School in 1604, and his youngest son Edward was created a baronet; his son founded Sleaford Hospital in 1636. The last male descendent died in 1683 and the heiress, Isabella Carre, married John Hervey, Earl of Bristol, in whose family the estates remained until the 1970s. The Carres and Herveys had a strong influence: in addition to extracting dues from their tenants, they took leading tradesmen to the Exchequer Court to gain legal force behind their monopoly on charging tolls on market and cattle traders and for driving animals through the town.|$|E

As discussed by Sri Lankan historians such as Paul E Peiris, Karthigesu Indrapala and others, pre-Christian stone inscriptions of Sri Lanka point to the extensive use of the Sinhala language in local administration.

25|$|There soon {{followed}} a period playing in Copenhagen, Denmark which McGregor {{identified as a}} turning point in their musical approach. They returned to London and were subsequently to be found playing almost exclusively at The <b>Old</b> <b>Place</b> in Gerrard Street, the former home of Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club which had recently been transformed into a virtual laboratory for the emerging British avant garde jazz scene. Because of this, they are still considered a seminal influence on the new generation of British jazz musicians coming through in the late 1960s. Artists such as Keith Tippett, Evan Parker, John Stevens and John Surman have long hailed them as true pioneers and a massive influence. However, by late 1965 the group was also beginning to fragment. Feza returned to Copenhagen, while Dyani and Moholo went on a South American tour with the soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy – subsequently recording the album The Forest and the Zoo for the ESP-Disk label. Meanwhile, Moyake had decided to return to South Africa permanently even before their arrival in the UK.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Place</b> (...) is a ruin of an Elizabethan manor house, {{built by}} Griffith Williams for his {{daughter}} and son-in-law Edmund Vann in 1596. It is often mistakenly called Llantwit Castle. [...] The Williams family were successful lawyers {{and part of the}} rising minor gentry who were loathed by the Seys of Boverton and the Stradlings of St Donats. Vann was fined over £1,000 for being involved in a scuffle in central Llantwit on a Sunday which led him to take on the Sey family and seek his revenge.|$|E

The king had originally expressed surprise at Edward's request asking him [...] "What could you possibly want that queer <b>old</b> <b>place</b> for? Those damn weekends I suppose", but then smiled and gave his permission. Edward's previous residence had been York House, part of St. James's Palace in London, which he had thought [...] "more an office than a home."

500|$|The South Melbourne Football Club was {{established}} in 1874 {{and was one of}} the founding clubs in the VFL/AFL. During the 1920s and 1930s, an influx of players from Western Australia led to the team becoming known as the [...] "swans" [...] within the VFL. In 1982, South Melbourne transferred to Sydney, dropping its <b>old</b> <b>place</b> name but retaining its nickname as the Sydney Swans. The swan, however, is no longer a black swan but a white swan, derived from existing red and white colours of South Melbourne and the lake-bound white swans of Albert Park near its original home ground. The white swan is often combined with, or replaced by, a white Sydney Opera House-style logo.|$|E
500|$|On 9 November 1858, the Bury and Norwich Post {{recorded}} {{that earlier}} that month, a waistcoat, silk handkerchief, and £3 in gold {{were stolen from}} a labourer, Richard Butcher, who lived in Stanford-le-Hope. Butcher had gone to Murrell, asking him to use his skills to locate and retrieve his stolen property; when Murrell failed to do so, Butcher turned to the police to apprehend the culprit. Other accounts were passed down in local folk accounts; Maple interviewed an eighty-six-year-old Mrs Petchey, who stated that [...] "My mother lost a brooch, and Murrell told her who had stolen it. It was her own sister-in-law. He wouldn't tell her, though, unless she promised not to tell anyone. The brooch was back in its <b>old</b> <b>place</b> a few days later." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1925, Provincial Highway 5, the Evergreen Route, {{followed}} the surveyed rail line {{route of the}} Canadian Northern Railway, later the Canadian National Railway. [...] Provincial Highway 5 had a western terminus at Lloydminster located on the Alberta - Saskatchewan border. [...] When the province was surveyed, the road evolved from a dirt road to a gravel road. [...] This was finally improved to an all-weather road known as Provincial Highway 5 from the Alberta–Saskatchewan border bypassing Saskatoon to the north, and continuing on to the Manitoba–Saskatchewan border. [...] Just as the rail line went through Aberdeen, Warman, and Langham, so too did Provincial Highway 5. [...] In 1925, access from Saskatoon to Provincial Highway 5 was via Provincial Highway 12 which was a route due north of the city. [...] The other connection was Provincial Highway 27 which traveled east and north from Saskatoon connecting to Provincial Highway 5 at the junction located at the town of Aberdeen. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the highway was straightened and widened. [...] During this process, the current Saskatchewan Highway 5 connected Humboldt and Saskatoon in a more direct west and east highway. [...] The <b>old</b> <b>place</b> names of Warman, Aberdeen, Vonda, Prudhomme, Dana, Bruno, and Carmel located on Provincial Highway 5 were no longer place names along Saskatchewan Highway 5. [...] Now the Highway 2 concurrency was the only north-south stretch between Humboldt and Saskatoon and Meacham the only place name. [...] On [...] August 15, 1970 the Yellowhead was opened for the northern Trans-Canada route and the north western half of Provincial Highway 5 between Saskatoon and Lloydminster was designated as Saskatchewan Highway 16, the Yellowhead route.|$|E

2500|$|As {{late as the}} 1920s, Coventry {{was being}} {{described}} as [...] "The best preserved Medieval City in England".

[...] However, the narrow medieval streets proved ill-suited to modern motor traffic, and during the 1930s many old streets were cleared to make way for wider roads, creating an odd mix of medieval and contemporary streets and buildings.|$|E

2500|$|In 1890, a {{newspaper}} reported that [...] "the former invincible Cranston" [...] was not {{playing to the}} level he had in 1889 -- [...] "The old men, instead of improving with age, are rather deteriorating {{in the quality of}} their play." [...] The New York Tribune offered a more positive take on Cranston in November 1890:"John Cranston, the Crimson's center rusher, {{is one of the oldest}} and strongest men on either team. He has played four years on the Harvard team, becoming center rusher in his freshman year. He played a right guard in the two following years, but returned to his <b>old</b> <b>place,</b> because there was no one else to fill the <b>old</b> <b>place.</b> Cranston is aggressive and active and always gives his opponent a great deal of work." [...] The Springfield Republican wrote that Cranston was not a great blocker and [...] "is rather pugnacious and wastes time splitting heads; but he is a strong, heavy man, and will do his part very nearly as it ought to be done." [...] At the end of the 1890 season, Cranston was again selected for [...] on the College Football All-America Team, this time as the center. In 1891, The New York Times reported that Cranston had left Harvard:"Cranston is another man who will be missed. Year before last he played in the center but last year he was the left guard. Late in the Spring Cranston withdrew from college, and in all probability will not enter Harvard again. Although his game last year was not up to his usual standard, he was an extremely valuable man." ...|$|E

She {{converted}} it into a residence, what locals came to call the [...] "Banning Mansion." [...] She lived there several years with her daughters, Mary Banning (1871–1956) and Lucy Banning (1876–1929). The enormous old structure made a charming home, which was cut up into suitable parlors and bedrooms and elegantly furnished, with a fine view.

2500|$|Construction on the North Shore Branch {{began on}} March 17, 1884 {{after a number}} of legal proceedings; a party of {{surveyors}} started marking out the grades and they broke ground for the roadbed of the line. In order to construct the line, the rights to a horse car line operating in Richmond Terrace were bought. The right of way for the line followed the North Shore of Staten Island and reached a ferry to Elizabeth, NJ, which had been operating since the mid-1700s. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad built about [...] of rock fill out from shore as well as along the Kill Van Kull to deal with opposition from property owners in the neighborhood of Sailor's Snug Harbor. This additional expenditure cost $25,000. In order to get property for the line to pass over the cove at Palmer's run, the company had to undergo a contest in litigation.

2500|$|The stadium {{has also}} been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a Sunday Night Baseball {{telecast}} in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in {{the old and new}} stadiums saying that [...] "As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait {{to get back in the}} dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout." [...] Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent. The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. [...] "This is a very easy place to play now", said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. [...] "Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here." [...] In his autobiography [...] "The Closer", the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote these comments about the new stadium's atmosphere: [...] "It doesn’t hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the <b>old</b> <b>place</b> did. The old Stadium was our 10th man—a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe I’m wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that. Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, Jeter said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: [...] "It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn’t get any better. The old stadium, if you were at the stadium, in the stands, the only place you could see the game was in your seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you." ...|$|E
