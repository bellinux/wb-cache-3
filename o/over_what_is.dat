5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} in the fields between West and East Worldham reveal that the area has been visited and inhabited {{since at least the}} Palaeolithic era. An Iron Age Hillfort, dated to around 100 BC, lay on the summit of King John's Hill, to the east of East Worldham. The Romans built a road from Chichester to Silchester which passed below the hill <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Green Street and Pookles Lane.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{concerns}} of the Irish discussed in the first letter was <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now known as Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would {{no longer be able to}} pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.|$|E
5|$|Cortés {{was troubled}} by news that his enemies in New Spain were gaining control of Mexico; when Cortés {{received}} news that Pedro Moreno would soon be arriving in Honduras with many colonists, and official documents from the Audiencia of Santo Domingo, he decided against further exploration and instead returned to Mexico, leaving on 26 April 1526. He took Pizacura to Mexico with him, where he died not long afterwards of a fatal illness. Gonzalo de Sandoval also returned to Mexico, marching overland via Guatemala. Cortés installed his cousin Hernando de Saavedra as governor of the new territory, and left Saavedra with instructions to treat the natives fairly; however Saavedra's actions reopened underlying divisions between rival groups of colonists. Saavedra rapidly established rule <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the department of Olancho; he sent Bartolomé de Celada inland {{to find a good}} location for a new Spanish town. He founded Frontera de Cáceras upon the savannah of the Olancho valley, near the Indian towns of Telica and Escamilpa, within the disputed territory between Honduras and Nicaragua.|$|E

5|$|He {{also sought}} the {{opinions}} {{of many of the}} astronomers to whom he had sent Mysterium, among them Reimarus Ursus (Nicolaus Reimers Bär)—the imperial mathematician to Rudolph II and a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe. Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute <b>over</b> (<b>what</b> <b>is</b> now called) the Tychonic system with Tycho. Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus. Through their letters, Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability). But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues.|$|E
5|$|John Wilson (1847) {{writes that}} the tomb lies {{about two or three}} hundred yards to the north of Jacob's Well, across the valley. He {{describes}} it as 'a small solid erection {{in the form of a}} wagon roof, <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> supposed to be the patriarch’s grave, with a small pillar or altar at each of its extremities, sometimes called the tombs of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the middle of an enclosure without a covering. Many visitors names, in the Hebrew and Samaritan characters, are written on the walls of this enclosure.' One of the inscriptions is said to intimate the tomb's repair by a Jew from Egypt, Elijah son of Meir, around 1749. Wilson adds that 'The Jews of Nablus take upon themselves the duty of keeping the tomb in order. They applied to us for a subscription to aid in making some repairs and we complied with their request'. These Hebrew and Samaritan inscriptions were still visible on the white plastered walls as late as 1980, as were small lamps in an internal recess, probably donated by Jews during the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E
