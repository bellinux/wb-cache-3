5|$|Undismayed by {{the loss}} of his papers, Bottomley {{embarked}} on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the Hansard reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, floated on the London Stock Exchange with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the Lord Mayor-elect of London, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London Evening News, and Sir Roper Lethbridge, the Conservative MP for Kensington North. This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These <b>outgoings</b> and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of £40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.|$|E

25|$|Despite New Zealand's {{persistent}} current account deficits, the balance on external {{goods and services}} has generally been positive. In FY 2014, export receipts exceeded imports by NZ$3.9 billion. There has been an investment income imbalance or net outflow for debt-servicing of external loans. In FY 2014, New Zealand's investment income {{from the rest of}} the world was NZ$7 billion, versus <b>outgoings</b> of NZ$16.3 billion, a deficit of NZ$9.3 billion. The proportion of the current account deficit that is attributable to the investment income imbalance (a net outflow to the Australian-owned banking sector) grew from one third in 1997 to roughly 70% in 2008.|$|E

25|$|The manor of Sandwell was {{a useful}} {{windfall}} for a monarchy perennially {{in debt and}} was used to reduce future <b>outgoings.</b> It was included {{in a group of}} properties granted by the Crown to Dame Lucy Clifford in exchange for her share of a pension that she had inherited from the estate of the Marquess of Montagu When she died in 1557, it passed to her grandson, John Cutte, who later sold it to the Whorwood family of Compton Hallows, near Kinver. During the 16th century some of the priory buildings were renovated to create a comfortable private home, known as Priory House. The church was still largely standing in 1588 but was demolished shortly after.|$|E
25|$|Brian Cornwall died in 1391. The date is {{variously}} {{given as}} 5 May, and 18 August: the inquisition held at Standlake, Oxfordshire, in early September recorded {{it as the}} Friday after the Assumption and stated that John, his heir, was 24 and more years of age – the best evidence for his birth date. It noted that his estates in the county included the manor of Asthall-under-Wychwood, which was held in chief: this was a property that went back to Richard of Cornwall himself, who was granted it in 1227 by his brother, Henry III. There was also Idbury, held of the Earl of March. The inquisition taken at Bridgnorth the following day recorded the manor of Kinlet, also held of the Earl of March, as worth nothing beyond <b>outgoings.</b> It also listed various pieces {{of land in the}} vicinity of Kinlet, including a small estate at Catsley. At Leominster an inquisition recorded Brian's moiety of Ashton as held in joint feoffment with his wife Maud, who had survived him. The succession posed few legal issues and on 25 September the escheators were ordered to hand over to John Cornwall all his lands held in chief.|$|E
2500|$|Confident {{of their}} [...] "specialness", Orton and Halliwell refused {{to work for}} long periods. They subsisted on Halliwell's money (and {{unemployment}} benefits) and were forced to follow an ascetic life to restrict their <b>outgoings</b> to £5 a week. From 1957 to 1959, they worked in six-month stretches at Cadbury's {{to raise money for}} a new flat; they moved into a small, austere flat at 25 Noel Road in Islington in 1959.|$|E
5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 {{register}} signalling variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each call attempt has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called the <b>outgoing</b> register in R2 parlance. The termination end is called the incoming register in R2 parlance. The <b>outgoing</b> register transmits forward MF tones to the incoming register. The incoming register transmits backward MF tones to the <b>outgoing</b> register. The <b>outgoing</b> register detects backward MF tones arriving from the incoming register. The incoming register detects forward MF tones arriving from the <b>outgoing</b> register. The <b>outgoing</b> register transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the <b>outgoing</b> register merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the incoming register. (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the <b>outgoing</b> register's first push signal to the incoming register is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the incoming register's pull signals, which request information from the <b>outgoing</b> register, are client-server, where the client is the incoming register and the server is the <b>outgoing</b> register.) ...|$|R

2500|$|In late September {{or early}} October 1840 MP and New Zealand Company {{secretary}} Charles Buller {{appealed to the}} Colonial Office for help for the company which he claimed was in [...] "distress". Over the next month the two parties negotiated a three-part agreement that, once agreed, was hailed by the company as [...] "all that we could desire". Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell agreed to offer a royal charter for 40 years, which would allow the company to buy, sell, settle and cultivate lands in New Zealand, with the Colonial Land and Emigration Commission, formed in January 1840, to have oversight of the company's colonisation activities. Russell also agreed to assess the total sum of money the company had spent on colonisation and then grant the company title to four acres for every pound it had expended. In return the company would relinquish its claim to 20 million acres. He also promised the company a discount—at a level to be decided later—for a purchase from the government of 50,000 acres. The company began providing figures to the Colonial Office of its total <b>outgoings,</b> which included ₤20,000 paid to the 1825 company and ₤40,000 paid to the New Zealand Colonisation Company of 1838 as well as ₤5250 paid for the Tory. The company's spending on placards, printing and advertising, employee salaries, and food and transport for the emigrants were [...] {{also included in the}} total, along with the costs of goods, including firearms, that had been used to buy land. A final calculation in May 1841 was that under the agreed formula the company was entitled to an initial 531,929 acres, with possibly another 400,000 to 500,000 acres to come. In May Russell agreed to allow the company a 20 percent discount on the cost of 50,000 acres it wished to buy in New Plymouth and Nelson.|$|E
