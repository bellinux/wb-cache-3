This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.|$|E

25|$|To display {{events with}} un{{changing}} or slowly (visibly) changing waveforms, but occurring at times {{that may not}} be evenly spaced, modern <b>oscilloscopes</b> have triggered sweeps. Compared to simpler <b>oscilloscopes</b> with sweep oscillators that are always running, triggered-sweep <b>oscilloscopes</b> are markedly more versatile.|$|E

40|$|An {{exposure}} interlock {{has been}} developed for <b>oscilloscope</b> cameras which cuts off ambient light from the <b>oscilloscope</b> screen before the shutter of the camera is tripped. A flap is provided which may be selectively positioned to an open position which enables viewing of the <b>oscilloscope</b> screen and a closed position which cuts off the <b>oscilloscope</b> screen from view and simultaneously cuts off ambient light from the <b>oscilloscope</b> screen.

25|$|If {{the input}} signal is periodic, the sweep {{repetition}} rate {{can be adjusted}} to display a few cycles of the waveform. Early (tube) <b>oscilloscopes</b> and lowest-cost <b>oscilloscopes</b> have sweep oscillators that run continuously, and are uncalibrated. Such <b>oscilloscopes</b> are very simple, comparatively inexpensive, and were useful in radio servicing and some TV servicing. Measuring voltage or time is possible, but only with extra equipment, and is quite inconvenient. They are primarily qualitative instruments.|$|E
25|$|Most modern <b>oscilloscopes</b> are lightweight, {{portable}} {{instruments that}} are compact {{enough to be}} easily carried by a single person. In addition to the portable units, the market offers a number of miniature battery-powered instruments for field service applications. Laboratory grade <b>oscilloscopes,</b> especially older units which use vacuum tubes, are generally bench-top devices or may be mounted into dedicated carts. Special-purpose <b>oscilloscopes</b> may be rack-mounted or permanently mounted into a custom instrument housing.|$|E

50|$|A {{digital storage}} <b>oscilloscope</b> (often {{abbreviated}} DSO) is an <b>oscilloscope</b> which stores and analyses the signal digitally {{rather than using}} analog techniques.

25|$|Early <b>oscilloscopes</b> used {{cathode ray}} tubes (CRTs) as their display element (hence they were {{commonly}} referred to as CROs) and linear amplifiers for signal processing. Storage <b>oscilloscopes</b> used special storage CRTs to maintain a steady display of a single brief signal. CROs were later largely superseded by digital storage <b>oscilloscopes</b> (DSOs) with thin panel displays, fast analog-to-digital converters and digital signal processors. DSOs without integrated displays (sometimes known as digitisers) are available at lower cost and use a general-purpose digital computer to process and display waveforms.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>oscilloscopes</b> have cursors, {{which are}} lines {{that can be}} moved about the screen to measure the time {{interval}} between two points, or the difference between two voltages. A few older <b>oscilloscopes</b> simply brightened the trace at movable locations. These cursors are more accurate than visual estimates referring to graticule lines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oscilloscopes</b> {{are used}} in the sciences, medicine, engineering, {{automotive}} and the telecommunications industry. General-purpose instruments are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work. Special-purpose <b>oscilloscopes</b> may be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive ignition system or to display the waveform of the heartbeat as an electrocardiogram.|$|E

500|$|To {{record the}} signal, he {{installed}} {{a very fast}} <b>oscilloscope,</b> provided as a prototype by DuMont Laboratories, in an underground bunker several hundred feet from the Gadget, where it was photographed. To bring the signal to the <b>oscilloscope,</b> he devised an oversized coaxial transmission line, whose inner conductor was made smaller as it went from chamber to <b>oscilloscope.</b> [...] Because this configuration enhanced the signal reaching the <b>oscilloscope,</b> {{there was no need}} for amplification. [...] To confirm this surprising behaviour, Rossi consulted with Harvard professor Edward Purcell.|$|R
25|$|Better quality {{general purpose}} <b>oscilloscopes</b> include a {{calibration}} signal {{for setting up}} the compensation of test probes; this is (often) a 1kHz square-wave signal of a definite peak-to-peak voltage available at a test terminal on the front panel. Some better <b>oscilloscopes</b> also have a squared-off loop for checking and adjusting current probes.|$|E
25|$|In {{a number}} of digital <b>oscilloscopes</b> from the 80s, the 68000 {{has been used as}} a {{waveform}} display processor; some models including the LeCroy 9400/9400A also use the 68000 as a waveform math processor (including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two waveforms/references/waveform memories), and some digital <b>oscilloscopes</b> using the 68000 (including the 9400/9400A) can also perform FFT functions on a waveform.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} work on {{developing}} specifications of electronic instruments of Norman Delisle and David Garlan from Tektronix. As with their original, the specification abstracts away from user interface and implementation issues, and the specification is simplified by considering the behaviour of the <b>oscilloscope</b> over all time, rather than incrementally. We present a specification of a simple, single-channel, single-trigger <b>oscilloscope</b> in two phases: 1. the specification of an ideal <b>oscilloscope</b> [...] - this makes use of concepts from real analysis to capture the ideal behaviour of an <b>oscilloscope,</b> and 2. the relaxation of {{the conditions of the}} specification to an extent that allows implementation within the bounds of physical limitations. The main contribution of our paper is the treatment of physical limitations in the second phase; these turn an unimplementable ideal <b>oscilloscope</b> into a realistic <b>oscilloscope</b> that can be physically implemented.

25|$|Most <b>oscilloscopes</b> have a {{graticule}} {{as part of}} {{the visual}} display, to facilitate measurements. The graticule may be permanently marked inside the face of the CRT, or it may be a transparent external plate made of glass or acrylic plastic. An internal graticule eliminates parallax error, but cannot be changed to accommodate different types of measurements. <b>Oscilloscopes</b> commonly provide a means for the graticule to be illuminated from the side, which improves its visibility.|$|E

25|$|Better <b>oscilloscopes</b> have a {{polarity}} selector. Normally, {{a positive}} input moves the trace upward, but this permits inverting—positive deflects the trace downward.|$|E
25|$|On old and lower-cost CRT <b>oscilloscopes</b> the {{graticule}} is a {{sheet of}} plastic, often with light-diffusing markings and concealed lamps {{at the edge of}} the graticule. The lamps had a brightness control. Higher-cost instruments have the graticule marked on the inside face of the CRT, to eliminate parallax errors; better ones also had adjustable edge illumination with diffusing markings. (Diffusing markings appear bright.) Digital <b>oscilloscopes,</b> however, generate the graticule markings on the display in the same way as the trace.|$|E
25|$|Dual-trace <b>oscilloscopes</b> have a {{mode switch}} to select either channel alone, both {{channels}}, or (in some) an X‑Y display, which uses the second channel for X deflection. When both channels are displayed, {{the type of}} channel switching can be selected on some oscilloscopes; on others, the type depends upon timebase setting. If manually selectable, channel switching can be free-running (asynchronous), or between consecutive sweeps. Some Philips dual-trace analog <b>oscilloscopes</b> had a fast analog multiplier, and provided a display of {{the product of the}} input channels.|$|E
