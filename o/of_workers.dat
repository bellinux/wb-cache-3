40|$|In most {{contemporary}} occupational {{health and safety}} (OHS) regimes, great emphasis is placed on amplifying worker voice in regulation through worker health and safety representation in the employers’ OHS management system. Historically, these regimes were designed {{on the assumption that the}} workers who would use these mechanisms were full-time workers having secure jobs with their current employers. This is manifestly no longer true, posing a serious challenge to the efficacy of these regimes. After setting out the historical context <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> voice in OHS regulation, this paper begins by mapping out eight channels <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> voice based on the combination of three variables: the subject <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> voice, the object <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> voice and the audience for worker voice. The aim of this exercise is not only to provide greater analytical clarity to discussions <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> voice in OHS regulation, but to also open up the discussion about alternative models <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> voice that might better fit the reality of today’s labour market. The paper examines the research on how well precariously employed workers are able to use existing channels of voice and concludes by considering strategies and tactics for amplifying their voice in OHS regulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of extreme cooperation, {{as found in}} eusocial insects (those with a worker caste), is potentially undermined by selfish reproduction among group members 1, 2, 3. In some eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), workers can produce male offspring from unfertilized eggs 4. Kin selection theory predicts levels <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> reproduction {{as a function of}} the relatedness structure of the workers' natal colony and the colony-level costs <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> reproduction 5, 6. However, the theory has been only partially successful in explaining levels <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> reproduction 7, 8, 9. Here we show that <b>workers</b> <b>of</b> a eusocial bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) enter unrelated, conspecific colonies in which they then produce adult male offspring, and that such socially parasitic workers reproduce earlier and are significantly more reproductive and aggressive than resident workers that reproduce within their own colonies. Explaining levels <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> reproduction, and hence the potential <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> selfishness to undermine the {{evolution of}} cooperation, will therefore require more than simply a consideration of the kin-selected interests <b>of</b> resident <b>workers.</b> It will also require knowledge of the full set of reproductive options available to workers, including intraspecific social parasitism...|$|R
