5|$|In 1934, Bill Woodfull led Australia back to England on a {{tour that}} had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket {{diplomacy}} of the previous bodyline series.

Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|E
5|$|The Misericorde Sisters {{were not}} well liked by the Montreal community.

On some <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> the Sisters brought newborns to church for baptism, garbage was thrown at them.

5|$|During the battle, the British Commonwealth {{logistic}} system proved robust {{enough to}} bear the strain of the fighting without serious disruption, although problems were experienced. Despite difficulties, an adequate flow of ammunition, equipment, food and water was maintained, although there were <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> the Australians endured thirst and hunger for several hours. 3 RAR used 900,000 rounds of small arms, 5,000 grenades and 7,000 mortar rounds during the five-day battle, all of which was moved in man-packable loads by Korean Service Corps porters and Australian soldiers over long distances and extreme terrain, often while under fire. These resupply operations had required considerable effort and bravery to effect, {{and a number of}} Korean porters were killed and wounded at Maryang San.|$|E
5|$|Second and third-generation {{descendants}} of Japanese-Palauans who were descended from earlier settlers generally chose to remain behind, although {{those who were}} raised in Japanese-speaking families reportedly faced trouble conversing in Palauan. Most retained their Japanese surnames, but Japanese-Paluans generally identified themselves as Palauans after the war. Second-generation Japanese-Palauans usually married Palauan women, and became assimilated with the local Palauan populace. In terms of self-identification, Japanese-Palauans usually emphasised their Japanese identities only on <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> they associate with other Japanese, for instance when they participate in memorial services for Japanese soldiers who died during the Pacific War. Some Japanese-Palauans also chose {{to be buried in}} Japanese cemeteries after their deaths, notably those in Koror.|$|E
