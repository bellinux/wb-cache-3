40|$|Hypodermosis, {{caused by}} <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> Przhevalskiana silenus (Order: Diptera, Family: Oestridae), is an endemic {{parasitic}} infestation of goats in Pakistan. The larvae of this fly, obligatory parasite of their hosts, are economically very important causing severe losses to leather industry. This infestation is {{also responsible for}} growth retardation, carcass depreciation and production losses in milk and meat. Keeping in view {{the importance of this}} infestation, studies were designed on serodiagnosis, epidemiology and economic importance of hypodermosis in goats in northern uplands of Balochistan, Pakistan, with the objectives to diagnose <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> infestation at early stages through serology for better control and eradication strategies, to study different epidemiological factors (age, sex, breed, temperature, humidity and rain fall) contributing goat <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> infestation, to compare seroprevalence over the prevalence based on clinical examination and to study the economic importance of hypodermosis in the study area. The duration of the study was one year (April 2011 to March 2012) and the most prevalent breed of goat i. e. khurasani breed in uplands of Balochistan was involved in the study which was compared with the non-descriptive breed of goat. In the first experiment, a total of 1440 sera samples were processed by commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX hypodermosis serum antibody test) method. The infestation was detected in May (summer) while the infestation is usually detected in the months of October until February (winter) by clinical palpation method when warbles appear {{on the backs of the}} animals. ELISA based seroprevalence showed the highest mean percentage (48. 45 % Â± 16. 14) of goat hypodermosis. In the second experiment on epidemiology, the mean percentage was 15. 94 % Â± 5. 65 by clinical palpation method in the field. In the slaughter house and skin market studies, the mean percentages were 9. 07 % Â± 3. 90 and 7. 16 % Â± 3. 39, respectively, while the mean intensity was 16. 19 Â± 3. 04 holes per skin. Analysis of data by Pearson Chi-square test (Ã· 2), revealed highly significant differences (P 2 years of age groups whereas no significant difference (P< 0. 05) was observed sex-wise and breed-wise. The life cycle of <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> in naturally infested goats was studied from April 2011 to March 2012. First instars larvae (L 1) were observed in subcutaneous tissues from mid of May to mid of July in slaughter houses of the study areas, second instars larvae (L 2) from mid of July to November and third instars larvae (L 3) were palpated in the field animals from December until the end of February. The pupal period was observed in early spring in the months from March to mid April while the adult fly activity season (Oviposition period) was observed in early summer from mid April to mid May. In the third experiment, the overall loss due to skin damages by <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> infestation was calculated as Pak. Rupees 7578625. 49 (Pak.

40|$|Abstract. Among the {{arthropods}} causing diseases to animals, myiasis {{causes a}} broad range of infestations depending on the location of larvae and its developmental stages on the body of the host. These infestations reduce host physiological functions, destroy host tissues and cause significant economic losses to livestock worldwide. This study was conducted to find out the pathological changes of goats tissue infested with Przhevalskiana silenus. Goat <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> infestation (GWFI), improperly named goat hypodermosis, is a myiasis caused by larvae of P. silenus. Out of 16, 250 goats examined in the slaughter house in the studied area, 433 (2. 67 %) were infested with <b>warble</b> <b>fly.</b> The minimum and maximum rate of infectivity was 7 and 84 with an average of 32. 4 warbles per animal. Histopathological examinations were carried out on the infested subcutaneous tissues. Infiltration of the mononuclear cell types, tissue necrosis, pyogranulomatous reaction, hyalinization, mineralization, muscle fragmentation, oedema, and hyperemia of arterioles and capillaries were the most important microscopic findings associated with different developmental stages of P. silenus instars in the goats.

5000|$|Purdey's {{interest}} in the disease was triggered when four cows he purchased for his farm developed the disease, though no animal raised on his farm ever contracted it. He also became aware of a fact also considered by the Philips Inquiry: [...] "1145. The practice in the UK of recycling animal protein as an ingredient of animal feed dates back to at least 1926. In the 1970s attention was directed within MAFF to the danger that this practice {{would result in the}} spread of infectious diseases. The diseases considered were those caused by conventional viral and bacterial organisms. No consideration appears to have been given to the risk that scrapie might be recycled in sheep, or even transmitted to other farm animals. This may seem surprising. The answer probably {{lies in the fact that}} half a century had elapsed without any indication that animal feed containing ovine protein was infecting sheep or any other animal." [...] Purdey published a number of papers in which he set down his belief that BSE was a transmissible disease that had an environmental cause. He suggested this cause might be Phosmet, a systemic organophosphate insecticide that was being spread along the spines of intensively farmed cows to eradicate <b>warble</b> <b>fly.</b> Purdey believed that the chemicals, derived from military nerve gases, disturbed the balance of metals in the animals' brains, namely reducing copper and increasing manganese, giving rise to the misfolded proteins called prions that are regarded as the cause of BSE.
