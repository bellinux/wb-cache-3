25|$|In {{a recent}} study (published May 1, 2013), it is {{suggested}} that the inflammation of the hypothalamus may be connected to <b>our</b> <b>overall</b> aging bodies. They focused on the activation of the protein complex NF-κB in mice test subjects, which showed increased activation as mice test subjects aged in the study. This activation not only affects aging, but affects a hormone known as GnRH, which has shown new anti-aging properties when injected into mice outside the hypothalamus, while causing the opposite effect when injected into the hypothalamus. It'll be some time before this can be applied to humans in a meaningful way, as more studies on this pathway are necessary to understand the mechanics of GnRH's anti-aging properties.|$|E

40|$|We find {{a robust}} {{negative}} correlation between Italian firms' productivity and their export share to low-income destinations. To account for this surprising fact, we marry Verhoogen (2008) with Eaton (2011), by introducing firm heterogeneity in product quality and country heterogeneity in quality consumption in a framework featuring firm and market-specific shocks in entry costs and demand, and estimate the model's parameters structurally by the simulated method of moments. The estimated preference for quality {{turns out to be}} monotonically increasing in foreign destinations' income.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that generalist CEOs enjoy higher pay than do {{specialist}} CEOs. However, the implication of CEO expertise on how CEOs are paid is largely unknown. We conjecture that because of information asymmetry, generalist CEOs may overstate their ability when contracting with shareholders. Thus the pay should be more closely linked to firm performance for generalist CEOs than for specialists in an optimal contract. Our results support this conjecture, especially when generalist CEOs are early in their tenure or are less known in the executive labor market or when they are more important for firm performance. The results are robust to endogeneity concerns. Alternative explanations such as risk-taking or price efficiency are unlikely to account for <b>our</b> findings. <b>Overall,</b> <b>our</b> results support the optimal contracting perspective of executive compensation...|$|R
