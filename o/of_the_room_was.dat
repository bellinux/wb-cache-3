5|$|The Amber Room {{was begun}} in 1701 {{with the purpose}} of being {{installed}} at Charlottenburg Palace, the residence of Frederick, the first King in Prussia, at the urging of his second wife, Sophie Charlotte. The concept and design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> drafted by Andreas Schlüter. It was fabricated by Gottfried Wolfram, master craftsman to the Danish court of King Frederick IV of Denmark, with help from the amber masters Ernst Schacht and Gottfried Turau from Danzig.|$|E
5|$|The Disaster Artist, Sestero's {{memoir of}} the making <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Room,</b> <b>was</b> written in {{collaboration}} with Tom Bissell and published in 2013. A film based on the book, directed by James Franco, is scheduled for release on December 1, 2017; both the book and film received widespread critical acclaim. Additionally, the film inspired an unofficial video game adaptation titled The Room Tribute, which was released on Newgrounds in 2010.|$|E
5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a fireplace. In the south-west corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor {{was used as a}} cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E

25|$|The Great Hall was {{a room of}} some size, 80ft long by 22ft wide. The floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> Hopton Wood stone, {{and it had a}} {{panelled}} wagon roofed ceiling. The wall were panelled to 10ft high in old oak, {{and above}} the panelling hung 17th century tapestries. On the south wall were several traceried windows, consisting of two tiers of four very narrow lights. The upper lights were trefoil headed having such massive framework that the central shaft is equal in width to the lights. On the west wall was a stone mullioned leaded light window some 20ft in height.|$|E
25|$|The housemates were Cruz, Demet, Kara, and Harrison. The White Room and its {{fixtures}} and fittings were all entirely white, and the housemates had only white clothes to wear. White Room housemates were provided with a white porridge which fulfilled all nutritional needs. In the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> a red button. At any time, a housemate could press the red button if they wished to leave. This decision to leave was final and the quitting housemate could {{not return to the}} Big Brother House or the White Room. The challenge was that the housemate who stayed in the White Room the longest without pressing the red button would become a legitimate Big Brother housemate and enter the main house {{with the rest of the}} housemates.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Andre Bormanis {{was named after}} one of Spotnitz's childhood friends, {{who went on to}} become one of the science consultants for both [...] and [...] In preparing the character's death scene the director, Tony Wharmby spent a whole day shooting inserts of rats. In total, the film crew used 500 rats. Initially, Wharmby had an issue getting the rats in the middle of the room being shot. In order to fix this, animal trainers continuously released more rats until the middle part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> finally covered. The crew later spent many hours [...] "painting out rat droppings in that shot." ...|$|E
500|$|The Billiard Room is {{situated}} between the South Drawing Room and the library, and overlooks the Deer Park. Once {{known as the}} [...] "Rubens Room", the room was once described by Charles Spencer as a [...] "dead space; desperately uncomfortable furniture, and Rubens's imposing portraits of several unattractive Habsburgs, against a tightly patterned silver silk, making it anything but welcoming". The room has now been [...] "brought to life" [...] with numerous horse and sporting paintings and portraits, including a dramatic portrait of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria hunting, and a full-sized billiard table moved from the stables in the 1990s. [...] The chimney piece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> made by Derval under Holland, and the room also contains an 1893 bronze sculpture of Forager, the Red Earl's favourite foxhound. The Broadbent ceiling is dated to 1865.|$|E
500|$|In a {{flashback}} sequence {{in one of}} his early episodes, Lucas is subjected to waterboarding, a method of psychological torture. In order to ensure the authenticity of the sequence, Armitage was himself subjected to the actual torture while shooting. He agreed to perform the sequence after he was convinced by consultants for the FSB and CIA. Armitage was only subjected to it for a short time, and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear he was on for longer. The ambient temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> also raised to make him as comfortable as possible. However, after the sequence was shot, Armitage changed his opinion entirely, stating; [...] "I only lasted five to ten seconds, and the sound of my voice crying out to stop isn't me acting." [...] Armitage shot more interrogation scenes during production of the eighth series, but only some were added into the episodes. He was [...] "less physical" [...] in the ninth series.|$|E

Armitage was only waterboarded for a short time, and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear as if he was on for longer.

500|$|With {{but a few}} notable exceptions, the {{interiors}} of the palazzi were from the start less elaborate than those of Sicily's Baroque churches. Many were finished without ornate interior decoration, simply because they {{took so long to}} build {{and by the time they}} were completed Baroque had passed from fashion; the principal rooms were therefore decorated in the new neoclassical style known as [...] "Pompeian". Often one can find a fusion of the two styles, as in the ballroom wing of the Palazzo Aiutamicristo in Palermo, built by Andrea Giganti in 1763, where the ballroom ceiling was frescoed by Giuseppe Cristadoro with allegorical scenes framed by Baroque gilded motifs in plaster. This ceiling was already old-fashioned when it was finished, and the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> decorated in a far simpler mode. Changing use over the past 250 years has simplified palazzo decor further, as the ground floors are now usually shops, banks, or restaurants, and the upper floors divided into apartments, their interiors lost.|$|E
500|$|The Vatican nativity {{scene for}} 2007 placed {{the birth of}} Jesus in Joseph's house, based upon an {{interpretation}} of the Gospel of Matthew. Mary was shown with the newborn infant Jesus in a room in Joseph's house. To the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> Joseph's workshop while to the right was a busy inn—a comment on materialism versus spirituality. [...] The Vatican's written description of the diorama said, [...] "The scene for this year's Nativity recalls the painting style of the Flemish School of the 1500s." [...] The scene was unveiled on December 24 and remained in place until February 2, 2008 for The Feast of the Presentation of the Lord. [...] Ten new figures were exhibited with seven on loan from the town of Tesero and three—a baker, a woman, and a child—donated to the Vatican. The decision for the atypical setting was believed {{to be part of a}} crackdown on fanciful scenes erected in various cities around Italy. In Naples, Italy, for example, Elvis Presley and Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi, were depicted among the shepherds and angels worshipping at the manger.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{allow the}} cast to perform {{many of their}} own stunts. In filming fight sequences, they were carefully choreographed beforehand so the actors could participate themselves. The guns featured on the series are real. In scenes where guns are included, an armourer is on hand throughout {{the entirety of the}} sequence to see if the actors are handling them properly and gives out the guns to the actors at the last possible second before filming. After the sequence is shot, the guns have to be returned and locked in a case to prevent anybody from playing with them, even if the guns are not loaded. Among other stunt work, Armitage was asked to be subjected to an actual waterboarding scene to ensure the authenticity of the sequence. The actor agreed after he was convinced by conultants from the FSB and CIA. Kudos film and television, the production company behind Spooks, had to follow several health and safety provisions from an advisor to ensure the sequence strictly adheres to the advice.

[...] Richmann was attending {{a meeting of the}} Academy of Sciences when he heard thunder and ran home with his engraver to capture the event for posterity. While the experiment was under way, {{ball lightning}} appeared and travelled down the string, struck Richmann's forehead and killed him. The ball had left a red spot on Richmann's forehead, his shoes were blown open, and his clothing was singed. His engraver was knocked unconscious. The door frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> split and the door was torn from its hinges.|$|E
2500|$|The salle des gardes du roi, {{served to}} house the Garde du corps du roi – the King’s Body Guard. [...] The early decor of this room {{included}} walls clad in tooled gilt leather and a battle scene by Joseph Parrocel, [...] "The Battle of Leuze, 18 September 1691", hung over the fireplace. [...] Two large chandeliers emblazoned with the king’s monogram complemented the decor. [...] The utilitarian nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> evidenced by the wooden benches, camp beds, and folding screens used by the guards stationed in the room. [...] On Mondays, a table, dressed with a gold-fringed velvet rug, would be placed in this room, at which Louis XIV would personally accept petitions presented {{to him by his}} subjects.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the East Room—along {{with the rest}} of the White House—was in such poor shape that its {{structural}} integrity was at risk. President Harry S. Truman was attending a concert in the East Room on February 11, 1947, when he was informed that the ceiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> being pulled down by the weight of the chandeliers.The following day, the chandeliers were taken down. On October 26, 1948, plaster fell from the ceiling of the East Room, exposing a [...] crack in the ceiling. Engineers discovered that the ceiling had also dropped by [...] The East Room was cleared of all furniture, and floor-to-ceiling X-shaped wooden braces erected in the room to stabilize it. The room was then sealed off. Engineers with the Public Building Administration and White House staff feared the entire building could collapse. President and Mrs. Truman left the White House on September 27, 1948, for a 45-day nationwide political barnstorming tour. When they returned to the White House on November 5, they were immediately informed that the White House had to be evacuated. The White House was closed to the public on November 7, and after a two-week vacation in Key West, Florida, the Trumans moved into Blair House on November 21, 1948.|$|E
