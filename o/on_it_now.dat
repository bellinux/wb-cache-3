5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> and threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E

[...] Nichols describes Tucker as [...] "a self-made success, a regular guy who can tend bar and shoot pool and talk shit with anybody. He's very unassuming in many ways." [...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has all that stuff, but he {{has found a way}} to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason he is such a player is, and it’s my take <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>now,</b> is that it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are sneaking up on him." [...] He also described the character as [...] "very, very cool, and [...] "full of a lot of fire and a lot of surprises".|$|E

2500|$|President Eisenhower's staff quickly {{selected}} Farmer as Herzog's replacement. Publicly, Farmer {{was portrayed}} as a political independent. He had few personal associations with management and his professional contacts were perceived as legal and contractual rather than ideological. But privately, Farmer was well known as a strong conservative, an avid proponent of states' rights, and an early and avid political backer of Eisenhower. By June 21, Farmer {{was reported to be}} Eisenhower's only choice as Herzog's replacement. However, Eisenhower also informed his cabinet that all agency appointments should be cleared with the Republican National Committee (RNC), which was known to be much more conservative on labor issues than the administration. The RNC {{went so far as to}} advocate that all Roosevelt and Truman administration appointees to the NLRB be fired, no matter how competent. Farmer's views of federal labor law were strongly conservative. Farmer thought the federal role in labor relations should be delegated to the states. [...] "...I favor as much decentralization as possible; and as much as possible should be done with the board's discretionary authority, which has some limits <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>now,</b> to cede to the states by agreement." [...] Farmer advocated wholesale re-examination of the major decision of the Herzog board, especially in those areas restricting employer freedom of speech, permitting bargaining during the contract, and giving unions preferential treatment in captive audience meetings. [...] Farmer was also a vigorous anti-communist, which further heightened his appeal as chairman. He believed that communists had infiltrated not only American labor unions but the staff of the NLRB itself (some at the highest levels of the Board), and that it was his duty to purge the NLRB of these individuals.|$|E
