5|$|The {{cane toad}} (Bufo marinus) {{is a very}} {{adaptable}} species native to South and Central America. In the 1930s, it was introduced into Puerto Rico, and later various other islands in the Pacific and Caribbean region, as a biological pest control agent. In 1935, 3000 toads were liberated in the sugar cane fields of Queensland, Australia, {{in an attempt to}} control cane beetles such as Dermolepida albohirtum, the larvae of which damage and kill the canes. Initial results in many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> were positive, but it later became apparent that the toads upset the ecological balance in their new environments. They bred freely, competed with native frog species, ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates, had few predators in their adopted habitats, and poisoned pets, carnivorous birds, and mammals. In many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries,</b> they are now regarded both as pests and invasive species, and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them.|$|E

5|$|Even before Han's {{expansion}} into Central Asia, diplomat Zhang Qian's travels from 139 to 125 BC had established Chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations. Zhang encountered Dayuan (Fergana), Kangju (Sogdiana), and Daxia (Bactria, formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom); he also gathered information on Shendu (Indus River valley of North India) and Anxi (the Parthian Empire). All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> eventually received Han embassies.

5|$|The Wall Street Journal conjectured as {{well that}} Germany could return to the Deutsche Mark, or create another {{currency}} union with the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Baltics. A monetary union <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> with current account surpluses would create the world's largest creditor bloc, bigger than China or Japan. The Wall Street Journal added that without the German-led bloc, a residual euro would have the flexibility to keep interest rates low and engage in quantitative easing or fiscal stimulus {{in support of a}} job-targeting economic policy instead of inflation targeting in the current configuration.|$|E
5|$|The largest area of {{production}} {{is also the}} Netherland, with 76% of the global cultivated area, followed by France, Chile, Japan, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. Approximately ten countries produce lilies commercially altogether. About half of the commercial production is for cut flowers. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> export bulbs as well as supplying the domestic market. The Netherland produces about 2,200 million lily bulbs annually, of which 96% is used domestically and the remainder exported, principally within the European Union. One particularly important crop is the production of Lilium longiflorum, whose white flowers are associated with purity and Easter.|$|E
5|$|Andean {{immigrants}} in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat, and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy. Peruvian research universities, especially La Molina National Agrarian University, began experimental {{programs in the}} 1960s {{with the intention of}} breeding larger-sized guinea pigs. Subsequent university efforts have sought to change breeding and husbandry procedures in South America, to make the raising of guinea pigs as livestock more economically sustainable. In the 1990s and 2000s, the university began exporting the larger breed guinea pigs to Europe, Japan, and the United States in the hope of increasing human consumption outside <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> in northern South America.|$|E

5|$|Both popes {{sent their}} legates {{to the catholic}} kingdoms {{in order to secure}} their recognition. At the council of Pavia in February 1160 Emperor Frederick I {{declared}} himself in favour of Victor IV, and the episcopate of the Empire followed him, with the significant exception of archbishop of Salzburg Eberhard I von Hilpolstein-Biburg and his suffragans. King Valdemar I of Denmark also gave his support to Victor IV, but the primate of Denmark archbishop Eskil of Lund became partisan of Alexander III. It seems that Poland also supported Victor IV. The rest of Europe, namely France, England, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Hungary, Sicily and the Latin territories in Outremer, recognized Alexander III as true Pope, even if in some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> there were a significant Victorine minorities in episcopates or among feudal rulers.

5|$|Limousins {{ability to}} adapt to {{different}} environments contributed greatly to the breed's current success outside France. In most cases, Limousin bulls or their semen are now imported to improve locally bred Limousins. Today, the breed is present in about 70 countries around the world, and in all latitudes ranging from Finland in the north to South Africa in the south. Limousin breeders' associations exist in many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries,</b> of which 29 {{are members of the}} International Limousin Council (ILC). The ILC was founded at Limoges in 1973 by Louis de Neuville, the Limousin breed ambassador. In 1989, EUROLIM was formed to bring together all of the herd books of European Limousins.|$|E
5|$|Political {{boundaries}} {{drawn by}} the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding settler populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> and their indigenous minorities, and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark {{in the form of}} divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of Indians emigrating {{to other parts of the}} empire, such as Malaysia and Fiji, and Chinese people to Malaysia, Singapore and the Caribbean. The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing to immigration to Britain from its former colonies.|$|E

5|$|With the {{discovery}} of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around {{the beginning of the}} 18th century, particularly Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina: the last <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth. In the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly Canada, Mexico, and Nevada in the United States: some secondary production from lead and zinc ores also took place in Europe, and deposits in Siberia and the Russian Far East as well as in Australia were mined. Poland emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after {{the discovery}} of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.|$|E
