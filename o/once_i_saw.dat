25|$|Today, {{everybody}} pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I {{can still}} hear {{the way he was}} whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than <b>once,</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E
500|$|Jaws set the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Jaws there was no way I was ever going to learn to surf – no way! Because I can imagine my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|E
500|$|I was {{surprised}} I got that call 'cause of our {{differences in the}} audiences we hit, but I'm always up for challenges and trying something new ... She described what her album is about and then she sent me some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of stuff that I grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that's the vibe she wanted, I still had to make it sound like the way my beats thump and stuff but still give her the atmosphere she's trying to bring out on the singing side.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> {{heard you}} playing scales in the drawing-room, and <b>once</b> <b>I</b> {{positively}} <b>saw</b> you peeping {{at me through}} the curtains.' ...|$|R
60|$|So he spoke, and <b>once</b> more <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{his hand}} steal towards the {{spearhead}} which was hidden beneath the blanket that he wore.|$|R
60|$|He started, {{and looked}} round at me <b>once</b> more. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that {{something}} in my language, or in my tone of speaking, had stung him.|$|R
500|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the tour's title, Beyoncé was criticized by several critics and feminists alike for entitling it after her husband's name as she has been regarded as a feminist. Questions were raised about how Beyoncé agreed to be known as a bride of another celebrity person. During an interview with Vogue, Beyoncé described herself as a [...] "modern-day feminist" [...] and further spoke about her decision to reference her husband's name: [...] "I feel like Mrs. Carter is who I am, but more bold and more fearless than I've ever been..... It comes from knowing my purpose and really meeting myself <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> my child. I was like, 'OK, this is what you were born to do'. The purpose of my body became completely different." [...] After the second European leg was announced on December 11, 2013, a new poster was revealed and used for the promotion of all the newly added shows.|$|E
500|$|On April 5, 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Dirty Sexy Money actor Seth Gabel had been {{cast as the}} lead Fringe investigator in the parallel universe, and would be making his first appearance in the finale as a possible recurring character. Jeff Pinkner described the character as [...] "the scientist-cop-leader of the team on the Other Side." [...] In an interview with TV Guide, Gabel commented that during shooting {{he felt that he}} looked [...] "like such a doofus holding a gun," [...] but changed his mind when he saw the finished production. Gabel elaborated, [...] "I was so scared that I wouldn't pull it off. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> myself being a scientist-slash-FBI hero, I felt more confident and relaxed." [...] His character is caught in a large explosion in the finale, but Gabel confirmed, in a Chicago Tribune interview, that his character would be returning for the third season. He states that the parallel universe has [...] "special technology than can heal burns".|$|E
500|$|Wall Street enjoyed renewed {{interest}} in the film in 1990 when the cover of Newsweek magazine asked, [...] "Is Greed Dead?" [...] after 1980s icons like Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky ran afoul of insider trading laws. Over the years, the film's screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, [...] "The movie changed my life. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it I knew that I {{wanted to get into}} such and such business. I wanted to be like Gordon Gekko". In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have people come up to them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film. In recent years, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in Wall Street has changed and he replied, [...] "The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. Enron is a fiction, in a sense, {{in the same way that}} Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... Kenny Lay—he's the new Gordon Gekko". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Owen Gleiberman recently commented that the film, [...] "reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich—they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us".|$|E
6000|$|... "He did not. And {{there is}} now no slight on her name. I was hastening ath'art to tell you at <b>once,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you were not there." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{sank back}} shamed, and, as <b>I</b> did so, <b>once</b> more <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{the smile of}} triumph {{on the face of}} Charmion, {{followed}} by what was, perhaps, the shadow of pity for my fall.|$|R
60|$|Listen now, sharer of {{the sorrow}} of my heart, and I will tell of the hunting. I {{followed}} to Peshawur from Pubbi, and I went {{to and fro}} about the streets of Peshawur like a houseless dog, seeking for my enemy. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him washing his mouth in the conduit in the big square, but when I came up he was gone. It may be that it was he, and, seeing my face, he had fled.|$|R
500|$|Lang did not {{disguise}} his {{relief that}} the crisis was over. He wrote of George VI: [...] "I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response." [...] On 12 May 1937, Lang crowned George VI with full pomp in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. Time magazine recorded: [...] "All through the three-hour ceremony, {{the most important person}} there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England." [...] Supposedly the archbishop fumbled with the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: [...] "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten." [...] He also said of the Coronation: [...] "It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it was going well, I enjoyed every minute." [...] "Thank God that is over!" [...] said his chaplain, as they got into the car to leave. [...] "Lumley, how can you say such a thing!" [...] cried the archbishop. [...] "I only wish it was beginning over again." ...|$|E
60|$|Then for <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Bes grow afraid, for {{his great}} jaw dropped and he trembled.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Alice, {{taken aback}} by this {{apparent}} irrelevance. [...] "My father disapproved of it. But I was there <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the 'Lady of Lyons.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--ghost. Generically--provisionally. We always {{consider}} them ghosts, don't we, till they prove themselves something else? <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> an apparition." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Curtiss planes {{approximately}} 300 meters {{below us}} and falling away below. These aircraft were {{no threat to}} us whatsoever! Now I just wanted to level out of my turning bank, since my colleagues were already at a substantially higher altitude. Keppler (his wingman), overshot me. <b>Once</b> again, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Curtiss planes 300 meters directly below me and counted eleven aircraft.|$|R
60|$|Miss Trevor {{came out}} as I spoke, and our {{conductor}} appeared, bending under the hamper. I shouldered some blankets and the basket, and we started. We followed a rough path, evidently cut by a camping party in some past season, but now overgrown. The Fraction marched ahead, and I formed the rear guard. Several times {{it seemed to me}} as though someone were pushing after us, and more than <b>once</b> we halted. <b>I</b> put down the basket and went back to reconnoitre. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> believed <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a figure flitting in the gray light, but I set it down to my imagination.|$|R
60|$|There were sunfish and sharks showing all around. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a whale. The sea was glassy, with a long, heaving swell. Birds were {{plentiful}} in scattered groups.|$|E
6000|$|... "Robert Lumsden. The picture {{belongs to}} my mother. She puts it under her pillow of nights. And <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her kiss it. I wouldn't. But women are that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|So sang {{a patriot}} whom <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> [...] Descending Bunker's holy hill. With awe [...] I {{noted that he}} shone with sacred light, [...] Like Moses with the tables of the Law.|$|E
6000|$|... "I went to {{the hotel}} and saw Mr. Clark," [...] resumed Mr. Tucker, {{somewhat}} crestfallen. [...] "When I heard {{that you were a}} widow, all the old times came back to me again. The years fell from me like a mantle. <b>Once</b> again <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> myself walking with you over the footpath to Cooper's farm; <b>once</b> again <b>I</b> felt your hand in mine. Your voice sounded in my ears--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to go}} to a city <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> a town bigger'n Lumberville. I've {{never seen}} a play, but I've read of 'em in the magazines. It must be wonderful; they say they have wharves and real ships coming up to the wharf, and people getting off and on. How do they do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{that did}} the {{business}} for me. My imagination began to construct dangers out of nothing, and they multiplied faster than I could keep the run of them. All at <b>once</b> <b>I</b> imagined <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> shoal water ahead! The wave of coward agony that surged through me then came near dislocating every joint in me. All my confidence in that crossing vanished. I seized the bell-rope; dropped it, ashamed; seized it again; dropped it once more; clutched it tremblingly one again, and pulled it so feebly that I could hardly hear the stroke myself. Captain and mate sang out instantly, and both together-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jes' growled at me. Gran'dad's got a awful temper when he's good an' riled, but usual' he's {{still as}} a mouse. Don't {{say a word to}} me fer days together, sometimes. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Look on {{this right}} hand of mine, my father! I cannot see it now; and yet I, Mopo, son of Makedama, {{seem to see}} it as <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> red with the blood of two kings. Look on-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} of him and <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him, a few moons ago passing through Pinetown. A Kaffir with him {{told me that he}} was going over the Drakensberg to hunt for things that crawl and fly, being quite mad, Baas." ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, madam, {{since my}} Sharper is untrue, I joyless make my <b>once</b> adored Alpeu. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him stand behind Ombrelia's chair, And whisper with that soft, deluding air, And those feign'd sighs which cheat the {{listening}} fair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see your}} face in every scene of my dreams, and hear your voice in every sound. I wish I did not. It {{is too much}} what I feel. They say such love never lasts. But it must! And yet <b>once,</b> <b>I</b> remember, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{an officer of the}} Hussars ride down the street at Budmouth, and though he was a total {{stranger}} and never spoke to me, I loved him till I thought I should really die of love--but I didn't die, and at last I left off caring for him. How terrible it would be if a time should come when I could not love you, my Clym!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Passing {{along the}} beach <b>once</b> more, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that in a cleft of the ridge {{a piece of wood}} had been jammed. I rowed out to it in my boat, and brought it ashore. It was part of the {{sternpost}} of a boat, and on it, or rather on the piece of wood attached to it, was the word [...] "Archangel," [...] painted in strange, quaint lettering.|$|R
6000|$|I wandered lonely as a Cloud [...] That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills, [...] When all at <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a crowd [...] A host {{of dancing}} Daffodills; [...] Along the Lake, beneath the trees, [...] Ten {{thousand}} {{dancing in the}} breeze.|$|E
6000|$|... "Young lords," [...] {{he cried}} out, [...] "there {{is a white}} bear on the land, such a bear as <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> when I was a boy. Come out and kill the bear and win honour, but first give me a drink for my news." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{often see}} the little {{children}} playing on the decks of the boat. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> one that had a dog, {{and he was trying}} to teach him to cipher on a slate. His mother and the other children were on the boat too.|$|E
6000|$|... "The person {{then was}} a knight, for I {{had seen him}} before {{when he came in}} knightly harness into my master's shop to have two rivets put into his hauberk. I liked not his face then, and should have remembered it anywhere. I knew him at <b>once</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him. He was a dark faced knight, handsome, and yet with {{features}} which reminded me of a hawk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Courtenay Ivor," [...] I said slowly, {{steeling}} myself {{once more}} for a hard effort, [...] "I knew who you were at <b>once</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you poise yourself on the parapet. Once {{before in my life}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you like that, and the picture it produced has burned itself into the very fibre and marrow of my being. As long as I live, I can never get rid of it. It was when you leapt from the window at The Grange, at Woodbury, after murdering my father!" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>saw</b> a {{wall display}} of several dozen of these images... The {{combination}} of ceaseless proliferation and searing emotion made an impact that struck {{to the very}} core of human feeling.|$|R
