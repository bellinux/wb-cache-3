5000|$|The <b>Offset</b> Figure <b>Eight</b> <b>Bend,</b> {{a similar}} knot using the figure-eight knot, {{has been used}} in the belief that its greater size and {{complexity}} brings more security. But testing and more than one fatal failure indicate the figure-eight variant to be less secure, more prone to capsize at lower loads, and in capsizing uses more of the ends than does a capsizing overhand bend.
