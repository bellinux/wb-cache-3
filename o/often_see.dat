5|$|Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's has emerged, {{in which}} {{biological}} vulnerability and adverse environmental events {{are seen to}} interact. In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to no longer require that symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning, recognizing that clinicians <b>often</b> <b>see</b> patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|Women who {{identify}} as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence. These emotions {{have been cited}} as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women {{who identify}} as bisexual. On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to, and more <b>often</b> <b>see</b> being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.|$|E

Cycling races <b>often</b> <b>see</b> Basque fans lining the roads wearing orange, the {{corporate}} color of the telco Euskaltel, coining the term the orange crush during the Pyrenees stages of the Tour de France. Miguel Indurain was born in Atarrabia (Navarre), and he won 5 French Tours.|$|E
25|$|Involuntary {{annexation}} is {{a controversial}} issue in {{those parts of}} unincorporated Bexar County affected by it. Residents attracted to the outlying areas by lower taxes and affordable real estate values, <b>often</b> <b>see</b> annexation as a mechanism to increase property tax rates (which are primarily driven by school district taxes, not city taxes) without a corresponding improvement in services such as police and fire protection, while the city regards its annexation policy as essential to its overall prosperity.|$|E

50|$|Some Greek writers {{give the}} names of the nine Muses as Kallichore, Helike, Eunike, Thelxinoë, Terpsichore, Euterpe, Eukelade, Dia, and Enope.In Renaissance and Neoclassical art, the {{dissemination}} of emblem books such as Cesare Ripa's Iconologia (1593 and many further editions) helped standardize the depiction of the Muses in sculpture and painting, so they could be distinguished by certain props. These props, or emblems, became readily identifiable by the viewer, enabling one immediately to recognize the Muse and the art with which she had become associated. Here again, Calliope (epic poetry) carries a writing tablet; Clio (history) carries a scroll and books; Euterpe (song and elegiac poetry) carries a flute, the aulos; Erato (lyric poetry) is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> with a lyre and a crown of roses; Melpomene (tragedy) is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> with a tragic mask; Polyhymnia (sacred poetry) is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> with a pensive expression; Terpsichore (choral dance and song) is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> dancing and carrying a lyre; Thalia (comedy) is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> with a comic mask; and Urania (astronomy) carries a pair of compasses and the celestial globe.|$|R
25|$|Dolichovespula norwegica has {{eye-catching}} {{black and}} yellow color patterns throughout its body. Starting from the face, {{it has a}} long malar space and is separated by a black bar that runs vertically. The sides of the thorax contain small black hairs that project outwards and the rear has distinct yellow spots. One can <b>often</b> <b>see</b> red coloring {{on the front of}} the abdomen. Dolichovespula is derived from the Greek word, dolichos, which means long. Its genus name matches with physical characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Many {{languages}} with ergative marking display what {{is known}} as optional ergativity, where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when we <b>often</b> <b>see</b> optional ergativity, and argues that the choice is often not truly optional but is affected by semantics and pragmatics. Note that unlike split ergativity, which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.|$|E
25|$|Despite its {{reliance}} on manufacturing, Indiana has been less affected by declines in traditional Rust Belt manufactures than many of its neighbors. The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is located primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This {{makes it possible for}} firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms <b>often</b> <b>see</b> in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.|$|E

25|$|The {{extent to}} which the Common Heritage of Mankind {{principle}} does or should control the activities of private multinational corporations as well as nation states, particularly with regard to mining activities, remains controversial. underdeveloped nations <b>often</b> <b>see</b> the principle as a means of protecting critical resources from exploitation by capitalist nations and their corporations. As world oil, coal and mineral reserves are depleted there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit Common Heritage of Mankind areas. It appears at the present time that exploration of outer space is unlikely to initially proceed under the jurisdiction of a supranational organization, but rather through the coordination of national space programs. It has been argued that photosynthesis in its natural or artificial forms should be considered the common heritage of humanity.|$|E
25|$|In 1015 {{and again}} in 1016 forces from the taifa of Denia, in the east of Muslim Spain (al-Andalus), {{attacked}} Sardinia and attempted to establish control over it. In both these years joint expeditions from the maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa repulsed the invaders. These Pisan–Genoese expeditions to Sardinia were approved {{and supported by the}} Papacy, and modern historians <b>often</b> <b>see</b> them as proto-Crusades. After their victory, the Italian cities turned on each other, and the Pisans obtained hegemony over the island at the expense of their erstwhile ally. For this reason, the Christian sources for the expedition are primarily from Pisa, which celebrated its double victory over the Muslims and the Genoese with an inscription on the walls of its Duomo.–XIIIe siècle: textes et documents] (Lyon: Presses Universitaires de Lyon, 2000), 20–23.|$|E
25|$|Besides football, Wembley can be {{configured}} to hold {{many other}} events, particularly major concerts but also private events like weddings and conferences. This {{is an economic}} necessity given that the stadium ended up costing the FA much more than was originally projected. The regular covering of the pitch for concerts {{has led to the}} pitch being relaid <b>often</b> (<b>see</b> elsewhere in this article). Regular changes to the pitch mean that it never matches the quality of its surroundings, or of the pitch of the old Wembley in its later years. The first concert at the new stadium was given by George Michael on 9 June 2007. Bon Jovi were scheduled to be the first artists to perform at the new Wembley but the late completion of the stadium saw the concerts relocated to the National Bowl and the KC Stadium.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{attendance}} at football matches {{is associated with}} the consumption of traditional football foods such as meat pies and Bovril. Food and beverage sales in stadiums can raise high incomes for clubs, and some clubs make attempts to improve their service and diversify out of traditional foods. In Brazil, sanduíche de calabresa (pepperoni sandwich) is a popular meal in the surrounding areas of stadiums. In Mineirão stadium, feijão tropeiro, a typical dish from Minas Gerais, is very common. In Germany, many football fans eat bratwurst and drink beers. In Argentina, choripán (a sandwich with grilled chorizo with crusty bread) and grilled hamburgers are commonly served in stadiums. In the past, a variety of pizza without cheese was served, which is now known as pizza de cancha (“pitch pizza”). In Spain it is very common to eat sunflower seeds during the game. Although not in the whole Bosnia and Herzegovina, but especially in Sarajevo ćevapi are commonly seen to be sold around the stadiums before and after the matches and you can <b>often</b> <b>see</b> people selling pepita and juices in front of the entrance of the stadium and on the stands during the match.|$|E
25|$|In {{situations}} where multiple referees disagree substantially {{about the quality}} of a work, {{there are a number of}} strategies for reaching a decision. When a publisher receives very positive and very negative reviews for the same manuscript, the publisher will often solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. As another strategy in the case of ties, the publisher may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. If a publisher does not feel confident to weigh the persuasiveness of a rebuttal, the publisher may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. A publisher may convey communications back and forth between authors and a referee, in effect allowing them to debate a point. Even in these cases, however, publishers do not allow multiple referees to confer with each other, though each reviewer may <b>often</b> <b>see</b> earlier comments submitted by other reviewers. The goal of the process is explicitly not to reach consensus or to persuade anyone to change their opinions, but instead to provide material for an informed editorial decision. Some medical journals, usually following the open access model, have begun posting on the Internet the pre-publication history of each individual article, from the original submission to reviewers' reports, authors' comments, and revised manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{east from}} the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords {{in the south and}} by deep lakes in the north, and with varying {{temperatures}} according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to 2,000 m on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuquén in Argentina, where sunnier and dryer conditions allow trees to grow up to close to 3,000 m), and diminishes southward to only 600–800 m in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other, and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Frías, in Argentina, receives 4,400mm yearly. The city of Bariloche, about 40km further east, receives about 1,000mm, and the airport, another 15km east, receives less than 600mm. The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Martín de los Andes, Bariloche, El Bolsón, Esquel, El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between 20°C and 24°C, with cold nights between 4°C and 9°C; in the south, summers are between 16°C and 20°C, at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from 3°C to 9°C in the north, and from 0°C to 7°C in the south, whereas nights range from −5°C to 2°C everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values: -21°C have been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can <b>often</b> <b>see</b> temperatures between −12°C and −15°C and highs staying around 0°C for a few days.|$|E

25|$|Mandy, Whitworth's step-mother, {{reported}} the Police knocking {{on her door}} to inform her they had found Daniel's body. She says she was led to believe Daniel had overdosed on drugs, despite no investigation having taken place. Police didn't treat the death as suspicious, despite bruising found under Daniel's arms, {{which led to a}} coroner reporting that third-party involvement could not be ruled out. The Police took the fake suicide note left by Port with Daniel's body at face-value. They sent a small fragment of the letter to Mandy and Daniel's father, Adam, asking them to verify if it was Daniel's penmanship. They looked at the writing on the note and compared it with Daniel's writing from Birthday cards and other mementos. They reported back to the Police saying they were unsure if it was Daniel's writing, as they didn't <b>often</b> <b>see</b> his handwriting and they couldn't say for certain. Mandy reported that Dagenham Police had told her they had experts who can analyse the writing and determine whether it is Daniel's or not, and Mandy assumed this is what the Police would do. It is later shown at trial that Dagenham Police documented that Mandy and Adam had confirmed the handwriting was Daniel's, despite them telling the Police they were unsure. It came to light that handwriting professionals had not investigated the note, but that untrained Police Officers had 'taken a look' at the note themselves. Mandy maintains that if specialists had looked further into this note, they could have found Port earlier.|$|E
