5|$|After {{three months}} of closure due to the Pawnee budget crisis and {{government}} shutdown, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly informs her fellow employees that the parks department has been reopened, although <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget. State auditors Chris (Rob Lowe) and Ben (Adam Scott) announce they may only conduct existing park maintenance, but Leslie wants to offer better programs and services. Meanwhile, the always-optimistic Chris continues trying to convince Ann (Rashida Jones) {{to go on a}} date with him. Ann finds him too intense, but Leslie convinces her to accept a date and try to persuade Chris to increase the parks budget.|$|E
5|$|Made <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> {{budget of}} , Kahaani was {{conceived}} and developed by Ghosh, who co-wrote the film with Advaita Kala. The crew often employed guerrilla-filmmaking techniques on Kolkata's city streets to avoid attracting attention. The film was {{noted for its}} deft portrayal {{of the city and}} for making use of many local crew and cast members. Kahaani explores themes of feminism and motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to Satyajit Ray's films such as Charulata (1964) and Aranyer Dinratri (1970).|$|E

According to Macias, this film, like other Wakamatsu films of the time, [...] "combined, in still unique manner, disjunctive New Wave style, existentialist dread, sex, sadism, and gore, all <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ridiculously <b>shoestring</b> budget." ...|$|R
5|$|Saria {{conceived}} Loev script {{while he}} was working on another project, and drew heavily from his personal experiences. It was eventually picked up for production despite Saria's own doubts on its viability. Principal photography took place at Mahabaleshwar, the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Western Ghats in peninsular India, and Mumbai, in the summer of 2014. The film was shot within sixteen days by the cinematographer Sherri Kauk in 2K resolution. Made <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget, the film relied on crowdfunding and costcutting measures to meet its production costs.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{brothers}} started Ashby Computers and Graphics in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch with Lathbury and Tim's girlfriend, Carole Ward, whom he later married in 1985. They {{worked out of}} a four-room row house next-door to {{the brothers}}' family corner store and ran <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget for its first six months, in which they pooled their {{money to pay the}} bills. The company did not credit individuals on their releases, though they had individual roles in development: Chris and Lathbury programmed and Tim and Carole designed the graphics. Carole also served as the company's secretary. Ultimate Play the Game, as the company was publicly known, first licensed arcade cabinet conversion kits to companies before moving to the more profitable British home computer market.|$|E
5|$|The school runs <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget as a {{tradeoff}} for its financial independence and accessibility to low-income students. Tuition is billed on {{a sliding scale}} based on what parents can afford. Revenue from rental properties and fundraising supplements tuition income. The Free School started a high school program in 2006. It later spun off as the Harriet Tubman Democratic High School and enrolls about 20 students in both self-directed and traditional classes. Alumni of the school have attended a variety of colleges. Journalists have noted the school's similarity to unschooling and homeschooling, and its work to that of prefigurative politics. The Albany Free School {{is one of the}} few schools remaining from the 1960s and 1970s free school movement. It inspired the program of the Brooklyn Free School.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{infrastructure}} for the project (now known as the West Berkshire Groundwater Scheme) is still in place and maintained, albeit <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rather <b>shoestring</b> budget. But the lasting legacy of the scheme is that the catchment has been preserved as a near-natural groundwater system, almost totally unaffected by groundwater abstractions. This factor made it an ideal candidate for selection {{as one of the}} flagship research sites for the NERC LOCAR research project investigating permeable (i.e. groundwater dominated) catchments.|$|R
5000|$|John Coates wrote that: [...] Of all {{the campaigns}} of the Second World War that can {{reasonably}} {{claim to have}} been fought <b>on</b> <b>a</b> logistic <b>shoestring,</b> New Guinea ranks high. The country's relative isolation, inhospitable terrain, enervating and malarious climate, and underdeveloped infrastructure meant that the maintenance and re-supply of military forces presented a continuing challenge. After a series of false starts, the Allies generally overcame their logistic difficulties; the Japanese did not. Therein lay the most important single factor in the campaign.|$|R

5|$|Kubrick {{was raised}} in the Bronx, New York City, and {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. Although he only received average grades, Kubrick displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school. After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget, and made his first major Hollywood film, The Killing, for United Artists in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas, the war picture Paths of Glory (1957) and the historical epic Spartacus (1960). His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew, and he was approached by Marlon Brando to film what would become One-Eyed Jacks (1961), though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{lease on}} Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was {{extended}} {{on an annual}} basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on other days. Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in the quarry gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway {{as long as he}} was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom. Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the Aberllefenni Slate Quarry purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway. On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.|$|E
25|$|There {{was still}} theatre done <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring,</b> but several {{cultural}} entrepreneurs had raised the stakes {{to the point}} where a venue like Aurora (St Stephen's Church, Stockbridge) could hold its head up in any major world festival.|$|E

The film was hailed an filmmaking achievement by critics and garnered accolades for the director as a first feature.|$|E
25|$|The strong {{participation}} by AMC in Trans-Am and drag racing served to enhance its image, and notable was that its motorsports efforts were achieved <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget with the automaker racking up a respectable {{number of points}} against its giant competitors. For example, with an estimated 4.5million participants and 6million spectators, drag racing was the fastest growing segment of motorsport in the U.S. The marketing strategy was to appeal to buyers who otherwise would not give AMC a second glance.|$|E

25|$|Initially, no studio would {{finance the}} film {{because of its}} {{potentially}} controversial and off-beat subject matter. After Drugstore Cowboy received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest. However, they all wanted their own versions made and not Van Sant's. This frustration prompted the filmmaker to attempt the feature <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget with a cast of actual street kids filling out the roles including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, {{who was going to}} play Scott.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Clark was {{informed}} about a Mesolithic flint scatter {{that had been}} found in peaty deposits at Seamer Carr in North Yorkshire by an amateur archaeologist, John Moore. Clark visited this site, known as Star Carr, and realised that it may provide further evidence of a Mesolithic settlement. He oversaw three seasons of excavation at the site, in the summers of 1949, 1950, and 1951. The project was carried out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget under the auspices of Cambridge University and the Prehistoric Society.|$|E
25|$|Peanuts {{had become}} a {{phenomenon}} worldwide by the mid-1960s, and the special was commissioned and sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company. It was written {{over a period of}} several weeks, and animated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget in only six months. In casting the characters, the producers went an unconventional route, hiring child actors. The program's soundtrack was similarly unorthodox: it features a jazz score by pianist Vince Guaraldi. Its absence of a laugh track (a staple in US television animation in this period), in addition to its tone, pacing, music, and animation, led both the producers and network to wrongly predict the project would be a disaster preceding its broadcast.|$|E

25|$|In 1954, Westland {{investigated}} licensed {{manufacture of}} the Sikorsky S-56 {{for the civil}} market with turboshaft power. The company sought Ministry of Supply support for the proposal, {{but this was not}} forthcoming. In June 1958, Westland obtained an extension to their licence agreement with Sikorsky to cover the five bladed main-rotor, gearbox, tail-rotor, transmission and control systems of the S-56. Faced with continuing government indifference, Westland decided to press ahead with a private-venture design for a heavy-lift transport, built around the S-56 systems but powered by a pair of Napier Eland turboshafts. At the time, Westland was heavily committed to development of the Wessex and the Westminster project had to be run <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Senate {{election}} held in May 2007, Trillanes successfully {{launched a}} nationwide campaign from his prison cell {{as he ran}} and won {{a seat in the}} Philippine Senate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget. He was elected to the Senate as guest candidate for the anti-administration Genuine Opposition ticket, and assumed office on June 30, 2007. He made history for being the first Philippine senator to be elected while in jail when more than 11 million people voted him into office. On November 29, 2007, Trillanes, together with the soldiers facing coup d'état charges in connection with the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny, marched out of the courtroom while attending a hearing towards the Peninsula Manila hotel in Makati City, to reiterate their call for the ouster of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.|$|E
25|$|While on {{location}} in Ireland for The Young Racers in 1963, Corman, ever alert {{for an opportunity to}} produce a decent movie <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoestring</b> budget, persuaded Coppola to make a low-budget horror movie with funds left over from the movie. Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night, incorporating elements from Hitchcock's Psycho, and the result impressed Corman enough to give him the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights), Coppola directed in a period of nine days Dementia 13, his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a cult film among horror buffs. It was on the sets of Dementia 13 that he met his future wife Eleanor Jessie Neil.|$|E
