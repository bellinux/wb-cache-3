Images of the CME in different spectral lines {{show how the}} morphology depends on the temperature, density, and <b>outflow</b> <b>speed</b> of the ejected plasma. The H i Ly is the line that best resembles the white-light data, although it can be rather different where the <b>outflow</b> <b>speed</b> severely dims its radiative component. We estimate the ranges of temperature and density in the front, prominence core, and void. We also estimate the <b>outflow</b> <b>speed</b> that is the true speed of the ejecta as obtained from the Doppler dimming technique, its component projected on {{the plane of the}} sky, and the line-of-sight speed for the three components of the CME. The plasma in the front was denser, cooler, and more depleted in O and Si than the ambient coronal streamer. These characteristics indicate that it originated in the closed field core of the pre-CME streamer. The leading edge was not the projection of a simple spherical shell onto the plane of the sky. The line profiles suggest a wide looplike structure, although a more complete shell that was brighter in some areas could also match the data. The prominence has a structure in temperature and density with the hotter top end emitting in the Mg x and Si xii lines while the bottom end was much cooler and visible only in the H i Lyman lines. Emission in the void was rather faint. The <b>outflow</b> <b>speed</b> obtained from Doppler dimming of the radiative lines, the line-of-sight speed measured from the Doppler shift of the lines, and the plane-of-the-sky speed estimated from the comparison of the images taken at 2. 3 and 2. 6 R give speeds much lower than those estimated at greater heights (> 4 R) from LASCO and indicate a stronger acceleration at lower heights...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} properties of galactic winds are {{of paramount importance}} for our understanding of galaxy formation. Fortunately, they can be constrained using background quasars passing near star-forming galaxies (SFGs). From the 14 quasar&# 8722;galaxy pairs in our VLT/SINFONI Mgii Program for Line Emitters (SIMPLE) sample, we reobserved the 10 brightest galaxies in H&# 0945; with the VLT/SINFONI with 0. 7 " seeing and the corresponding quasar with the VLT/UVES spectrograph. Applying geometrical arguments to these ten pairs, we find that four are likely probing galactic outflows, three are likely probing extended gaseous disks, and the remaining three are not classifiable because they are viewed face-on. In this paper we present a detailed comparison between the line-of-sight kinematics and the host galaxy emission kinematics for the pairs suitable for wind studies. We find that the kinematic profile shapes (asymmetries) can be well reproduced by a purely geometrical wind model with a constant wind speed, except for one pair (towards J 2357 &# 8722; 2736) that has the smallest impact parameter b = 6 kpc and requires an accelerated wind flow.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Space Physics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. A {{two-dimensional}} hydrodynamic {{numerical model}} is extended {{and applied to}} simulate the interaction between stellar winds and the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, the stellar wind evolution of O- and B-type stars is calculated. First, {{the evolution of a}} stellar wind into the ambient interstellar medium and also a more dense molecular cloud are considered for the case of no relative motion between the star and the interstellar medium. This interaction results in a cavity being blown into the ISM. Of importance in this work is the boundary radius (astropause) of the stellar wind and also the location where the <b>outflow</b> <b>speed</b> decreases from supersonic to subsonic speeds, called the termination shock. Different parameters like ISM density, <b>outflow</b> <b>speed</b> and mass-loss rate were varied to study the effect these have on the computed astropause (AP) and termination shock (TS) radii. The evolution of these structures is presented up to a simulation time of 1 My. However, stars are not stationary relative to the ISM, and the evolution of stellar winds into the interstellar medium including relative motion is also considered. It is shown that the positions of the TS and AP are dependent on the mass-loss rate and stellar wind <b>outflow</b> <b>speed</b> of the star and the interstellar medium density and relative speed. When these massive stars reach the end of their life, they end their life in a supernova explosion. The explosion results in a blast wave moving outward, called the forward shock (FS) and a reverse shock (RS) also forms which moves inward. Previous work done by Ferreira and de Jager (2008) to simulate supernova remnant (SNR) evolution, was only done for the case of evolution into the undisturbed ISM (no cavity). In this work, the evolution of SNR is simulated taking also into account the pre-existing cavity blown out by the stellar winds of these massive stars. The results of this study showed that the evolution of the SNR is definitely influenced by the presence of a stellar wind cavity even if the cavity is only a few pc in extent. Master...|$|E

40|$|Measurements of {{interstellar}} absorption lines in 18 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) have been combined with published data, {{in order to}} reassess the dependence of galactic <b>outflow</b> <b>speeds</b> on starburst luminosity and galactic mass. The Doppler shifts reveal outflows of relatively cool gas at 330 ± 100 km/s. The <b>outflow</b> <b>speeds</b> increase with the star formation rate (SFR) as roughly v ∝ SFR^ 0. 35. This result is surprising since, in the traditional model for starburst-driven winds, these relatively cool gas clouds are accelerated by the ram pressure of a hot, supernova-heated wind that exhibits weak (if any) temperature variation with increasing galactic mass. The lack of evidence for much hotter winds is partly a sensitivity issue; but the outflow velocities in ultraluminous starbursts actually are consistent with acceleration by the tepid wind, indicating a hotter component is unlikely to dominate the momentum flux. The velocities in the dwarf starburst winds do not reach the terminal velocity of a hot wind at the measured temperature of kT 0. 73 keV. A dynamically-motivated {{explanation is that the}} dwarf starburst winds simply lack enough momentum to accelerate the clouds to the velocity of the hot wind. Among the subsample of starbursts with well- constrained dynamical masses, the terminal outflow velocities approach the galactic escape velocity. If this relation, which is similar to that observed for stellar winds, arises from radiation pressure on dust and gas limiting the maximum luminosity of a starburst, then feedback will be stronger in massive galaxies than previously thought helping shape the high-mass end of the galaxy luminosity function.

40|$|The {{classical}} Sweet-Parker {{approach to}} steady-state magnetic reconnection is extended into {{the regime of}} large resistivity (small magnetic Reynolds or Lundquist number) when the aspect ratio between the outflow and inflow scale, delta = d/L, approaches unity. In a previous paper {{the vicinity of the}} dissipation site ("diffusion region") was investigated. In this paper, the approach is extended to cover larger sites, in which the energy transfer and conversion is not confined to the diffusion region. Consistent with the results of Paper I, we find that increasing aspect ratio delta is associated with increasing compression, increasing reconnect ion rate for low Beta, but slightly decreasing rate for higher Beta, decreasing <b>outflow</b> <b>speed,</b> and increasing outflow magnetic field. These trends are stronger for lower Beta. Deviations from the traditional Sweet-Parker limit delta approaches 0 become significant for R(sub m) approx < 10, where R(sub m) is the magnetic Reynolds number (Lundquist number) based on the half-thickness of the current layer responsible for the Ohmic dissipation. They are also more significant for small gamma, that is, for increasing compressibility. In contrast to the results of Paper I, but consistent with earlier results for delta much < 1,nu(sub A) we find that in this limit the <b>outflow</b> <b>speed</b> is given by the Alfven speed nu(sub A) in the inflow region and the energy conversion is given by an even split of Poynting flux into enthalpy flux and bulk kinetic energy flux.

40|$|Contrary to the {{prediction}} of benchmark neoclassical models, growth accelerations in developing countries tend to be associated with current account improvements, resulting from larger increases in saving than in investment. I argue that this can be driven by the behavior of entrepreneurs facing incomplete financial markets and risky investment. The uninsurable risk of losing invested capital forces entrepreneurs to rely on self-financing to build up their firms. As new business opportunities open up, entrepreneurs increase their saving to finance the investment that produces growth. The key insight is that saving has to rise more than investment in order to allow also for the accumulation of precautionary assets. As a consequence, entrepreneurs generate a net saving increase that sustains persistent net capital outflows. Plausibly calibrated simulations produce sizeable quantitative effects.

Kinematic modelling indicates a wide opening angle (∼ 60 ◦), an inclination consistent {{with that of the}} disk, and deprojected <b>outflow</b> <b>speeds</b> of a few 100 km s− 1 that increas...|$|R
