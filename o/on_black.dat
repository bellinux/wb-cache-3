5|$|American {{alligator}} predation on Florida panthers is rare, but {{has been}} documented.

5|$|Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge {{influence}} in both television and literature and have {{in many cases}} become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film Almost Famous, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words <b>on</b> <b>Black</b> Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) <b>on</b> <b>Black</b> Sabbath {{as a means of}} proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.|$|E

5|$|After its {{ratification}} of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes. The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone {{with more than one}} black great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights. Restrictions <b>on</b> <b>black</b> land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent.|$|E
5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator <b>on</b> <b>Black</b> Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in the Moroccan desert.|$|E
5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs <b>on</b> <b>black),</b> lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed <b>on</b> <b>black</b> instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E

5|$|In 1904, Hunter made a {{visit to}} Paris, funded by his {{earnings}} as an illustrator. He {{was inspired by the}} numerous artistic experiences there, and became fully resolved to take up oil painting. When he returned to San Francisco in 1905, he began preparing for his first solo exhibition, which was to be held the following year. However, Hunter's early work was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and he returned to Scotland shortly afterwards, settling in Glasgow. Initially he continued to make his living there primarily as an illustrator. His oil painting began with still lifes <b>on</b> <b>black</b> backgrounds, influenced by the Dutch style.|$|E
5|$|In November, a New York City Police Department officer {{shot and}} killed, Akai Gurley, a 28-year-old African-American man.

5|$|Located {{entirely in}} southeastern Millard County, SR-161 starts at a diamond {{interchange}} with the westernmost exit on I-70 before it terminates at I-15. The road continues northward {{until it reaches}} the historic Cove Fort and the associated visitors center. On {{the eastern side of}} the highway is a Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) maintenance center. SR-161 starts to make a gentle turn to the northeast, passing a filling station, which also serves as a rest area as part of a public–private partnership between UDOT and the owners of the station. The highway intersects I-15 and comes to an end at a cattle guard <b>on</b> <b>Black</b> Rock Road northwest of the interchange with I-15.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{technology}} and systems used <b>on</b> <b>Black</b> Arrow had already been developed or flight-proven on the Black Knight rocket, or the Blue Steel missile. Black Arrow was designed to reuse as much technology from the earlier programmes as possible {{in order to reduce}} costs, and simplify the development process. Many senior staff of the Black Knight programme transferred directly to Black Arrow, including the Chief Missile Scientist, Roy Dommett, the Chief Design Engineer, Ray Wheeler and the Deputy Chief Engineer, John Underwood.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, 2009, Nintendo {{announced}} its first price reductions for the console. Nintendo {{sold more than}} threemillion Wii consoles in the U.S. in December 2009 (setting a regional record for the month and ending nine months of declining sales), due to the price cut and software releases such as New Super Mario Bros. Wii. On January 31, 2010 the Wii became the best-selling home video-game console produced by Nintendo, with sales of over 67million units (surpassing those of the original Nintendo Entertainment System). Nintendo reported that <b>on</b> <b>Black</b> Friday 2011 over 500,000 Wii consoles were sold, making it the most successful Black Friday in company history.|$|E
5|$|Protests erupted {{soon after}} the release of the video, and <b>on</b> <b>Black</b> Friday protesters shut down part of the city's Magnificent Mile. Public calls for {{resignation}} grew steadily over this period, including a well-circulated op-ed published in The New York Times. By early December, Emanuel's approval rating had sunk to 18%, with 67% of Chicagoans disapproving of his job performance and slightly more than half of those polled calling for his resignation. During the week of December 10, protestors blocked streets and continued to call for Emanuel to resign. Additional protests against Emanuel and Chicago's Police Department were held on the city's busy Michigan Avenue shopping area on December 24, 2015.|$|E
