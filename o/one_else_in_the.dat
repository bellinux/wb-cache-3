25|$|In February 1897 Sinclair scored 301 not {{out in a}} club game, which {{remained}} {{the highest score in}} any form of cricket in South Africa for many years. South Africa's next Tests came in 1898-99, with a two-match series against England. This time, thanks largely to Sinclair, the matches were more evenly contested, and South Africa gained a first-innings lead each time before losing. He did not bowl in the First Test, but scored 86, South Africa's first Test fifty, opening the first innings; apart from Pelham Warner's 132 in England's second innings, no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match reached 40. In the Second Test Sinclair became the first person from any country to score a century and take five wickets in an innings in the same Test. In England's first innings he took 6 for 30, dismissing them for 92, then went in to bat with South Africa's score at 27 for 2 to make 106 before being last out with the total on 177. He was caught on the boundary in each innings.|$|E
500|$|Although Henry {{played up}} front as a striker during his youth, {{he spent his}} time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger {{immediately}} changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp. During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to 4–5–1. This change forced Henry to adapt again {{to fit into the}} Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker. Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals.

2500|$|In 1999, Martínez {{finished}} 23–4 with a 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts (earning {{the pitching}} Triple Crown) in 31 games (29 starts), pitching 213⅓ innings.

The MVP result was controversial, as Martínez received the most first-place votes of any player (8 of 28), but was omitted from the ballot of two sportswriters, New York's George King and Minneapolis' LaVelle Neal. The two writers argued that pitchers were not sufficiently all-around players to be considered. (However, George King had given MVP votes to two pitchers just the season before: Rick Helling and David Wells; King was the only writer {{to cast a vote}} for Helling, who had gone 20–7 with a 4.41 ERA and 164 strikeouts.) MVP ballots have ten ranked slots, and sportswriters are traditionally asked to recuse themselves if they feel they cannot vote for a pitcher. [...] "It really made us all look very dumb", said Buster Olney, then a sportswriter for the New York Times. [...] "People were operating under different rules. The question of eligibility is a very basic thing. People were determining eligibility for themselves." [...] The Times does not permit its writers to participate in award voting. Martínez finished second to Texas Rangers catcher Iván Rodríguez, by a margin of 252 points to 239. Rodríguez had been included on all 28 ballots.

50|$|He quickly {{established}} his own concern by 1980 and started producing and directing {{a string of}} distinctive films made mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tamil language. His first commercially successful main lead hero film was Bhama Rukmini in 1980. This film was neither directed-produced nor written by him. His voice was dubbed by some <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> films he did till 1980 including Bhama Rukmini. It was from films like Mouna Geetangal he started to dub his own lines in his films. He often stars in lead roles of the films he scripts and directs, effectively carving out a niche for himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> actor-auteur vein. His style of film making is notable for its relatively elaborate, witty, and double-entered-laced script and socially themed framework. His on-screen personae are typically characterised by their ironic sense of humour and intelligent bravado. Success of Bhama Rukmini was followed by 12 films directed by him - starring him as the main lead which were box-office hits - Vidiyum Vari Kaathiru, Mouna Geethanagal, Indru Poyi Naalai Vaa, Antha Ezhu Natkal, Thooral Ninnu Pochhu, Poyi Satchi, Darling Darling Darling, Dhavani Kannavukal, Munthanai Mudichu, Chinna Veedu, Enga Chinna Rasa and Idhu Namma Aalu. From 1981 onwards successful Tamil films starring him, directed and written by him started being remade in Hindi with first being Mouna Geetangal remade as Ek Hi Bhool and Anztha Ezhu Natkal remade as Woh Saat Din. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> period 1980-1990, he rarely acted in films not directed or not written by him with exceptions being Naan Sigappu Manithan, Anbulla Rajinikanth and En Rathathin Rathame.

He introduced actress Urvashi in Tamil film Mundhanai Mudichu and actress Kalpana (sister of Urvashi) made her début with 1985 film Chinna Veedu directed by Bhagyraj, a commercially successful film. He received Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor for his performance in Mundhanai Mudichu. He became nationally famous when he wrote the script for Mundhanai Mudichu remake in Hindi as Masterji with Rajesh Khanna <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead role, which was huge success at the box-office. He decided to direct Hindi remake of Bhartiraja's 1984 directorial venture Oru Kaidhayin Diary with Rajesh Khanna <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead <b>in</b> 1985, but later Khanna due to his date issues had to opt-out and Bhagyaraj cast Amitabh Bachchan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hindi remake Aakhree Raasta. Bhagayraj decided to remade classic old Kannada film Mallammana Pavada starring Rajkumar and B Saroja Devi into a new Tamil film Enga Chinna Rasa in 1987, which became a huge blockbuster. In 1989, K Balaji produced Tamil remake of Mr India as En Rathathin Rathame and the film was successful. In 1989, he wrote script for Idhu Namma Allu and decided to produce it but chose not to direct it by himself as he wanted to act-write-direct a film on a serious issue which was Aararo Aaariraro. He received Best Film Award for Idhu Namma Aalu in 1990, directed by Balakumar whereas the other film Aararo Aaariraro also was both critically acclaimed and successful at box-office. After death of MGR in 1987, during a meeting with director C V Sridhar and producer Duraiswamay, an idea came across to Bhagyaraj {{to make use of}} unfinished 1977 film Anna Nee En Deivam starring MGR and Lata and make the film Avasara Police 100 starring himself as well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead.
