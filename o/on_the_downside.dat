Now, however, Japanese teams scout American Triple-A games and monitor MLB transactions, looking for players being shuttled {{back and forth}} between the minors and the majors. A good majority of American players recruited to play in NPB are power hitters, which traditionally are in short supply in Japan.|$|E

5000|$|... "The School Boy" [...] is a poem {{written in}} the {{pastoral}} tradition that focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>downsides</b> of formal learning. It considers how going to school on a summer day [...] "drives all joy away". The boy in this poem {{is more interested in}} escaping his classroom than he is with anything his teacher is trying to teach. In lines 16-20, a child in school is compared to a bird in a cage. Meaning something that was born to be free and in nature, is instead trapped inside and made to be obedient.|$|R

25|$|During a {{downside}} regime, {{a large number}} of investors who have held positions in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in ‘safer’ investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a flight-to-quality effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers {{in a short period of}} time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy.|$|E
25|$|The Hs 123 was not {{employed}} in the subsequent Battle of Britain as the English Channel proved a formidable obstacle for the short-ranged aircraft. The sole operator, II.(Schl)/LG 2 went back to Germany to re-equip with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter bomber (Jabo) variant. The Bf 109E fighter bomber was not capable of carrying any more bombs than the Hs 123. It did, however, have a greater range and was far more capable of defending itself. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> were the notoriously tricky taxiing, ground handling and takeoff/landing characteristics, especially exacerbated with a bomb load.|$|E
25|$|T-5 HO {{lights are}} the newest {{variation}} on fluorescent lights. They are run at slightly higher power levels than standard fluorescent lamps, but are made significantly thinner than standard fluorescent bulbs, {{which allows for}} more efficient reflector designs that get more light into the aquarium. Higher quality T-5 systems often match or exceed the output of equivalent power compact fluorescent or VHO lighting fixtures. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>downside,</b> T-5 lighting {{is the most expensive}} type fluorescent lighting available. Many times it is much cheaper per watt, especially in the long run with the multiple T-5 bulbs being replaced, to use an equivalent metal halide light setup over a T-5 setup if such high light output is required.|$|E

It addresses the responsibility and significance of both capital and labour contributing to exploitative and greedy relationships throughout all three cases. The results contribute to a more balanced understanding of the responsibilities towards the ‘shadow sides’ of free movement in the EU, as it shows that not all free movement of persons is totally free. Moreover, instead of bold political statements, it demonstrates the relevance of a more differentiated perspective <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>downsides</b> and benefits of European free movement.|$|R

25|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>downside,</b> {{cartridges}} {{took longer}} to manufacture than CDs, with each production run (from order to delivery) taking {{two weeks or}} more. This meant that publishers of Nintendo 64 games had to attempt to predict demand for a game ahead of its release. They risked being left with a surplus of expensive cartridges for a failed game or a weeks-long shortage of product if they underestimated a game's popularity. The cost of producing a Nintendo 64 cartridge was also far higher than for a CD. Publishers passed these expenses onto the consumer. Nintendo 64 games cost an average of $10 more when compared to games produced for rival consoles. The higher cost also created the potential for much greater losses to the game's publisher {{in the case of}} a flop, making the less risky CD medium tempting for third party companies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Poles were a force to be {{reckoned}} with, especially their elite, heavy cavalry, most notably the Winged Hussars. While the Russians were fighting among themselves in a civil war, King Sigismund saw an opportunity to invade and take power, as did Sweden though they were never firmly on one side or the other. At one point the boyars invited the son of King Sigismund, Prince Władysław, to become their new Tsar, but Sigismund disallowed it. Initially Sigismund wished to gain the throne for himself and become the master of Russia, and while this did not happen, the Commonwealth army was victorious in many battles and gained more territory. At one point Polish troops, under the command of the famous Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski, captured Moscow and the Kremlin. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> the whole conflict meant that any lasting union between the Commonwealth and Russia was impossible and any plans concerning the final destruction of the Russian state were unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Defoe scored five goals at White Hart Lane in a 9–1 {{thrashing}} of Wigan on 22 November 2009. This {{included the}} second-fastest hat-trick in Premier League history, which was scored in seven minutes. In doing so, Defoe became {{only the third}} player to score five goals in one Premier League match, after Alan Shearer and Andy Cole. Dimitar Berbatov and Sergio Agüero have subsequently equalled this feat. After the match, Harry Redknapp further asserted his belief that Defoe {{would go on to}} be the Premier League's top scorer in 2009–10. Redknapp later said that although Wayne Rooney is the best all-round attacking player, Defoe is the best finisher in England and should be a regular for the England national team. On 3 February, Defoe claimed his third hat-trick of the season in an FA Cup fourth round replay against Leeds United at Elland Road, with Spurs winning 3–1. His rich vein of form continued on 21 February with another goal in the Premier League, against Wigan. Defoe's next goal was a penalty in Tottenham's win against Chelsea, which itself followed a famous 2–1 win over Arsenal. This took his tally to 24 goals for the season. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>downside,</b> Defoe committed a significant number of handball offences during the season, being penalised for the offence on 19 occasions, nine more than any other player.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{systematic}} review of the literature concerning the negative aspects of global sourcing (GS). It complements prior research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> positive aspects of GS, advances theoretical understanding of the phenomenon, and suggests an agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The sourcing, international business and supply chain management literature is systematically reviewed and findings from 83 previous studies are investigated. Findings: Research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>downsides</b> of GS has intensified over the last decade, but the related knowledge has been very fragmented and oftentimes latent. This literature review extracts knowledge around 28 antecedents to GS <b>downsides</b> from <b>the</b> literature and illustrates their potential harmful effects along operational and financial performance dimensions. Findings suggest that future research should focus more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> effects of decision-making biases and the effects of firm-internal barriers. The dynamic and hidden costs of GS should also be scrutinized in more depth. Originality/value: This study is the first systematic literature review of <b>the</b> <b>downsides</b> of GS. It facilitates a more balanced and nuanced picture of GS to help managers make better-informed GS decisions. The review also offers a holistic research framework that opens up avenues for much-needed research into the “dark side” of GS...|$|R
40|$|Segmentation plays a {{vital role}} in medical imaging. Segmentation of an image is the {{partition}} or separation of the image into disjoint regions of similar feature. We propose a method that integrates Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering and marker controlled watershed segmentation algorithm for medical image segmentation. The use of the usual watershed algorithm for medical image analysis is common because of its advantages, such as always being able to construct a complete division of the image. However, its downsides include over-segmentation and sensitivity to false edges. We concentrate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>downsides</b> of <b>the</b> usual watershed algorithm when it is applied to medical images by using Fuzzy C-Means clustering to produce a primary segmentation of the image before we apply marker controlled watershed segmentation algorithm to it. The Fuzzy C-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm, while the marker controlled watershed segmentation algorithm makes use of automated thresholding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gradient magnitude map <b>on</b> <b>the</b> initial partitions {{to reduce the number of}} false edges and over-segmentation.

500|$|The LFR {{navigation}} system required, at a minimum, only a simple AM radio receiver {{on board the}} aircraft to accurately navigate the airways under instrument meteorological conditions, and even execute an instrument approach to low minimums. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>downside,</b> however, it had only four course directions per station, was sensitive to atmospheric {{and other types of}} interference and aberrations, and required pilots to listen for hours to an annoying monotonous beep, or a faint stream of Morse codes, often embedded in background [...] "static". Its eventual replacement, the VHF band VOR {{navigation system}}, had many advantages. The VOR was virtually immune to interference, had 360 available course directions, had a visual [...] "on course" [...] display (with no listening needed), and was far easier to use. Consequently, when the VOR system became available in the early 1950s its acceptance was rapid, and within a decade the LFR was mostly phased out. VOR itself is gradually being phased out today in favor of the far superior Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{downside}} risk aversion {{is the study}} of the placement of a pure risk (a secondary risk) <b>on</b> either <b>the</b> upside or <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> of a primary two-state risk.
