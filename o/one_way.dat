When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term.

He said Big Huge Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions on how to improve the game.|$|E

It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn <b>one</b> <b>way</b> so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system.

The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in <b>one</b> <b>way</b> or another.|$|E
