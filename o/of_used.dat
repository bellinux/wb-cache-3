Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act.

5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales <b>of</b> <b>used</b> goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value <b>of</b> <b>used</b> goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E
5000|$|The {{right to}} use a {{copyright}} protected work may cover individual or all types <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> § 31 I 1 UrhG. The concept of “type of use” isn't defined by law. And there is no list featuring possibilities <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> From the wording of § 31 I 1 UrhG (“…einzelne oder alle…“, which means: “several or all”) it can be inferred that each type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> shows distinctive characteristics.A type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> must, thus, be clearly distinguishable from any other type <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> [...] For each type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> there is consequently a corresponding right <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> If there are several types <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in connection with their work, there will be, in proportion, various rights <b>of</b> <b>use</b> the author can grant. The types <b>of</b> <b>use</b> have changed and evolved {{in the course of}} technical development and they still continue to do so.The term “kind of use” refers to [...] "all technically and economically concretised utilisation of an author's work, meaning that the parties to a contract have specified the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the work as required for achieving the contractual purpose.The kinds <b>of</b> <b>use</b> listed in § 15 UrhG can be subdivided into several rights <b>of</b> <b>use</b> which again can be matched, each, with a corresponding type <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> so it is always possible to restrict a right <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in many different ways as long as the specification <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> work makes clear the individuality of the type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> with respect to its economic and technical content. So there is a possibility to control the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> one's work by specifying the types <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> thereby limiting the rights <b>of</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R

The 747-300M features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck, similar to the -200M, but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers. The 747-300SR, a short range, high-capacity domestic model, was produced for Japanese markets with a maximum seating for 584.

5|$|In 1915, O'Brien, by now in {{poor health}} as a {{consequence}} of alcohol abuse, sold his shares in the brewery to Joseph Segber, who appointed F. Vinnicomb to manage the company day-to-day. The sale of alcohol in the territory was suspended in the autumn of 1919, full prohibition followed the next year, and the company ceased trading. Initially the premises were kept maintained, probably in case the company was able to reopen, but most of the equipment was sold off to a new brewery in Fairbanks in 1933. The buildings were soon dismantled, probably for firewood, and vegetation reclaimed the site. The rusting brewery steam boiler remained on the site, surrounded by mounds <b>of</b> <b>used</b> bottles, many of which were dug up and removed by collectors over subsequent years, leaving perhaps over 3,000 intact bottles still in place. The remains of a Perfection Bottling Machine and a Crown capping device were left buried beneath the debris.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCivic mindedness and the {{perceptions}} of trustworthiness, usefulness, and ease <b>of</b> <b>use</b> seem to explain much <b>of</b> the effective <b>use</b> <b>of</b> websites.

With the help of ordinary least squares and quantile regression models, we found that there is mixed influence of those factors on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> government websites.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} software plasticity, i. e. {{the ability}} of interactive systems to adapt to context <b>of</b> <b>use</b> while preserving user-centered properties. In plasticity, a classical approach consists in concentrating design efforts {{on a set of}} pre-defined contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> that deserve high quality User Interfaces (UIs), and switching from one to another according to variations <b>of</b> context <b>of</b> <b>use</b> at runtime. However, key contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> cannot be finely envisioned at design time, especially when dealing with the specific field of mobility. Thus, we propose a designer’s partner tool running on the end-user’s mobile device to probe key contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in the wild. The underlying principles are data gathering, bayesian learning, and clustering techniques. Probing key contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> can save design efforts...|$|R
