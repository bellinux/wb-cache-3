5000|$|The {{techniques}} {{mentioned above}} are utilized {{in a handful}} of different ways. The probes and transducers can be utilized on a [...] "walking stick", on a hand pushed trolley, or in a hand held setup. These devices are used when small sections of track are to be inspected or when a precise location is desired. Many times these detail oriented inspection devices follow up on indications made by a rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> or HiRail trucks. Handheld inspection devices are very useful for this when the track is used heavily, because they can be removed relatively easy. However, they are considered very slow and tedious, when there are thousands of miles of track that need inspection. [...] Rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> and HiRail trucks are the answer to today’s high mileage inspection needs. The first rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> were created by Dr. Sperry. Since then, many new models have rolled out. These rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> are basically their own train with inspection equipment on board. The probes and transducers are mounted on carriages located underneath the <b>inspection</b> <b>car.</b> Modern day <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> now use multiple NDT methods. Induction and ultrasound methods can be used in rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> and operate at testing speeds of more than 30 mph. The next generation will go even faster.|$|R

50|$|A speeder (also {{known as}} railway motor car, putt-putt, track-{{maintenance}} car, crew car, jigger, trike, quad, trolley or <b>inspection</b> <b>car,</b> and {{also known as}} a draisine (although that can also be unpowered) is a maintenance of way motorized vehicle formerly used on railroads around the world by track inspectors and work crews to move quickly to and from work sites. Although it is slow compared to a train or car, it is called speeder because it is faster than a human-powered vehicle such as a handcar. Motorised <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> date back to at least 1896, when it was reported that the U.S. Daimler Motor Company created a gasoline-powered rail <b>inspection</b> <b>car</b> capable of 15 mph.|$|R

50|$|The first rail {{inspections}} {{were done}} visually. Many sources cite {{that the need}} for better rail inspections came after a derailment at Manchester, New York, in 1911. That particular accident resulted in the death of 29 people and injuries to 60 others. The investigation of the accident revealed that the cause was a transverse fissure (a critical crack which lies perpendicular to the length of the rail) in the rail. Further investigation in the late 1920s showed that this type of defect was quite common. With increased rail traffic at higher speeds and with heavier axle loads today, critical crack sizes are shrinking and rail inspection is becoming more important. In 1927, Dr. Elmer Sperry built a massive rail <b>inspection</b> <b>car</b> under contract with the American Railway Association. Magnetic induction was the method used on the first rail <b>inspection</b> <b>cars.</b> This was done by passing large amounts of magnetic field through the rail and detecting flux leakage with search coils. Since then, many other <b>inspection</b> <b>cars</b> have traversed the rails in search of flaws.|$|R
