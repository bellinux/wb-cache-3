40|$|By {{virtue of}} the Customs Courts Act of 1980 (the 2 ̆ 21980 Act 2 ̆ 2), 2 ̆ 7 the U. S. Court of International Trade (the 2 ̆ 2 CIT 2 ̆ 2) was granted new and {{exclusive}} jurisdiction over certain actions commenced by the United States, including actions 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 to recover upon a bond relating to the importation of merchandise. 2 ̆ 2 As {{a result of the}} 1980 legislation, the CIT became the new forum for suits instituted by the United States to collect liquidated damages which had been assessed by the U. S. Customs Service (2 ̆ 2 Customs 2 ̆ 2) against, an importer and/or its surety for breach of the terms of an importation bond. This Article shall concentrate upon five of the claims and defenses considered by the CIT and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and will include a discussion of several of the related unresolved issues that have recently emerged. The specific issues that will be focused upon are: 1. Whether the assessment of liquidated damages is a protestable decision within the meaning of 19 U. S. C. § 1514 (a), and if so, whether the failure to protest within ninety days of the demand for damages precludes the challenging of the assessment of those damages as a defense to a collection suit by the U. S. government. 2. Whether the event that commences the running of the statute of limitations in suits to recover liquidated damages for breach of the bond is the date of the actual breach, or the date of the mailing of the demand for payment of the liquidated damages. 3. Whether liquidation of an entry affects the bond <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> an <b>importer</b> and surety in a suit based upon failure to timely redeliver, export or destroy foodstuffs and/or motor vehicles. Whether liquidated damages assessed for breach of a bond function as a penalty for purposes of the statute of limita- tions and/or the awarding of prejudgment interest. 5. Whether prejudgment interest should ordinarily run from the date of the first demand for payment of the liquidated damages...|$|R

40|$|Unilateral or sub-global {{policies}} to combat climate change are potentially sensitive to free-riding and carbon leakage. One {{way of dealing}} with carbon leakage and competitiveness is the imposition of border adjustment measures for competing imports, for example in the form <b>of</b> the <b>obligation</b> to <b>importers</b> <b>of</b> goods to purchase and surrender emissions allowances to the authorities when importing. In this paper, we explore some implications of border adjustment measures in the EU ETS, for sectors that might be subject to carbon leakage. We examine the implications of two variants of these measures on the competitiveness of these sectors and on the global environment {{with the help of a}} multi-sector, multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the global economy. Our calculations suggest that border adjustment might reduce the sectoral rate of leakage of the iron and steel industry rather forcefully, but that the reduction would be less for the mineral products sector, including cement. The reduction of the overall or macro rate of leakage would be modest. So, from an environmental point of view border tax adjustments would not be a very effective policy measure, but might mainly be justified by considerations of sectoral competitiveness. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain. Following on from these remarks I will adumbrate an alternative account of the relation which grounds (enforceable) <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice...|$|R

But {{even if there are}} <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global or environmental citizenship. Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R
