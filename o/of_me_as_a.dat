After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film—"Sooner or Later", [...] "More" [...] and [...] "What Can You Lose"—which {{would be part of}} the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to her previous releases.

500|$|In her writing, Frank {{examined}} her {{relationships with the}} members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, [...] "I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did." [...] The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, [...] "Margot's much nicer... She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> little baby who doesn't count." ...|$|E

500|$|Beatty had {{realized}} several {{positive aspects of}} hiring Madonna as an actress for the film. She would be inclined to develop the soundtrack for Dick Tracy and the film studio would {{see this as a}} promotional opportunity before the release of their product, since Madonna was popular as a recording artist. This would also benefit Warner Bros. Records, who would get a reason to release a new Madonna record. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , by the 1980s record labels started to release albums which were closely associated with a film, thereby gaining double promotion.

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the Crystal Palace, Grove devoted much of his leisure time to Biblical scholarship. Discovering that there was no full {{concordance}} of the proper names in the Bible, Grove, helped by his wife, began work in 1853 making a complete index of each occurrence of every proper name in the Bible, including the Apocrypha. Between 1860 and 1863, Grove was assistant editor to Sir William Smith in a comprehensive Bible dictionary, contributing more than a thousand pages. Some entries written by Grove, such as that on the prophet Elijah, were equivalent almost to book-length. He visited the Holy Land in 1859 and 1861, and helped to found the Palestine Exploration Fund, of which he became honorary secretary, labouring incessantly on its behalf. The Archbishop of York said that Grove was [...] "virtually the founder and institutor of the Society, and has done wonders for it throughout." [...] Grove later observed, [...] "People will insist on thinking <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> musician, which I really am not in the very least degree. I took quite as much interest in my investigations into the natural features and the little towns of Palestine which I did for Smith's Dictionary of the Bible or for Arthur Stanley's Sinai and Palestine, as I did for Beethoven and Mendelssohn, indeed perhaps more so." ...|$|E

[...] Several of his pieces were broadcast during his lifetime on BBC Radio. His Symphony No. 3 in C was premiered by the University of Iowa orchestra in Iowa City in 1975. Burgess described his Sinfoni Melayu {{as an attempt to}} [...] "combine the musical elements of the country into a synthetic language which called on native drums and xylophones." [...] The structure of [...] (1974) was modelled on Beethoven's Eroica symphony, while Mozart and the Wolf Gang (1991) mirrors the sound and rhythm of Mozartian composition, among other things attempting a fictional representation of Symphony No.40. Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 features prominently in A Clockwork Orange (and in Stanley Kubrick's film version of the novel). Many of his unpublished compositions are listed in This Man and Music. [...] He wrote a good deal of music for recorder as his son played the instrument. [...] Several of his pieces for recorder and piano including the Sonata No. 1, Sonatina and [...] "Tre Pezzetti" [...] have been included on a major CD release from recorder player John Turner and pianist Harvey Davies; the double album also includes related music from 15 other composers and is titled Anthony Burgess – The Man and his Music (Metier records, release September 2013).|$|E
