5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering,</b> with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E
5|$|Proteins may be {{purified}} {{from other}} cellular components {{using a variety}} of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.|$|E

5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> began in the 1970s, with the {{invention}} of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E

5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting {{would have on the}} workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering,</b> and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns the economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E

5|$|The Baltimore Sun writer Tamara Ikenberg equated {{the episode}} {{as both a}} parody <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> and a {{statement}} against its potential evils, particularly through in its portrayal of the giant mutant Stan wreaking havoc through South Park. This episode marked the first appearances of the characters Shelley and Sharon Marsh, Stan's sister and mother respectively, {{as well as that}} of Dr. Mephesto. Dr. Mephesto is based on Marlon Brando's character Dr. Moreau in the 1996 film, The Island of Dr. Moreau, which is based on the 1896 H. G. Wells novel of the same name. Mephesto is named after Mephistopheles, the demon in the Faust legend. Kevin, the companion of Dr. Mephesto, is based on the small creature who resembles and dresses like a miniature version of Brando's character in the 1996 film The Island of Dr. Moreau.|$|E
5|$|The film {{operates}} on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It employs {{some of the}} conventions of film noir, among them {{the character of a}} femme fatale; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); chiaroscuro cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlookâ€”extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity. It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> in the context of classical Greek drama and hubris. It also draws on Biblical images, such as Noah's flood, and literary sources, such as Frankenstein. Linguistically, the theme of mortality is subtly reiterated in the chess game between Sebastian and Tyrell, supposedly based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851 (though Scott has said this was merely coincidental).|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E

The son is the climax of generations <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>engineering</b> and selective breeding, and is a genetically perfect human.

This official understood that the soul is reincarnated, and in preparation for her own death and reincarnation she was instrumental in the genetic engineering of the son and daughter.|$|E
