5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Following his injury, Loxton played in neither; Australia won both by an innings. While in Scotland, Loxton's nose was {{operated}} on in Edinburgh. Following his injury, Loxton eschewed the sweep shot and advised {{students to do}} the same, exhorting them to move <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> foot to drive instead.|$|E
5|$|Johnston then {{knocked over}} Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> foot and inside edged {{the ball into}} his stumps for eight; this brought Godfrey Evanswho was given two livesto the crease at 6/60. Evans hit Johnston hard {{in the air to}} cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second {{catching}} opportunity went in the same direction before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Hutton rocked <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> foot, played {{outside a}} Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32. The English opener had been {{uncertain}} against Johnson's spin and played forward too early {{at a slower}} ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Later in the afternoon, Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England were out early on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.|$|E

50|$|Detainees wearing {{civilian}} clothing (more common {{later in}} the war) instead of the striped uniforms were often marked with a prominent X on the back. This made for an ersatz prisoner uniform. For permanence, such Xs were made with white oil paint, with sewn-on cloth strips, or were cut (with underlying jacket-liner fabric providing the contrasting color). Detainees would be compelled to sew their number and (if applicable) a triangle emblem <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>fronts</b> of such X-ed clothing.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{derailleur}} gears the chain is usually long enough {{so that it can}} be shifted <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>front</b> chain ring and the largest rear sprocket without jamming, and not so long that, when shifted <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> smallest <b>front</b> chain ring and the smallest rear sprocket, the rear derailleur cannot take up all the slack. Meeting both these requirements is only possible if the rear derailleur is compatible with the gear range being used on the bike. It is broadly accepted as inadvisable to actually use the large/large and small/small gear combinations due to chain stress and wear.|$|R
5|$|In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia batted {{first and}} Johnston scored his Test career best of 29 in another tail-wagging {{performance}} in the first innings. After coming to the crease with the score at 8/275 on the second morning, Johnston added 45 runs with wicket-keeper Don Tallon before the latter fell to Bedser. He was joined by last man Toshack and they put on 30 before Johnston was stumpedhaving overbalanced while leaning <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> foot and trying to hit a ball for sixfrom the bowling of Doug Wright to end Australia's innings at 350. Both Johnston and Toshack threw the bat at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions compared to where they had aimed their shots. Both mennot known for their batting abilityplayed without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls being unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers.|$|E
5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of a semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged {{through the streets of}} San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 amid dark skies and the threat of rain; Australia was unable to break through despite taking the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians, playing with a {{straight}} bat and stretching forward <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> foot to block the ball. Tallon dropped Compton for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston when the batsman was on 73. Lindwall bowled well below his top pace in the morning session and the batsmen slowly accumulated their runs. Bedser was the more defensive of the two Englishmen, and Compton drove Toshack past mid on for a four to register his second century of the series, after 235 minutes of batting. Lindwall then beat Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch, but the Englishman survived. England reached lunch at 323/7 having added 92 runs without losing a wicket. Compton was on 123 and Bedser on 37, having brought up their century partnership. Five minutes were lost in the morning session when a stray dog invaded the playing arena and evaded policemen and a number of Australian fielders who attempted to catch it.|$|E

50|$|The tandem {{compound}} locomotive {{first appeared on}} the American Erie Railroad in 1867. In a {{tandem compound}} engine, each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders drove a common crosshead, connecting rod and crank. The high-pressure cylinders were bolted <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>fronts</b> of <b>the</b> low-pressure cylinders, which were usually each cast integrally with {{one half of the}} smokebox saddle. The hollow piston valves were mounted on the same valve spindle in a common steam chest, with the high-pressure valves arranged for inside admission and the low-pressure valves for outside admission.|$|R
5|$|The {{collapse}} left Barnett and captain Yardley {{as the new}} men at the crease. Both players {{attacked the}} bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs. Soon after, Lindwall {{was forced to leave}} the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight off the inside edge as he leaned <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> foot. This brought Evans to the crease with the score at 60/6, and he attempted to disrupt the Australians' line and length by counter-attacking with a series of shots in front of the wicket. He drove the ball forward of point to the boundary for four, and was then given two lives. He hit Johnston hard to cover, but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary. The second chance of a catch went through Bradman's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen. However, the missed opportunities cost the tourists little; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at short leg by Morris. Without further addition to the score, Toshack trapped Yardley, who had lingered at the crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs, leg before wicket (lbw) with a ball that straightened after pitching, leaving the score at 74/8.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the English crowd {{filled the}} ground early, anticipating a strong showing {{from the home}} team after their {{promising}} start on the first day, but Australia's lower order batted their team into control on the second morning. Tallon and Lindwall batted confidently {{from the start of}} the play, and the latter hit two cover drives for four from Bedser after the new ball was taken. O'Reilly said Lindwall was playing in the same manner as when he made his maiden Test century in the last Ashes series, but he then played around a straight ball from Bedser, and was bowled for 15 to leave the score at 275/8. Tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner, while Johnston and Toshack played adventurously, registering the highest Test scores of their careers. Both Johnston and Toshack swung hard at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Australia's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnstonwho scored 29before becoming Bedser's second victim of the morning, holing out to Yardley for 53. Toshack came out to join Johnston with the score at 320/9 and the last pair put on 30 more runs before the latter was stumped from Wright's leg spin, having overbalanced while leaning <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> foot and trying to hit a ball for six. The Australians had regained the momentum, adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls being unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers from mishits. Both Johnston and Toshacknot known for their batting abilityplayed without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. Yardley was later criticised for not bringing Wright into the attack at an earlier stage, as the Australian tail was dealing efficiently with the English pacemen. Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers, ending with 4/100 from 43 overs, while debutant Coxon took 2/90 from 35 overs. The off spin of Laker was used sparingly, accounting for only seven overs, whereas the part-time medium pace of Edrich and Yardley had combined for 23 overs.|$|E

25|$|He was {{considered}} by some observers to have trouble against quality spin, especially against Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh, who dismissed Ponting on 13 occasions in international cricket.
