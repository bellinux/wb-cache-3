5|$|Marmalard {{and other}} <b>Omegas</b> lure Otter to a motel {{and beat him}} up, believing that Otter is {{having an affair with}} Marmalard's girlfriend, Mandy. The Deltas' midterm grades are so poor that an ecstatic Wormer expels them all, having already {{notified}} their local draft boards that they are now eligible for military service. The news shocks Flounder so badly that he vomits on Wormer.|$|E
5|$|The Deltas are despondent, but Bluto rallies {{them with}} an impassioned, if {{historically}} inaccurate, speech ("Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"), and so they decide {{to take action against}} Wormer, the <b>Omegas,</b> and the college. They convert Flounder's damaged car into an armored vehicle and hide it inside a cake-shaped breakaway float in order to sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they wreak havoc on the event, the futures of several of the student main characters are revealed using freeze-frame labels. Most of the Deltas become respectable professionals, while their adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Bluto and D-Day {{steal the}} answers to an {{upcoming}} test from the trash, not realizing that the <b>Omegas</b> have planted a fake set of answers for them to find. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met at the supermarket. They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk. Pinto takes her home in a shopping cart and later discovers {{that she is the}} mayor's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Animal House was {{the first}} film {{produced}} by National Lampoon, the most popular humor magazine on college campuses in the mid-1970s. The periodical specialized in satirizing politics and popular culture. Many of the magazine’s writers were recent college graduates, hence their appeal to students all over the country. Doug Kenney was a Lampoon writer and the magazine’s first editor-in-chief. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the <b>Omegas</b> in the film (he had been president of the university's elite Spee Club). Kenney {{was responsible for the}} first appearances of three characters that would appear in the film, Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon Wormer. They made their debut in 1973's National Lampoon’s High School Yearbook, a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger's and Pepperidge's characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon Wormer was a P. E. and civics teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook.|$|E

500|$|The {{leader of}} The <b>Omegas,</b> Callisto is a mutant with {{enhanced}} superhumanly acute senses, who senses mutants and their powers, and possesses superhuman speed and reflexes.

Ramirez had originally auditioned to play the mutant prostitute Stacy X, and impressed Brett Ratner so much the director decided to bring her to play Callisto.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{commenced}} in {{the autumn}} of 1977, [...] and Landis brought the actors who played the Deltas up five days early in order to bond. Staying at the Rodeway Inn motel in adjacent Springfield, they moved an old piano from the lobby into McGill's room, which became known as [...] "party central." [...] James Widdoes ("Hoover") remembers, [...] "It was like freshman orientation. There was a lot of {{getting to know each other}} and calling each other by our character names." [...] This tactic encouraged the actors playing the Deltas to separate themselves from the actors playing the <b>Omegas,</b> helping generate authentic animosity between them on camera. Belushi and his wife Judy rented a house in south Eugene in order to keep him away from alcohol and drugs; she remained in Oregon while he commuted to New York City for Saturday Night Live.|$|E
