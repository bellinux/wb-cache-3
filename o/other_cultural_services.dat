40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain some ways of {{innovation}} that are being extended to Spanish public libraries, and to consider that these changes require a more flexible model of management and service. To illustrate these new models we describe libraries such as Alhóndiga Bilbao, Cubit at Zaragoza, and Library at Tenerife space for arts (TEA). These libraries have been created with a different model, mainly conditioned by their location inside big cultural or arts centres, where they coexist with <b>other</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> and events...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores public {{internet}} access in an inner-city community with many “digital divide” characteristics. Using a qualitative methodology attentive to social, technical, and geographic contexts, the paper describes how {{internet access}} is {{integrated into a}} communicative ecology: specifically how internet access is identified by residents; what it affords; and its potential for effective use. In addition, it argues {{that the concept of}} “universal access” to internet infrastructures must be refined to consider “contextual access” that is, access provided that takes into account cultural, geographic, and demographic factors. Finally, at the level of practice, the paper recommends striking a balance between “universal” and “contextual” internet access in an urban area so that internet access becomes linked with <b>other</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>services,</b> and is integrated into local contexts of use...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstract Agricultural {{intensification}} {{has led to}} {{the decrease}} of the diversity of wild and domestic pollinators. For instance, honeybees declined by 59 % in 61 years in the USA. About 35 % of major crops in the world depend on pollination services, and 3 – 8 % of world crop production will disappear without pollinators. Indeed, pollination provides several ecosystem services such as enabling crop and honey productions, regulating weeds and <b>other</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>services.</b> Agricultural intensification has also decreased weed diversity by about 50 % in 70 years because massive herbicide sprays have reduced the competition between weeds and crops. Nevertheless, weeds are at the basis of agricultural foodwebs, providing food to many living organisms. In particular, weeds provide flowers for pollinating insects including honey and wild bees. Here, we review the decline of weeds and bees. We discuss the effect of bees and pollination on crop production. We describe the complex interactions between bee pollinators, e. g. honey and wild bees, and landscape habitats such as crop fields and seminatural elements. For that, we focus on spatial and temporal effects on flower resources. We show that weed abundance can reduce crop yields, thus inducing conflict with farmers. But weed abundance enhances regulating services by ensuring the survival of honeybees in the absence of oil seed crops. Weed abundance also enhances pollination services and, in turn, honey yield for the benefit of beekeepers. Weed abundance has also improved the survival of wild flora and the socio-cultural value of landscapes, a major request from the public. From those findings, we present a conceptual framework allowing to define ecological engineering options based upon ecosystem services of weeds and pollinators...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAssessment of {{ecosystem}} services (ES) can improve decision-making and policy development on {{land use and}} the environment. As the determinants {{of supply and demand}} for ES are spatially variable, ES assessments often need to be spatially explicit. ES mapping has gained increasing attention in research and has been used to identify priority areas for ES provision or with most pressing threats on ES. Mapping can be combined with scenarios of environmental, political, social or economic to investigate future ES changes, define sensitive areas to change and estimate the impact of changes on society. ES mapping is more often applied to provisioning and regulation services rather than cultural services. Among cultural ES (e. g., scenic beauty, recreation, spiritual, heritage, etc.), the recreation-related ES are the most often mapped because they are relatively simple to quantify (e. g., based on site visits), compared to <b>other</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> whose assessment require to understand personal preferences, beliefs or spiritual values (e. g., aesthetics or sense of place). We assessed several cultural ES related to recreation, scenic beauty and spiritual values in the Mariño watershed (Apurímac region) in Peru using several methods with a focus on spatial variations. We used participatory mapping methods during workshops and interviews to understand the spatial distribution of the supply and use of ES. We also used surveys to analyze what landscape or ecosystem attributes explain cultural ES, for example aesthetic preferences for certain landscape elements. We then used those attributes to map ES supply and we compared the maps produced by the two approaches (direct participatory mapping vs. mapping with attributes). We also compared differences in ES maps resulting from different information sources and stakeholders. Results allow to discuss {{the pros and cons of}} different approaches applied to ES related to recreation, scenic beauty and spiritual values...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in assessing ecosystem services to improve ecosystem management in landscapes containing a mix of different ecosystems. While methodologies for assessing ecosystem services are constantly improving, only {{little attention has been}} given to the identification of which ecosystem services to assess. Service selection is mostly based on current state of the landscape although many landscapes are both inherently complex and rapidly changing. In this study we examine whether scenario development, a tool for dealing with uncertainties and complexities of the future, gives important insights into the selection of ecosystem services in changing landscapes. Using an agricultural landscape in South Africa we compared different sets of services selected for an assessment by four different groups: stakeholders making the scenarios, experts who have read the scenarios, experts who had not read the scenarios, and services derived from literature. We found significant differences among the services selected by different groups, especially between the literature services and the <b>other</b> groups. <b>Cultural</b> <b>services</b> were least common in literature and that list was also most dissimilar in terms of identity, ranking, and numbers of services compared to the other three groups. The services selected by experts and the scenario stakeholders were relatively similar indicating that knowledge of a study area gained through the scenario exercise is not very different from that of experts actively working in the area. Although our results show limited value in using scenario development for improved ecosystem service selection per se, the scenario development process triggers important discussions with local and regional stakeholders about key issues of today, helping to more correctly assess changes in the future...|$|R

40|$|In post-devolution Scotland, New Labour {{added to}} the role of 'culture' by {{introducing}} ideas of social inclusion to policies concerning <b>cultural</b> <b>services.</b> Ten years later, with the Scottish National Party (SNP) minority government in the Scottish Parliament, do policy makers think social inclusion still has a role within <b>cultural</b> <b>services?</b> This article shows that policy makers' understandings of 'culture' and social inclusion are vague, general and complex.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the consumption process in relation to <b>cultural</b> <b>services.</b> More specifically, the aim is to identify the cultural themes through which consumers communicate consumption meanings while visiting exhibitions and thereby shed light on the nature of consumer activeness in the production of meanings for <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> and related consumption experiences. In the previous research on consumer encounters with <b>cultural</b> <b>services,</b> the analytical focus has mainly been on the interactions between the service provider and the consumer regarding the locus in which the service provider produces the particular <b>cultural</b> <b>service</b> and the consumer experiences it. The first shortcoming of this view is a predetermined understanding of the consumer’s value emphasis. By identifying the core experience and the peripheral experience, this view finalizes what constitutes the most valuable experience and what constitutes the less valuable experience for the consumer beforehand. The second shortcoming is an excessive focus on interaction where the focus of attention in value creation is on the interaction between the consumer and the cultural organization. However, in the context of <b>cultural</b> <b>services,</b> there seem to be manifold interactions occurring in the marketplace that are important in the production of meanings for <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> and related experiences. The third shortcoming relates to the embedded belief in the division of control. It is understood that through careful planning and organization of the encounters the service provider can gain control over the service delivery. Consumers in turn control their own experiences. However, it is not always possible to control the delivery of a <b>cultural</b> <b>service.</b> For example, the media acts as an important provider of meanings for art exhibitions. This study aims to provide more understanding of this multi-faceted value creation of <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> and related experiences. It suggests that value-creation of <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> occurs in the marketplace through various cultural processes in which different marketplace actors take part. The study aims to increase understanding of this matter from the consumers’ point of view and answers the following research questions: how do consumers give meaning to the consumption experience of <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> in marketplace encounters? What kinds of cultural themes can be identified in the consumption process of exhibitions? In what ways do the cultural themes relate {{to each other in the}} consumption process? A framework has been developed for analysis of the value-creation of <b>cultural</b> <b>services.</b> The theoretical framework draws on the poststructuralist, social constructionist, <b>cultural</b> studies and <b>service</b> marketing approaches. The study suggests that the value of a <b>cultural</b> <b>service</b> and related experiences is not determined beforehand but produced in the marketplace in on-going negotiations in which different actors take part. Service encounters are seen as positions in the marketplace where the struggle for meanings takes place. Consumers are perceived as active agents taking part in the meaning-making occurring in the marketplace. The methodological approach in this study draws on ethnography. The main data consisted of 23 on-site consumer interviews and 22 visitor essays. They were analyzed with a hermeneutic, iterative approach. Based on the data, four cultural themes through which consumers give meaning to consumption experience of <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> were identified. These themes were called sensibility, progress, corporality, and fellowship. Each theme consists of several sub-themes which are analyzed in detail. The study suggests that consumers take part in the struggle of meaning of experience in marketplace encounters as aesthetic agents.

40|$|The {{cultural}} {{atmosphere in}} a society is accumulated over time through the consumption of <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> and is diminished through depreciation. Using cultural capital (e. g., cultural heritage, paintings, music scores), <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> are provided by the cultural-services industry (e. g., museums, opera houses); cultural capital is enlarged by new cultural goods created by individuals. Individuals’ utilities are positively affected by the <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> they consume, by the cultural goods they create and by the cultural atmosphere and the cultural capital accumulated in society. In a laissez-faire economy, individuals tend to ignore the positive external effects of their cultural-services consumption and creation of <b>cultural</b> goods on <b>other</b> individuals via accumulating cultural atmosphere and cultural capital. Consequently, suboptimally little cultural atmosphere and cultural capital will be accumulated. The efficient intertemporal allocation can be restored by introducing an appropriate subsidy that not only stimulates consumers’ demand for <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> {{and the creation of}} new cultural goods but also enhances the accumulation of cultural atmosphere and cultural capital.
