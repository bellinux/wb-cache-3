5|$|Gaze following, or shared gaze, can {{be found}} in a number of primates. Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also {{demonstrate}} shared gaze.

5|$|A 1.5 hectare {{patch of}} brown earth soil at the {{abandoned}} settlement of Papadil {{is home to}} a thriving population of earthworms, which are rare in the elsewhere poor soil of the island.

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{interactions among}} and within three species <b>of</b> <b>predator</b> in {{their effects on}} prey survival using short-term predation experiments. The prey were Rana temporaria tadpoles, and the predators were dragonfly larvae (Anax imperator), newts (Triturus alpestris), and backswimmers (Notonecta glauca). Mortality rate per predator imposed by Triturus and Notonecta did not decline with predator density, whereas the predation rate of Anax was strongly reduced when the number <b>of</b> <b>predator</b> individuals increased. Impacts <b>of</b> all three <b>predators</b> were not altered {{by the presence of}} other species in pairwise combinations. This system is therefore characterized by interference between individual dragonflies but relatively independent effects <b>of</b> <b>predator</b> species. These results were largely predictable based on the natural history <b>of</b> the <b>predators,</b> and are encouraging for attempts to model communities as assemblages of interacting species...|$|R

5|$|These birds forage on {{the ground}} or in vegetation; they also fly down from a perch to capture food. While foraging, they {{frequently}} spread their wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation <b>of</b> <b>predators</b> or prey.|$|E
5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and the presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>predators.</b> Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} out of sight <b>of</b> <b>predators,</b> whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{currently}} {{receive the}} greatest attention {{in regards to}} conservation. Arguably the most successful fauna recovery plan in Puerto Rico was the Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Plan. Initiated in 1968, its main objective was to downlist the Puerto Rican parrot's status from critical to threatened by 2020. Other objectives include the establishment of two separate, effective, wild populations (500 or more individuals for 5 years), the protection of habitat for those populations and the control <b>of</b> <b>predators,</b> parasites and competitors of the species. Currently, the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals, and 105 birds are in captivity. This program was fundamental in raising ecological awareness in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention <b>of</b> <b>predators,</b> principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E
30|$|For {{developing}} the CML model, a two-dimensional rectangular lattice divided into n × n sites by space interval h is considered. Simultaneously, {{the time is}} divided {{into a series of}} slices with time interval τ. Parameters τ and h are the time scale and the space scale for describing the predator–prey dynamics, respectively. Since the growth, death, feeding, and migration <b>of</b> <b>predator</b> and prey individuals always occur periodically, the dynamics of a predator–prey system can be observed by a particular time scale, which can be defined by the generation span <b>of</b> the <b>predator</b> and prey populations and measures the regeneration time of both populations. On the other hand, the space scale on which spatial movements <b>of</b> <b>predator</b> and prey take place can be defined by maximum size of dwelling sites <b>of</b> <b>predator</b> and prey individuals.|$|R

5|$|Dinoflagellates may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting the attention <b>of</b> <b>predators</b> from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; {{if they were}} eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution <b>of</b> <b>predators</b> to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|Gorgosaurus {{spent as}} much as half its life in the {{juvenile}} phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack <b>of</b> <b>predators</b> intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This pattern is seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but {{there is no evidence of}} gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Green-head ants are prey for {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>predators,</b> {{including}} assassin bugs and the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), in the faeces {{of which have been}} found worker ants. Birds also eat these ants, including the Australian white ibis (Threskiornis moluccus), black kite (Milvus migrans), masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) and the Australian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles cristatus). Workers and larvae can be infected by parasites; examined workers were seen with late-stage pupae of an unidentified parasite in their thoraces. In some nests of the green-head ant, some myrmecophilous insects such as the beetle Chlamydopsis longipes are sometimes seen living inside colonies.|$|E
5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach <b>of</b> <b>predators.</b> Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E

The most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes (which most often pick off brooding females) and the faster or larger birds of prey, i.e. peregrine falcons, Aquila eagles, or Haliaeetus eagles. In North America, adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey, from northern harriers and short-eared owls (both smaller than a mallard) to huge bald and golden eagles, and about a dozen species of mammalian predator, not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings.|$|E

30|$|From {{the above}} {{results of the}} dichotomy, it follows {{that in order to}} control the prey {{population}} (pest species) one should at least put predator population (natural enemies) into the initial habitat at the initial state in one of four ways: (i) decrease the death rate <b>of</b> <b>predator</b> during the process of putting; (ii) extend the range <b>of</b> <b>predator’s</b> targets; (iii) accelerate putting predators; (iv) choose the natural enemies which have a strong ability for predating.|$|R
