5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but {{it is unlikely that the}} bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E

5|$|The new cent {{was issued}} in {{exchange}} for the worn Spanish colonial silver coin that had circulated in the U.S. until then, as well as for its larger predecessor. So many cents were issued that they choked commercial channels, especially as they were not legal tender and no <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take them. The eagle design did not strike well, and was replaced in 1859 by Longacre's Indian Head cent.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{commented that}} the outside {{environment}} {{was very difficult to}} create. He explained that the reason previous games were primarily set indoors is because the current consoles were not powerful enough to portray a true jungle environment. In contrast with urban environments, the jungle does not have a flat surface. The protagonist in Snake Eater has to cross uneven terrain, including rocks, dirt mounds, and treestumps. As a result, the collision engine used in previous installments could not be used, and a new <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be built from scratch. Setting up the motion capture technology so players could walk over these mounds was a problem during development.|$|E

5|$|The Great Powers occupying Paris {{demanded that}} Louis XVIII {{implement}} a constitution. Louis responded with the Charter of 1814, which included many progressive provisions: freedom of religion, a legislature {{composed of the}} Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers, a press that would enjoy a degree of freedom, and a provision that the Biens nationaux would remain {{in the hands of}} their current owners. The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to be voted on by the chambers. Catholicism was to be the official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in the Chamber of Deputies, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The king would appoint peers to the Chamber of Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
5|$|Statutes {{passed in}} 1430 and 1432, {{during the reign}} of Henry VI, {{standardised}} property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of freehold property or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county. This requirement, known as the forty shilling freehold, was never adjusted for inflation; thus the amount of land <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> own in order to vote gradually diminished over time. The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership. Nevertheless, {{the vast majority of people}} were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000. Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, Rutland and Anglesey, had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, Yorkshire, had more than 20,000. Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times; there was usually no need to live in a constituency in order to vote there.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the two bridge raids took place on 10 August 1941. For this mission, the I-16s were fitted with {{additional}} 95-liter (25 US gal) underwing fuel tanks for an additional 35 minutes of flight time. Of the three Zveno-SPBs, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> turn back due to mechanical problems. The other two launched their fighters 15km (8 NM, 9mi) from the Romanian coastline. The fighters successfully dive-bombed from the altitude of 1800 m (5,900ft) and returned home with no losses despite heavy anti-aircraft fire. The second raid took place on 13 August 1941. This time, all three Zveno-SPBs reached the target. The six fighters scored five direct hits on the bridge and completely destroyed one of the spans. On the way back, the fighters strafed Romanian infantry near Sulina and returned to Eupatoria with no losses. Following the successful sorties, two additional Zveno-SPB were brought to operational status, bringing the total to five. The main limiting factor {{was the lack of}} high-output Mikulin AM-34FRN engines, as the other versions were not powerful enough to get the aircraft airborne. On 16 August 1941, Admiral Kuznetsov asked Joseph Stalin for additional AM-34FRN-engined TB-3s from the Air Force so they could be converted to Zveno-SPB carriers, but the request was denied as the Air Force had suffered heavy losses in the opening days of the war. In the meantime, the five aircraft continued flying operational sorties, destroying a dry dock in Constanţa on 17 August and a bridge across the Dnieper River on 28 August, losing one I-16 in the process. During the repeat attack the next day, four Zveno-launched I-16s engaged several Messerschmitt Bf 109s, shooting down two. Despite the high success rate, Zveno missions ended by 1942 due to high vulnerability of the obsolete TB-3s and I-16s in the face of enemy air superiority. It is estimated that Zveno-SPB flew at least 30 combat missions.|$|E
