5|$|Damage to the <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> (II) affects {{specific}} {{aspects of}} vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the <b>optic</b> <b>nerve,</b> or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{field testing}} is {{recommended}} {{as soon as}} possible after diagnosis, as it quantifies the severity of any <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> involvement, and may be required to decide on surgical treatment.|$|E

40|$|Background. A 10 -year-old {{boy with}} a history of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but without {{previous}} evidence of central nervous system involvement, presented with seizures 3 years after complete remission. Materials and methods. MRI showed bilateral enlargement of the <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> despite normal ophthalmological examination. Results. Only the third cerebrospinal fluid examination showed 2 % blasts without concomitant bone-marrow infiltration. Enlargement of the <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> was consistent with bilateral leukaemic peri-optic nerve infiltration. The appearances returned to normal after chemotherapy Conclusion. The <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> are a potential site of relapse in patients with systemic and meningeal ALL, {{even in the absence of}} ophthalmological signs...|$|R
5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
5|$|This in turn {{blocks the}} flow of fluids in the eye, leading to a painful {{increase}} in intra-ocular pressure (glaucoma) and often irreparable <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> damage, leading to visual field loss and eventual blindness.|$|E
5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> and {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E
40|$|The {{eyes and}} <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> were studied histologically in a fatal case of {{methanol}} poisoning in a 37 -year-old man. The most striking findings were bilateral central necrosis of the <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> {{from behind the}} lamina cribrosa to the orbital apex. Proximal parts of the nerve and the tract showed no necrosis. It is suggested that the complex blood supply of the nerve may be of importance...|$|R
40|$|Corpora amylacea (CA) are spherical or ovoid bodies 50 - 50 microns in diameter. They {{have been}} {{described}} in normal elderly brain {{as well as in}} a number of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, the incidence of CA in the <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients was compared with normal elderly controls. Samples of <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> (MRC Brain Bank, Institute of Psychiatry) were taken from 12 AD patients (age range 69 - 94 years) and 18 controls (43 - 82 years). <b>Optic</b> <b>nerves</b> were fixed in 2 % buffered glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, embedded in epoxy resin and then sectioned to a thickness of 2 microns. Sections were stained with toluidine blue. CA were present in all of the <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> examined. In addition, a number of similarly stained but more irregularly shaped bodies were present. Fewer CA were found in the <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> of AD patients compared with controls. By contrast, the number or irregularly shaped bodies was increased in AD. In AD, there may be a preferential decline in the large diameter fibres which may mediate the M-cell pathway. Hence, the decline in the incidence of CA in AD may be associated with a reduction in these fibres. It is also possible that the irregualrly shaped bodies are a degeneration product of the CA...|$|R

5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> sheath fenestration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Optic</b> <b>nerve</b> sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|Shunt {{surgery was}} {{introduced}} in 1949; initially, ventriculoperitoneal shunts were used. In 1971, good results were reported with lumboperitoneal shunting. Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s led to a brief period (1988–1993) during which <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> fenestration (which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular. Since then, shunting is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.|$|E

5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (<b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the <b>optic</b> <b>nerve,</b> brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, {{and the rest of}} the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{surgical}} procedures {{exist in the}} treatment of IIH: <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> sheath decompression and fenestration and shunting. Surgery would normally only be offered if medical therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated. The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH. Neither procedure is perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both may eventually fail in controlling the symptoms. There are no randomized controlled trials to guide the decision as to which procedure is best.|$|E
40|$|Summary: We report {{imaging and}} gross {{pathologic}} find-ings from two cases of Krabbe disease {{in which there}} was marked enlargement of the intracranial <b>optic</b> <b>nerves.</b> Nu-merous globoid cells were observed in the <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> at autopsy in one case. Krabbe disease {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of children with enlargement of the <b>optic</b> <b>nerves.</b> Krabbe’s disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy) is a disorder of lysosomal function that results in ac-cumulation of galactocerebroside and psychosine in macrophages and is associated with demyelination and dysmyelination of cerebral white matter. Pre-viously described imaging findings with Krabbe’s disease include foci of increased attenuation on CT scans early in the disease, patchy foci of abnormal signal in the white matter on MR images, and white matter volume loss later in the disease. We present two cases of Krabbe’s disease in which there is striking enlargement of the <b>optic</b> <b>nerves</b> in associ-ation with foci of abnormal signal on MR images. Histologic analysis of one of the cases shows the enlargement to occur because of the presence of numerous globoid cells...|$|R

5|$|When {{given for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe antibiotic. It {{can be used in}} people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods still, it may cause sometimes irreversible nerve damage including <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|If one {{of these}} tests shows a {{deficiency}} of hormones produced by the pituitary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary {{is the first step}} in identifying an underlying cause. MRI may show various tumors and may assist in delineating other causes. Tumors smaller than 1cm are referred to as microadenomas, and larger lesions are called macroadenomas. Computed tomography with radiocontrast may be used if MRI is not available. Formal visual field testing by perimetry is recommended, as this would show evidence of <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> compression by a tumor.|$|E

5|$|Vision is {{generated}} by light that hits the retina of the eye. Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that {{is sent to the}} visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Vision from the left visual field is received {{on the right side of}} each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the <b>optic</b> <b>nerve</b> until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the visual field passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through the optic radiation to reach the visual cortex.|$|E
5|$|Visual Impairment – Athletes {{with visual}} {{impairment}} ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness.

The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete {{with visual impairment}} and the guide are considered a team.

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named <b>Optic</b> <b>Nerve</b> to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, <b>Optic</b> <b>Nerve</b> sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
