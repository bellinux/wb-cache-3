Inter-row ground covers that are known to increase the abundance of some predators and parasitoids had no effect on the pests, possibly as a result of lack of synchrony between pests and natural enemies, lack of specificity or intra-guild predation.

40|$|Abstract: The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Dipt., Tephritidae), is {{the most}} {{important}} pest of <b>olive</b> <b>crops</b> in the world. Economic losses associated to the limited efficiency of pesticides and natural regulation require the development of new alternatives. A classical biological control program was thus implemented in 2007 in France with two main objectives: (1) test the efficiency of a new exotic parasitoid, Psyttalia lounsburyi (Hym., Braconidae) on the olive fruit fly populations and (2) understand how intraspecific hybridization could affect the demographic success of exotic biocontrol agents and, more generally, invasive species. In 2008, more than 43, 000 P. lounsburyi were consequently introduced in 60 sites located in Southern France, covering the whole geographic distribution of <b>olive</b> <b>crops</b> in this country. The pluri-annual surveys realised between 2007 and 2010 gave the opportunity to better document the dynamics of olive fruit fly populations as well as the associated communities of parasitoids. Main results on these two topics are outlined here in a view to stimulate collaborative research and more precisely document the community ecology of B. oleae and its natural enemies in the Mediterranean area and elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|Examinations {{were carried}} out in order to compare the {{fertility}} of production site 1 (chernozem soils) and production site 2 (mostly consisting of brown forest soils) which depends {{on the level of}} humus supply, using yield data collected from two different <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> We were interested in the impact of the soil humus content on maize yield in different <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> The nitrogen supply ability of the soil is taken into consideration along with the humus categories established in accordance with plasticity. The different impact of each category could also be shown statistically. The examinations {{were carried out}} using the country-wide database of the Agrochemical Information and Management System (AIIR) containing around 380 000 entries. On both production sites, but especially on chernozem, there are differences in yield also in terms of different <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> It is a general tendency that maize yield increases with the increasing humus content of soils. At the same time, it can also be observed that favourable <b>crop</b> <b>years</b> result in yield depression on brown forest soils in the case of especially high humus supply on intensively cultivated agricultural plots (N-P-K> 50 - 50 - 100 kg ha- 1), while the same refers to chernozem soils in unfavourable <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> The obtained results indicate that high maize yields can be expected even in the case of average humus content in favourable <b>crop</b> <b>years</b> both on chernozem and brown forest soil. However, in the case of unfavourable <b>crop</b> <b>year,</b> higher humus content (good and very good supply level) is expected to result in relatively higher yields. On chernozem soil, the statistically significant yield increasing effect of humus content (resulting in 15 % yield surplus) can be observed until average humus supply in favourable <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> In unfavourable <b>crop</b> <b>years,</b> yield increases with the increase of humus supply until reaching high supply level, resulting in more than 25 % yield increase in comparison with very weak supply level. Significant yield increase was observed until average humus supply on brown forest soil – similarly to chernozem – in favourable <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> On average, yield was 23 % higher than those of plots with very weak humus supply. On the contrary, yield increasing effect (12. 4 % altogether) can only be shown in the case of humus content increase ranging from very low to low supply in unfavourable <b>crop</b> <b>years.</b> There was no significant yield increase with the further increase of humus content.

In this paper, a methodology to evaluate future <b>olive</b> <b>crop</b> yield {{several months in}} advance is presented. Olive tree phenology, airborne pollen concentrations, meteorological data and fruit production data were analysed {{in the province of}} Córdoba (Andalusia, Spain) over a period of 20 years (1982 – 2002). Data were integrated to obtain models for predicting fruit production. In this study, annual Olea pollen emission is shown to be a reliable bio-indicator to forecast olive fruit production up to 8 months in advance. Hirst volumetric pollen traps were found to be an accurate tool in <b>olive</b> <b>crop</b> yield forecasting. May rainfall was the most important meteorological parameter affecting final fruit production. Three statistical models, with different elapsed time between crop estimation and harvest, were developed: 8, 4 and 2 months.

Field floral phenological data {{were used to determine}} the anthesis phase, to ascertain which period of the pollination records {{should be included in the}} models.

40|$|Abstract Floral phenology, as most {{of natural}} phenomena, shows, as an {{inherent}} feature, {{a high degree of}} spatial continuity. Geostatistics are a family of statistics that describe correlations through space/ time and they can be used for both quantifying spatial correlation and interpolating no monitored sampling points. The combined use of Geographical Informa-tion Systems (GIS) and geostatistics can be an essential tool for spatial analysis in phenological and aerobiological studies. In the present work, Kriging interpolation by using linear geostatistic analysis has allow us to estimate phenological data of a wide <b>olive</b> <b>crop</b> area of the province of Cordoba (Andalusia, Southern Spain), {{on the basis of a}} limited number of phenology sampling points. The main a priori hypothesis was that 7 traditionally observed sampling points (with 10 olive trees in each site) uniformly distributed through the main <b>olive</b> <b>crop</b> areas could be enough for interpolating phenological information of the whole Cordoba olive area. Geostatistical results reject this hypothesis. The optimum/minimum number and location of sampling points was deter-mined in 13 sites (including the original 7 sites and 6 new sites). The obtained phenological maps will improve olive pollen aerobiological information and forecasting in the area. The application of such new combined space analysis tools on floral phenology allows optimising human and economic resources on field phenology campaigns.
