5000|$|Huffaker created nine {{different}} universes {{to examine the}} effect of predator-prey interaction and spatial heterogeneity on populations of predator and prey species. Prey species were always added several days before predator species were added. Predator species were placed on oranges colonized by prey species. Additionally, Huffaker spread petroleum jelly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trays</b> between <b>the</b> oranges and rubber balls to serve as an [...] "impediment but not an exclusion to movement" [...] of the mites, creating heterogeneity.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} tunnel dryer for sultana grapes is presented and applied for the determination of size and optimal operating conditions of the dryer. The optimum condition is given by the minimization of heat consumption, expressed as the ratio of thermal load to production, with some constraints regarding the production rate of the dryer and the maximum permissible air temperature. The optimization variables are temperature and humidity of the drying air, and product loading thickness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trays.</b> <b>The</b> optimum condition requires the operation of <b>the</b> dryer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> maximum permissible air humidity, which corresponds to {{a high degree of}} recirculation of exhaust air. This can be accomplished using automatic control of fresh air and humid air inlet and exhaust dampers {{along the length of the}} dryer, during the entire drying cycle...|$|R

40|$|Subsampling is {{a common}} method for {{estimating}} the abundance of species in trawl catches. However, the accuracy of subsampling in representing the total catch has not been assessed. To estimate one possible source of bias due to subsampling, we tested whether <b>the</b> position <b>on</b> trawler sorting trays from which subsamples were taken affected their ability to represent species in catches. This was done by sorting catches into 10 kg subsamples and comparing subsamples taken from different positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sorting <b>tray.</b> Comparisons were made after species were grouped into three categories of abundance, either 'rare', 'common' or 'abundant'. A generalised linear model analysis showed that taking subsamples from different positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sorting <b>tray</b> had no major effect <b>on</b> estimating <b>the</b> total numbers or weights of fish or invertebrates, or {{the total number of}} fish or invertebrate taxa, recorded in each position. Some individual taxa showed differences between positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sorting <b>tray</b> (11. 5 % of taxa ina three-position design; 25 % in a five-position design). But consistent and meaningful patterns in the position of these taxa <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sorting <b>tray</b> could only be seen for the pony fish Leiognathus moretoniensis and the saucer scallop Amusium pleuronectes. Because most bycatch laxa are well mixed throughout the catch, subsamples can be taken from any position on trawler sorting trays without introducing bias...|$|R

40|$|Contaminant {{deposition}} measurements {{have been}} made on species content and depth profiles on three experiment <b>trays</b> from <b>the</b> Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). Auger, Argon sputtering, ESCA and SEM {{analysis was used to}} define the contaminant deposits. The Integrated Spacecraft Environments Model (ISEM) was used to predict the deposition levels of <b>the</b> contaminants measured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> three <b>trays.</b> <b>The</b> details of the modeling and the assumptions used are presented along with the predictions for <b>the</b> deposition <b>on</b> select surfaces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trays.</b> These are compared to the measured results. <b>The</b> <b>trays</b> represent surfaces that have a high atomic oxygen flux, an intermediate oxygen flux, and no oxygen flux. All surfaces received significant solar UV flux. It appears that the atomic oxygen is necessary for significant deposition to occur. Surfaces that saw significant contaminant flux, solar UV and no atomic oxygen did not show any appreciable levels of observable deposition. The implications of the atomic oxygen interaction with contaminant deposits from silicon contaminant sources is discussed. The primary contaminant sources in the LDEF analysis are DC 6 - 1104 adhesive and Z- 306 paint. The results and interpretation of the findings have a potential significant impact on spacecraft surfaces that are exposed to solar UV and atomic oxygen in low Earth orbit...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{recognized that the}} presence of specific resources constitutes one of the ways of territorial development. However, in certain situations, generic resources (easily usable in other productive contexts) can nearly constitute specific resources. This paradox occurs thanks to two combined phenomena : the existence of asymmetries of information between producers and consumers, the insertion in a basket of localized goods and services of the good produced with generic resources. We illustrate this paradox with the case of the Laguiole knife made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trays</b> of Aubrac in the confluence of Midi-Pyrenees, Auvergne and Languedoc-Roussillon regions. resource enhancement, rent, specificity, bundle, reputation, territorial development...|$|R
