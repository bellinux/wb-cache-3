5|$|In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was {{concluded}} between the British Government {{and representatives of}} the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an <b>opt-out</b> clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, an oath of allegiance to the King was to be taken. Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 2011, {{he signed}} a {{contract}} with Strasbourg IG of France's LNB Pro A. The contract included an <b>opt-out</b> clause when the NBA settled its lockout, set to expire on January30,2012. Allen joined former Richmond foes Kevin Anderson and Justin Harper on Strasbourg IG. He made his debut on October 7, scoring 10 points and pulling down four rebounds in a 77–74 victory over Cholet Basket. The following game, against SLUC Nancy Basket, he grabbed a season-high 13 rebounds and also added 12 points. Allen's season-high 19 points came on November 10, when Strasbourg IG defeated Chorale Roanne Basket 93–80. In nine games, Allen averaged 10.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game.|$|E
5|$|Strasburg {{signed a}} 7-year, $175 million {{extension}} {{to remain with}} the Nationals. With the extension, Strasburg became the first National to receive an <b>opt-out</b> clause in his contract, which allows him to elect free agency after the 2019 or 2020 seasons if he desires. On June 26, 2016, he {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list due to an upper back strain. He returned on July 3 against the Cincinnati Reds, where he took a no-hitter through 6.2 innings until being lifted from the game after throwing 109 pitches. The no-hitter was broken up in the 8th inning, but the Nationals still won 12-1. On July 8, Strasburg became the first pitcher since 1912 to start 12-0. His streak of consecutive wins ran to 16, including 13 decisions in the 2016 season, before it was snapped by the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 21. On August 22, Strasburg was again placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right elbow soreness.|$|E
5000|$|When asked, {{how they}} would vote {{when they had to}} decide about all four <b>opt-outs</b> in a package, a {{relative}} majority of 42% would vote in favour of abolishing the <b>opt-outs,</b> 37% would vote in favour of keeping the <b>opt-outs</b> and 21% expressed no opinion.|$|R
50|$|Denmark {{obtained}} four <b>opt-outs</b> {{from the}} Maastricht Treaty following the treaty's initial rejection in a 1992 referendum. The <b>opt-outs</b> are {{outlined in the}} Edinburgh Agreement and concern the EMU (as above), the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) and the citizenship of the European Union. With these <b>opt-outs</b> the Danish people accepted the treaty in a second referendum held in 1993.|$|R
5000|$|Afterwards {{support for}} abolishing the <b>opt-outs</b> {{increased}} again. In October 2009, {{there was a}} majority in favour of abolishing {{each of the four}} <b>opt-outs,</b> the only difference being in the size of majority: ...|$|R
5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an <b>opt-out</b> clause that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another criticism has been that the program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E
5|$|Moore was {{selected}} with the 55th {{overall in the}} 2nd round of the 2011 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics. Due to the lockout, Moore signed a deal with Italy's Benetton Treviso that featured an <b>opt-out</b> clause that let him return to the Celtics once the lockout ended. On December 9, 2011, Moore signed a guaranteed contract with the Celtics. He debuted briefly (for less than 1 minute) in the Celtics' season-opener against the New York Knicks on Christmas Day. He posted his first rebound and assist on December 28 against the Charlotte Bobcats. He scored his first points on January 4, 2012, against the New Jersey Nets. He got significant minutes {{for the first time}} in a game against the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in his home state, when he played 20 minutes. In the subsequent weeks with Keyon Dooling and Sasha Pavlović injured he often received a significant amount of playing time. He recorded 16 points on January 26, 2012, against the Orlando Magic, going 4–4 from distance. On April 24, Moore established a career high of 7 rebounds against the Miami Heat.|$|E
5|$|Rodriguez again won the AL MVP {{award in}} 2007, as his 54 {{home runs and}} 156 RBIs topped the AL; he scored 143 runs, the highest single-season number by a player since 1985. After {{starting}} the year 21–29, the Yankees rallied to win the AL's wild card berth; {{it was the first}} time in 10 seasons that they did not win the AL East. New York's season ended in the first round of the playoffs; the Indians won the opening two games of the ALDS and finished the series in four games. Manager Torre did not re-sign after the season, and Joe Girardi took his place. Rodriguez, who used an <b>opt-out</b> clause in his contract to become a free agent, stayed with the Yankees by signing for $275million over 10 seasons, an MLB record. The 2008 season was the Yankees' last in which they played at the original Yankee Stadium. The club had sought a new stadium to increase revenues, following the example set by other MLB teams. It was also the first in which Hal and Hank Steinbrenner ran the team as general partners; though George Steinbrenner was still the principal owner on paper, he yielded operational responsibilities during the 2007 offseason. Yankee Stadium was the site of the 2008 All-Star Game, but for the first time in 14 years did not host playoff action. New York ended the year third in the AL East and failed to qualify for the postseason.|$|E
50|$|Denmark {{obtained}} four <b>opt-outs</b> {{from the}} Maastricht Treaty following the treaty's initial rejection in a 1992 referendum. The <b>opt-outs</b> are {{outlined in the}} Edinburgh Agreement and concern the Economic and monetary union (EMU), the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), Justice and Home Affairs (then JHA, now PJCC) and the citizenship of the European Union. With these <b>opt-outs</b> the Danish people accepted the treaty in a second referendum held in 1993.|$|R
50|$|The {{program also}} {{includes}} <b>opt-outs</b> for news updates {{from a local}} anchor at each station {{at the end of}} each half-hour. The network would always produce an alternate national segment for stations not using the <b>opt-outs,</b> as well as CTV News Channel.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the defeat}} of the treaty in the first refererendum, Denmark {{negotiated}} and received four <b>opt-outs</b> from portions of the treaty: Economic and Monetary Union, Union Citizenship, Justice and Home Affairs, and Common Defence. The second referendum approved the treaty amended with the <b>opt-outs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The players union {{encouraged}} {{players to}} find work overseas, hoping owners would offer better deals if they saw players having more options. Josh Childress, who played for Greek team Olympiacos {{before returning to the}} NBA in 2010, said he would not consider playing overseas during the lockout. He cited concerns with reliability of getting paid, differences in coaching styles, and lower standards of business travel compared to the NBA. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) announced on July 29 that it would allow players under NBA contracts to play overseas, provided that the contracts they signed had <b>opt-out</b> clauses that allowed players to return once the work stoppage ended. Stern said the league would allow players to play overseas, but he warned that it could divide the union and possibly jeopardize players' contracts if they were seriously injured. Most leagues permitted the signing of locked-out NBA players with the option of opting out; the Chinese Basketball Association, however, only allowed its clubs to sign foreign free agents who could play for at least the entire season. Chinese nationals were exempt from this rule; this allowed Yi Jianlian to return to the NBA upon the end of the lockout.|$|E

50|$|A poll {{from early}} June 2008 saw a clear {{majority}} in favour of repealing the defence and judicial issues <b>opt-outs,</b> a very close race regarding the euro and {{a clear majority}} against repealing the citizenship opt-outs.Following an increase in support for abolishing the <b>opt-outs,</b> support dropped in mid-May 2009; in January 2009, 49.8% were in favour of having the Euro as Danish currency, dropping to 45.2% against and 43.7% in favour in May 2009. Support for abolishing <b>opt-outs</b> on legal and defence cooperation has also dwindled to equal numbers pro and against.|$|R

25|$|Public {{views are}} crucial {{to the success of}} <b>opt-out</b> or presumed consent {{donation}} systems. In a study done to determine if health policy change to a presumed consent or <b>opt-out</b> system would help to increase donors, an increase of 20 to 30 percent was seen among countries who changed their policies from some type of opt-in system to an <b>opt-out</b> system. Of course, this increase must have {{a great deal to do}} with the health policy change, but also may be influenced by other factors that could have impacted donor increases.|$|E
25|$|Within the European Union, organ {{donation}} is regulated by member states. As of 2010, 24 European countries {{have some form}} of presumed consent (<b>opt-out)</b> system, with the most prominent and limited <b>opt-out</b> systems in Spain, Austria, and Belgium yielding high donor rates. In the United Kingdom {{organ donation}} is voluntary and no consent is presumed. Individuals who wish to donate their organs after death can use the Organ Donation Register, a national database. The government of Wales became the first constituent country in the UK to adopt presumed consent in July 2013. The <b>opt-out</b> organ donation scheme in Wales went live on December 1, 2015 and is expected {{to increase the amount of}} donors by 25%. In 2008, the UK discussed whether to switch to an <b>opt-out</b> system in light of the success in other countries and a severe British organ donor shortfall. In Italy if the deceased neither allowed nor refused donation while alive, relatives will pick the decision on his or her behalf despite a 1999 act that provided for a proper <b>opt-out</b> system. In 2008, the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted for an initiative to introduce an EU organ donor card in order to foster organ donation in Europe.|$|E
