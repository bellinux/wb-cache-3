500|$|Lynch is an {{advocate}} {{for health care reform}} but split with his party on Obama's health care reform efforts. He voted in November 2009 to pass the Affordable Health Care for America Act (AHCAA), the House's health care reform bill. This bill was scrapped by Congressional leaders in favor of the Senate's bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Despite pressure from Obama and Democratic leaders, Lynch stated that he would oppose the PPACA until [...] "they put reform back in the health reform bill." [...] He described the Senate bill as a [...] "surrender" [...] to insurance companies, putting too little pressure on insurance companies to reduce costs, and that did not represent meaningful reform. He explained, [...] "There's a difference between compromise and surrender, right? And this is a complete surrender <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> people thought were important to health care reform." [...] When the PPACA came to a House vote in March 2010, he was the only U.S. representative from New England to vote against it.|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E
2500|$|Early Christian {{writers such}} as Clement of Alexandria and Firmicus denigrated Athena as {{representative}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were detestable about paganism; they condemned her as [...] "immodest and immoral". During the Middle Ages, however, many attributes of Athena {{were given to the}} Virgin Mary, who, in fourth century portrayals, was often depicted wearing the Gorgoneion. Some even viewed the Virgin Mary as a warrior maiden, much like Athena Parthenos; one anecdote tells that the Virgin Mary once appeared upon the walls of Constantinople when it was under siege by the Avars, clutching a spear and urging the people to fight. During the Middle Ages, Athena became widely used as a Christian symbol and allegory; she appeared on the family crests of certain noble houses.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2016, Keys {{initiated}} a #NoMakeup movement, where she wrote on Lenny [...] "Before I started my new album, I wrote a list <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I was sick of. And one {{was how much}} women are brainwashed into feeling like {{we have to be}} skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the many things I was tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size. Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked". Keys presented her movement at various events, and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days after}} winning the U.S. Open, Woods {{announced}} that he would be required to undergo reconstructive anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery on his left knee and would miss the remainder of the 2008 golf season, including the final two major championships: The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship. Woods also revealed that he had been playing for at least ten months with a torn ligament in his left knee, and sustained a double stress fracture in his left tibia while rehabbing after the surgery he had after the Masters. Publications throughout the world asserted his U.S. Open victory as [...] "epic" [...] and praised his efforts, especially after learning of the extent of his knee injury. Woods called it [...] "My greatest ever championship – the best of the 14 because <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have gone on over the past week." ...|$|E

60|$|For one of {{her natural}} {{sweetness}} of disposition she had been oddly irritable of late, manifesting signs of a cynical worldliness, which convinced Mme. de Sautron more than ever that her brother Quintin had scandalously conducted the child's education.

60|$|So gallantly did Mr. Hoopdriver comport {{himself up}} to {{the very edge of}} the Most Wonderful Day of all.

He caught himself in the middle of a yawn, pulled out his watch, saw the time was halfpast eleven, and marched off, with a fine sense of heroism, bedward.|$|E
