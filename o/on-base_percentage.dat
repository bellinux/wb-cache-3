5|$|Uribe {{began his}} {{professional}} career in 1997 {{when he was}} signed by the Colorado Rockies. After advancing through the minors, he made his MLB debut with the Rockies in 2001. He became their shortstop in 2001 and spent all of 2002 in that capacity. He missed part of 2003 with an injury and {{was traded to the}} Chicago White Sox following the season.

In 2008, Uribe lost his starting shortstop role to Orlando Cabrera and shifted to the starter at second, but then lost that job to rookie Alexei Ramírez. He eventually ended the season as the team's third baseman due to an injury to Joe Crede.|$|E
25|$|In his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, {{baseball}} historian Bill James ranked Tenace 23rd all-time among {{major league}} catchers. Chuck Rosciam, a Baseball historian {{and a member}} of the Society for American Baseball Research, believes that Tenace deserves a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Using six offensive measures: Average, <b>On-base</b> <b>percentage,</b> Slugging, RBIs, Runs created and Win shares—all League-Era adjusted, Rosciam ranks Tenace sixth offensively behind Mickey Cochrane, Mike Piazza, Bill Dickey, Gabby Hartnett and Joe Torre among catchers. Tenace is tied for third in OPS (<b>on-base</b> <b>percentage</b> plus slugging percentage) with Johnny Bench and Torre. He's only behind Roy Campanella and Yogi Berra.|$|E

5000|$|In , Ventura saw his {{batting average}} drop 20 points to [...]262, though both his {{slugging}} and <b>on-base</b> <b>percentages</b> rose slightly. He also collected his 500th hit that May and won his third straight Gold Glove, while {{becoming the first}} AL third baseman with three consecutive 90-RBI campaigns since Graig Nettles (1975-78). On August 4, 1993, during {{a game against the}} Texas Rangers, Ventura was hit by a pitch thrown by Nolan Ryan. Ventura charged the mound and started a bench-clearing brawl. This brawl was voted the top baseball brawl of all time by ESPN's SportCenter. After Ventura charged the mound, Ryan, 20 years Ventura's senior, placed Ventura in a headlock and punched him several times. The White Sox won the AL West that year, which resulted in Ventura's only playoff trip while in Chicago. They would lose in the ALCS to the Toronto Blue Jays.|$|R
