5|$|Its generic name, Cleptornis, {{is derived}} from the Ancient Greek kleptes, a robber or thief, and <b>ornis,</b> a bird. This is not a {{reference}} to any aspect of the golden white-eye's behaviour, but to the old French name of the Mariana Islands, les Îles des Voleurs, or Robbers' Islands. The specific epithet marchei refers to the French explorer and writer Antoine-Alfred Marche, who procured the original specimens.|$|E
500|$|British {{banker and}} naturalist Walter Rothschild first {{described}} the long-tailed ground roller in 1895, {{giving it the}} scientific name Uratelornis chimaera; Rothschild published his description in Novitates Zoologicae, the periodical of his private museum. The adaptations required for the ancestral long-tailed ground roller to inhabit scrubland led Rothschild to create the monotypic genus Uratelornis for the species in his description. The genus name Uratelornis {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek word oura [...] "tail," [...] and atelornis in reference to another genus of ground roller. Atelornis comes from the Ancient Greek words ateles [...] "indeterminate or incomplete," [...] and <b>ornis</b> [...] "bird." [...] The specific name, chimaera, is a reference to the Ancient Greek mythological creature known as the chimera. The long-tailed ground roller is placed in the ground roller family, which gets its common name due to its similarity to the rollers and its largely terrestrial nature. Until recently the ground rollers, cuckoo roller, and rollers were all placed in a single family, Coraciidae, in which each of the three groups formed a subfamily. In 1971, Joel Cracraft proposed a separate family for the ground rollers based on significant differences in behavior, plumage, and post-cranial anatomy between the groups. This position is supported by DNA evidence. It has been suggested, but not widely accepted, that ground rollers are closely related to the puffbirds and jacamars. It has been speculated that the ancestor of the long-tailed ground roller was an [...] roller that crossed over from Africa to Madagascar and developed a terrestrial lifestyle before moving from the rainforests into the long-tailed ground roller's arid scrubland. No fossils have been found for this genus, and genetic analysis suggests that this bird's closest relative is the scaly ground roller. The long-tailed ground roller has no subspecies.|$|E
2500|$|Ornithology is {{a branch}} of zoology that {{concerns}} the study of birds. The word [...] "ornithology" [...] derives from the ancient Greek ὄρνις <b>ornis</b> ("bird") and λόγος logos ("rationale" [...] or [...] "explanation"). Several aspects of ornithology differ from related disciplines, due partly to the high visibility and the aesthetic appeal of birds. Most marked among these is the extent of studies undertaken by amateurs working within the parameters of strict scientific methodology.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995 Zhou, Hou, Zhang and Gu Youcai named Confuciusornis sanctus. The {{generic name}} {{combines}} the philosopher Confucius with a Greek ὄρνις, (<b>ornis),</b> [...] "bird". The specific name means [...] "holy one" [...] in Latin {{and is a}} translation of Chinese 圣贤, shèngxián, [...] "sage", again in reference to Confucius. The holotype specimen is IVPP V10918. In 1997 Hou named two species. The first was Confuciusornis chuonzhous, based on specimen IVPP V10919, originally a paratype of C. sanctus. The specific name refers to Chuanzhou, an ancient name for Beipiao. The second species was Confuciusornis suniae, based on specimen IVPP V11308. The specific name honours madam Sun, the wife of Shikuan Liang who donated the fossil to the IVPP. In 1999 Hou, Zhou, Zhang, Larry Martin and Alan Feduccia named Confuciusornis dui, based on specimen IVPP V11553. The specific name again honours a donating collector: Du Wengya. In 2009 Zhang Fucheng et al. named Confuciusornis feducciai, based on specimen D2454, the specific name honouring Feduccia. In 2010 Li Li, Wang Jingqi and Hou Shilin named Confuciusornis jianchangensis, based on specimen PMOL-AB00114 found at Toudaoyingzi.|$|E
