5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 {{were the}} first open revolt against Mexican rule and they coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the nation's president. Texians sided with the federalists against the current {{government}} and drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas. They {{took advantage of the}} lack <b>of</b> <b>oversight</b> to agitate for more political freedom. Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood, among other issues. The following year, Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833.|$|E
5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts {{and encourage them to}} ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system <b>of</b> <b>oversight</b> by wardens employed by the state.|$|E
5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of products in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack <b>of</b> <b>oversight</b> saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E

5|$|Godley {{continued}} as divisional commander {{for most of}} the campaign at Gallipoli. Of tall stature, he made constant tours of the front line amidst jokes that the communication trenches needed to be dug deeply to allow for his height. On one visit to Quinn's Post on 7 May, he personally directed troop deployments to counter a potential Turkish counterattack. Despite his inspections, his reputation amongst the rank and file of the division did not improve. Nor was his co-ordination of offensive operations sound; during the August offensive, his lack <b>of</b> <b>oversight</b> allowed one of his brigade commanders, Brigadier General Francis Johnston, a British Army officer on secondment to the NZEF, to vacillate over deployment of reinforcements. On the morning of 8 August, the Wellington Infantry Battalion was in tenuous possession of Chunuk Bair but required support to consolidate its position. Johnstone did not order his reinforcements forward until later that day. Crucial momentum was lost and Chunuk Bair was later recaptured by the Turks.|$|E
5|$|The first {{portion of}} the book is a {{critique}} of deficiencies in safety practices by the Federal Aviation Administration and United States Department of Transportation, and the inherent problems with the closeness between these agencies and the airline industry. The book is an exposé of what Schiavo saw as fraud, corruption, waste, mismanagement, and dangerous negligence in the aviation industry and the FAA as a crusader for flight safety. Her primary criticisms in the book focus on the FAA's reluctance to address its many shortcomings, while expressing her concern that there was a fundamental conflict of interest between the FAA job <b>of</b> <b>oversight</b> and the FAA job of promoting aviation.|$|E
5|$|Tod {{was born}} in London and educated in Scotland. He joined the East India Company as a {{military}} officer and travelled to India in 1799 as a cadet in the Bengal Army. He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an envoy in a Sindian royal court. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, during which Tod {{was involved in the}} intelligence department, he was appointed Political Agent for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region {{under the control of the}} East India Company. During this period Tod conducted most of the research that he would later publish. Tod was initially successful in his official role, but his methods were questioned by other members of the East India Company. Over time, his work was restricted and his areas <b>of</b> <b>oversight</b> were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, Tod resigned his post as Political Agent and returned to England.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Criminal Justice) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. The {{autonomy}} {{of law enforcement}} has been addressed by the development <b>of</b> civilian <b>oversight</b> agencies/entities. These agencies aim to provide accountability of law enforcement through civilian review of police policies, independent civilian investigations of citizen complaints against the police, and through civilian review of police investigations of citizen complaints. Although civilian <b>oversight</b> <b>of</b> law enforcement has been developing since the late 1940 s {{there has been little}} research on the topic. There is little research on characteristics <b>of</b> specific <b>oversight</b> agencies and even less research on measuring the performance <b>of</b> civilian <b>oversight.</b> 	This exploratory study aspired to learn about the structures and functions <b>of</b> four specific <b>oversight</b> agencies, and to compare these agencies using performance measures identified in existing literature. The sources of data for this study are qualitative interviews. The interviewees consist of five classifications of individuals associated with oversight agencies in some manner. 	This study found that the varying structure and function <b>of</b> each <b>oversight</b> agency yielded both positive and negative results. The political influences on oversight agencies and the authority <b>of</b> the <b>oversight</b> agencies were found to be sources of contention that impeded their missions. The criticism in existing literature that civilians do not have the necessary training and experience to hold police departments accountable was corroborated by the interviews. Most importantly this study found that none <b>of</b> these <b>oversight</b> agencies actively employed measures to evaluate their own performance. Furthermore, when this study applied performance measures identified in existing literature, it found the oversight agencies were deficient. Criminal Justic...|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} season, Nikita gains some allies {{to aid in}} her fight against Division, {{including}} Owen Elliot (Devon Sawa), a guardian to one of Division's several black boxes; hard drives contain files of Division's missions, until Percy tried to have him killed, CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean) who was investigating black operations invisible to the United States government, and eventually her trainer Michael, after he learns Percy {{was responsible for the}} deaths of his wife and daughter. The two would be in a relationship for the rest of the series' run. By the first-season finale, Alex learns that Nikita killed her father and leaves her to become a free agent for Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who overthrew Percy to lead Division with the help <b>of</b> <b>Oversight,</b> a group of American politicians who ensure that Division's existence remains secret from the public (Alex would later return to fight alongside with Nikita again midway through season two). Michael is discovered to be working with Nikita and the two end up on the run together with a black box.|$|E
