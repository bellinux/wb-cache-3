2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album. It was the first song that she and Naughty Boy had worked together on and she {{pointed out that the}} song {{has nothing to do with}} her father. It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while trying to get into the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song she was thinking about The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E

6000|$|... "You foolish boy!" [...] she cried. [...] "Can't you {{see that}} I am dying? Hold my hands tightly and watch--watch! Here is <b>one</b> more <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see--that <b>you</b> cannot understand." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “No, no,” said Natty, {{shaking his}} head kindly; “I would not rob you so for twenty rifles. But there’s <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do for me, if ye will, that no other is at hand to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, George, there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> rely upon, I'm {{doing nothing}} in a hurry. I turn over {{this one and}} that, and I don't talk--indiscreetly. There's--No! I don't think I can tell you that. And yet, why NOT?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hazard: [...] "You <b>can</b> look, if <b>you</b> like. I'm rather {{proud of}} it. There's only <b>one</b> other <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> give a man, and I said, 'No, not a cigar-case. Fountain smokes enough already, {{but if a}} bath-robe can induce him to wash--'" [...] He goes out.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> and <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> only, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do for me," [...] said Lopez. His {{voice was}} peculiarly sweet, {{and when he}} spoke his words seemed to mean more than when they came from other mouths. But Mr. Wharton did not like sweet voices and mellow, soft words,--at least not from men's mouths.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] Heneage remarked. [...] "I speak {{without knowing}} {{very much about}} the matter, but I am {{thoroughly}} convinced of <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find the murderer of Morris Barnes, you will solve, at the same time, the mystery of Bentham's death. It is the same affair; {{part and parcel of}} the same tangle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You old dear!' she cried, 'I don't {{believe you}} are a bit better as a {{conspirator}} than I am. There's only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. Give the waiter half a crown, tell him the truth, and don't conspire any more.' ...|$|E
60|$|No. There's but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see, here, {{which you}} didn't in Ghirlandajo's fresco, {{unless you were}} very clever and looked hard for it--the Baby! And you are never likely to see a more true piece of Giotto's work in this world.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell Mr. Townsend {{when you}} see him again," [...] he said: [...] "that if you marry without my consent, I don't leave you a farthing of money. That will {{interest}} him more than anything else you can tell him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't you be put out, my dear,' complacently {{retorted}} Mr Boffin. 'I'll {{bring this}} young man to book. Now, you Rokesmith! You can't decline to hear, you know, {{as well as to}} answer. You hear me tell you that the first side of your conduct was Insolence--Insolence and Presumption. Answer me <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Didn't this young lady tell you so herself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, my dear Gosse, here's wishing you {{all health}} and prosperity, {{as well as}} to the {{mistress}} and the bairns. May you live long, since it seems as if you would continue to enjoy life.

6000|$|... "Now {{listen to}} me," [...] Thomson continued. [...] "On Monday I am going from Southampton to Boulogne for forty-eight hours, {{to attend a}} court martial there. There is only <b>one</b> decent <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. <b>You</b> know what that is. I'll have you exchanged, if you are willing, into a line {{regiment}} with your present rank. Your colonel will have a hint. It will be your duty to meet the first German bullet <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find. If <b>you</b> are content with that, I'll arrange it for you. If not--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do," [...] I said. [...] "You can tighten this distressingly loose jacket. If you won't, {{then get}} out. And I don't {{care if you}} fail {{to come back for}} a week or for the whole ten days." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{authority}} grunted, [...] "Nothing to it. The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> bet {{on is that}} {{no matter}} what happens to the German people, win or lose, they'll stick by the Kaiser till hell freezes over. I got that absolutely straight, from a fellow who's {{on the inside of the}} inside in Washington. No, sir! I don't pretend to know much about international affairs but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> put down as settled is that Germany will be a Hohenzollern empire for the next forty years. At that, I don't know as it's so bad. The Kaiser and the Junkers keep a firm hand on a lot of these red agitators who'd be worse than a king if they could get control." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am sure of it,” agreed Patsy; “but {{that does}} not {{enlighten}} the mystery any. I’m sorry we brought Mildred to this place. There’s just <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> bank on, Beth: {{that in some way}} or other Mildred is responsible for the disappearance of our precious Toodlums.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{keep saying}} 'No, no'. She must have done. Well, I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> take this as official. If ever I find this slimy, slithery snake in the grass, {{he had better}} make all the {{necessary}} arrangements at his favourite nursing-home without delay, because I {{am going to be}} very rough with him. I propose, if and when found, to take him by his beastly neck, shake him till he froths, and pull him inside out and make him swallow himself." ...|$|R
60|$|None {{of these}} <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> know. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> only <b>you</b> <b>can</b> know, namely, whether this dealing of yours is {{a just and}} {{faithful}} one, which {{is all you need}} concern yourself about respecting it; sure thus to have done your own part in bringing about ultimately in the world a state of things which will not issue in pillage or in death. And thus every question concerning these things merges itself ultimately in the great question of justice, which, the ground being thus far cleared for it, I will enter upon in the next paper, leaving only, in this, three final points for the reader's consideration.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{may save}} your life later on," [...] Crawshay {{observed}} coolly. [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do <b>one</b> of three <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> {{come with me to}} the captain, be put in irons and shot as soon as we land--or before, if the Blucher finds us; or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> send the message which I shall give you; or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> end your days where you sit." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be {{perfectly}} sure of. If you do wrong {{you are going}} to be punished for it sometime, somehow and somewhere. My punishment was delayed for two months, and then it descended on my head and I was crushed to the very dust.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, there's only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. Write to her, {{and tell}} her the thing's over. Put it so {{that there can be}} no mistake about it. It'll hurt her, but it'll hurt her less if you do the thing brutally than if you try half-hearted ways." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do, and that's {{to unyoke}} the beast and hobble it, and then strike for Taylor's on your feet," [...] he advised. [...] "The walk will {{probably}} do you good, if only by convincing {{you that it}} doesn't pay to drive a horse to the verge of exhaustion." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Anytime anybody {{writes a}} song, that's <b>one</b> less <b>thing</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do {{and still be}} original. You can't come along and write Black Sabbath's [...] "Iron Man" [...] today. All the heavy riffs that are that simple are already taken. So, you've gotta find new riffs, and as more of those become taken, there's fewer places to go." [...] Kurt Ballou {{interview}} with Decibel ...|$|R
40|$|What's the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> give to your {{children}} and you’ll never hear them say-"Thanks. I really needed that!"? The answer is limits. So what are limits and {{why are they so}} important? Children {{need to learn how to}} live in a social world – how to be safe and how to interact with others. Establishing boundaries and limits for children’s behavior is key! Early on, you set limits for your baby by using distraction. Your infant began to “get into things”, and so you took something away or gave something else to play with. You might have said, “No, don’t touch! ” or perhaps picked and moved your child. You were setting limits...|$|R
500|$|The discovery, made by Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Neil H. Shubin {{from the}} University of Chicago, and Harvard University Professor Farish A. Jenkins, Jr, was {{published}} in the April 6, 2006, issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form. Jennifer A. Clack, a Cambridge University expert on tetrapod evolution, said of Tiktaalik, [...] "It's <b>one</b> of those <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> point to and say, 'I told you this would exist,' and there it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. All we Ethnological men are as jealous as jackdaws of one another's discoveries. They're of no {{interest}} {{to anyone but}} ourselves, of course, {{but you know what}} book-collectors are like. Well, don't say a word, directly or indirectly, about the Asiatic side of the boy's character--his adventures and his prophecy, and so on.

6000|$|... "And you see, Jimmy, {{these people}} up top, {{the guys who}} arrange the giving of titles, are {{keeping an eye on}} you, because you would have the title after me and {{naturally}} they don't want to get stung. I gathered all that from your stepmother. Say, Jimmy, I'm not asking a lot of you, but there is just <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do for me without putting yourself out too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{go on in}} {{the same}} disconsolate, miserable way, I suppose I shall stay here, because I shall be as well here as {{anywhere}} else. I might move to Lisbon,--but what good would that do me? Your image would follow me to whatever capital I might direct my steps. But there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do." [...] Here he brightened up, putting on quite an altered face.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{her success}} and tales {{of how she}} used to {{disguise}} herself to mask her identity while reviewing, she is quite open about why she stopped. [...] "I really {{wanted to go home}} and cook for my family," [...] she says.

6000|$|Northwick {{said he did}} not, and Bird said, [...] "It is <b>one</b> {{of three}} <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do here in the winter; smoke the pipe, cut the wood, court the ladies." [...] Northwick remembered his saying that before, too, and how it had made his wife laugh. [...] "I used to do all three. Now I smoke the pipe. Well, while you are young, it is all right, and it is fun in the woods. But I was always 'omesick for Quebec, more or less. You {{know what it is}} to be 'omesick." ...|$|R
40|$|What’s the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> give to {{your child}} and you will never hear them say — “Oh, thanks. I really needed that!”? The answer is limits. So what are limits and {{why are they so}} {{important}} in parenting? Let’s explore. Limits are specific behavioral expectations parents set for their children. Setting limits defines the boundaries for acceptable behavior. Parents show their love, concern, and willingness to parent children when they set and use reasonable limits. But there is something funny about limits — children will never say they want/need/like them. However, children need clear, reasonable limits just as much as they need food and shelter. Limits are at the foundation of parenting responsibility. There are two behaviors we see from children reared without limits. Some children will withdraw, too fright...|$|R
