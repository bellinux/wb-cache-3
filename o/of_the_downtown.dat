5|$|Several {{sites were}} {{proposed}} {{as the main}} Expo grounds. One location that was considered was Mount Royal Park, to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> core. But it was Drapeau's idea to create new islands in the St. Lawrence river, and to enlarge the existing Saint Helen's Island. The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented land speculation.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes {{may seem}} rare in {{downtown}} areas because downtown areas cover {{such a small}} geographical area.

5|$|According to Jerusalem {{architectural}} historian David Kroyanker, {{the heyday}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Downtown</b> Triangle lasted {{from the early}} 1930s to the 1970s. Many stores and restaurants were opened by German Jewish immigrants who sought to recreate a European ambience in the city center. Their upscale boutiques, coffeehouses, delicatessens, and exclusive restaurants were frequented by senior Mandate officials and wealthy, English-speaking tourists. Unlike Israeli stores that sold all kinds of unrelated products under one roof, the Europeans introduced boutiques that featured only one item, such as gloves or ties. Some shops offered unique extras, such as coffeehouses that included an orchestra and dance floor, and a bookstore with a second-floor library.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure.

While {{cities across the country}} grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the reunification}} of Jerusalem in 1967, the city {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, drawing customers {{away from the city}} center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Downtown</b> Triangle in the 1970s. The clientele of the upscale European boutiques had also aged, and the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown became occupied by poor and Haredi Jews who did not patronize the Triangle. The elegant shops gave way to hummus restaurants, dollar stores, and money changers. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas.|$|E
