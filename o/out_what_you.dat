500|$|Nathaniel Shaler {{left his}} humanist studies and joined Agassiz's lab at Harvard University, having already read Agassiz's {{introductory}} essay on classification. His autobiography details his initial interactions with Agassiz. With regard {{to his first}} assignment, Shaler recorded that Agassiz brought him a small fish to study with the stipulation that Shaler not discuss it with anyone or read anything on the topic until Agassiz had given him permission. When Shaler asked Agassiz for more explicit instructions, Agassiz replied {{that he could not}} be more explicit than saying [...] "ind <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can without damaging the specimen". After the first hours, Shaler thought he had [...] "compassed that fish," [...] but despite Agassiz always being [...] "within call" [...] he was not asked to present his conclusions. During the course of the following week, Shaler recorded the details of [...] "how the scales went in series, their shape, the form and placement of the teeth, etc." ...|$|E
500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
