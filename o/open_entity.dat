Most studies analyzing dynamics and regulation of inner ear hydrostatic pressure performed pressure measurements in the cochlea. The present study {{is the first one}} reporting about absolute hydrostatic pressure values in the labyrinth. Hydrostatic pressure of the endolymphatic system was recorded in all three semicircular canals. Mean pressure values were 4. 06 cmH(2) O +/- A 0. 61 in the posterior, 3. 36 cmH(2) O +/- A 0. 94 in the anterior and 3. 85 cmH(2) O +/- A 1. 38 in the lateral semicircular canal. Overall hydrostatic pressure in the vestibular organ was 3. 76 cmH(2) O +/- A 0. 36. Endolymphatic hydrostatic pressure in all three semicircular canals is the same (p = 0. 310). With regard to known endolymphatic pressure values in the cochlea from past studies vestibular pressure values are comparable to cochlear values. Until now it is not known whether the reuniens duct and the Bast's valve which are the narrowest passages in the endolymphatic system are open or closed. Present data show that most likely the endolymphatic system is a functionally <b>open</b> <b>entity...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Casati and Varzi have {{developed}} a theory of boundary based on extensional mereotopology and the distinction between fiat and bona fide boundaries. Firstly, I point out some problems in their theory {{that are related to}} the contact of bodies. Next, I propose a way of classification of boundaries into four kinds based on substance ontology and an alternative distinction between potential and actual boundaries. Finally, I will show that my way of classification makes it possible to solve the problems above. 1 Casati and Varzi’s Theory of Boundary In [Casati and Varzi 1999], Casati and Varzi insisted that the contact is only possible between a closed entitiy and an <b>open</b> <b>entity,</b> while neither the contact of two closed entities nor that of two open entities is possible, as a result of adopting the system of General Extensional Mereotopology with Closure Conditions (GEMTC). However, such a position brings about the following puzzles: 1 (1) Puzzle of Inner Boundary Which of e. g. the right-half of a body and its left-half does the boundary between them belong to? Which is an (partly) open body and which is a closed one? (2) Puzzle of Fission When a body is separated into two, how does one boundary at the cross section become two? (3) Puzzle of Collision If closed bodies cannot make contact with each other, how is collision possible? To solve the puzzle(1), Casati and Varzi introduce the distinction between fiat and bona fide boundaries. According to them, in contrast with bona fide boundaries such as an outer boundary of a material body, we can take fiat boundaries such as th...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{argue for the}} {{definition}} a knowledge-based entity matching framework {{for the implementation of}} a reliable and incrementally scalable solution. Such knowledge base is formed by an ontology and a set of entity matching rules suitable to be applied as a reliable equational theory {{in the context of the}} Semantic Web. In particular, we are going to prove that relying on the existence of a set of contextual mappings to ease the semantic heterogeneity characterizing descriptions on the Web, a knowledge-based solution can perform comparably, and sometimes better, than existing solutions at the state of the art. We further argue that a knowledge-based solution to the <b>open</b> <b>entity</b> matching problem ought to be considered under the open world assumption, as in some cases the descriptions to be matched may not contain the necessary information to take any accurate matching decision. The main goal of this work is to show how the framework proposed is suitable to pursue a reliable solution of the entity matching problem, regardless the set of rules for the ontology adopted. In fact, we believe that structural and syntactic heterogeneity affecting data on the Web undermine the definition of a global unique solution. However, we argue that a knowledge-driven approach, considering the semantic and meta-properties of compared attributes, can provide important benefits and lead to more reliable solutions. To achieve this goal, we are going to implement several experiments to evaluate different sets of rules, testing our thesis and learning important lessons for future developments. The sets of rules that we will consider to bootstrap the solution proposed in this work are the result of diverse complementary processes: first we want to investigate whether capturing the matching knowledge employed by people in taking entity matching decision by relying on machine learning techniques can produce an effective set of rules (bottom-up strategy); second, we investigate the application of formal ontology pools to analyze the features defined in the ontology and support the definition of entity matching rules (top-down strategy). Moreover, in this work we argue that by merging the rules resulting from these complementary processes, we can define a set of rules that can support reliably entity matching decision in an open context...|$|E

Research results benefited from viewing the project organization as a &# 039;complex adaptive system&# 039; with a structurally <b>open</b> project <b>entity</b> facilitating the contextual interconnections necessary for detecting and creating environmental change. Pragmatic knowledge was seen as emergent through movement of human interactions and contributed to the portrayal of the project organisation as a &# 039;becoming&# 039; cognitive system whose resilience is dependent upon producing meaning as opposed to processing information. Complexity in project management and theory has traditionally focussed on technical and structural aspects of project practice, whereas aligning social systems with nature where disorder and uncertainty prevails provides a better model of social analysis. Working in culturally pluralistic project environments where multiple realities and disparities in language are commonplace create challenges to traditional PM practice.
