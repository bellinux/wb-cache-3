5|$|In {{front of}} the Royal Crescent is a Ha-ha, a trench on which the inner side of which is {{vertical}} and faced with stone, with the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> sloped and turfed, making the trench, in effect, a sunken fence or retaining wall. The ha-ha is designed not to interrupt the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to be invisible until seen from close by.|$|E
5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the <b>outer</b> <b>face.</b> The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the dual}} graph {{depends on a}} {{particular}} embedding, the dual graph of a planar graph is not unique {{in the sense that}} the same planar graph can have non-isomorphic dual graphs. In the picture, the blue graphs are isomorphic but their dual red graphs are not. The upper red dual has a vertex with degree 6 (corresponding to the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> of the blue graph) while in the lower red graph all degrees are less than 6.|$|E

5000|$|Kahouna {{features}} a semicircular seawall about 1200 ft long. The inner and <b>outer</b> <b>faces</b> {{of the original}} wall were of stacked stone, with gravel, coral rubble, and soil as fillers between them.|$|R
5|$|The {{remains of}} the {{gatehouse}} and north range comprise only fragments of walls and {{one side of the}} entrance arch, with the remains of a bartizan above. Along {{the west side of the}} castle, the 15th-century curtain wall remains standing to a considerable height. This section of wall has six openings at the base, one of which served as a postern gate. On the <b>outer</b> <b>face,</b> the six bays are divided by rounded buttresses. Old sketches of Roslin show bartizans above each of these buttresses, with a wall-walk connecting them.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the tooth is {{triangular}} and contains six cusps, connected by low crests, that surround two prominent, low-lying fossae (basins) and a third, smaller fossa. Because {{of the complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues interpreted it as a molar; {{because of the number of}} roots, the arrangement of the cusps, and the shape of the tooth, as an upper molar; and because it tapers towards the end, as a last molar. One side, the longest, is flat and low compared to the others, suggesting it is the labial (<b>outer)</b> <b>face.</b> This would imply that the tooth is from the left jaw. Under this interpretation, the length of the tooth is 2.65mm, width is 2.20mm, height at the labial side is 1.05mm, and height at the lingual side is 1.30mm.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of the original fortifications in this area has been examined by several scholars, and several theories have been proposed as to their course. It is known from the Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae that the XIV region, which comprised Blachernae, stood apart and was enclosed all around by a wall of its own. Further it is recorded that originally, and at least {{as late as the}} Avar-Persian siege of 626, when they were burned down, the important sanctuaries of Panagia Blachernitissa and St. Nicholas lay just outside the quarter's fortifications. Traces of the quarter's walls have been preserved, running from the area of the Porphyrogenitus Palace in straight line to the so-called Prison of Anemas. The original fortified quarter can thereby be roughly traced to have comprised the two northern spurs of the city's Seventh Hill in a triangle, stretching from the Porphyrogenitus Palace to the Anemas Prison, from there to the church of St. Demetrios Kanabos and thence back to the Porphyrogenitus Palace. These fortifications were apparently older than the Theodosian Walls, probably dating to sometime in the 4th century, and were then connected to the new city walls under Theodosius II, with the western wall forming the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> of the city's defenses and the eastern wall fell into disrepair.|$|E
50|$|Korari:is a very {{important}} place from archaeological view point. This place has two brick temples, having amazing carving on the <b>outer</b> <b>faces.</b> The temple is tilted in its own axis about 4Â°. Every panel has different design.|$|R
50|$|The {{classical}} puteal wellheads {{are made}} of carved stone, often marble in Europe. They are frequently decorated with bas-reliefs of classical Greek and Roman themes around their <b>outer</b> <b>faces.</b> An Ancient Roman one was in the Puteal Scribonianum structure in the Roman Forum, nothing remains.|$|R
50|$|The Pons Fabricius has {{a length}} of 62 m, and is 5.5 m wide. It is {{constructed}} from two wide arches, supported by a central pillar {{in the middle of}} the stream. Its core is constructed of tuff. Its <b>outer</b> <b>facing</b> today is made of bricks and travertine.|$|R
25|$|Such an {{assignment}} is always possible when the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> is a triangle, {{and so this}} method {{can be used to}} realize any polyhedral graph that has a triangular face.|$|E
25|$|A beam bends under bending moment, {{resulting}} in a small curvature. At the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> (tensile face) of the curvature the concrete experiences tensile stress, while at the inner face (compressive face) it experiences compressive stress.|$|E
25|$|A plane graph {{is said to}} be convex if all of its faces (including the <b>outer</b> <b>face)</b> are convex polygons. A {{planar graph}} may be drawn convexly if and only if it is a {{subdivision}} of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph.|$|E
50|$|As they mature, {{the trees}} of the bosquet form an {{interlacing}} canopy overhead, and they are frequently limbed-up to reveal the pattern of identical trunks. Lower trunks may be given a lime wash to a selected height, which emphasizes the pattern. Clipped <b>outer</b> <b>faces</b> of the trees may be pleached.|$|R
50|$|The Bullo Pill Railway was {{probably}} completed soon afterwards. The track {{was of the}} L-plate form in which plain wagons wheels could run, guided by the upstand of the L. There are uncertainties about the gauge, but four feet measured between the <b>outer</b> <b>faces</b> of the vertical flanges, is generally assumed.|$|R
50|$|Atrina seminuda, is an {{inhabitant}} endobentic, usually {{secured by}} a strong byssus secreted by the animal in rocks and gravel substrate in areas of high energy. Associated with the <b>outer</b> <b>faces</b> of the leaflets of Atrina seminuda usually inhabit a range of fouling organisms among them being common gastropod mollusks, bivalves and chitons.|$|R
25|$|There {{are seven}} battlements along the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> of the Sohail gate. The gate {{features}} {{room in the}} upper portion that have windows which open towards the fort's interior. Like the outer arch {{there is a small}} window {{in the middle of the}} inner arch.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{simplest}} repeating pattern, and {{will create a}} wall only one-half brick thick. Such a thin wall is not stable enough to stand alone, and must be tied to a supporting structure. This practice is common in modern buildings, where stretcher bonded brickwork may be the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> of a cavity wall, or the facing to a timber or steel-framed structure.|$|E
25|$|The parapet walks are corbelled, as is an {{oriel window}} in the south gable. A {{projecting}} garderobe was also added on the west wall in the 19th century. Within the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> of the north gable is a dovecot, formerly accessed via a timber walkway from a high-level door. The chimney runs behind the pigeon holes, ensuring the birds were kept warm in winter.|$|E
50|$|Kaiwharawhara had {{a unique}} {{platform}} arrangement for New Zealand. Looking north, the left-hand island platform was for up trains, the right-hand platform for down trains. The inner faces {{were used by}} Kapiti Line services on the NIMT, the <b>outer</b> <b>faces</b> by Melling Line and Hutt Valley Line services on the Wairarapa Line.|$|R
25|$|The {{sculpture}} of the <b>outer</b> <b>faces</b> {{of the two}} great piers was lost when the Arch of Titus was incorporated in medieval defensive walls.

50|$|In these {{deteriorated}} {{sections of}} the wall sapling posts or (in a small section) steel posts have been inserted to support wire mesh and barbed wire. These posts {{appear to have been}} inserted by removing the <b>outer</b> <b>facing</b> stones of one side of the wall, placing the posts in position, then replacing the outer stones to secure the posts.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{function}} of the epigyne is to receive and direct the palpal organ of the male during copulation. The various specific forms of epigynes are correlated, in each case, with corresponding specific differences in the palpus of the male. This specialization prevents individuals of different species from mating. The epigyne covers or accompanies the openings of the spermathecae, which are pouches for receiving and retaining sperm. Frequently, the openings of the spermathecae are on the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> of the epigyne and can be easily seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{orientation}} of furrows (relative {{to the original}} tetrad of microspores) classifies the pollen as sulcate or colpate. Sulcate pollen has a furrow across the middle of what was the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> when the pollen grain was in its tetrad. If the pollen has only a single sulcus, it is described as monosulcate, has two sulci, as bisulcate, or more, as polysulcate. Colpate pollen has furrows other than across {{the middle of the}} outer faces. Eudicots have pollen with three colpi (tricolpate) or with shapes that are evolutionarily derived from tricolpate pollen. The evolutionary trend in plants has been from monosulcate to polycolpate or polyporate pollen.|$|E
25|$|Apollonian {{networks}} {{are examples of}} maximal planar graphs, graphs to which no additional edges can be added without destroying planarity, or equivalently graphs that can be drawn in the plane so that every face (including the <b>outer</b> <b>face)</b> is a triangle. They are also chordal graphs, graphs in which every cycle of four or more vertices has a diagonal edge connecting two non-consecutive cycle vertices, and {{the order in which}} vertices are added in the subdivision process that forms an Apollonian network is an elimination ordering as a chordal graph. This forms an alternative characterization of the Apollonian networks: they are exactly the chordal maximal planar graphs or equivalently the chordal polyhedral graphs.|$|E

25|$|To {{achieve the}} inside-out configuration, the pipette is {{attached}} to the cell membrane as in the cell-attached mode, forming a gigaseal, and is then retracted to break off a patch of membrane {{from the rest of the}} cell. Pulling off a membrane patch often results initially in the formation of a vesicle of membrane in the pipette tip, because the ends of the patch membrane fuse together quickly after excision. The <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> of the vesicle must then be broken open to enter into inside-out mode; this may be done by briefly taking the membrane through the bath solution/air interface, by exposure to a low Ca2+ solution, or by momentarily making contact with a droplet of paraffin or a piece of cured silicone polymer.|$|E
25|$|If a {{polyhedral}} graph {{does not}} contain a triangular face, its dual graph does contain a triangle and is also polyhedral, so one can realize the dual in this way and then realize the original graph as the polar polyhedron of the dual realization. It is also possible to realize any polyhedral graph directly by choosing the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> to be any face with at most five vertices (something that exists in all polyhedral graphs) and choosing more carefully the fixed shape of this face {{in such a way}} that the Tutte embedding can be lifted, or by using an incremental method instead of Tutte's method to find a liftable planar drawing that does not have equal weights for all the interior edges.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{is located in}} the suburb of Blachernae, between the mid-12th century stretch of walls constructed by the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143â1180) and the earlier walls of Byzantine emperors Heraclius (r. 610â641) and Leo V the Armenian (r. 813â820). A small stretch of wall connects the structure to the east with the wall of Manuel Komnenos. The structure's outer wall itself is extraordinarily high, rising as high as 23 m above {{the ground in front of}} it, and is 11â20 m thick. Behind the outer curtain wall, the building consists of twelve three-storied chambers. Its <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> features two rectangular towers built side-by-side, with one shared wall. The twin towers are in turn supported by a massive buttress, which stands almost 8 m above the ground level and projects from 6.5â9 m in front of the towers themselves.|$|E
50|$|The station {{consists}} of two island platforms paired by direction, with the S-Bahn serving the <b>outer</b> <b>faces</b> of each platform and the U-Bahn the inner faces of the same platforms. This makes interchange between the two modes very easy and is a unique situation in Berlin. At 160 m in length, the platforms are the longest in the Berlin U-Bahn network.|$|R
25|$|Mechanically {{stabilized}} earth, {{also called}} MSE, is soil constructed with artificial reinforcing via layered horizontal mats (geosynthetics) fixed at their ends. These mats provide added internal shear resistance {{beyond that of}} simple gravity wall structures. Other options include steel straps, also layered. This type of soil strengthening usually needs <b>outer</b> <b>facing</b> walls (S.R.W.'s â Segmental Retaining Walls) to affix the layers to and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The {{interchange}} is modelled on {{a successful}} design {{used on the}} Strasbourg tram system in France, and comprises two staggered island platforms. Trams serve the <b>outer</b> <b>faces</b> of the platforms, whilst the inner faces are served by local bus services. An elongated facing crossover allows outbound trams to terminate in the inbound platform. Vehicular access to the interchange is restricted to buses and trams.|$|R
