50|$|On mass-produced clothing, {{the seam}} {{allowances}} of plain seams are usually trimmed and stitched {{together with an}} <b>overlock</b> <b>stitch</b> using a serger. Plain seams may also be pressed open, with each seam allowance separately secured with an <b>overlock</b> <b>stitch.</b> Traditional home sewing techniques for finishing plain seams include trimming with pinking shears, oversewing with a zig-zag stitch, and hand or machine overcasting.|$|E
5000|$|The needle again {{begins its}} {{downward}} path passing behind the upper looper and securing the upper looper thread. This completes the <b>overlock</b> <b>stitch</b> formation and begins the stitch cycle all over again.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-thread: Edging and seaming, {{especially}} on knits and wovens, finishing seam edges, stitching flatlock seams, stitching elastic and lace to lingerie, and hemming. This {{is the most}} common type of <b>overlock</b> <b>stitch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Overlock</b> <b>stitches</b> are {{traditionally}} used for edging and light seaming. Other applications include: ...|$|R
50|$|Overlock sewing {{machines}} usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to over 9000 rpm, {{and most are}} used in industry for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products. <b>Overlock</b> <b>stitches</b> are extremely versatile, {{as they can be}} used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Overlock</b> <b>stitches</b> are {{classified}} {{in a number}} of ways. The most basic classification is by the number of threads used in the <b>stitch.</b> Industrial <b>overlock</b> machines are generally made in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 thread formations. Each of these formations has unique uses and benefits: ...|$|R
50|$|A better stitch {{was found}} in the lockstitch. The chainstitch is still used today in {{clothing}} manufacture, though due to its major drawback it is generally paired with an <b>overlock</b> <b>stitch</b> along the same seam.|$|E
5000|$|Overlock, {{also known}} as [...] "serging" [...] or [...] "serger stitch", can be formed with one to four threads, one or two needles, {{and one or two}} loopers. Overlock sewing {{machines}} are usually equipped with knives that trim or create the edge immediately in front of the stitch formation. Household and industrial overlock machines are commonly used for garment seams in knit or stretchy fabrics, for garment seams where the fabric is light enough that the seam {{does not need to be}} pressed open, and for protecting edges against raveling. Machines using two to four threads are most common, and frequently one machine can be configured for several varieties of <b>overlock</b> <b>stitch.</b> Overlock machines with five or more threads usually make both a chainstitch with one needle and one looper, and an <b>overlock</b> <b>stitch</b> with the remaining needles and loopers. This combination is known as a [...] "safety stitch". A similar machine used for stretch fabrics is called a mock safety.|$|E
5000|$|This was {{the birth}} of a small machine that could produce an <b>overlock</b> <b>stitch</b> - a [...] "baby lock". Nick Tacony, founder of Tacony Corporation, had the {{foresight}} and ability to stay alert to new consumer demands and took the opportunity to introduce the Baby Lock to the United States market. This eliminated the challenge of finishing seams with a sewing machine by giving sewing enthusiasts the opportunity to create clothing like a professional garment manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Overlock</b> <b>stitching</b> {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a {{knitting}} mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of <b>overlock</b> <b>stitches,</b> such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R
50|$|Sometime after nylon-backed {{neoprene}} appeared, {{the blind}} stitch method was developed. A blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle, {{which does not}} {{go all the way}} through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing, crosses the glue line, and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene. This is similar to the <b>overlock</b> <b>stitching</b> used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{variables}} {{in the types of}} <b>overlock</b> <b>stitches</b> are the stitch eccentric, and the stitch width. The stitch eccentric indicates how many stitches per inch there are, which is adjustable and can vary widely within one machine. Different stitch eccentrics create more or less dense and solid-looking edges. The stitch width indicates how wide the stitch is {{from the edge of the}} fabric. Lightweight fabrics often require a wider stitch to prevent pulling.|$|R
50|$|Coverstitch {{is formed}} {{by two or}} more needles {{and one or two}} loopers. Like {{lockstitch}} and chainstitch, coverstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn. One looper manipulates a thread below the material being sewn, forming a bottom cover stitch against the needle threads. An additional looper above the material can form a top cover stitch simultaneously. The needle threads form parallel rows, while the looper threads cross back and forth all the needle rows. Coverstitch is so-called because the grid of crossing needle and looper threads covers raw seam edges, much as the <b>overlock</b> <b>stitch</b> does. It is widely used in garment construction, particularly for attaching trims and flat seaming where the raw edges can be finished in the same operation as forming the seam.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} mainly {{depend on}} the material of the shell. Most suit shells are currently assembled by stitching the seams, which {{in the case of}} neoprene suits are first butt-glued, and are then <b>overlock</b> <b>stitched</b> and waterproofed by glued seam tape. DUI use a liquid polyurethane sealing compound over the seams {{on the inside of the}} suit instead of tape, and the rubber-coated Viking suits are dipped and heat cured for a seamless waterproof layer. DUI crushed neoprene suit shells are assembled before crushing the bubbles by hydrostatic pressure, then adding seals, zippers and accessories.|$|R
30|$|First, in general, {{menswear}} brands {{provide the}} pants lining pattern to the factory. The pant style (suit or casual) {{and the outer}} shell fabric’s degree of stretch were important factors {{with regards to the}} patternmaking method of the pants lining. The sewing method of pants lining has several steps. For example, attaching the lining fabric onto the outer shell fabric using an <b>overlocking</b> <b>stitch</b> must be done first. Then, the sewing of both layers together can be done to construct the remainder of the pant. Interestingly, it was noted that the direction of the grain line was crosswise instead of lengthwise for the lining fabric.|$|R
30|$|In addition, the {{researchers}} analyzed {{the process of}} how to combine the lining and outer shell fabrics, along with manufacturing the pocket and darts on the pants. There were two cases of construction methods found for these areas of the pants. In the first case, after stitching the lining to the outer shell by using an <b>overlocking</b> <b>stitch,</b> manufacturers sewed two layers (lining and outer shell) of the darts and pocket. This method of construction was not expected and was done for a lower manufacturing price. In the second case, the sewing of the darts and pocket {{of the outer shell}} and the lining were done separately, then the lining piece was attached to the outer shell at the waistline.|$|R
50|$|Most library binders use {{a method}} of {{bookbinding}} called oversewing to secure the volumes. Oversewing involves cutting or milling off the spines of the volumes, creating a block of loose pages. Then the loose sheets are combined into small units or signatures, which are secured with <b>overlock</b> <b>stitching.</b> The separate signatures then get sewn together, creating a single book block. Often a piece of linen is glued to the book block spine for further support. The spine of the volume sometimes is rounded and backed to keep the spine from caving in. But if the paper of the volume is too fragile, or the book block is too thick, the spine is left flat. The book block is placed in a sturdy cover or case, with special paper covering the inside covers (Boardway 1993).|$|R
5000|$|Oversewn {{bindings}} are {{a type of}} bookbinding {{produced by}} sewing together loose leaves of paper to form a text block. Threads pass through small holes that have been punched in the signature's gutter margin (nearest the spine), forming <b>overlock</b> <b>stitches</b> that attach it to previously attached sections. [...] This method of stitching is sometimes called stab sewing. A piece of linen is then glued to the text block spine for further support. The book's spine may be rounded and backed {{to keep it from}} caving in, but if the text block is too thick, the spine is sometimes left flat. A strip of cloth called a super is then often affixed to the spine of the text block and then to the boards of the case. Oversewing can be done by hand but is usually done with a machine in a bindery.|$|R
50|$|Of {{a typical}} garment factory's sewing machines, half might be {{lockstitch}} machines {{and the other}} half divided between <b>overlock</b> machines, chain <b>stitch</b> machines, and various other specialized machines.|$|R
