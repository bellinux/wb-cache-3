40|$|<b>Optic</b> <b>aphasia</b> {{is a rare}} {{syndrome}} {{in which}} patients are unable to name visually presented objects but have no difficulty in naming those objects on tactile or verbal presentation. We report a 79 -year-old man who exhibited anomic aphasia after a left posterior cerebral artery territory infarction. His naming ability was intact on tactile and verbal semantic presentation. The results of the systematic assessment of visual processing of objects and letters indicated that he had <b>optic</b> <b>aphasia</b> with mixed features of visual associative agnosia. Interestingly, although he had difficulty reading Hanja (an ideogram), he could point to Hanja letters on verbal description of their meaning, suggesting that the processes of recognizing objects and Hanja share a common mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A long-standing debate {{regarding}} {{the representation of}} semantic knowledge is whether such knowledge is represented in a single, amodal system {{or whether it is}} organised into multiple subsystems based on modality of input or type of information. The current paper presents a distributed connectionist model of semantics that constitutes a middle ground between these unitary- versus multiple-semantics accounts. In the model, semantic representations develop under the pressure of learning to mediate between multiple input and output modalities in performing various tasks. The system has a topographic bias on learning that favours short connections, leading to a graded degree of modality-specific functional specialisation within semantics. The model is applied to the specific empirical phenomena of <b>optic</b> <b>aphasia</b> [...] a neuropsychological disorder in which patients exhibit a selective deficit in naming visually presented objects that is not attributable to more generalised impairments in object recognition (visual agnosia) or naming (anomia). As a result of the topographic bias in the model, as well as the relative degrees of systematicity among tasks, damage to connections from vision to regions of semantics near phonology impairs visual object naming far more than visual gesturing or tactile naming, as observed in <b>optic</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Moreover, as in <b>optic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> the system is better at generating the name of an action associated with an object than at generating the name of the object itself, because action naming receives interactive support from the activation of action representations. The ability of the model to account for the pattern of performance observed in <b>optic</b> <b>aphasia</b> across the full range of severity of impairment provides support for the claim that semantic representations exhibit graded functional specialisation rather than being entirely amodal or modality-specific...|$|E
40|$|Most {{models of}} {{cognitive}} processing assume {{a considerable amount}} of built-in structure in the cognitive system, such as modality-specific semantic systems. Such structural distinctions are thought to be necessary to account for various neuropsychological dissociations, including the selective impairment of visual object naming with spared tactile naming and visual gesturing, known as <b>optic</b> <b>aphasia.</b> A distributed connectionist simulation is presented in which <b>optic</b> <b>aphasia</b> occurs following damage as a result of more graded representational specialization. This specialization emerges through learning under the combined influence of two general factors: the relative systematicity of mappings between input and output modalities, and a topographic bias favoring short connections. The results raise the possibility that much {{of the structure of the}} lexical /semantic system can be derived from general learning principles and need not assumed a priori. 1 Introduction A central issue in the stu [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Modality-specific naming deficits, such as <b>optic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> {{have been}} taken as {{evidence}} that semantics is organized into distinct modality-specific subsystems. We adopt an alternative view in which semantics is a learned, internal representation within a parallel distributed processing system that maps between multiple input and output modalities. We show that the robustness of a task to damage depends critically on its systematicity, and that modality-specific naming deficits can arise because naming is an unsystematic task. 2 Background What is the organization of semantic knowledge of objects?

40|$|Abstract <b>Optic</b> <b>aphasia</b> is {{characterized}} by a deficit in naming objects presented visually, as a result of left occipito-temporal lesion. It differs from other neuropsychological disorders {{due to the nature of}} the deficits and impairment of cognitive function. A 52 year-old patient, admitted after an episode of sub-acute infarction in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery involving the temporo-occipital region, was submitted to neuropsychological evaluation as part of a diagnostic investigation and presented specific characteristics of this disorder, as well as impairment to episodic memory. The relevance of the present case is justified not only due to the rarity of the disorder, but also because it highlights the importance of differential diagnosis in the treatment of patients...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} neurocognitive {{and language}} functions {{in a single}} case presenting with modality-specific naming difficulties secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: A comprehensive neuropsychological testing and specific assessment of naming and recognition functions were administered. Follow-up testing was administered 2 years post-injury to evaluate syndrome evolution. Rehabilitative intervention is described. Results: Ability to name visually presented objects was greatly impaired. The patient can describe or demonstrate the use of objects she cannot name and to sort them into their appropriate categories, indicating adequate non-verbal recognition. The impairment is specific to visual naming, as recognition through modalities different from vision is adequate (e. g. by touching the object, hearing its sound or being provided with verbal definition of it). This study and follow-up testing illustrated {{the evolution of the}} deficit, from a visual agnosic impairment to the co-occurrence of partial deficit of visual naming of objects and letters (<b>optic</b> <b>aphasia</b> and alexia). Conclusion: The patient presents with mild pre-semantic deficit (in mapping visual information with semantics) as well as post-semantic impairments (in the association between semantics and lexical label). Such performance can be accommodated within Farah 2 Ì† 7 s formulation which implies superadditive mild damage at several stages of object recognition naming model...|$|E
