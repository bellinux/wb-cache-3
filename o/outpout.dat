The thesis also includes suggestions, which could help {{to improve the}} financial state of the company.

40|$|The vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser(VCSEL) {{has proved}} to be a low cost light source with {{attractive}} properties such as surface emission, circular and low divergence output beam, and simple integration in two-dimensional array. Many new applications such as in spectroscopy, optical storage, short distance fiber optic interconnects, and in longer distance communication, are continuously arising. Many of these applications require stable and single-mode high output power. Several methods that affect the transverse guiding and/or introduce mode selective loss or gain have been developed. In this study, a method for improving the single mode output power by using metal surface plasmons nanostructure is proposed. Theoretical calculation shows that the <b>outpout</b> power is improved about 50 % compared to the result of standard VCSELs...|$|E
40|$|Hardware {{verification}} is nowadays one of {{the most}} time-consuming tasks during chip design. In the last few years SAT-based methods have become a core technology in hardware design, especially for the verification of combinational parts of the circuits. Verifying the equivalence of some specification and a corresponding implementation is typically done by building a so-called miter. In practice this miter is often build for each pair of primary outputs or for all primary outputs at once. In this work we have a closer look on partitioning the primary <b>outpouts</b> of the circuit and how structural partitionings can speed-up the verification process when SAT-based methods are used...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the optimal policy {{reaction}} to an asset price boom. Empirical evidence shows that the monetary policy stance is typically loose during asset price booms. Emplying a modified New Keneysian sticky price model we show that this policy of leaning with the wind {{can be attributed to}} the forward-looking nature of the private sector's expectations. Agents incorporate the macroeconomic consequences of a looming asset price bust in their expectations. The expectation-induced deviations of <b>outpout</b> and inflation from their targets enforce a monetary loosening before the bust occurs. Futhermore, we argue that a policy of benign neglect towards asset price movements, as often advanced by monetary practitioners, is (generally) not optimal in welfare terms. monetary policy, asset prices, credit crunch, boom bust cycles, forward-looking behavior...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an <b>outpout</b> {{collaborated with the}} {{following}} institutions: - Academy for Innovation & Research, University College Falmouth, Cornwall, UK - Institute for Applied Research, Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences, Ingolstadt, GermanyCreating flexible and automated production facilities is a complex process that requires high levels of cooperation involving all mechatronics disciplines, where software tools being utilised {{have to work together}} as closely as their users. Some of these tools are well-integrated, but other tools can hardly exchange any data. One of the main barriers impeding the implementation of existing integration solutions relates to the mutually diverse requirements of the mechatronics disciplines involved. In order to overcome these barriers, this research study approaches systems integration from a data modelling view point. A middle-in data modelling strategy is presented, which goes beyond present strategies in fulfilling multidisciplinary requirements and in maintaining data model consistency. Such an approach has been successfully applied within the engineering design process concerning body shop production lines for the automotive industry...|$|E

This period comprises {{the early years of}} the crisis experienced by the Spanish economy and industry between 1974 and 1985. At the external level, the Spanish economy was affected by two oil shocks. At an internal level, the automobile industry was affected by a decree passed by the government: the so-called Ford decree of 1972, which allowed the establishment of the American company in Spain and had serious consequences for SEAT, the main Spanish producer. The production of SEAT suffered a one third reduction between 1972 and 1980 and, in addition, the financial situation of the firm was unsustainable. Conversely, during this stage FASARenault became the main Spanish production (its <b>outpout</b> was multiplied by 3, 5 during the 1970 s) and sales leader in Spain (its sales as percentage of total Spanish market sales increased from 23 to 36 %). The main aim of this paper is to analyse {{the trajectory of}} success of FASA-Renault in Spain durig the 1970 s. development, industrial policy, fasa-renault, spain, automobile...|$|E
