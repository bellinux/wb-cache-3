In this work, we propose a new unified model and method for finding the best <b>overlapping</b> <b>communities</b> {{on the basis of}} the associated node and link partitions derived from the same framework. Specifically, we first describe a unified model that accommodates node and link communities (partitions) together, and then present a nonnegative matrix factorization method to learn the parameters of the model.

Finally, we introduce a model selection method based on consensus clustering to determine the number of communities. We have evaluated our method on both synthetic and real-world networks with ground-truths, and compared it with seven state-of-the-art methods.

This is a useful simplification and most community detection methods find this type of community structure.

This might happen in a social network where each vertex represents a person, and the communities represent the different groups of friends: one community for family, another community for co-workers, one for friends in the same sports club, and so on.

40|$|Network {{communities}} represent mesoscopic {{structure for}} understanding the organization of real-world networks, where nodes often belong to multiple communities and form <b>overlapping</b> <b>community</b> structure in the network. Due to non-triviality in finding the exact boundary of such overlapping communities, this problem has become challenging, and therefore huge effort {{has been devoted to}} detect overlapping communities from the network. In this paper, we present PVOC (Permanence based Vertex-replication algorithm for <b>Overlapping</b> <b>Community</b> detection), a two-stage framework to detect <b>overlapping</b> <b>community</b> structure. We build on a novel observation that non-overlapping community structure detected by a standard disjoint community detection algorithm from a network has high resemblance with its actual <b>overlapping</b> <b>community</b> structure, except the overlapping part. Based on this observation, we posit that there is perhaps no need of building yet another <b>overlapping</b> <b>community</b> finding algorithm; but one can efficiently manipulate the output of any existing disjoint community finding algorithm to obtain the required overlapping structure. We propose a new post-processing technique that by combining with any existing disjoint community detection algorithm, can suitably process each vertex using a new vertex-based metric, called permanence, and thereby finds out overlapping candidates with their community memberships. Experimental results on both synthetic and large real-world networks show that PVOC significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art <b>overlapping</b> <b>community</b> detection algorithms in terms of high similarity of the output with the ground-truth structure. Thus our framework not only finds meaningful overlapping communities from the network, but also allows us {{to put an end to}} the constant effort of building yet another <b>overlapping</b> <b>community</b> detection algorithm.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Overlapping</b> <b>community</b> {{detection}} is {{a popular}} topic in complex networks. As compared to disjoint community structure, <b>overlapping</b> <b>community</b> structure is more suitable to describe networks at a macroscopic level. Overlaps shared by communities {{play an important role}} in combining different communities. In this paper, two methods are proposed to detect <b>overlapping</b> <b>community</b> structure. One is called clique optimization, and the other is named fuzzy detection. Clique optimization aims at detecting granular overlaps. The clique optimization method is a fine grain scale approach. Each granular overlap is a node connected to distinct communities and it is highly connected to each community. Fuzzy detection is at a coarser grain scale and aims at identifying modular overlaps. Modular overlaps represent groups of nodes that have high community membership degrees with several communities. A modular overlap is itself a possible cluster/sub-community. Experimental studies in synthetic networks and real networks show that both methods provide good performances in detecting overlapping nodes but in different views. In addition, a new extension of modularity is introduced for measuring the quality of <b>overlapping</b> <b>community</b> structure...|$|E

Our community detection algorithm is based on maximizing the GenPerm over all the vertices in the network. We demonstrate, through experiments over synthetic and real-world networks, that GenPerm {{is more effective than}} other metrics in evaluating community structure. Further, we show that due to its vertex-centric property, GenPerm can be used to unfold several inferences beyond community detection, such as core-periphery analysis and message spreading. Our algorithm for maximizing GenPerm outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms in accurately predicting the ground-truth labels.

Slides from talk <b>Overlapping</b> <b>Communities,</b> Edge Partitions and Line Graphs given at ECCS 09 (University of Warwick, 22 nd September 2009). Paper: Edge Partitions and <b>Overlapping</b> <b>Communities</b> in Complex Networks, Eur. Phys. J. B 2010, 77, 265 – 272 [arXiv: 0912. 4389]. This covers in more detail the case where one is interested in the different line graphs of a weighted graph.
