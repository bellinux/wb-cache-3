5|$|Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi, {{the first}} {{ruler of the}} Al Said dynasty, {{blockaded}} Muscat and captured the forts in 1749. He renovated them, particularly al-Jalali. The function of al-Jalali changed from passive defense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> to a base from which troops could be dispatched. In the decades that followed the large central buildings and the round towers were added.|$|E
5|$|Over {{a hundred}} years later, missionaries had more success, setting up posts along the river. Spanish Franciscan missionaries gave the river its current name based on San Juan del Puerto (St. John <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Harbor),</b> the mission {{established}} at the river's mouth following {{the demise of the}} French fort. The name first appeared on a Spanish map created between 1680 and 1700.|$|E
5|$|All three ships had {{extensive}} careers during World War II. Maryland and West Virginia were both present during {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Maryland escaped relatively unscathed; West Virginia was sunk in the shallow waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> but subsequently raised and repaired. All three ships served as artillery support ships during amphibious operations. Maryland and West Virginia were present at the last surface action between battleships, the Battle of Surigao Strait during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. The three ships, put into the reserve fleet {{after the end of}} the war, were scrapped by the late 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Brummer and Bremse {{typically}} operated together {{throughout the}} war. They participated in numerous minelaying operations in 1916 and 1917. The two cruisers devastated a British convoy to Norway in October 1917, sinking the two escorting destroyers {{and most of}} the transports. Both were interned at Scapa Flow {{at the end of the}} war; they were successfully scuttled in June 1919. Brummer remains on the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor,</b> but Bremse was raised for scrapping in 1929 and broken up in the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Early plans also {{included}} a northsouth freeway {{on each side of}} the Los Angeles Central Business District, splitting at the merge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Harbor</b> Parkway (Harbor Freeway) and Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway (Pasadena Freeway) and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. Initially known as the East By-Pass and West By-Pass, the latter later became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Harbor</b> Parkway, while the former remained as a separate route roughly along Main Street. The state legislature added the East By-Pass to the state highway system in 1947 as Route 222. The Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved a revised master plan in mid-1955, based on various studied that had been made. A new Industrial Freeway replaced the Terminal Island Freeway and Alamitos Parkway between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles, where it then continued north along the former East By-Pass (which was not kept south of the Santa Monica Freeway) and the southern part of the Riverside Parkway to the interchange of the Glendale Freeway and Golden State Freeway (which had replaced the rest of the Riverside Parkway). The Industrial Freeway south of the Santa Monica Freeway became Route 270 in 1959, but the ex-Riverside Parkway piece north of the Arroyo Seco Parkway never became a state highway.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut {{discovered}} {{a photo of}} the light and began to research its history. Joel Severance, chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> commission, wanted to build a 28-foot (8.5 meter) tall replica that would primarily function as a daymark and their plan was endorsed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation in the United States Coast Guard and both the town of Deep River and Middlesex County, Connecticut, but it was expected to be denied by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. In 2000, the plan was rejected by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.|$|E
5|$|König was interned, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet, in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter gave the order to scuttle the fleet, including König, while the British guard ships were out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> on exercises. Unlike most of the scuttled ships, König was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still {{on the bottom of the}} bay.|$|E

5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of the blockade, Indiana fired at the cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo {{as they left the}} harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable {{to keep up with the}} Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski sailed on {{her third}} and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June, and sailed the next day for Freetown, where she arrived on 18 June. Likely because of the {{confusion}} surrounding the French surrender on 22 June, Pułaskis movements over the next days are unrecorded, but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities. That evening, Pułaskis crew raised steam and sailed the ship out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> {{in defiance of the}} detainment. After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry, the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|Retained {{under the}} Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, both ships were modernized significantly, with torpedo bulges and oil-fired boilers {{installed}} and other improvements made, but were demilitarized under {{terms of the}} 1930 London Naval Treaty. Florida was scrapped, Utah converted into first a radio-controlled target ship, then an anti-aircraft gunnery trainer. She served in the latter role until sunk by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Her hull, never raised, remains on the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> as a war memorial.|$|E

5|$|Shinanos launch on 8 October 1944, with Captain Toshio Abe in command, was {{marred by}} what some {{considered}} an ill-omened accident. During the floating-out procedure, one of the caissons {{at the end of}} the dock unexpectedly lifted as the water rose to the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> (no one had checked to ensure that all the caissons were properly ballasted with seawater). The sudden inrush of water into the graving dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor, {{it was decided that}} the USS Arizona would remain at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> as the final resting place for those lost. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{approved}} the construction of a memorial over the vessel and the USS Arizona memorial was dedicated in 1962. It includes a complex at Halawa Landing (opposite Ford Island) and a structure over the Arizona which receives visitors by ferry. Although the ferries are operated by US Navy personnel, the complex is staffed by the National Park Service.|$|E
5|$|While the {{superstructure}} {{and two of}} {{the four}} main gun turrets were removed, the barbette of one of the turrets remains visible above the water. Since her sinking, oil still leaks from the hull, with more than 2.3 quarts (2.18l) escaping into the harbor per day. The Navy, in conjunction with the National Park Service, has recently overseen a comprehensive computerized mapping of the hull, being careful to honor its role as a war grave. The Navy is considering non-intrusive means of abating the continued leakage of oil to avoid the further environmental degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beauregard {{was unhappy}} with his new assignment, believing that he {{deserved}} command {{of one of the}} great Confederate field armies. He performed successfully, however, preventing the capture of Charleston by Union naval and land attacks in 1863. On April 7, 1863, Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, led a union ironclad attack against Fort Sumter that was repulsed by highly accurate artillery fire from Beauregard's forces. In July through September 1863, union land forces under Brig. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore launched a series of attacks on Fort Wagner on Morris Island and other fortifications at the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor,</b> while Rear Adm. John A. Dahlgren attempted to destroy Fort Sumter. Because the latter operation failed, the successful seizure of Morris Island was not effective in threatening Charleston.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau {{remained}} unused in Gotenhafen {{until the}} end of the war. As the Red Army advanced on the city, the remaining crew took the ship out to the entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> and sank the vessel as a blockship on 27 March 1945. In 1947, the Polish government ordered the ship be removed, and initial salvage operations began. The ship was sealed and refloated on 12 September 1951 then completely scrapped, though it is believed that some of her steel was used in the construction of Polish merchant vessels. She was the largest ship raised at the time. Norway offered to return the turret from Trondheim in 1979, though the offer was rejected. The gun turret was instead preserved as a museum in Norway.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
