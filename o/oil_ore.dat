50|$|A {{decade of}} surveys {{by dozens of}} {{domestic}} research and design departments {{have resulted in the}} construction of a 10-30 ton deep-water port in natural conditions. The harbour can rely on the deep-water advantages of an ocean port, with convenient collection and distribution facilities, and a flexible transport system, the construction of various types of container berths, bulk cargo berths, berths imported crude <b>oil,</b> <b>ore</b> transshipment berths, liquefied natural gas berths etc. Rich land and water resources have fueled the establishment of large-scale petrochemical, metallurgy, shipbuilding and other projects, to develop the port industry. With China's accession to the World Trade Organization, the western port hinterland of the Yangtze River Delta has increasingly attracted international capital as well as domestic investment, resulting in a demand for energy, raw materials and products in large quantities. There is an urgent demands for coastal port facilities, which provides excellent opportunities both for developers and around the Yangtze River estuary, and for foreign investors. After completion, the Yangtze River Ocean Port will become the anchor of further economic prosperity in Jiangsu, complementing the Shanghai international shipping center.|$|E
40|$|Regarding the {{increase}} in world population the satisfaction of needs concerning the limited availability of raw materials such as <b>oil,</b> <b>ore</b> or water reaches an alarming level. This situation is intensified by {{the increase}}d consumption orientation of developing and emerging countries towards industrial countries. This clearly anticipates global distribution conflicts on remaining resources. Therefore, from 2001 up until now the world-wide demand for raw materials has dramatically increased and raw materials have become rarer and more expensive. The share of raw material costs regarding the overall production costs is already considerably higher than the cost factor labour. A main challenge for industrial businesses {{is the development of}} strategies to reduce costs, resource and energy input as well as emissions. This means to produce the most possible out of the input raw material and energy. In order to fulfil this principle a paradigm change is necessary: "maximum profit through minimum investment" has to be displaced by "maximum profit through minimum resource input". Due to their characteristics, the use of forming processes in manufacturing processes offers the potential for significant resource savings. In the following chapters, the focus will be on car manufacturing processes, that means innovative technologies for the realization of car body and powertrain components will be presented. In addition to the potentials for improving resource efficiency in car manufacturing as well as in car operation, challenges connected with these technologies will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Compared with present-day global plate {{tectonics}}, Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic {{plate tectonics}} may have involved faster moving, hotter plates that accumulated less sediment and contained a thinner section of lithospheric mantle. This scenario also fits with the complex geodynamic {{evolution of the}} Fennoscandian Shield from 2. 06 to 1. 78 Ga when rapid accretion of island arcs and several microcontinent-continent collisions in a complex array of orogens was manifested in short-lived but intense orogenies involving voluminous magmatism. With a few exceptions, all major ore deposits formed in specific tectonic settings between 2. 06 and 1. 78 Ga and thus a strong geodynamic control <b>oil</b> <b>ore</b> deposit formation is suggested. All orogenic gold deposits formed syn- to post-peak metamorphism and their timing reflects the orogenic younging of the shield towards the SW and west. Most orogenic gold deposits formed during periods of crustal shortening with peaks at 2. 72 to 2. 67, 1. 90 to 1. 86 and 1. 85 to 1. 79 Ga. The ca. 2. 5 to 2. 4 Ga Ni-Cu PGE deposits formed both as part of layered igneous complexes and associated with mafic volcanism, in basins formed during rifling of the Archaean craton at ca. 2. 5 to 2. 4 Ga. Svecokarelian ca. 1. 89 to 1. 88 Ga Ni-Cu deposits are related to mafic-ultramafic rocks intruded along linear belts at the accretionary margins of microcratons. All major VMS deposits in the Fennoscandian Shield formed between 1. 97 and 1. 88 Ga, in extensional settings, prior to basin inversion and accretion. The oldest "Cyprus-type" deposits were obducted onto the Archaean continent during the onset of convergence. The Pyhasalmi VMS deposits formed at 1. 93 to 1. 91 Ga in primitive, bimodal arc complexes during extension of the arc. In contrast, the Skellefte VMS deposits are 20 to 30 million years younger and formed in a strongly extensional intra-arc region that developed on continental or mature arc crust. Deposits in the Bergslagen-Uusimaa belt are similar in age to the Skellefte deposits and formed in a microcraton that collided with the Karelian craton at ca. 1. 88 to 1. 87 Ga. The Bergslagen-Uusimaa belt is interpreted as an intra-continental, or continental margin back-arc, extensional region developed on older continental crust. Iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) deposits are diverse in style. At least the oldest mineralizing stages, at ca. 1. 88 Ga, are coeval with calc-alkaline to monzonitic magmatism and coeval and possibly cogenetic subaerial volcanism more akin to continental arcs or to magmatic arcs inboard of the active subduction zone. Younger mineralization of similar style took place when S-type magmatism occurred at ca. 1. 80 to 1. 77 Ga during cratonization distal to the active N-S-trending subduction zone in the west. Possibly, interaction of magmatic fluids with evaporitic sequences in older rift sequences was important for ore formation. Finally, the large volumes of anorthositic magmas that characterize the Sveconorwegian Orogeny formed a major concentration of Ti in the SW part of the Sveconorwegian orogenic belt under granulite facies conditions, about 40 million years after the last regional deformation of the Sveconorwegian Orogeny, between ca. 930 and 920 Ma.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{methods of}} process-based {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) fail {{to account for the}} role of ecosystem goods and services derived from natural capital. This study presents an in-depth analysis of resource consumption and atmospheric emissions across a wood-derived bioethanol supply chain. The analysis is based on energy consumption, Industrial Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ICEC), and Ecological Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ECEC) of resources used in the production of one ton of ethanol from woodchips using the near-neutral hemicellulose extraction technology. We found that when compared with fossil-based fuels and corn ethanol, wood-based cellulosic ethanol derived under the near-neutral hemicellulose extraction process demonstrated superior environmental performance. Renewable resources - mostly sunlight and detrital matters-are the dominant contributors to ICEC analysis, whereas non-renewable resources such as crushed stone, crude <b>oil,</b> <b>ores</b> and minerals contribute more to total ECEC. Lime manufacturing, inorganic chemicals production for green liquor preparation, and anthraquinone production have the highest resource consumption. The woodchip washing process and transportation stages consume relatively fewer resources. A performance metric analysis suggests that even though cellulosic ethanol uses a renewable feedstock, its environmental sustainability performance is reduced due to the large consumption of non-renewable resources during the ethanol production stage...|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explain the {{motivating}} factors behind Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) patterns to the Middle East and Africa through a quantitative framework that utilizes a pooled cross-sectional time-series data set that covers 57 countries from 2003 - 2010. Prior research on the issue has hypothesized that China attempts to use external FDI to developing areas to promote national interests and help sustain economic growth. However, {{there has been an}} almost exclusive focus on economic determinants while generally ignoring political variables. The approach in this project attempts to fill this scholarly void by employing a broad array of independent variables that account for both economic and political influences in producing a timely model that yields robust results that will allow for generalizable statements to be made regarding the data. The findings demonstrate that pre-existing trade relations and strategically important natural resources (<b>oil,</b> <b>ores,</b> and metals) within host economies influence Chinese FDI to the Middle East and Africa. In addition, the study empirically shows that external FDI from China was heavily concentrated in economies with lower per capita income and directed toward regimes that may be classified as mildly authoritarian.
