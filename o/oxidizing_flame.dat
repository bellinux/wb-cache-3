It occurs when the ratio of oxygen to acetylene required for a neutral flame has been changed to give an excess of oxygen. This flame type is observed when welders add more oxygen to the neutral flame. This flame is hotter {{than the other two}} flames because the combustible gases will not have to search so far to find the necessary amount of oxygen, nor heat up as much thermally inert carbon. It is called an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>flame</b> because of its effect on metal. This flame adjustment is generally not preferred. The <b>oxidizing</b> <b>flame</b> creates undesirable oxides to the structural and mechanical detriment of most metals. In an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>flame,</b> the inner cone acquires a purplish tinge, gets pinched and smaller at the tip, {{and the sound of the}} flame gets harsh.

The coatings were elaborated by oxy-fuel thermal spraying processes. The best way to prepare the surface of the substrate was previously determined to achieve a sufficient adherence of copper alloy particles on the ceramic substrate. In order to manufacture the coatings an Eutectic CastolinTM 21071 powder was used, the oxy-fuel flames were produced from two different volumetric acetylene-oxygen ratios (1 : 1. 15 and 1 : 2. 5) obtaining a reducing and <b>oxidizing</b> <b>flame</b> respectively. The effect of surface preparation of the substrate, the coating thickness and the energy of the flame on the structure and coating adhesion were evaluated. It was found that the coatings obtained using a reducing flame presented lower adhesion values to the ceramic substrate and a higher level of porosity in its structure, while those made using an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>flame</b> presented greater adhesion and an homogenous structure (low porosity).

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of the chemical, physical, and optical properties of aerosol particles containing black carbon are necessary to improve current estimates of the radiative forcing in the atmosphere. A collaborative research effort between Aerodyne Research, Inc. and Boston College has focused on conducting field and laboratory experiments on carbonaceous particles and the development and characterization of new particulate instrumentation. This presentation {{will focus on the}} chemical, physical, and optical properties of black carbon particles measured in the laboratory {{in order to understand the}} effects of atmospheric processing on black carbon particles. Results from a three-week study during July 2008 of mass- and optical-based black carbon measurements will be presented. The project utilized the Boston College laboratory flame apparatus and aerosol conditioning and characterization equipment. A pre-mixed flat flame burner operating at controlled fuel-to-air ratios produced stable and reproducible concentrations of soot particles with known sizes, morphologies, and chemical compositions. In addition, other black carbon particle types, including fullerene soot, glassy carbon spheres, <b>oxidized</b> <b>flame</b> soot, Regal black, and Aquadag, were also atomized, size selected, and sampled. The study covered an experimental matrix that systematically selected particle mobility size (30 to 300 nm) and black carbon particle mass, particle number concentration, particle shape (dynamic shape factor and fractal dimension), and particle chemistry and density (changed via coatings). Particles were coated with a measured thickness (few nm to {approx} 150 nm) of sulfuric acid or bis (2 -ethylhexyl) sebacate and passed through a thermal denuder to remove the coatings. Highlights of the study to be presented include: (1) Characterization of the chemical and physical properties of various types of black carbon particles, (2) Mass specific absorption measurements as a function of fuel-to-air ratio and carbon particle type, (3) Optical absorption nhancement measurements as a function of coatings, and (4) Particle shape determination as a function of fuel-to-air ratio and collapse observed due to coatings...|$|R
40|$|Stainless steel (SS) {{can be an}} {{attractive}} material to create large electrodes for microbial bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), due to its low cost and high conductivity. However, poor biocompatibility limits its successful application today. Here we report a simple and effective method to make SS electrodes biocompatible by means of flame oxidation. Physicochemical characterization of electrode surface indicated that iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were generated in situ on an SS felt surface by flame oxidation. IONPs-coating dramatically enhanced the biocompatibility of SS felt and consequently resulted in a robust electroactive biofilm formation at its surface in BESs. The maximum current densities reached at IONPs-coated SS felt electrodes were 16. 5 times and 4. 8 {{times higher than the}} untreated SS felts and carbon felts, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum current density achieved with the IONPs-coated SS felt (1. 92 rnA/cm(2), 27. 42 mA/cm(3)) is one of the highest current densities reported thus far. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} <b>flame</b> <b>oxidized</b> SS felts could be a good alternative to carbon-based electrodes for achieving high current densities in BESs. Most importantly, high conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, strong chemical stability, large specific surface area, and comparatively low cost of <b>flame</b> <b>oxidized</b> SS felts offer exciting opportunities for scaling-up of the anodes for BESs...|$|R

The cations were analyzed using Varian AA 240 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Hundred millilitres of thoroughly (homogeneously) mixed sample was transferred into a 250 -mL volumetric glass beaker, 5  mL of concentrated nitric acid was added, and the entire volume was heated to boil till it was reduced to 20  mL; concentrated nitric acid was added in increments of 5  mL till all the residue was completely dissolved. The mixture was cooled, transferred into another beaker and made up to 100  mL using metal-free distiled water. The sample was aspirated, into the <b>oxidizing</b> air-acetylene <b>flame.</b> When the aqueous sample was aspirated, the sensitivity for 1 % absorption was observed.

40|$|Almost {{seventy percent}} of deaths in {{accidental}} fires are caused by inhalation of toxins such as carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke (soot) that form during underventilated burning. The COSMIC project examines the formation mechanisms of CO and soot during underventilated combustion, achieved presently using laminar, inverse diffusion flames (IDFs) formed between an air jet and surrounding fuel. A major hypothesis of the project is that the IDF mimics underventilated combustion because carbon-containing species that form on the fuel side of the flame (such as CO and soot) can escape without passing through an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>flame</b> tip. An IDF literature review {{was presented at the}} last microgravity workshop, and a few additional IDF papers have appeared since that meeting. The COSMIC project is entering the third year of its four-year funding cycle. The first two years have been devoted to designing and constructing a rig for use in the NASA 2. 2 -second drop tower. A few computations and laboratory experiments have been performed. The goals of this paper are to discuss the use of numerical simulation during burner design, to present computational and experimental results that support the hypothesis that IDFs are similar to underventilated flames, and to delineate future plans...|$|E
50|$|Borosilicate {{glass is}} {{considered}} more forgiving to work with, as its lower COE makes it less apt to crack during flameworking than soda-lime glass or lead glass. However, {{it has a}} narrower working temperature range than the soft glasses, has fewer available colors, and is considerably more expensive. Also, its working range is at higher temperatures than the soft glasses, requiring the use of oxygen/gas flames instead of air/gas. In addition to producing a hotter flame, the use of pure oxygen allows {{more control over the}} <b>flame's</b> <b>oxidizing</b> or reducing properties, which is necessary because some coloring chemicals in borosilicate glass react with any remaining oxygen in the flame either to produce the desired final color or to discolor if extra oxygen is present.|$|R

40|$|Differently {{prepared}} thin {{layers of}} TiO 2 were scanned with a UV laser to produce images of photoactivity. <b>Flame</b> <b>oxidized,</b> galvanically oxidized, sputtered and Sol Gel prepared layers were compared by determining images of UV induced photocurrent under otherwise constant conditions. Significant {{differences were found}} between the samples, both with respect to distribution and intensity of photoactivity. Also within the same sample, variations in photoactivity of up to one order of magnitude was found, which partially could be traced back to characteristic features of the preparation technique. The UV photoactivity of TiO 2 layers was shown to depend on the preparation procedure and the duration of photoelectrochemical activity. The developed technique is discussed as a strategy for optimizing photoactivity of TiO 2 layers. By locally immobilizing oxidants e. g. methanol, chlorophenol within a deposited porous sodium silicate layer, enhanced photooxidation activity can be identified in form of patches of increased photocurrent density. In this way the technique will allow minimal approaches to photooxidation and detoxification of chemicals. The described UV imaging techniques can be developed as a useful tool for optimizing photocatalytic layers for solar detoxification and surface cleanin...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{concerning}} {{properties of}} large diffusion flames burning steadily in a vitiated atmosphere under {{conditions similar to}} those which may arise in a room fire are described. The effects of vitiation on the products of combustion and flame lengths, and the extinction limits are described for natural gas and ethylene diffusion flames stabilized on 8. 9 -, 19 - and 50 -cm pool-type burners. As vitiation was increased and the flame extinction limit was approached, the flame length increased slightly. Close to the limit, radiation from soot in the flame became imperceptible, leaving only a weakly luminous blue flame. Even with significant reductions in both the flame height and luminosity near the limit conditions, the hydrocarbon fuels were completely <b>oxidized</b> in the <b>flame</b> to water and carbon dioxide and no measurable concentrations of products of incomplete combustion were produced. A comparison of limiting oxygen concentrations and limiting flame temperatures for these experiments {{with the results of}} other investigations shows reasonably good agreement despite widely varying experimental techniques.

40|$|In a Ni tube {{placed in}} an <b>oxidizing</b> air/acetylene AAS <b>flame</b> {{simultaneous}} digestion/oxidation of biological samples and powerful trace determinations were performed. A ceramic capillary was used for sample introduction. This capillary acted as a flame-heated thermospray nozzle (TS-FF-AAS). Slurry samples, prepared in 0. 3 mol L- 1 HNO 3, were transported by a new 0. 6 MPa (84 psi) flow injection system through the hot capillary into the flame tube furnace. A nitric acid vapour environment exists inside the tube at temperatures above 1000 degreesC oxidising the samples. The element traces could then be measured by AAS. For these investigations, 300 muL slurry samples (0. 1 to 1. 0 % w/v) from various biological materials, such as pig kidney (CRM 186), bovine liver (SRM 1577), spinach (SRM 1570), orchard leaves (SRM 1571) citrus leaves (SRM 1572), tomato leaves (SRM 1573) and tomato puree were used. Reference values were additionally obtained by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). The standard deviation (n = 10) was between 3 and 5 % using the same slurry and about 10 % when the whole process was repeated on subsequent days.

40|$|Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are bioreactors {{that use}} {{bacteria}} as catalysts to drive oxidation and/or reduction reactions at solid-state electrodes. They are {{considered as a}} promising technology for energy efficient wastewater treatment, power production, bioremediation, {{and the production of}} valuable chemicals. Currently, the practical application of this technology is limited by low current and power densities. Electrode surface modification has been proved an efficient way to enhance of the performance of BESs. However, there is still limited knowledge on the effects of surface chemistry on the biofilm formation and electron transfer. Moreover, most of the reported electrode modification methods are either complex, expensive or unscalable. There is a need to fill in some of these knowledge gaps and to develop simple, effective, and scalable surface modification methods to enhance the bioanode current output of BESs. Therefore, the objectives of this work were: (i) to clarify the effects of surface chemistry of carbon electrode on anodic biofilm formation and current generation in BESs; (ii) to develop a quick approach to achieve desirable surface chemical properties on carbon electrode for faster anodic biofilm formation; (iii) to invent a novel strategy to graft electron transfer mediator to carbon electrode surface to enhance extracellular electron transfer (EET); (iv) to establish a simple method to make stainless steel (SS) surface biocompatible for scalable electrodes of BESs. To investigate the effects of surface charge and surface hydrophobicity on anodic biofilm formation and current generation in BESs, glassy carbon electrodes were modified with –OH, –CH 3, –SO 3 -, or –N+(CH 3) 3 functional groups and then tested as anode in BESs. The results demonstrated that: (i) positively charged and hydrophilic surfaces were more selective to electroactive microbes (e. g. Geobacter) and more conducive for electroactive biofilm formation; (ii) The effects of the surface hydrophilicity were more pronounced than surface charge; (iii) differences in the maximum current output between surface modifications were correlated with biomass quantity; and (iv) all biofilms were dominated by Geobacter populations, but the composition of –CH 3 -associated biofilms differed from those formed on surfaces with different chemical modification. Now that the mode of action of the surface charge was established with expensive aryl diazonium salts, {{the next step was to}} perform the modification in a more cost effective, realistic manner. To convert carbon the felt surface into hydrophilic and positively-charged surface, a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) based treatment method was developed. In an acetate-fed bioanode, the start-up time of current production and the time to reach stable current output at the CTAB-treated felt anodes were 36. 1 % and 49. 4 % shorter than the untreated anodes, respectively. Moreover, the maximum current output with these treated electrodes was 23. 8 % higher than the untreated counterparts. Comparing to the routinely used electrode pretreatment methods such as high temperature ammonia, HNO 3 /H 2 SO 4 oxidation, NaOH/HCl soaking, and plasma treatment, surfactant treatment is quick, simple, cheap, and environmentally friendly way to make carbon felt surfaces hydrophilic and positively-charged. The use of this method will help researchers to save both time and chemicals involved in the electrode pretreatment procedure. To accelerate EET, immobilization of neutral red onto carbon electrodes was achieved via spontaneous reduction of in situ generated NR diazonium salts. The current output of NR-modified graphite felt electrodes when used as bioanodes in BESs were 3. 63 ± 0. 36 times higher than the unmodified electrodes, which demonstrated the effectiveness of covalently bound NR as insoluble redox mediator during the microbial anodic oxidation of acetate. Comparing to the existing NR modification methods, no nitric/sulfuric acids and organic solvents were involved, and no expensive equipment were required in the new method. Most importantly, the whole procedure of this method only takes a couple of hours. Hence, spontaneous reduction of in situ generated NR diazonium salts is a simple, effective, and environmentally friendly method to graft NR molecules on carbon surface. To enhance the biocompatibility of stainless steel felt (SS felt), iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were in situ generated on SS felt by flame oxidation. Consequently, a robust anodic biofilm formation was achieved on SS felt surface in BESs. The current density of IONPs-coated SS felt electrodes were 14 times higher current than the untreated electrodes. The maximum current density achieved on the IONPs-coated SS felt (1. 92 mA/cm 2) was one of the highest current densities reported. The <b>flame</b> <b>oxidized</b> SS felt reported here meets all requirements of the ideal anode materials for BESs:(1) high conductivity; (2) good biocompatibility; (3) strong chemical stability; (4) large specific surface area; (5) excellent mechanical strength; and (6) low cost. Attributed to these advantages, <b>flame</b> <b>oxidized</b> SS felt holds exciting opportunities for scaling-up of anode and for achieving high current densities in BESs...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} details a predictive computational {{approach for}} modeling titanium dioxide nanoparticles in flame reactors. The industrial production of these nanoparticles is done using the chloride process, i. e. titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) is <b>oxidized</b> in a <b>flame</b> to form titanium dioxide (TiO 2) particles: TiCl 4 (g) + O 2 (g) 2 ̆ 6 rarr TiO 2 (s) + 2 Cl 2 (g). In absence of thermochemical data most previous works used the one-step reaction mechanism given above. But this problem was alleviated recently by West et al. (2009) [R. H. West, R. A. Shirley, M. Kraft, C. F. Goldsmith, W. H. Green, Combust. Flame 156 (2009) 1764 - 1770], by proposing a detailed mechanism for this oxidation process, which includes 30 species and 66 reactions. As the oxidation of TiCl 4 {{happens in a}} flame, this detailed mechanism becomes more complex with interactions of the hydrocarbons with oxidizer as well as chlorine. Hence, the proposed detailed mechanism in this work extends to 107 species and 501 reactions. Comparisons are made between the one-step and detailed mechanism to show that different models would result in very different product properties. A bivariate population balance model was proposed to evaluate the size distribution of nanoparticles in the flame reactor. This model tracks both the area and volume distributions and accounts for nucleation, surface growth, aggregation and sintering of the nanoparticles. The results from this model are {{used to evaluate the}} particle size and shape for the two chemical mechanisms, which in turn are compared to experimental results. Also explored are the roles of gas-phase and surface phase reactions. Accurate models for the nanoparticles involve developing a detailed chemical mechanism and modeling the transport process. This is especially true in the case of flame reactors where the flow structure and turbulence are of major importance. Computational fluid dynamics based techniques can be used to understand and implement this coupling between transport processes and chemical reactions. But due to the large number of species and reactions involved, coupling this detailed chemistry with flow solvers is computationally very expensive. Thus, to represent the correct chemistry while making the problem computationally viable reduction of the detailed mechanism is carried out. Finally, discussed are the results from the successful application of the models and techniques refined during the dissertation work to an industrial system. The findings show that the developed models can accurately track particle evolution in an industrial reactor. In summary, this work uses detailed chemistry and bivariate distribution to present a predictive multiphysics computational model for TiO 2 nanoparticle synthesis in flame reactors, that can be employed to optimize operating conditions based on desired product particle size distribution...|$|R
