The company used viralmarketing techniques to collect potential customers' e-mailaddresses and encourage them to post the album streaming on their blogs.

This is because the predetermined overhead rate is computed before the period begins and is used to apply <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> throughout the period. Companies typically base their predetermined overhead rates on the estimated, or budgeted, amount of allocation base (cost drivers) for the upcoming period. The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s predetermined overhead rate based on the traditional costing with those rate computes or bases on the activity-based costing (ABC). PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s manufacturing <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> data (primary data) is used to reach the purpose. PT Kusumahadi Santosa is the manufacturer that process threads into cloth materials. The result of this research as follows. PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s applied <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> base on predetermined overhead rates computes on the traditional costing (uses machine hours allocation base) is Rp 51. 324, 044, 510, 00, while those applied <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> based on predetermined overhead rates computes on ABC is Rp 53. 926. 959. 944, 00. We conclude if PT Kusumahadi Santosa uses cost plus pricing to set the price of his products, those products is underpricing. This because the <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> is under applied. We suggest that PT Kusumahadi Santosa use ABC to compute and to apply the manufacturing <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> in order to calculate his product inventory cost and set his product price properly. ...|$|R

The study revealed that <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> budgets, special imprests and additional imprests were ineffectively used.
