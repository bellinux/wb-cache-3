Mansur and Tan (1999) suggested criteria for the selection of location of web openings in RC beams. The depth of openings was recommended not to exceed 50 % of the overall depth of beam. Accordingly, in this study, {{the depth of the}} opening was not taken as a studied parameter and it was hence set equal to 225  mm. The length of the opening was taken as a studied parameter and it varied from zero (case of no opening) to 1350  mm. The maximum opening length of 1350  mm was chosen to have an opening extending approximately to the mid-length of the shear span. Details of numerically investigated beams with different <b>opening</b> <b>sizes</b> are shown in Table  5. Ten opening lengths with ℓo/hc (see Fig.  1) ranging from zero to 12 were numerically studied for unstrengthened beams. However, six opening lengths with ℓo/hc ranging from 4 to 12 were numerically investigated for strengthened beams as seen in Table  5. Since scheme- 4 was previously found to be the most economical scheme, it was used in this parametric study. The FE analysis results of beams with different <b>opening</b> <b>sizes</b> are listed in Table  5.|$|R

Since drywall contractors are not ordinarily required to do mechanical and electrical firestopping, the drywall openings can become an item of dispute or neglect, particularly in North American construction. This common issue can be minimised by designating a separate firestopping sub-contract, whereby a separate speciality sub-contractor firestops all openings on site, mechanical, electrical and structural, as well as the building joints.|$|E

40|$|Suspended solids in {{stormwater}} runoff {{create a}} range of water quality problems; their removal lessens the deleterious impact of stormwater runoff on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, three geotextiles were tested in laboratory column tests with influent suspensions having hydraulic loading rates, total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations, and particle size distributions (PSDs) similar to those reported for urban highway stormwater runoff. After a short ripening period, the geotextile filters removed TSS from 100 - 200 mg/L to below a target concentration of 30 mg/L. A lower geotextile permittivity resulted in an increased percentage of TSS captured by the filter; however, the total mass of solids captured was unaffected because lower permittivity resulted in lower total solids loaded to the filter overall. In general, {{the effectiveness of the}} geotextile filter at retaining suspended solids increased as filter <b>opening</b> <b>sizes</b> decreased and as influent particle sizes increased. The hydraulic conductivity of a geotextile filter, which was related to TSS captured via a power function, was higher for geotextiles with higher permittivity and larger <b>opening</b> <b>sizes</b> and for larger influent particle sizes. Overall, the filter with the second highest permittivity (0. 8 s- 1), NW 2, was the most successful geotextile tested. TSS removal in the geotextile laboratory tests was comparable to reported values from sand filters in literature under similar loading conditions. Sand filters in laboratory tests had greater TSS removal than geotextile filters. However, the sand filters clogged at a lower total solids loading than the geotextiles. The applicability of existing filtration criteria for geotextiles for stormwater treatment is addressed, and four new retention criteria ratios specifically for stormwater filtration which use two filter <b>opening</b> <b>sizes</b> and two particle diameters, such as (095 /D 60) /(O 30 /D 10) > 0. 05, are introduced. Results from field testing are analyzed; the geotextile filter reduced TSS concentrations in runoff by an average of 84 % with input TSS event mean concentrations (EMCs) ranging from 22 - 185 mg/L and output EMCs ranging from 1. 7 - 22 mg/L. A mathematical model is developed which estimates hydraulic conductivity as a function of solids captured. The model and filtration criteria are used to assess the field testing results...|$|R

50|$|Perimeter or barrier {{guarding}} {{refers to}} a barrier placed around a work area where an automated piece of equipment-like a robotic arm-performs a function. This type of guarding is generally a wire partition system, but also can {{take the form of}} pressure sensitive mats or light curtains. Wire partitions systems used as machine guards must be fixed in place either on the machine or around its perimeter. These guarding systems may be configured with various sizes of wire mesh, solid sheet metal, or clear polycarbonate panels. Use of these materials depends on the hazard being guarded and the distance between the hazard and the guard. Mesh <b>opening</b> <b>size</b> of the guard depends on the proximity of the guard to the hazard. If the guard is installed close to moving parts, the mesh openings must be smaller than if the guard is installed a greater distance away from the moving parts. Mesh opening sizes for specific distances from the hazard are defined in ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012. Solid barriers such as sheet metal or clear view polycarbonate can be used to shield the hazard as well as control sparks or liquids. Size of the barrier (height and width) must conform to ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012. Wire partition guards provide a means of access to the guarded equipment with doors, lift out sections, or other controlled openings.|$|E
50|$|Flood {{detention}} dams {{are commonly}} used {{as part of a}} flood or storm water detention system. Flood detention systems combine the use of detention basins, detention dams, and channels in order efficiently collect and regulate the runoff. The detention facilities not only regulate the amount of water that is released, but control the quality of the water that is released. The runoff is monitored in order to prevent harmful contaminates and debris from damaging resources like: lakes, rivers, and wetlands. Flood detention dams are constructed methodically. The watershed topographical data, hydrological records, and geological structure for the area are analyzed {{in order to determine the}} most effective location for the flood detention dam(s). The analyzed watershed topographical data, hydrological records, and geological structure display the potential storage capacity, environmental impacts, and physical limitations of the area. As a result, models can be generated to simulate the effectiveness of possible flood detention dam locations and designs. The general design for a flood detention dam has a cross sectional shape of a trapezoid where the longer of the parallel sides is the base of the dam, and the angled sides face upstream and downstream. The flood detention dam has an opening at the top in order to release the flood water at a controlled rate that the channels below can accommodate. The flood detention dam models can be used to determine the necessary dam height and overflow <b>opening</b> <b>size</b> in order to prevent overtopping.|$|E
