50|$|Clear span {{refers to}} the {{internal}} construction. Clear span steel buildings utilize large <b>overhead</b> <b>support</b> beams, thus reducing the need for internal supporting columns. Clear span steel buildings {{tend to be less}} cost efficient than structures with interior columns. However, other practical considerations may influence the selection of framing style such as an occupancy where interior structural obstructions are undesirable (e.g. aircraft hangars or sport arenas).|$|E
50|$|The sooty-capped hermit (Phaethornis augusti) is a hummingbird from Venezuela, Colombia, Guyana and Brazil. It builds one of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} nests which hangs by a single stout cable of spiders' silk from some <b>overhead</b> <b>support.</b> These curious nests have been found beneath bridges, in highway culverts, and hanging from the roof inside dark buildings. As far as is known, most other hermits build rather similar nests.|$|E

50|$|The {{line between}} Pakenham to Warragul was {{duplicated}} {{in various stages}} between 1952 and 1956, and was electrified in 1954. Starting from 15 February 1987, and lasting until 1998, the station was the terminus {{of a number of}} The Met electric passenger services from Flinders Street. The line was de-electrified beyond Warragul on 28 June 1987, and the <b>overhead</b> <b>support</b> structures were removed in 2005/2006, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project.|$|E
50|$|The {{tracks were}} blocked in both directions. The {{overhead}} wire was destroyed and the <b>overhead</b> <b>supports</b> {{had fallen on}} the tracks. The cleanup work was continued through the whole night {{and in the early}} morning, after the day of the crash, train traffic was resumed on one track. Train cranes were able to lift some carriages back on the track in the morning. During the day after the crash the president of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, ir. J. Lohman, visited the disaster site.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason is}} that the {{hardware}} they used was (largely) fixed and a need for an operating system to abstract away differences was thus not needed. They shipped with minimal amounts of computer memory - 4-8 kilobytes was standard on early home computers - as well as 8-bit processors without specialized support circuitry like a MMU or even a dedicated real-time clock. On this hardware, a complex operating system's <b>overhead</b> <b>supporting</b> multiple tasks and users would likely compromise the performance of the machine without really being needed.|$|R

50|$|The I-5 Skagit River Bridge {{collapse}} {{occurred on}} May 23, 2013, {{in the state}} of Washington, in the northwestern United States. At approximately 7:00 pm PDT, one bridge span carrying Interstate 5 over the Skagit River collapsed into the river below. Three people in two different vehicles fell with the span; they were rescued by boat and did not sustain serious injury. The cause of the collapse was determined to be an oversize load striking several <b>overhead</b> <b>support</b> beams on the bridge, which led to an immediate collapse of the northernmost span.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{crosses the}} river from New York on its {{northeast}} portal to Pennsylvania on its southwest, just downstream from a bend. It is a polygonal Warren through truss steel bridge with alternating vertical members. Three spans, supported by concrete piers and abutments, comprise the bridge. The longest of those spans is 224 ft; the bridge's total length is 684 ft. Its deck carries a two-lane asphalt roadway 26 ft wide; there is 14.8 ft of clearance underneath the <b>overhead</b> <b>support</b> structures. A pedestrian walkway {{is located on the}} upstream side. Local utility lines cross the river 300 feet (100 m) north of the bridge.|$|E
5000|$|Adapted by Ben Hurst, the attraction's story occurs {{after the}} events of the movie, {{beginning}} with Helen's return from [...] "Dryland" [...] to get her friends from the [...] "Atoll", and includes the characters Helen, the Deacon, and the Mariner as well as several [...] "Atollers" [...] and [...] "Smokers". The show is 16 minutes long and includes stunts on water, land, and <b>overhead,</b> <b>supported</b> by many pyrotechnic, flame, water, and other special effects, including the explosive crash landing of the seaplane. The stunt show's unique soundtrack was crafted from snips from the movie score.|$|R

5000|$|The through-truss {{bridge was}} built in 1955 and connects the Skagit County cities of Mount Vernon and Burlington. It had {{recently}} been evaluated as safe. Although not structurally deficient, it was considered [...] "functionally obsolete", meaning it did not meet current design standards. The bridge's design was [...] "fracture-critical," [...] meaning {{that it did not}} have redundant structural members to protect its structural integrity {{in the event of a}} failure of one of the bridge's support members. The <b>overhead</b> <b>support</b> structure was known to have been struck by a truck as recently as October 2012. From an engineering standpoint, the bridge actually consists of four consecutive spans which are structurally independent. The deck and overhead superstructure of only the northernmost span collapsed into the river. The span south of the collapsed span also sustained damage from being struck by the same truck, but not severe enough to result in a collapse. Also, the piers below the deck were not damaged.|$|E
5000|$|Cut-and-cover is {{a simple}} method of {{construction}} for shallow tunnels where a trench is excavated and roofed over with an <b>overhead</b> <b>support</b> system strong enough {{to carry the load}} of what is to be built above the tunnel. Modern Deep level Construction is by tunnel boring machines.The Circle, District, Hammersmith & City, and Metropolitan lines are services that run on the sub-surface network that has railway tunnels just below the surface and built mostly using the [...] "cut-and-cover" [...] method. The tunnels and trains are of a similar size to those on British main lines. The Hammersmith & City and Circle lines share all their stations and most of the track with other lines. The Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria and Waterloo & City lines are deep-level tubes, with smaller trains that run in two circular tunnels with a diameter of about 11 ft, lined with cast-iron or precast concrete rings, which were bored using a tunnelling shield. It is these that were the tube lines, although since the 1950s the term [...] "tube" [...] has come to be used to refer to the whole London Underground system.|$|E
