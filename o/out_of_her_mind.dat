500|$|... "Everyone Nose" [...] {{was written}} by Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, who also {{produced}} the song as The Neptunes. The title of the song derives from the subject of women snorting cocaine socially in bathrooms. N.E.R.D attested that, [...] "when the girls go in the bathroom, they're powdering their faces with that other white stuff." [...] Andrew Coleman, the band's engineer, explained the song's bridge, saying it is the [...] "breakdown" [...] of the girl: [...] "you can imagine a girl who is totally coked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> dancing and sweating." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{her death}} and the {{publication}} of her daughter Imogen's 1989 autobiography, A Childhood at Green Hedges, Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure. Imogen considered her mother to be [...] "arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> and {{without a trace of}} maternal instinct. As a child, I viewed her as a rather strict authority. As an adult I pitied her." [...] Blyton's eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however, as [...] "a fair and loving mother, and a fascinating companion".|$|E
500|$|In July 2008, BBC Radio Scotland's head, Jeff Zycinski, {{stated that}} the BBC, and media in general, were complicit in {{undermining}} celebrities, including Winehouse. He said that public interest in the singer's lifestyle did not make her lifestyle newsworthy. Rod McKenzie, editor of the BBC Radio One programme Newsbeat, replied: [...] "If you play [...] music to a certain demographic, those same {{people want to know}} what's happening in her private life. If you don't cover it, you're insulting young licence fee payers." [...] In The Scotsman, British singer and songwriter Lily Allen was quoted to have said – [...] "I know Amy Winehouse very well. And she is very different to what people portray her as being. Yes, she does get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> on drugs sometimes, but she is also a very clever, intelligent, witty, funny person who can hold it together. You just don't see that side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! has she gone?" [...] said Edward, recollecting {{the sick}} {{woman of the}} cottage which he had entered with Ellen and Fanshawe. [...] "Was she not <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right <b>mind,</b> Dolly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She puts {{meanings}} to {{my words}} which I never thought of," [...] John said, [...] "and is angered, or pretends to be--for I never know which it is--at things {{which she has}} coined <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mind,</b> for they had no place in mine." ...|$|R

500|$|Church {{later said}} that the team [...] "stumbled into a nice villain" [...] with SHODAN, in that she could {{routinely}} and directly affect the player's gameplay [...] "in non-final ways". Through triggered events and through objects in the environment, such as security cameras that the player must destroy, the team made SHODAN's presence part of the player's exploration of the world. Because SHODAN interacts with the player as a [...] "recurring, consistent, palpable enemy", Church believed that she meaningfully connects the player to the story. System Shock concept artist Robb Waters created SHODAN's visual design, and LoPiccolo recruited his bandmate Terri Brosius to voice the character. Brosius said that her goal during the recording sessions was to speak [...] "without emotion, but with some up and down inflections". Afterward, her voice was heavily edited in post-production, which created a robotic effect inspired by the voice of Max Headroom. LoPiccolo later {{said that the}} large number of effects on Brosius's voice were [...] "laboriously hand-done" [...] with Sound Designer, which lacked the features that a sound editor would normally use to achieve such results. SHODAN's dialogue early in the game was given [...] "a few glitches" [...] to hint at her corrupted status. LoPiccolo increased the number of these effects throughout the game, which creates an [...] "arc" [...] that ends with SHODAN [...] "completely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> [...] collapsing as an entity". The character of the hacker arose as a reaction against the protagonist of the Ultima series, the Avatar. According to Grossman, they wanted to cast the player as someone [...] "interestingly morally compromised" [...] who had a stake in the situation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1636 Maria Eleonora {{was taken}} to Gripsholm castle and officially lost her parental rights to her daughter, because at times she was {{completely}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> In 1639 a letter written by her and intended for Sweden's archenemy, the King Christian IV of Denmark, was intercepted. After a summons, Maria Eleonora appeared at her daughter's court in a flood of tears {{in the summer of}} 1640. Queen Christina, 13 years old, reasoned with her mother and dissuaded her from taking up residence at Nyköping near Denmark. Afterwards, Maria Eleonora returned to Gripsholm. To undertake one of her periodic fasts, she retired to the seclusion of her own apartment, accompanied by only one of her ladies-in-waiting, Anna Sofia von Bülow. Maria Eleonora wrote regularly to her daughter Christina. [...] She and her German court wanted to leave their exile at Gripsholm castle. [...] Christina replied tactfully, knowing that the Council would not permit the queen mother any leave. Eventually her mother asked to leave Sweden altogether. [...] Christina invited her to Stockholm, attempting to persuade her to stay in the country. [...] At night the two ladies let themselves down from a window and were rowed in a boat {{to the other side of}} the nearby lake, where a carriage was waiting for them. They drove to Nyköping, where they boarded a Danish ship. [...] King Christian IV had intended the ship to take her home to Brandenburg, but she convinced the captain to bring her to Denmark instead. She was well received by the Danish king, but that did not make the demanding Maria Eleonora like Denmark any better. She wanted to go home to Brandenburg. The electoral prince there demanded financial compensation from Sweden, where on the contrary the Council expected to withdraw her appanage as well as her properties. [...] Finally the teenage Christina succeeded in negotiating a certain alimony for her mother, adding to this from her own purse.|$|E

60|$|They {{had been}} {{standing}} when she commenced her last speech; but as she finished it, the doctor moved on again, and she moved with him.

60|$|Helena {{thinks it}} over, and thinks well of it. Mr. Crisparkle doing so, {{she would do}} so; but she does originally, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mind,</b> think well of it, as a healthy project, {{denoting}} a sincere endeavour and an active attempt at self-correction. She is inclined to pity him, poor fellow, for going away solitary on the great Christmas festival; but she feels it much more to the purpose to encourage him. And she does encourage him.|$|R
60|$|On {{the night}} of the benefit, Lucy was in a most {{exasperating}} mood, Christie in a very indignant one, and as they entered their dressing-room they looked as if they might have played the Rival Queens with great effect. Lucy offered no help and Christie asked none, but putting <b>her</b> vexation resolutely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight fixed <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> on the task before her.|$|R
60|$|She made no answer; {{she looked}} before {{her as if}} she were going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
60|$|But he didn't. He {{discovered}} nothing; and {{she went}} home jubilant, and dropped all concern about the matter permanently <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Again the fanatical voluptuary endeavoured to {{pull the}} poor girl towards him, while she, alarmed, but not scared <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> endeavoured, by fair entreaty, to prevail on him to release her. But his features, in themselves not marked, had acquired a frightful expression, and he exclaimed, [...] "No, Phoebe--do not think to escape--thou art given {{to me as a}} captive--thou hast neglected the hour of grace, and it has glided past--See, the water trickles over thy pitcher, which was to be a sign between us--Therefore I will urge thee no more with words, of which thou art not worthy, but treat thee as a recusant of offered grace." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was very}} sorrowful {{to think that}} Charley's pretty looks would change and be disfigured, even if she recovered--she was such a child with her dimpled face--but that thought was, for the greater part, lost in her greater peril. When {{she was at the}} worst, and <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> rambled again to the cares <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's sick bed and the little children, she still knew me so far as that she would be quiet in my arms when she could lie quiet nowhere else, and murmur <b>out</b> the wanderings <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> less restlessly. At those times I used to think, how should I ever tell the two {{remaining}} babies that the baby who had learned <b>of</b> <b>her</b> faithful heart to be a mother to them in their need was dead! ...|$|R
60|$|After Merton's {{departure}} from Eyethorne things drifted {{back to their}} old state at Wood End House, the slight change in Constance becoming less and less perceptible, until the time came when Fan began to think, with a secret feeling of relief, that the visitor had after all made only a passing impression, which was already fading <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> teacher's <b>mind.</b> But by-and-by there came from London a letter and a packet of books and periodicals for Constance, and Fan remarked the glad excitement in her friend's face when she carried her treasures away to her room, and her subsequent silence on the subject. And after that Constance was again much occupied with her own thoughts, which, to judge from her countenance, were happy ones; and Fan quickly {{came to the conclusion}} that the books and letter were from Merton. Mrs. Churton, who knew nothing about this new acquaintance, imagined only that her daughter had sucked out all the impiety contained in the books she already possessed, and had sent for a fresh supply. For, she argued, if there had been nothing wrong in the books Constance would have allowed her to read or see them. She made herself very unhappy over it, and was more incensed than ever against her sinful daughter, but she said nothing, and only showed her dissatisfaction in her cold, distrustful manner.|$|R
60|$|LEXY (confidentially). Well, I don't exactly know; but {{she spoke}} very strangely {{to me this}} morning. I'm afraid she's a little <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> sometimes.|$|E

50|$|After {{her group}} goes {{home for the}} weekend and she decides to stay, Dr. Klein becomes swept up in <b>her</b> studies <b>of</b> the cave. Meanwhile, the sheriff starts looking into the dead animal {{carcasses}} and finds that many local farmers are losing some of their animal stock. Later on, the sheriff {{comes back to the}} cave to find a dead animal being cooked and Dr. Klein acting strangely. She claims the drawings have been changing. The photos taken earlier show that the drawings on the wall are different from when the photos were taken. She plans {{to spend the night in}} the cave because whatever happens, happens at night. The sheriff tries to talk <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, but <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> is set. The sheriff decides to spend the night in his truck outside the cave.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to her writings about sex, Heywood championed women’s suffrage and wrote passionate arguments against rape. She was a labor reformer, and believed wealthy women to be “morally corrupt” {{because they did not}} work. She ardently defended prostitutes, blaming their poverty and desperation on the men who exploited them, while most people of the time simply blamed the women themselves for the institution of prostitution. Heywood was also an anarchist and a spiritualist, meaning that she rejected the authority of the government and the church. She believed the church to be too constricting in its treatment of female sexuality, and said that the “church-state grip” on sexual knowledge caused “women and labor” to be put into a place of “subjected destitution.” It is unclear why or when the church fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor in <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> but it likely happened sometime between 1865, when she got married in a church, and 1872, when she began writing for The Word, criticizing the church. Her husband’s view that the church played too large a role in marriage may have influenced Angela’s change of heart in this matter.|$|R
60|$|Then {{it became}} a {{wonderful}} and terrible sight to watch her, to divine in some little way the dark and awful state <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> The lines, the tenseness, the shade, the age faded <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face; the deep-set frown smoothed itself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brow and it became young. Neale saw those staring eyes fix upon his; he realized a dull, opaque blackness of horror, hideous veils let down over the windows of a soul, images of hell limned forever on a mind. Then that film, that unseeing cold thing, like the shade of sleep or of death, passed from her eyes. Now they suddenly were alive, great dark-violet gulfs, full of shadows, dilating, changing into exquisite and beautiful lights.|$|R
60|$|I {{believe she}} is on this point rather <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> and I do hope the poor thing will not do {{anything}} wild, and get into mischief.|$|E
