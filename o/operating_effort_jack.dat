40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the shape of}} contracts between local governments and the contractors they hire to run public facilities on their behalf.

This feature reduces the agent’s marginal incentives, creating a trade-off between signaling and moral hazard. We provide extensions of our framework in several directions allowing for risk aversion on the agent’s side, double moral hazard and political delegation. The model is supported by some stylized facts from the water industry...|$|R
