5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most <b>of</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E
5|$|Flag {{hoisting}} {{ceremonies and}} cultural programmes {{take place in}} governmental and non-governmental institutions throughout the country. Schools and colleges conduct flag hoisting ceremonies and cultural events. Major government buildings are often adorned with strings of lights. In Delhi and some other cities, kite flying adds to the occasion. National flags of different sizes are used abundantly to symbolise allegiance to the country. Citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, cars, household accessories with replicas of the tri-colour. Over a period of time, the celebration has changed emphasis from nationalism to a broader celebration <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> India.|$|E

Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed Manifestations of God.|$|E

5|$|For the 40th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, EMI reissued {{the album}} in its {{original}} configuration, in a limited-edition box set of three vinyl LPs. Available via participating Record Store Day retailers, with each copy individually numbered, the release took place on 26 November 2010. In what Bergstrom notes as a contrast to the more aggressive marketing campaign run simultaneously by John Lennon's estate, to commemorate Lennon's 70th birthday, a digitally remastered 24-bit version of the album was made available for download from Harrison's official website. The reissue coincided with the Harrison estate's similarly low-key release of the Ravi Shankar–George Harrison box set Collaborations and East Meets West Music's reissue of Raga, the long-unavailable documentary on Shankar that Harrison had helped release through Apple Films in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Sessions for Living in the Material World {{took place}} at Apple Studio in central London and at Harrison's Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, {{beginning}} in October 1972. Despite his original intention to co-produce with Phil Spector as before, Harrison was sole producer throughout the sessions, with Phil McDonald again serving as recording engineer. While Harrison succeeded in paring down the album's production after the Wall of Sound excesses <b>of</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, commentators note that he incorporated aspects of Spector's signature style on this and other songs on Material World, {{through the use of}} orchestral strings and brass, a choir and multiple drummers.|$|E

On 1 October 1861, the instalments were collected into one volume with the title The Book of Household Management, comprising information for the Mistress, Housekeeper, Cook, Kitchen-Maid, Butler, Footman, Coachman, Valet, Upper and Under House-Maids, Lady's-Maid, Maid-of-all-Work, Laundry-Maid, Nurse and Nurse-Maid, Monthly Wet and Sick Nurses, etc. etc.—also Sanitary, Medical, & Legal Memoranda: with a History of the Origin, Properties, and Uses <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>Things</b> Connected with Home Life and Comfort.|$|E

The critic John Ruskin was an ardent advocate <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> medieval and popularised these ideas. The architect Augustus Welby Pugin, who designed mainly for the growing Roman Catholic Church, set himself to recreate not only the structural appearance of medieval churches, but also the richly decorated and colourful interiors that had been almost entirely lost, existing only as a painted screen here and there, a few tiled floors such as those at Winchester and Canterbury and the intricate painted wooden ceiling of Peterborough Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>things.</b> Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E
