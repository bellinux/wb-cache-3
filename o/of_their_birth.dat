5|$|As {{successful}} as Carroll was in business, however, {{he and his}} wife experienced many personal losses throughout this period. Of the ten children born to Charles and Mary Carroll, five died within a year <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>birth.</b> Henry, their eldest son, died the year before his father in 1719, at the age of 21 or 22. Only the third child, named Charles and later known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, and their next son Daniel would marry and have children of their own.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cultures}} have attached importance to astronomical events, and the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. In the West, astrology most often {{consists of a}} system of horoscopes purporting to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict future events in their life based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other celestial objects at the time <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>birth.</b> The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>birth</b> much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E

25|$|Another experiment, {{in which}} {{the names of the}} famous rabbis were matched against the places <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>births</b> and deaths (rather than the dates), was {{conducted}} in 1997 by Harold Gans, former Senior Cryptologic Mathematician for the United States National Security Agency.|$|R
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this paper to {{illustrate}} from the novels themselves that Defoe's protagonists are essentially isolated individuals and that this isolation is the result of the circumstances <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>births,</b> the nature <b>of</b> <b>their</b> professions, their spiritually isolating religious beliefs, and their attitudes toward their fellow men...|$|R
5|$|Prevalent minorities, {{particularly}} Hindu and Christian, feel a {{sense of}} vulnerability because of their religious beliefs. Labourers and farmhands comprise the countless Christian villages throughout Punjab; many are descendants of people who converted from Hinduism to Christianity under the British Raj, and considered low caste by virtue <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>birth.</b> A small population of wealthy, well-educated Christians have settled in Karachi; however, as a result of increasing Islamization, religious intolerance in Pakistani society, blashphemy laws and Islamist militancy, most have left Pakistan to settle in other countries where there is more religious tolerance, such as Canada and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Similar effects {{should be}} found for other {{attributes}} connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>birth</b> more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, {{four-horned antelope}}s may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed {{for the first few}} weeks <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>birth.</b> The young remain with the mother for about a year.|$|E
25|$|Historically, OTMA was {{an acronym}} {{sometimes}} {{used by the}} daughters of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia and his consort, Alexandra Feodorovna, as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girl's name in the order <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>births</b> : Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.|$|R

2500|$|Especially {{noteworthy}} is section 8, on [...] "the {{ages of the}} pious," [...] the Patriarchs, the Matriarchs, and {{the twelve}} sons of Jacob, giving also the dates <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>births.</b> In this list the months are not designated as Nisan, etc., but as [...] "the first," [...] "the second," [...] etc. The dates for Zebulun and Benjamin are lacking in the present text, but are given in a citation by Baḥya and in the Yalḳuṭ, where, however, the months are named and not numbered. The length of life ascribed to the sons of Jacob agrees with that given in the Seder Olam Zuṭa, but only the Book of Jubilees gives the days and months <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>births,</b> and even it does not state the length <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives (comp. Jubilees, xxviii. and xxxii., where, however, some dates differ from those given in the midrash).|$|R
