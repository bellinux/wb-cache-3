5|$|Although cottage industries, both in boyar and peasant households, {{were still}} {{the main source}} of clothing, food and construction, {{specialized}} production, such as weaving and pottery, started to develop {{by the middle of the}} 15thcentury.

In Moldavia, Gypsy slaves were first mentioned in 1428 when Alexander I awarded 31 Gypsy families to the Bistriţa Monastery. In time Gypsies became specialized in several crafts: for example, throughout the Middle Ages the working of iron was an occupation reserved almost exclusively for them.|$|E
5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude oil from <b>oil</b> <b>wells</b> in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E
5|$|As Galveston's {{traditional}} economy declined, Texas' {{oil boom}} began in 1901, with <b>oil</b> <b>wells</b> and refineries constructed throughout the state. Galveston's direct {{role in this}} boom was minimal as investors avoided building pipelines and refineries on the island itself (though for a time oil was shipped through the island). Nevertheless, wealth {{brought on by the}} boom transformed nearby Houston, Texas City, Goose Creek (modern Baytown), and other communities. Houston in particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors. Galveston became even more tourism-focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche. Still, in the first two decades after the 1900 storm, the city's economy struggled to recover.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Oil</b> <b>well</b> tubing {{is used in}} oil {{extraction}} in offshore <b>oil</b> <b>well.</b> Under the force of tubular columns, erosion and pressure of drilling fluids, the <b>oil</b> <b>well</b> tubing usually fails in long-term service, which always leads to accidents and stagnation of production. So it’s especially necessary to detect faults in tubing. Intense-magnetic memory testing equipment for reusable offshore <b>oil</b> <b>well</b> tubing is developed for this consideration. The equipment is composed of feeding machines, baiting machines, transport machines and a detection machine. Measurement and control system decides the running sequence logic of these components and obtains fault signals of tubing. The avoidance of transport machines for <b>oil</b> <b>well</b> tubing coupling makes the transport of tubing stable. The synchronization control of transport and detection of tubing decides the accurate location of faults. The automatic switch of both detection units and measurement of fault signals makes it convenient to detect <b>oil</b> <b>well</b> tubing of multiple sizes...|$|R

Domestically, Brooke established the Sarawak Museum – the oldest museum in Borneo – in 1891, and brokered a peace in Marudi by ending intertribal wars there. Economic development continued, with <b>oil</b> <b>wells</b> drilling from 1910 and the Brooke Dockyard opening two years later.

5|$|Neutron {{penetration}} into materials makes californium {{useful in}} detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in <b>oil</b> <b>wells,</b> as a portable neutron source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century salt {{evaporation}} ponds were dug in tidal marshes {{around the}} bay, producing salt for condiments {{and to be}} used as a preservative for meats. Today, due to the bay's location, east of Goose Island State Park and west of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, very little industry can be found. No industrial plants are located on the bay's shore, but a few gas and <b>oil</b> <b>wells</b> are present. The Continental Oil Company is allowed to obtain oil and gas from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge as part of the purchase of St. Charles Ranch. Goose Island offers a few piers and campgrounds facing the bay, which encourage tourism. The privately owned St. Charles Bay Hunting Club is also found in this area, and allows hunting, boating and fishing on the bay, while striving to protect the ecosystem. The lack of coastal winds also attracts tourists interested in kayaking and wadefishing, however, boating is hindered by the general shallowness of the bay and the abundance of oyster reefs. Shellfish production is approved throughout the bay, but shrimping is prohibited due to the classification of St. Charles Bay as a nursery bay.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to design and build a DC to DC power converter that can operate in an <b>oil</b> <b>well,</b> while the <b>oil</b> <b>well</b> is being drilled.

This new procedure is called the No Drilling Surprise (NDS); the NDS consists of three phases. The first phase is a pre drill plan, the second phase is monitoring the drilling operation, and the third is reviewing and reporting on how the drilling process could have been improved. The problem with implementing the NDS procedure is that the onsite engineers have no way of receiving “real time data ” from the <b>oil</b> <b>well</b> to assess potential surprises sooner. Without the “real time data ” from the <b>oil</b> <b>well</b> the chances of surprises are very high, thus raising the cost of drilling the <b>oil</b> <b>well.</b> 1. 3 Methods Due to the extreme conditions that the power converter will be exposed to,...|$|R

Natural gas was discovered at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics Corp, which contribute to the local economies. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, it is not as prominent {{as it was in the}} 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world.|$|E
