Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments.

5|$|By the 1980s, protein {{sequencing}} had already transformed methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists {{soon began to}} use RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded the significance of molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular systematics could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology. Following the pioneering ideas of Lynn Margulis on endosymbiotic theory, which holds {{that some of the}} organelles of eukaryotic cells originated from free living prokaryotic organisms through symbiotic relationships, even the overall division of the tree <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's pioneering molecular systematics work with 16S rRNA sequencing.|$|E
5|$|Cuba was {{of special}} {{importance}} to Southern Democrats, who believed their {{economic and political}} interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union. The existence of slavery in Cuba, the island's plantation economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders, whose way <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> under fire from Northern abolitionists. Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the population-based House of Representatives, Southern politicians sought to maintain the fragile {{balance of power in}} the Senate, where each state received equal representation. As slavery-free Western states were admitted, Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state. If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state, the island would have sent two senators and up to nine representatives to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Daman {{did most}} of its damages on Cikobia island, which has a {{population}} of around 120.

Despite initial fears of there being some fatalities on Cikobia, no loss <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> recorded due to the storm. This was because the islands 120 residents had evacuated to caves on Cikobia.

The nurse has {{a significant role in}} the care of the patient and in his/her experience <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Aim The purpose of this study is to examine the quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> from a nurse perspective. Method The text analysis was carried out with qualified attempts, of a book, "Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> a challenge for the nurse" (in Swedish) by T. Rustoen, a nurse who also worked as a teacher in Norway. The book describes how quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> experienced from the patients and staffs view. Results The text analysis showed that out of the ordinary descriptions <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> the author found four new themes. These themes where; the meaning of solidarity, confidence, activity and meaningfulness in the existence. Conclusion Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> an important word, which means different to different kind of people. For people in common, quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> usually means: happiness, harmony and comfort, but as been showed includes more.

5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E

5|$|Knowledge of {{the fossil}} record {{continued}} to advance rapidly {{during the first few}} decades of the 19th century. By the 1840s, the outlines of the geologic timescale were becoming clear, and in 1841 John Phillips named three major eras, based on the predominant fauna of each: the Paleozoic, dominated by marine invertebrates and fish, the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles, and the current Cenozoic age of mammals. This progressive picture of the history <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> accepted even by conservative English geologists like Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland; however, like Cuvier, they attributed the progression to repeated catastrophic episodes of extinction followed by new episodes of creation. Unlike Cuvier, Buckland and some other advocates of natural theology among British geologists made efforts to explicitly link the last catastrophic episode proposed by Cuvier to the biblical flood.|$|E
