Javagal Srinath scalped six wickets in the fourth innings of the match.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an education framework to effectively develop crucial software engineering skills in {{students of the}} Telematics/Network Engineering curriculum at the Klagenfurt University of Applied Sciences. In order to establish such abilities we first lay a rather traditional lecture/lab-based foundation. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>grounds,</b> a carefully designed project-centered approach bridges the gap between dry knowledge and lively experience. This scheme has been in use {{for the past three}} years and proved to be not only efficient and effective but also quite rewarding for both students and instructors. Starting with the overall constraints posed by the curriculum and our educational objectives, this paper discusses important characteristics of projects as well as processes, central issues and relevant lessons learned...|$|R
