However in many legal systems, elements incorporated in a building such as the facade or the roof, or equipment in a plant, are seen as fixtures and therefore {{considered to be a}} part of real estate. Therefore ensuring multi-cyclic behaviour within the so-called technical loop of CE is not evident.

Bridges over or under Network Rail infrastructure must be owned by organisations which can provide suitable legal liability to any incidents which may occur {{as a result of}} operations, which means to meet this requirement the owning organisation needs to have a minimum Net present value of over £250M. As the GCR can not clearly meet this criteria, after contract negotiations, it was agreed that Charnwood Borough Council will retain ownership of the land up to the southern abutment of the new bridge, whilst Network Rail will become the owner of the new bridge. The GCR will resultantly negotiate an <b>operational</b> <b>lease</b> agreement with Network Rail, which will define operational requirements which the GCR must comply with over the bridge.|$|R
