5|$|Anderson {{ordered his}} men not to harass {{the women on}} the train, but the guerrillas robbed all of the men, finding over $9,000 and taking the soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the {{captured}} Union soldiers to form a line and announced that he would keep <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> prisoner exchange, but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them not to put out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted of the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.|$|E

5|$|At Wisconsin, {{he was a}} four–year starter at cornerback. He {{finished}} his career with a recovered fumble and 12 interceptions, returning <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown. Before his junior season in 2000, he was suspended one game for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. After the season, he was given second–team All–Big Ten Conference honors. In 2002, after graduating from Wisconsin, he declared for the NFL Draft. He was drafted by the Titans and debuted later that season. However, after four weeks, he injured his leg and missed {{the rest of the}} season. The following season, he saw limited action before being released by the team in 2004. After his stint with the Titans ended, he spent time with the Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, and Detroit Lions, failing to appear in a game for any of the teams. In 2006, Echols played his final professional game for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL, intercepting a pass in his only game for the team.|$|E

5|$|Each group plays a {{round-robin}} tournament, {{in which}} each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that {{a total of six}} matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled {{at the same time to}} preserve fairness among all four teams. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).|$|E
5|$|In 1895 he {{designed}} a funerary chapel for the Güell {{family at the}} abbey of Montserrat, but {{little is known about}} this work, which was never built. That year, construction finally began on the Bodegas Güell, the 1882 project for a hunting lodge and some wineries at La Cuadra de Garraf (Sitges), property of Eusebi Güell. Constructed between 1895 and 1897 under the direction of Francesc Berenguer, Gaudí's aide, the wineries have a triangular end facade, a very steep stone roof, a group of chimneys and two bridges that join them to an older building. It has three floors: the bottom <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> garage, an apartment and a chapel with catenary arches, with the altar in the centre. It was completed with a porter's lodge, notable for the iron gate {{in the shape of a}} fishing net.|$|E
5|$|Like Compton, many U.S. {{officials}} and scientists {{argued that a}} demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied prisoners of war might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, only two bombs would be available {{at the start of}} August, although more were in production, and they cost billions of dollars, so using <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> demonstration would be expensive.|$|E

5|$|Most {{owners of}} the Book of the Dead were evidently {{part of the social}} elite; they were {{initially}} reserved for the royal family, but later papyri are found in the tombs of scribes, priests and officials. Most owners were men, and generally the vignettes included the owner's wife as well. Towards the beginning {{of the history of the}} Book of the Dead, there are roughly 10 copies belonging to men for every <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman. However, during the Third Intermediate Period, 2/3 were for women; and women owned roughly a third of the hieratic paypri from the Late and Ptolemaic Periods.|$|E
5|$|On graduating a year later, Ramage {{once again}} {{expressed}} {{a preference for}} a flying job, so he received command of Heavy Attack Wing One, which was based at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida. This wing consisted of the nuclear attack squadrons flying the A3D Skywarrior, detachments from which were posted to the aircraft carriers. The post was a senior <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> captain; Robert Goldthwaite had held the post {{while he was a}} rear admiral. Ramage had never flown the A3D before, so he started by becoming carrier qualified on it, which required eight carrier landings. To his surprise, he found that the aircraft was easy to fly, and he was successful at lifting the training level of the entire wing.|$|E
5|$|Since its return, {{the tournament}} has used an unusual point scoring system. As with most league competitions, three points are awarded for a win, <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> draw and zero for a loss. An {{additional}} point, however, is awarded for each goal scored. The {{system is designed}} to reward teams that adopt a more attacking style of play. Each entrant plays two matches, with the winner being the club that finishes {{at the top of}} the table. The original competition was held at De Meer, Ajax's home between 1934 and 1996. The Amsterdam Arena has played host to the event since its return.|$|E
25|$|The theatre was a hub of {{activity}} in Sakata during the early 1970s and welcomed many patrons; {{at the time it}} was one of five active cinemas in the city. It would often screen films while their Tokyo runs were still ongoing, which was a source of pride to the Sakata populace. In 1976 the harbour area around Minato-za burned to the ground, consuming Green House and two other competing cinemas. Minato-za, however, survived. The cinema soon had three screens of varying sizes: <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audience of 180, <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audience of 80, and <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audience of 30 people. Over the following decades a diversification in available entertainment venues, such as television and multiplex theatres with large parking lots, led to a decline in patronage. In 2002 the Sakata Minato-za, the last cinema in the city, was closed.|$|R
