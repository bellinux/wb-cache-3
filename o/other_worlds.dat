5|$|Ifs origins can {{be traced}} to 1948 and 1949, when Raymond Palmer founded two {{magazines}} while working at Ziff-Davis in Chicago: Fate and <b>Other</b> <b>Worlds.</b> Fate published articles about occult and supernatural events, while <b>Other</b> <b>Worlds</b> was a science-fiction magazine. The two were sufficiently successful to attract the notice of James L. Quinn, a New York publisher. When Ziff-Davis moved to New York City in late 1950, Paul W. Fairman, a prolific writer, went with them, and was soon in touch with Quinn, who decided to found a pair of magazines modelled after Palmer's. One was a nonfiction magazine entitled Strange; the other was If.|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of <b>Other</b> <b>Worlds</b> but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The spine also changed from a colored spine with pale lettering, which was similar to the spine style used by <b>Other</b> <b>Worlds,</b> to a white spine with red or blue lettering.|$|E
5|$|Scattered {{throughout}} the castle are paintings and secret walls, which act as portals to <b>other</b> <b>worlds</b> where Bowser and his minions guard the Power Stars. After recovering {{most of the}} power stars and defeating Bowser's minions, Yoshi acquires keys that access {{other areas of the}} castle, where he finds Mario and his friends captured.|$|E

Therefore The Agency seeks to classify and remove any 'true' account about the <b>other</b> <b>world.</b> They are capable of erasing a person's memories.|$|R

5|$|As in {{previous}} games, the player assumes {{the role of}} the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to <b>other</b> <b>worlds</b> called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.|$|E
5|$|Each novel {{centers on}} the family of Atrus, a {{scientist}} and explorer who {{has the ability to}} write special books which serve as links to <b>other</b> <b>worlds,</b> known as Ages. This ability, known as the Art, was practiced extensively by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, who were only mentioned briefly in the original Myst game. The plot of each book reveals more of the Myst back-story and the workings of the D'ni.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the <b>other</b> <b>worlds</b> of the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as ambiguous. Whereas with planets such as Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets {{is seen as a}} good thing, Athshe is seen as changed for the worse both by the loggers and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones.|$|E

5|$|Mysts story {{concerns}} {{an explorer}} named Atrus {{who has the}} ability to write books which serve as links to <b>other</b> <b>worlds,</b> known as Ages. This practice of creating linking books was developed by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, whose society crumbled after being ravaged by disease. The player takes the role of an unnamed person referred to as the Stranger and assists Atrus by traveling to other Ages and solving puzzles. Over the course of the series Atrus writes a new Age for the D'ni survivors to live on, and players of the games set the course the civilization will follow.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Revelation ties up {{loose ends}} from the {{original}} Myst. The player is summoned by Atrus, a man who creates links to <b>other</b> <b>worlds</b> known as Ages by writing special linking books. Almost twenty years earlier, Atrus' two sons nearly destroyed all of his linking books and were imprisoned; Atrus now wishes to see if his sons' imprisonment has reformed them. The player ends up traveling to each brother's prison, {{in an effort to}} recover Atrus' daughter Yeesha from the brothers' plot.|$|E
5|$|The use of polyhedra {{to model}} heavenly bodies {{can be traced}} back to Plato, who in the Timaeus {{identified}} the regular dodecahedron with the shape of the heavens and its twelve faces with the constellations of the zodiac. Later, Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by the shapes of the five Platonic solids, nested within each other. Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra, and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and <b>other</b> <b>worlds.</b>|$|E

5|$|Vocalist Mark Lanegan, guitarist Gary Lee Conner, and bassist Van Conner formed Screaming Trees in 1985, soon signing to the {{independent}} label Velvetone Records and releasing the <b>Other</b> <b>Worlds</b> EP. The Screaming Trees' debut album, Clairvoyance, came out in 1986. The same year Screaming Trees signed with punk label SST Records and released the second full-length album, Even If and Especially When. The band would later release two more albums under SST Records, then signed with Epic Records in 1990. In 1991, the Screaming Trees released its first album for a major label, Uncle Anesthesia.|$|E
5|$|With Fate and <b>Other</b> <b>Worlds</b> launched, Palmer {{began to}} plan for a new magazine, to be called Imagination. Material {{for the first two}} issues had been {{assembled}} by mid-1950, but in the early summer Palmer fell down his basement stairs and was left paralyzed from the waist down. While he was hospitalized, much of the work of editing both <b>Other</b> <b>Worlds</b> and Imagination was done by Mahaffey, who coped well, despite her inexperience. An assistant, Marge Budwig Saunder, was hired to read the slush pile and help out. The magazine's first issue, dated October 1950 on a planned bi-monthly schedule, appeared on news stands 1 August 1950. However, in September that year, Ziff-Davis made the decision to move to New York from Chicago; Palmer promptly contacted William Hamling, {{who did not want to}} relocate and suggested that Hamling take over Imagination. Like Palmer, Hamling had made preparations to leave Ziff-Davis by establishing a separate publishing company, Greenleaf Publishing, and in November 1950 Hamling left Ziff-Davis and became Imaginations editor and publisher.|$|E
5|$|Development of Myst {{began in}} 1991. The game's {{creative}} team {{consisted of the}} Rand and Robyn, with help from sound designer Chris Brandkamp, 3D artist and animator Chuck Carter, Richard Watson, Bonnie McDowall, and Ryan Miller, who together made up Cyan, Inc. Myst {{was not only the}} largest collaboration Cyan had attempted at the time, but also took the longest to develop. Cyan took inspiration from games like Zork, Star Wars mythic universe, portals to <b>other</b> <b>worlds</b> like in C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia, and the mysterious islands of old literature like the works of Jules Verne. The game's name, as well as the overall solitary and mysterious atmosphere of the island, was inspired by the book The Mysterious Island by Verne.|$|E

5|$|The game {{includes}} numerous subplots which largely {{serve as}} {{means for the}} player to earn money. For example, the player can choose to locate and retrieve a stolen icon {{on behalf of a}} religious leader in exchange for a reward. Other methods to earn money include stripping the corpses of slain opponents for marketable items, killing wanted criminals to earn a reward, and attacking other vessels in space to pirate their cargo. Gameplay {{in the early stages of}} the game primarily involves activities of this nature so that the player can accumulate enough money to outfit the party with better weapons and armor and purchase a jump drive capable of propelling the party's spacecraft to <b>other</b> <b>worlds</b> crucial to obtaining the means to stop Kiefer.|$|E
5|$|When he recovers, {{he learns}} that, {{at the end}} of the bugger war, Earth's powers fought among themselves. He stays on Eros as his friends return home and colonists venture to <b>other</b> <b>worlds,</b> using Eros as a way station. Among the first colonists is Valentine, who apologizes that Ender can never return to Earth, where he would become {{dangerous}} as Peter and other politicians sought to exploit him for their own purposes. Instead, Ender joins the colony program to populate one of the buggers' former worlds. There, he discovers the dormant egg of a bugger queen, who reveals that the buggers had initially assumed humans were a non-sentient race, for want of collective consciousness, but realized their mistake too late, and requests that Ender take the egg to a new planet to colonize.|$|E
5|$|Converts were {{provided}} with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets. The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of <b>other</b> <b>worlds.</b> The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E

5|$|Saavedro is the {{antagonist}} of Exile. Depicted as a vengeful {{and broken}} man, Saavedro is an inhabitant of the Age of Narayan, {{one of the}} Ages chosen by Atrus to try to teach his sons Sirrus and Achenar about the Art of writing books linking to <b>other</b> <b>worlds.</b> Saavedro agrees to help tutor Atrus' sons, but is shocked when the brothers instigate a destructive rebellion and abandon the Age to be destroyed from within. When Saavedro pursues Sirrus and Achenar to the Age of J'nanin, he is assaulted and left for dead. Trapped on J'nanin and believing Narayan destroyed and his family to be dead, Saavedro's mental health deteriorates during his years of captivity. When Saavedro is unexpectedly freed and travels to Tomahna in hope of finding the brothers, he steals the linking book for Releeshahn in a plan to lure Atrus to Narayan and exact revenge. Once on Narayan, Saavedro discovers that his people have not been destroyed. Cornered by the Stranger, Saavedro gives up the Releeshahn book. In the game's optimal ending, the player enables Saavedro to peacefully return to Narayan, before taking Releeshahn back to Atrus. Saavedro is portrayed by veteran actor Brad Dourif, who accepted the role of Saavedro {{because he was a}} Myst fan. Dourif said that his role for the game was much more difficult than working on movie sets, as he could not see the player he was addressing or interact with the game environment.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario 64 {{is set in}} Princess Peach's Castle, which {{consists}} of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory {{area in which the}} player can experiment, testing his or her player skills. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses via secret walls and paintings. Super Mario 64 begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to <b>other</b> <b>worlds,</b> in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.|$|E
5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but they will need others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore <b>other</b> <b>worlds</b> and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating the forces of evil, Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy remembers being born in a place of light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of the future. The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that the future ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save the future, the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates the future worlds that the players travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected the future into their era to grow more powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from the future is manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E
