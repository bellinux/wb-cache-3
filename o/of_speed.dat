40|$|Abstract—Speeding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} contributing factors in traffic crashes. The prediction <b>of</b> <b>speeding</b> is important for reducing excessive speeds and preventing speeding-related traffic accidents and injuries. Speeding (either intentional or unintentional) is a consequence <b>of</b> inappropriate <b>speed</b> control. This work extends a previous mathematical model <b>of</b> driver <b>speed</b> control to provide quantitative predictions of intentional and unintentional speeding. These predictions consist of the time at which the driver exceeds the speed limit and the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>speeding.</b> Based on these modeling predictions, this work develops an intelligent speeding prediction system (ISPS) to prevent the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>speeding.</b> An experimental study using a driving simulator is conducted to evaluate ISPS. We find no significant difference between modeled predictions and experimental results in terms of the time and magnitude <b>of</b> intentional <b>speeding.</b> Also, ISPS can successfully predict the majority <b>of</b> unintentional <b>speeding</b> instances, with only a small portion <b>of</b> unnecessary <b>speeding</b> warnings (false alarms). Applications of the ISPS to reducing driving speed, and preventing the real-time occurrence <b>of</b> <b>speeding</b> and speeding-related traffic accidents are discussed.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{overlooked}} dimension of time judgments, namely subjective judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage: how fast time is judged as passing. It has examined how people make judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage and what factors influence people’s judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage. Chapter 2 first unravels the cognitive processes that underlie judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage: the more {{attention is paid}} to non-temporal information, the faster time is judged as passing; it also disentangles judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage from duration judgments (i. e., judgments about how long time lasted), demonstrating that it is not reliable to infer judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage from duration judgments. Chapter 3 builds upon the previous chapter and examines two factors: presentation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> stimuli and comparison, which might interfere with the role of attentional processes in judging the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage. It shows that both presentation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> stimuli and comparison could influence people’s judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage, but they could not replace the role of attentional processes: when either presentation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> stimuli or comparison is missing, people can always rely on attentional processes to make judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage. Chapter 4 examines the influence of unpredictability on people’s judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage. It shows that time is judged as passing faster when people are in both temporal unpredictable situations where they cannot predict when the events would happen, and in content unpredictable situations where they cannot predict what events would happen next. Chapter 5 examines the influence of spatial directions of movements on judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage. It shows the effect that people judge time as passing faster for the left-to-right movements than the right-to-left movements. This effect was also replicated with Farsi speakers. Overall, the work in this thesis shows original empirical evidence about how people make judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage; specifically, it discloses the underlying mechanism of judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage (i. e., attentional processes) as well as the factors that influence people’s judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage such as presentation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> stimuli, comparison, unpredictability and spatial directions of movements...|$|R

5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts <b>of</b> <b>speed.</b> The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E

5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – {{the difference between}} the expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by Doppler shifts as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine the aircraft's speed and heading, but multiple combinations <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> and heading can be valid solutions.|$|E
