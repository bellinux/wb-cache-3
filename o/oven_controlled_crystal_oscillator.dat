5000|$|The {{accuracy}} of a frequency counter is strongly {{dependent on the}} stability of its timebase. A timebase is very delicate like the hands of a watch, and can be changed by movement, interference, or even drift due to age, meaning it might not [...] "tick" [...] correctly. This can make a frequency reading, when referenced to the timebase, seem higher or lower than the actual value. Highly accurate circuits are used to generate timebases for instrumentation purposes, usually using a quartz crystal oscillator within a sealed temperature-controlled chamber, known as an <b>oven</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> or crystal oven.|$|E
5000|$|Amongst the {{building}} blocks of a GPS Time and Frequency solution the oscillator is a key component and typically they are built around an <b>Oven</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Crystal</b> <b>Oscillator</b> (OCXO) or a Rubidium based clock. The dominant factors influencing the quality of the reference oscillator are taken to be aging and temperature stability. However, depending upon the construction of the oscillator, barometric pressure and relative humidity can have at least as strong an influence on the stability of the quartz oscillator. What {{is often referred to as}} [...] "random walk" [...] instability is actually a deterministic effect of environmental parameters. These can be measured and modeled to vastly improve the performance of quartz oscillators. An addition of a Microprocessor to the reference oscillator can improve temperature stability and aging performance During Holdover any remaining clock error caused by aging and temperature instability can be corrected by control mechanisms. A combination of quartz based reference oscillator (such as an OCXO) and modern correction algorithms can get good results in Holdover applications.|$|E

An integrated space-qualified system will be specifically designed using a dedicated integrated circuit implementing time-to-digital conversion (TDC). A short-term stability of the TDC oscillator of 0.1  ppb (10 − 10) is required, corresponding to a measurement precision of about 10 ps for an average time between photon arrivals that could be as long as roughly 100  ms (10  cps). This can be achieved using an <b>oven</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> (see, e.g., [47]) or miniature atomic clock (such as, e.g., the model Quantum SA 45.s by MicroSemi [48]).
