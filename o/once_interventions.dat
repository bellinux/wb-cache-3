40|$|This paper: i) {{estimates}} {{the effect that}} going to a better school has on students' academic achievement, and ii) explores whether this intervention induces behavioral responses {{on the part of}} children, their parents, and the school system. For the first task, we exploit almost 2, 000 regression discontinuity quasi-experiments observed in the context of Romania's high school educational system. For the second, we use data from a specialized survey of children, parents, teachers and principals that we implemented in 59 Romanian towns. The first finding is that students do benefit from access to higher achieving schools and tracks within schools. A second set of results suggests that the stratification of schools by quality in general, and the opportunity to attend a better school in particular, result in significant behavioral responses on the part of teachers, parents, and students. Although we do not expect the magnitude or even the direction of these responses to hold everywhere, their existence has a number of implications for evaluation, particularly since some of them change over time, and some would seem to be relevant only <b>once</b> <b>interventions</b> reach a certain scale. ...|$|E

Design Retrospective, cross-sectional study. Setting Hospital clinic. Participants Ninety-seven participants (49 boys, 48 girls; mean age 1 standard deviation, 9. 1114. 8 y) with spastic diplegia CP were tested <b>once.</b> <b>Interventions</b> Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures A KinCom dynamometer was used to objectively measure spasticity (ankle plantarflexors, knee flexors, hip adductors) and maximum strength (ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors, knee flexors and extensors, hip abductors and adductors). A gait analysis was conducted to evaluate linear variables (gait speed, stride length, cadence) and kinematic variables (ankle dorsiflexion, foot progression, knee and hip flexion, pelvic tilt at initial contact and ankle dorsiflexion, knee and hip flexion, pelvic tilt, trunk rotation range of motion) during gait. Gross motor function was measured using the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM- 66) and separately, the GMFM walking, running & jumping dimension. Multiple linear regression {{analysis was used to}} {{determine the}} relationships between spasticity, strength, gait, and the GMFM (P<. 05).

40|$|Background: Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MetS) significantly {{increases the}} risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Being physically active and eating a healthy diet can reduce MetS risk factors. Too frequently, however, studies report that the effects of interventions targeting those factors are not maintained <b>once</b> <b>interventions</b> are withdrawn. A potential solution to the problem is targeting behavioral automaticity (habit-development) to aid in initiation and maintenance of health-behavior changes. The Pick two to Stick To (P 2 S 2), is an 8 -week, theory-based hybrid (face-to-face/telecoaching) habit focused lifestyle intervention designed to increase healthful physical activity and dietary behavioral automaticity. The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe the rationale and protocol for evaluating the P 2 S 2 program's feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness. Methods: Using a prospective, non-comparative design, the P 2 S 2 program will be implemented by trained occupational therapy ‘coaches’ to 40 African Americans aged 40 and above with MetS recruited from the emergency department. Semi-structured interviews with participants, bi-weekly research meetings with study staff, and observations of intervention delivery will provide data for a process evaluation. Estimates of effectiveness include weight, blood pressure, waist circumference, BMI, and behavioral automaticity measures that will be collected at baseline and week 20. Conclusion: The P 2 S 2 program could facilitate the development of healthful dietary and physical activity habits in an underserved population. Whether interventions aimed at changing habits can feasibly influence this automaticity, particularly for high-risk, low resource communities where other barriers exist, is not known. This pilot study, therefore, will fill an important gap, providing insight to inform subsequent trials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{abundance}} of water {{has certainly been}} a very important resource {{for the development of}} the Po Valley and has necessitated, more than <b>once,</b> <b>interventions</b> of regulation and drainage that have contributed strongly to imprint a particular conformation on the land. Already in Roman times there were numerous projects of canalisation and intense and diligent commitment to the maintenance of the canals, used for navigation, for irrigation and for the working of the mills. The need to control the excessive amount of water present was the beginning of the exploitation of this great font of rich-ness that was constantly maintained in subsequent eras. In the early Middle Ages, despite the condi-tions of political instability and great economic and social difficulty, the function of the canals con-tinued to be of great importance, also because the paths of river communication often substituted land roads, then left abandoned. After the 11 th century A. D. the resumption of agricultural activity was conducive to the intense task of land reclamation of the Lombardian countryside and of commitment by the cities to amplify their waterways with the construction of new canals and the improvement of those already existing. The example given by Milan, a city lacking a natural river, that equipped itself with a dense network of canal, used in various ambits of the city life (defence, hygiene, agriculture, transport, milling systems) and for connections with the surrounding territory, can be considered as emblematic. In the surrounding countryside, the activity of the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle repre-sents one of the situations more indicative of how land reclamation and waterways contributed fun-damentally to the organisation of the territory over the span of the ages...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Psychosocial and {{rehabilitation}} interventions are increasingly used to attenuate disability and improve health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQL) in chronic diseases, but are typically not available for patients with rare diseases. Conducting rigorous, adequately powered trials of these interventions for patients with rare diseases is difficult. The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) is an international collaboration of patient organisations, clinicians and researchers. The aim of SPIN {{is to develop a}} research infrastructure to test accessible, low-cost self-guided online interventions to reduce disability and improve HRQL for people living with the rare disease systemic sclerosis (SSc or scleroderma). Once tested, effective interventions will be made accessible through patient organisations partnering with SPIN. Methods and analysis: SPIN will employ the cohort multiple randomised controlled trial (cmRCT) design, in which patients consent to participate in a cohort for ongoing data collection. The aim is to recruit 1500 - 2000 patients from centres across the world within a period of 5 years (2013 - 2018). Eligible participants are persons ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of SSc. In addition to baseline medical data, participants will complete patient-reported outcome measures every 3 months. Upon enrolment in the cohort, patients will consent to be contacted in the future to participate in intervention research and to allow their data to be used for comparison purposes for interventions tested with other cohort participants. <b>Once</b> <b>interventions</b> are developed, patients from the cohort will be randomly selected and offered interventions as part of pragmatic RCTs. Outcomes from patients offered interventions will be compared with outcomes from trial-eligible patients who are not offered the interventions. Ethics and dissemination: The use of the cmRCT design, the development of self-guided online interventions and partnerships with patient organisations will allow SPIN to develop, rigourously test and effectively disseminate psychosocial {{and rehabilitation}} interventions for people with SSc...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{an intervention}} {{for people with}} aphasia delivered in a novel virtual reality platform called EVA Park. EVA Park contains a number of functional and fantastic locations and allows for interactive communication between multiple users. Twenty people with aphasia had 5 weeks' intervention, during which they received daily language stimulation sessions in EVA Park from a support worker. The study employed a quasi randomised design, which compared a group that received immediate intervention with a waitlist control group. Outcome measures explored the effects of intervention on communication and language skills, communicative confidence and feelings of social isolation. Compliance with the intervention was also explored through attrition and usage data. There was excellent compliance with the intervention, with no participants lost to follow up and most (18 / 20) receiving at least 88 % of the intended treatment dose. Intervention brought about significant gains on a measure of functional communication.

40|$|Aim To {{determine}} whether, in {{an impoverished}} South African community, an intervention that benefitted infant attachment also benefitted cognitive development. Method Pregnant women were randomized to intervention (220) and no treatment control groups (229). The intervention was home-based parenting support for attachment, delivered until six months postpartum. At 18 months, infants were assessed on attachment 6, and cognitive development (Bayley MDI) (127 intervention, 136 control). Infant MDI was examined {{in relation to}} intervention, socio-economic risk, antenatal depression, and infant sex and attachment. Results Overall, there was little effect of the intervention on MDI (p=. 094, d= 0. 20), {{but there was an}} interaction between intervention and risk (p=. 03, ŋp 2 =. 02) : MDI scores of infants of lower risk intervention group mothers were, on average, 4 · 84 points higher than those of other infants (p=. 002, d=. 41). Antenatal depression was not significant <b>once</b> <b>intervention</b> and risk were controlled (p=. 08); there was no association between infant MDI and either sex (p =. 41) or attachment (p=. 56). Conclusion Parenting interventions for infant cognitive development may benefit from inclusion of specific components to support infant cognition, beyond those that support attachment, and may be most effective for infants over six months.

40|$|Disabled {{patients}} with chronic respiratory disease and peripheral skeletal muscle disorders have limitations in their exercise capacity, which may be improved after specific training in a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Individual assessment of exercise capacity by clinically available exercise tests represents an important patient-centered outcome that should be embedded in the rehabilitation process. These measurements include laboratory (treadmill and/or cycle ergometer) and field (walking) tests. The cardiopulmonary exercise test, both performed with incremental (incremental-load test) or predetermined (constant-load or endurance test) loading, is an excellent means to describe the profile of an individual's maximal exercise capacity and to record its change after PR. Among the variety of field-based tests, 6 -min walking and shuttle walking are 2 simple tests widely used during PR. These tests are inexpensive and provide information on an individual's functional abilities: the 6 -min walking test {{has been shown to}} provide level of disability and functional status, whereas the shuttle walking test {{has been shown to be}} more suitable to detect change of physical performance following PR. Overall, several available physiologically targeted tests are useful to measure the patient's tolerance to exercise, and many are even sensitive to change <b>once</b> <b>intervention</b> has taken place. In particular, endurance modality tests seem to provide better measurement of changes after PR than incremental exercise tests...|$|R
