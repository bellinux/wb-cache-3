5000|$|<b>Orthorexia</b> nervosa [...] (also {{known as}} <b>orthorexia)</b> is a {{proposed}} eating disorder {{characterized by an}} excessive preoccupation with eating healthy food. The term was introduced in 1997 by American physician Steven Bratman, M.D. He suggested that some people's dietary restrictions intended to promote health may paradoxically lead to unhealthy consequences, such as social isolation, anxiety, loss of ability to eat in a natural, intuitive manner, reduced interest in {{the full range of}} other healthy human activities, and, in rare cases, severe malnutrition or even death.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Orthorexia</b> nervosa, a {{term used}} by Steven Bratman to {{characterize}} {{an obsession with}} a [...] "pure" [...] diet, in which people develop an obsession with avoiding unhealthy foods {{to the point where}} it interferes with a person's life.|$|E
50|$|A {{diagnostic}} questionnaire {{has been}} developed for <b>orthorexia</b> sufferers, similar to questionnaires for other eating disorders, named the ORTO-15.

5000|$|In 2015, {{responding}} to news articles {{in which the}} term <b>orthorexia</b> is applied to people who merely follow a non-mainstream theory of healthy eating, Bratman specified the following: [...] "A theory may be conventional or unconventional, extreme or lax, sensible or totally wacky, but, regardless of the details, followers of the theory do not necessarily have <b>orthorexia.</b> They are simply adherents of a dietary theory. The term 'orthorexia' only applies when an eating disorder develops around that theory." [...] Bratman elsewhere clarifies that with a few exceptions, most common theories of healthy eating are followed safely {{by the majority of}} their adherents; however, [...] "for some people, going down the path of a restrictive diet in search of health may escalate into dietary perfectionism." [...] Karin Kratina, PhD, writing for the National Eating Disorders Association, summarizes this process as follows: [...] "Eventually food choices become so restrictive, in both variety and calories, that health suffers - an ironic twist for a person so completely dedicated to healthy eating." ...|$|E
50|$|Although <b>orthorexia</b> is not {{recognized}} as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, {{and it is not}} listed in the DSM-5, as of January 2016, four case reports and more than 40 other articles on the subject have been published in a variety of peer-reviewed journals internationally. According to a study published in 2011, two-thirds of a sample of 111 Dutch-speaking eating disorder specialists felt they had observed the syndrome in their clinical practice.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Ursula Philpot, {{chair of}} the British Dietetic Association and senior {{lecturer}} at Leeds Metropolitan University, described people with <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa as being [...] "solely concerned {{with the quality of}} the food they put in their bodies, refining and restricting their diets according to their personal understanding of which foods are truly 'pure'." [...] This differs from other eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, where those affected focus on the quantity of food eaten.|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms of <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa include [...] "obsessive {{focus on}} food choice, planning, purchase, preparation, and consumption; food {{regarded}} primarily as source of health rather than pleasure; distress or disgust when in proximity to prohibited foods; exaggerated faith that inclusion or elimination of particular kinds of food can prevent or cure disease or affect daily well-being; periodic shifts in dietary beliefs while other processes persist unchanged; moral judgment of others based on dietary choices; body image distortion around sense of physical [...] "impurity" [...] rather than weight; persistent belief that dietary practices are health-promoting despite evidence of malnutrition.".|$|E
5000|$|In a 1997 {{article in}} the {{magazine}} Yoga Journal, the American physician Steven Bratman coined the term [...] "orthorexia nervosa" [...] from the Greek ορθο- (ortho, [...] "right" [...] or [...] "correct"), and όρεξις (orexis, [...] "appetite"), literally meaning 'correct appetite', but in practice meaning 'correct diet'. The term is modeled on anorexia, literally meaning [...] "without appetite", as used {{in the definition of}} the condition anorexia nervosa. (In both terms, [...] "nervosa" [...] indicates an unhealthy psychological state.) Bratman described <b>orthorexia</b> as an unhealthy fixation with what the individual considers to be healthy eating. Beliefs about what constitutes healthy eating commonly originate in one or another dietary theory such as raw foods veganism or macrobiotics, but are then taken to extremes, leading to disordered eating patterns and psychological and/or physical impairment. Bratman based this proposed condition on his personal experiences in the 1970s, as well as behaviors he observed among his patients in the 1990s. In 2000, Bratman, with David Knight, authored the book Health Food Junkies, which further expanded on the subject.|$|E
50|$|Although fruits {{provide a}} source of {{carbohydrates}}, they have very little protein, and because protein cannot be stored in the body as fat and carbohydrates can, fruitarians {{need to be careful}} that they consume enough protein each day. When the body does not take in enough protein, it misses out on amino acids, which are essential to making body proteins which support the growth and maintenance of body tissues. Consuming high levels of fruit also poses a risk to those who are diabetic or pre-diabetic, due to the negative effect that the large amounts of sugar in fruits has on blood sugar levels. These high levels of sugar means that fruitarians are at high risk for tooth decay. Another concern that fruitarianism presents is that because fruit is easily digested, the body burns through meals quickly, and is hungry again soon after eating. A side effect of the digestibility is that the body will defecate more frequently.Additionally, the Health Promotion Program at Columbia reports that food restrictions in general may lead to hunger, cravings, food obsessions, social disruptions, and social isolation. The severe dietary restrictions inherent in a fruitarian regime also carries the serious risk of triggering <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} and elucidated how <b>orthorexia</b> {{is framed}} in Swedish daily newspapers {{with a focus}} on characteristics of <b>orthorexia.</b> Key questions include: 1) how do the newspaper articles connect exercise with <b>orthorexia?</b> and 2) what trends in depicting exercise in relation to <b>orthorexia</b> do the newspaper articles represent over time? The method used was a longitudinal qualitative content analysis guided by the framing theory. We analyzed 166 articles published between 1998 and 2013. Our analysis revealed that <b>orthorexia</b> originally was framed as an eating disorder and subsequently included unhealthy exercise. Two trend shifts could be identified: in 2004, exercise was added as an element and in 2013 extreme exercise trends were described to influence the increase of <b>orthorexia.</b> The findings indicate that Swedish newspapers extend Bratman’s definition and depict <b>orthorexia</b> indiscriminately to describe a range of different behavioral characteristics.

40|$|Bratman first {{proposed}} <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa {{in the late}} 1990 s, defining it an obsession with eating healthy food to achieve, for instance, improved health.

The overall aim {{of this study was to}} provide an overview and synthesis of what philosophies of science approaches form the current academic framework of <b>orthorexia.</b> Key questions were: What aspects of food and eating are related to <b>orthorexia?</b> What role do exercise and sports play in relation to <b>orthorexia?</b> In what ways are <b>orthorexia</b> contextualized? Consequently, the concept of healthism was used to discuss and contextualize <b>orthorexia.</b> The method used was an integrative literature review; the material covered 19 empirical and theoretical articles published in peer-reviewed journals.

The majority of the articles followed an empirical-atomistic approach that focused on <b>orthorexia</b> as an individual issue, which was discussed using healthism. Our analysis indicates a need for (a) more empirical-holistic research that applies interpretive qualitative methods and uses a social perspective of health, e. g., healthism and (b) examining the role of sports and exercise in relation to <b>orthorexia</b> that takes the problematizing of “orthorexic behaviours” within the sports context into account...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{my study}} was to examine how <b>orthorexia</b> is {{constructed}} in the Swedish tabloids. The main question examined was in what way the Swedish tabloids contributes to define <b>orthorexia</b> as a social problem. But in order to answer this I also had to make up a couple of smaller questions which was; what in the texts helps to understand <b>orthorexia</b> as something dangerous and something that poses a health risk, what in the texts produces <b>orthorexia</b> as a new and growing eating disorder and which stereotypes are to be found of the ones that are sick.   Using a discourse analysis of six news articles from the two biggest tabloids in Sweden, showed three different themes; the new and dangerous disease, a problem and stereotypes. By using the framing theory two various frames of <b>orthorexia</b> was found. These were a new type of eating disorder that framed <b>orthorexia</b> as a quite unknown disorder and which to begin with was questioned as an eating disorder and said just to be a trend. But also when healthy become unhealthy that framed <b>orthorexia</b> as a dangerous disorder that in the most extreme cases could lead to death. <b>Orthorexia</b> is in this frame descried as something wrong. Using the framing theory three different stereotypes showed. These were; the trendorthorectic, the elite athlete who became ill and the one with the thought full of obsessions. The first of the three stereotypes is the most modern and takes healthy to its most extreme. The second one is driven by a hang-up on the well-trained body that it ones had. And finally, the third one is the stereotype that best matches how the tabloids frame <b>orthorexia.</b> It also the most of extreme of the three stereotypes. Unlike the other stereotypes this one is driven by obsessive thoughts about both health, exercise and food.   My study shows that <b>orthorexia</b> is defined as when something healthy become unhealthy and is framed as something both dangerous and wrong in the Swedish tabloids.

40|$|Nancy S Koven, Alexandra W Abry Department of Psychology, Bates College, Lewiston, ME, USA Abstract: <b>Orthorexia</b> nervosa {{describes}} a pathological obsession with proper nutrition that {{is characterized by}} a restrictive diet, ritualized patterns of eating, and rigid avoidance of foods believed to be unhealthy or impure. Although prompted by a desire to achieve optimum health, <b>orthorexia</b> may lead to nutritional deficiencies, medical complications, and poor quality of life. Despite its being a distinct behavioral pattern that is frequently observed by clinicians, <b>orthorexia</b> has received very little empirical attention and is not yet formally recognized as a psychiatric disorder. In this review, we synthesize existing research to identify what is known about the symptoms, prevalence, neuropsychological profile, and treatment of <b>orthorexia.</b> An examination of diagnostic boundaries reveals important points of symptom overlap between <b>orthorexia</b> and anorexia nervosa, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and psychotic spectrum disorders. Neuropsychological data suggest that orthorexic symptoms are independently associated with key facets of executive dysfunction for which some of these conditions already overlap. Discussion of cognitive weaknesses in set-shifting, external attention, and working memory highlights the value of continued research to identify intermediate, transdiagnostic endophenotypes for insight into the neuropathogenesis of <b>orthorexia.</b> An evaluation of current <b>orthorexia</b> measures indicates a need for further psychometric development to ensure that subsequent research has access to reliable and valid assessment tools. Optimized assessment will not only permit a clearer understanding of prevalence rates, psychosocial risk factors, and comorbid psychopathology but will also be needed to index intervention effectiveness. Though the field lacks data on therapeutic outcomes, current best practices suggest that <b>orthorexia</b> can successfully be treated with a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, and medication.

40|$|Background: <b>Orthorexia</b> is a {{behavioral}} disorder characterized by healthy food fixation (Bratman & Knight, 2000). Researchers {{suggest that the}} difference between eating disorders and <b>orthorexia</b> is that orthorexics are more concerned about their health status and may not be concerned about their body image or body weight (Ramaciotti et al., 2011) The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the prevalence of <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa in Lebanese university students and to study the associations between <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa and body image, body weight and physical activity. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on 320 randomly selected students from the Lebanese University, branch III. Data was collected through a questionnaire that includes three sections: the ORTO- 15 questionnaire, Multidimensional body self relations questionnaire (MBSRQ) and a personal history section. A comparative study was conducted to compare MBSRQ scores between orthorexics and non orthorexics.

Karolína Janečková DEPARTMENT: Pedagogy department SUPERVISOR: PaedDr. Eva Marádová, CSc. ABSTRACT: The topic of my dissertation is <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa, one of the modern eating disorders, {{and the impact of}} a Czech school on its development. The aim of this dissertation is to identify what knowledge about <b>orthorexia</b> issues the secondary medical school students have, what is their opinion on eating disorders, and to suggest a sample lesson focusing on this problem. To prove this fact, a quantitative research through a questionnaire has been used. This research was implemented in selected secondary medical schools and grammar schools. The results clearly indicate that students do not have sufficient knowledge about <b>orthorexia</b> and that the difference in the knowledge of medical students at secondary schools and grammar schools is negligible, although the composition of their diet is more concerned with secondary medical school students. In view of the fact of these and other findings, a draft of a sample lesson focusing on the issue of eating disorders and <b>orthorexia</b> has been developed.

40|$|<b>Orthorexia</b> nervosa is {{described}} as an exaggerated fixation on healthy food. It is unclear whether students in health-oriented academic programs, highly focused on physical exercise, {{are more prone to}} develop <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa than students in other educational areas. The aim was to compare health status, physical activity, and frequency of <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa between university students enrolled in an exercise science program (n = 118) or a business program (n = 89). The students completed the Short Form- 36 Health Survey (SF- 36), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and ORTO- 15, which defines <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa as a sensitive and obsessive behavior towards healthy nutrition. The SF- 36 showed that exercise science students scored worse than business students regarding bodily pain (72. 8 vs. 82. 5; p = 0. 001), but better regarding general health (83. 1 vs. 77. 1; p = 0. 006). Of 188 students, 144 (76. 6 %) had an ORTO- 15 score indicating <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa, with a higher proportion in exercise science students than in business students (84. 5 % vs. 65. 4 %; p = 0. 002). <b>Orthorexia</b> nervosa in combination {{with a high level of}} physical activity was most often seen in men in exercise science studies and less often in women in business studies (45. 1 % vs. 8. 3 %; p < 0. 000).

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether perfectionism, body image, attachment style, and self-esteem are predictors of <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa. Methods: A cohort of 220 participants completed a self-administered, online questionnaire consisting of five measures: ORTO- 15, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire- Appearance Scale (MBSRQ-AS), the Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Results: Correlation analysis revealed that higher orthorexic tendencies significantly correlated with higher scores for perfectionism [self-oriented, others-oriented and socially prescribed], appearance orientation, overweight preoccupation, self-classified weight, and fearful and dismissing attachment styles. Higher orthorexic tendencies also correlated with lower scores for body areas satisfaction and a secure attachment style. There was no significant correlation between <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa and self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation and the presence of an eating disorder history were significant predictors of <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa. Conclusions: <b>Orthorexia</b> nervosa shares similarities with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa with regards to perfectionism, body image attitudes, and attachment style. In addition, a history of an eating disorder strongly predicts <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa. These findings suggest that these disorders might be on the same spectrum of disordered eating...|$|E
40|$|<b>Orthorexia</b> nervosa was termed by the physician, Bratman, in {{the late}} 1990 s. He defined it as an {{unhealthy}} obsession with eating healthy food to achieve ‘optimal’ health. The term has since received attention in science and media, including in Sweden. Yet, <b>orthorexia</b> remains under establishment, as many symptoms, explanations and behaviors are being related to it. This thesis builds on four articles that create understanding of the term and phenomenon. The overall aim is to elucidate, explore and problematize how <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa is described, understood and reported. The thesis follows a sequential mixed method design. The empirical data consist of survey responses from 251 fitness participants, research findings from 19 empirical and theoretical scientific articles, newspaper texts from 166 Swedish daily newspaper articles, and responses provided by 14 personal trainers (PTs) in five focus group interviews. The findings demonstrate two versions of understanding <b>orthorexia.</b> The Swedish newspapers frame and PTs understand <b>orthorexia</b> to include excessive and obsessive approaches to food and eating, unhealthy and excessive exercise, and an extreme pursuit of a fit body. These characteristics create a Swedish popular version, which conflates <b>orthorexia</b> with exercise dependence and differs from Bratman’s definition. It further differs from scientific knowledge because this version does not include unhealthy and excessive exercise and does not provide consensus on corporeality. Indeed, the scientific knowledge remains limited and disparate. Nevertheless, both versions {{can be understood as}} a consequence of ‘aggressive healthism’...|$|E

Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess disordered eating, including <b>orthorexia</b> behaviors, in endurance athletes following GWDs compared to athletes following a normal diet (ND). Methods: Endurance athletes (ages 18 - 55 y) were invited to participate in a web-based questionnaire via multiple sporting websites. The survey included demographic information, questions regarding beliefs and attitudes about GWDs, and two validated disordered eating and <b>orthorexia</b> questionnaires: Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R 18) and the ORTO- 15. Athletes following GWDs were combined. Descriptive statistics and independent sample t-tests comparing groups using SPSS with significance set at p< 0. 05. Results: Of the athletes responding (n= 100), only 73 had usable data (63 females; 9 males; 1 transgender). One-third (37 %; n= 27) reported being on GWDs (clinically diagnosed gluten sensitivity (n= 10); celiac (n= 1)). ND’s were significantly older (44 + 11 y) than GWD (39 + 12 y, p= 0. 05). There were no differences between groups for self-reported body mass index (GWD= 22 + 3 vs. ND= 24 + 4 kg/m 2), <b>orthorexia</b> scores (GWD= 37. 1 + 6. 9 vs. ND= 39. 0 + 6. 3), and TFEQ subscale scores for emotional eating (GWD= 8. 2 + 2. 1 vs. ND= 8. 2 + 2. 2), dietary restraint (GWD= 14. 4 + 4. 1 vs. ND= 15. 8 + 3. 9) and uncontrolled eating (GWD= 24. 7 + 5. 3 vs. ND= 25. 1 + 4. 8). Athletes classified with <b>orthorexia</b> (75. 3 %; n= 55) had significantly lower TFEQ scores in restrained, emotional, and cognitive disordered eating than those not categorized as having <b>orthorexia</b> (24. 7 %; n= 18) (p< 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Orthorexia,</b> {{from the}} Greek words orthos (straight, proper) and orexis (appetite), is a newly {{conceptualized}} disorder characterized by distorted eating habits and cognitions concerning supposedly healthy nutrition. In {{this article we}} present preliminary results of a wider research aimed to investigate the diffusion of <b>Orthorexia</b> {{in the general population}} and to highlight its characteristics and particularly the relationship with Eating Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. METHOD: One-hundred and seventy seven adult subjects from the general population, were administered the ORTO- 15 test, a selfadministered questionnaire specifically designed to assess orthorexic symptomatology; note that statistical analyses were repeated twice, referring to different diagnostic thresholds (40 / 35). RESULTS: <b>Orthorexia</b> had a 57. 6 % prevalence in our sample, using the 40 -point threshold, with a female/male ratio 2 : 1; the figure was sensibly lower with the 35 -point threshold (21 %).

40|$|This {{project is}} about the eating {{disorder}} <b>orthorexia</b> nervosa, which was first described in 1996. It is an eating disorder characterized by an obsession or extreme fixation on righteous eating, in most cases regarding the quality of food. The aim of the project is both {{to find out what}} <b>orthorexia</b> is and the reasons for developing this eating disorder – the etiology. In this line we want to explore if the media and the focus on health in the Danish society {{have an impact on the}} development of <b>orthorexia.</b> Through theory and empirical evidence we have come to several conclusions. We found that the reasons for developing this eating disorder often are combined with a need of control, which often results in social cut-offs. We were able to see a lot of common aspects among people suffering from the eating disorder, but the everyday life is very individual. A person with orthorexia’s view on exercise, diet, and their view on people eating “unhealthy” can differ from person to person. Also the recognition of having an eating problem can diverge. During this research we found that <b>orthorexia</b> can escalate from various etiological factors like emotional distress and the realization of the consequences of unhealthy eating. Furthermore we found that the media, and particularly social medias such as Instagram and Facebook, influence the everyday life of people with <b>orthorexia.</b> The media gives them inspiration on how to live more "healthy". We were not able to find a direct connection between the society's increased focus on health and the emerging of <b>orthorexia,</b> but it is a fact that exercise and healthy food are becoming an increasing part of our everyday life, and the different perceptions of what health is, is confusing and can affect a person’s eating habits...|$|E

A sample of 441 participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk and California State University, Stanislaus SONA system, and were administered the ORTO- 15 eating behavior scale and the NEO-FFI- 3 personality scale.

The aim of our research was to analyze nutritional behaviors {{for the assessment of}} the risk of <b>orthorexia.</b> The authors developed a questionnaire in which 981  respondents participated and used it as a research method. Both men and women ate mostly 4 – 5  meals per day (46. 30 % women versus 34. 74 % men); however, more men than women ate 1 – 2  meals daily (18. 95 % men versus 7. 9 % women). Both place of birth and field of study did not differ {{in terms of the number}} of meals. Moreover, it was observed that the number of meals per day was correlated with the declared time spent on planning a diet. People who ate over 3 meals per day more often indicates that they spent > 3 h per day on planning their diet in comparison with people who ate only 1 – 2 meals. Only 17. 6 % of the respondents declared that they most often ate meals in a company of someone, whereas 45. 3 % indicated that there was no rule. The remaining 37. 1 % of the respondents most often consumed their meals alone. Almost twice as many men as women never paid attention to the qualitative composition of nutrition. Women followed a slimming diet more often than men (20. 3 % versus 5. 8 %) and this indicated > 4 attempts of losing weight. Around one-third of all the respondents suffered or suffer from eating disorders. Owing to insufficient information on <b>orthorexia,</b> it is essential to conduct further research to determine the characteristics of high-risk groups. Taking the growing interest in a healthy lifestyle into account, there is a need to address the problem of <b>orthorexia</b> in the public space.
