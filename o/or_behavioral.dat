5|$|Early speech <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> {{interventions}} {{can help}} {{children with autism}} gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.|$|E

Medication {{is also used to}} control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is attuned to the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E

25|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) relies on the paramagnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to see images of changing blood flow in the brain associated with neural activity. This allows images to be generated that reflect which brain structures are activated (and how) during performance of different tasks or at resting state. According to the oxygenation hypothesis, changes in oxygen usage in regional cerebral blood flow during cognitive <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> activity {{can be associated with}} the regional neurons as being directly related to the cognitive <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> tasks being attended.|$|E

Media quoted the town's mayor as stating that animals cannot be humanely stored indefinitely. The animals in the shelter will be evaluated by veterinarians but will most likely be euthanized.|$|E
25|$|In most of {{the current}} studies where {{positive}} correlations have been found between T. gondii antibody titers and certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders, T. gondii seropositivity tests are conducted after {{the onset of the}} examined disease <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> trait; that is, it is often unclear whether infection with the parasite increases the chances of having a certain trait or disorder, or if having a certain trait or disorder increases the chances of becoming infected with the parasite. Groups of individuals with certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders may share certain behavioral tendencies that increase the likelihood of exposure to and infection with T. gondii; as a result, it is difficult to confirm causal relationships between T. gondii infections and associated neurological disorders <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> traits. Provided there is in fact a causal link between T. gondii and schizophrenia, studies have yet to determine why some individuals with latent toxoplasmosis develop schizophrenia while others do not, however, some plausible explanations include differing genetic susceptibility, parasite strain differences, and differences in the route of the acquired T. gondii infection.|$|E

25|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{also known}} simply as Alzheimer's, is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining {{activities of daily living}} and neuropsychiatric symptoms <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> changes. The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory (amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and recognition (agnosia), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{area of expertise}} for many clinical psychologists is psychological assessment, and {{there are indications that}} as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice. Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypotheses about psychological <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than diagnoses) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing past records, clinical observation, and physical examination.|$|E
25|$|Biological testing {{involves}} the use of plant, animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an aquatic ecosystem. They are any biological species or group of species whose function, population, or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or environmental integrity is present. One example of a group of bio-indicators are the copepods and other small water crustaceans that are present in many water bodies. Such organisms can be monitored for changes (biochemical, physiological, <b>or</b> <b>behavioral)</b> that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} and signs that suggest {{a rise in}} ICP including headache, vomiting without nausea, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, back pain and papilledema. If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness. The headache is classically a morning headache which may wake them from sleep. The brain is relatively poorly supplied by oxygen {{as a result of}} mild hypoventilation during the sleeping hours, and also cerebral edema may worsen during the night due to the lying position. The headache is worse on coughing / sneezing / bending, and progressively worsens over time. There may also be personality <b>or</b> <b>behavioral</b> changes.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} earlier, {{community mental}} health professionals {{have been involved in}} beginning and operating community programs which include ongoing efforts to improve life outcomes, originally through long term services and supports (LTSS). Termed functional or competency-based programs, these service also stressed decision making and self-determination or empowerment as critical aspects. Community mental health professionals may also serve children which have different needs, as do families, including family therapy, financial assistance and support services. Community mental health professionals serve people of all ages from young children with autism, to children with emotional (<b>or</b> <b>behavioral)</b> needs, to grandma who has Alzheimer's or dementia and is living at home after dad passes away.|$|E
