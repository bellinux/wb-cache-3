2500|$|The Vinland map {{first came}} to light in 1957 (three years before the {{discovery}} of the Norse site at L'Anse aux Meadows in 1960), bound in a slim volume with a short medieval text called the Hystoria Tartarorum (usually called in English The Tartar Relation), [...] and was unsuccessfully offered to the British Museum by London book dealer Irving Davis on behalf of a Spanish-Italian dealer named Enzo Ferrajoli de Ry. Shortly afterwards, Ferrajoli sold the volume, for $3,500, to American dealer Laurence C. Witten II, who offered it to his alma mater, Yale University. It was initially treated with suspicion, partly because wormholes in the map and the Relation did not match.

The authors examined processing manuals from many libraries in compiling this manual and consulted {{a wide range of}} librarians, museum specialists, special collections experts, preservationists, and commercial library supply vendors.

Library decisions and policies on circulation, storage, preservation, and security that affect processing decisions are also discussed.

40|$|The {{story of}} the {{publication}} of dictionaries in early modern England is becoming increasingly well known, and is supported by an excellent infrastructure of short-title catalogues and digitized page images. The {{story of the}} ownership of dictionaries is a different matter. This paper will address two principal questions. First, which dictionaries, printed in England or abroad, {{appear to have been}} most widely owned in England before 1700 ? (The evidence to be examined in answering this question includes personal and institutional inventories, auction catalogues, and <b>ownership</b> <b>marks</b> in surviving copies). Second, to what extent is it possible to differentiate ownership and use: which dictionaries were most frequently cited? Were any marked up by readers? It is never possible to get definitive answers to questions like this about the early history of book ownership and reading, and this will necessarily be an exploratory paper, but it will at least give some indication of the dictionaries which really mattered in early modern England - which may not be identical with those which have received the most scholarly attention in recent decades.

40|$|In 1934 a 1 st-century ad copper-alloy {{infantry}} helmet was dredged {{from the}} River Thames or its Walbrook tributary. The helmet soon {{found its way}} into the possession of Father John Ward, an antiquarian, who exhibited it at his museum at the Abbey Folk Park, New Barnet. Here the helmet remained on display until 1940 when the London Blitz forced the museum's closure. After his death in July 1949 much of Ward's collection of antiquities was sold. The helmet was pur-chased by Gerald Gardner from Ward's widow; he then sold it on to the British Museum in 1950, where it has been displayed ever since. The helmet has been examined in detail for remnant tool marks and other evidence of how it was produced. This has allowed a tentative hypothesis to be forwarded regarding the production process. The helmet bowl was raised rather than spun. The dimensional conformity shown on some parts of the helmet reveals that the maker of the bowl was an artisan of some skill. However, the helmet furniture was attached in a haphazard manner with few items aligned correctly. It is possible that the various components of the helmet were manufactured by skilled craftsmen but their attachment was left to semi-skilled labour. The helmet was utilitarian and was produced quickly. Sufficient resources were devoted to the task to make the helmet functional {{but it was not a}} finely executed and finished piece. The helmet saw long service, as indicated by four different punctim <b>ownership</b> <b>marks</b> on the neck-guard, and at the end of its period of use it finally ended up in the Walbrook or Thames, where it may have been ritually deposited...|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, K-104 evolved {{to a more}} adult-leaning {{approach}} as the CHR format went into a short-term decline. The decline was mainly due to Country Music's resurgence immediately following the Persian Gulf War. With this, the numbers weakened {{even though there was}} no real competition for its target audience. In 1996, owner Beacon Broadcasting sold their remaining stations Enterprise Media of Binghamton. Under this new <b>ownership,</b> <b>Mark</b> Bolger left the station, and Stew Schantz handled the K-104 morning drive. Their ownership was short lived, as they in turn sold WBNR and WSPK to Pamal Broadcasting in 1998. Upon Pamal's take over, Schantz resigned from the station. He later went on to do behind-the-scenes work in Utica, Albany and Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Schantz died in June, 2010. The sale to Pamal ended K-104's running of weekend shows such as Open House Party with John Garabedian, Classic Dance Tracks with Stevie T, as well as the K-104 Hometown Countdown.|$|R

Bringing forward additional data about ancient bookbinding, this study will help book conservators to distinguish what they should respect when restoring bookbinding: assessing the originality of the bookbinding and taking the options required by any work of art, like a sculpture or a painting, respecting the taste of the epoch and the context where it was executed.
