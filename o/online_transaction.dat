40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>transactions</b> (e. g. {{buying a}} book) {{typically}} involve {{a number of}} steps spanning several pages. Conducting such transactions under constrained interaction modalities as exemplified by small screen mobile device is a strenuous, fatigueinducing activity. But usually one needs to browse only a small fragment of a Web page to perform a transactional step (e. g. choosing an item from a search results list). We exploit this observation to develop an automata-based process model for <b>online</b> <b>transactions</b> that succinctly captures the transactional steps delivering only the “relevant” page fragments at each step. We realize this model by coupling techniques from content analysis of Web documents, automata learning and statistical classification. This process model and associated techniques have been incorporated into Guide-O-Mobile, a prototype system that facilitates <b>online</b> <b>transactions</b> with limited display size mobile device. Performance of Guide-O-Mobile and its user experience is reported...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} is a {{large and}} ever growing industry. <b>Online</b> <b>transactions</b> are returning ever-growing revenues to electronic merchants. The e-commerce industry is still facing a range of problems concerning the process of completion of <b>online</b> <b>transactions.</b> Such problems are connected to consumer fears dealing with the identity of online merchants, their security pre- cautions and methods for accepting online payments. This thesis develops and presents a Mutual Authentication Model (MAM), which addresses the problem of mutual authentication between online shoppers and merchants. The model combines existing technologies in the eld of cryp- tography, {{as well as the}} use of digital signatures and certi cates. This is done in a speci c manner as for the model to achieve mutual authentication between communicating parties, in an <b>online</b> <b>transactions.</b> The Mutual Authentication Model provides a process through which an online shopper can be quickly and transparently equipped with a digital identi cation, {{in the form of a}} digital certi cate of high trust, in order for this shopper to participate in an authen- ticated transaction within the MAM. A few of the advantages of the developed model include the prospect of decreased online credit fraud, as well as an increased rate of completed <b>online</b> <b>transactions.</b> Prof. S.
