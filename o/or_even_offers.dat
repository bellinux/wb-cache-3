2500|$|After the {{complaints}} in 1925 regarding crop and forest destruction {{as a result}} of smoke from the smelter, COMINCO accepted responsibility and offered to compensate the farmers who were affected. COMINCO also proposed installing fume-controlling technologies to limit future damage and reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide. [...] The company had initially raised smoke stacks to four hundred feet in an effort to increase the dispersion of pollutants; however, this had resulted in prevailing winds moving the noxious fumes downwind to the inhabitants of the Columbia River Valley, thereby making the situation worse. The company also tried to offer payments to the affected residents <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>offered</b> to purchase the land outright, which some would have accepted. [...] However, the company was denied this method of compensation because of Washington State's prohibition of property ownership by foreigners. This led to the official petition by the farmers and landowners of Washington in 1927 for state and federal support against the smelter, claiming the smoke was damaging United States lands. In 1931, the IJC awarded the farmers $350,000 in damages, but did not set guidelines for sulphur dioxide emission reduction. The compensation was far less than the plaintiffs had expected and the IJC settlement was eventually rejected under the pressure of Washington's State Congressional Delegation. [...] The unsatisfactory result of the IJC decision led to the establishment of a three-person Arbitral Tribunal to resolve the dispute in 1935.|$|R

30|$|The {{adoption}} of software {{fault tolerance techniques}} based on design diversity has been advocated {{as a means of}} coping with residual software design faults in operational software (Lee and Anderson [1990]). Design diversity is the provision of software components called variants, which have the same or an equivalent specification but with different designs and implementations (Gärtner [1999]). An assumption of software fault tolerance techniques is that the probability of having the same fault in multiple variant components is lower, meaning that a fault present in a component should be detected and tolerated based on the behaviour of other variants (Lyu [1996]). In the nineties, the use of techniques based on design diversity to tolerate software faults was widely criticised since variant software components used to be developed from scratch, which is very expensive (Anderson et al. [1985]; Vouk et al. [1993]). Therefore these techniques were generally used only in highly critical systems, in which the occurrence of failures would result in large financial losses <b>or</b> <b>even</b> loss of life. Nevertheless, in the context of SOA on the web, there are already many services that provide equivalent functionality, thus making such techniques more practical (Zheng and Lyu [2010 b]). These variant services might be simply cost-free and open access, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>offered</b> by external organizations to cope with changes to user quality of services (QoS) requirements (Papazoglou et al. [2007]). Due to the low cost of reusing existing variant services, several diversity-based approaches have been developed to support reliable SOA-based applications. These approaches operate as mediators between clients and variant services. The latter are structured in fault-tolerant composite web services (Nascimento et al. [2011]; Zheng and Lyu [2010 b]). Hereafter we refer to fault-tolerant composite web services as FT-compositions. From the clients’ viewpoint, an FT-composition works as a single, reliable service.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether intravaginal clindamycin cream reduces {{the incidence of}} abnormal pregnancy outcome in women with abnormal vaginal microbial flora graded as intermediate or BV and to investigate {{the effect of the}} antibiotic on vaginal microbial flora. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of pregnant women in an antenatal clinic of a district general hospital. The subjects were 268 women who had abnormal vaginal microbial flora at first clinic visit by examination of a Gram-stained vaginal smear and 34 women with a normal vaginal flora. Two hundred and thirty-seven women were evaluable. Women with abnormal Gram-stained smears (graded as II or III) on clinic recall were randomised to receive treatment (intravaginal clindamycin cream) or placebo and followed to assess outcome of pregnancy, vaginal flora, and detection of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum after treatment. RESULTS: Abnormal outcomes of pregnancy were not significantly different in treated and placebo groups by Chi square (P = 0. 2). However, women with grade III flora responded better to clindamycin than women with grade II flora by numbers of abnormal outcomes (P = 0. 03) and return to normal vaginal flora (P = 0. 01) (logistic regression analysis model). This may be due to differences in vaginal bacterial species in these grades. Women whose abnormal vaginal flora had spontaneously returned to normal on follow-up and were therefore not treated (revertants) had as many abnormal outcomes as placebos suggesting that damage by abnormal bacterial species occurred early in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-stain screening distinguishing grade II from grade III flora may be helpful in prescribing treatment other than clindamycin for women with grade II flora. Earlier diagnosis and treatment may be more effective in preventing an abnormal outcome, possibly as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>offered</b> as a pre-conception screen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Ultrasound (US) is {{currently}} found predominantly in specialty practices {{and is not}} generally utilized within the primary care environment {{at the point of}} care. While several medical schools have included US training as part of their curriculum and residency programs, it remains a skill set not commonly taught <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>offered</b> to family nurse practitioners (FNP’s). Literature review revealed that primary care physicians are beginning to integrate ultrasound into the examination of patients in the primary care setting with multiple benefits during an initial encounter for diagnostic purposes and procedural guidance (Morris, 2015, p. 3). No research or papers concerning family nurse practitioner use of US in primary care settings were found. FNP’s are not usually offered training in the use of US, except in acute-care settings and the military, even though ultrasound performed at the point of care can have a great influence on the ability to “provide high quality, cost effective healthcare by expediting diagnosis and decreasing costly ancillary testing that utilizes ionizing radiation” (Soni & Lucas, 2015, p. 123). Initial familiarization for PoCUS was offered to a cohort group of FNP students and other providers at Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC). Familiarization training consisted of a series of didactic and hands-on training sessions focused on procedural guidance and assessment of the heart, lungs, vascular (deep vein thrombus, abdominal aortic aneurysm, fluid overload and dehydration), kidney, gallbladder, bladder, liver, and musculoskeletal systems. Initial training was accomplished in 16 hours of instruction. Assessment of knowledge and skill was performed pre- and post-training using a Likert scale tool. After training, the FNP students and providers were assessed for their likelihood to comfortably embrace the use of US/PoCUS, and their willingness to receive further training. As interest in and knowledge about ultrasound grows, {{it has the potential to}} replace or supplement other diagnostic and assessment methods currently used. While the FNP of today may not use ultrasound, training and adoption of its use may soon render it an indispensable part of the FNP provider’s practice.

40|$|Gut {{microbes}} {{are capable}} of producing most neurotransmitters found in the human brain. While these neurotransmitters primarily act locally in the gut, modulating the enteric nervous system, evidence is now accumulating to {{support the view that}} gut microbes through multiple mechanisms can influence central neurochemistry and behavior.

In this process, hundreds of Indonesian labour recruitment agencies have come to function as brokers in an increasingly government-regulated economy that sends documented migrants to countries such as Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. Based primarily on fieldwork on the island of Lombok, one of the major migrant-sending areas in Indonesia, the article considers the gendered aspects of this state market relationship by focusing ethnographic attention on the initial stages of recruitment, as informal labour brokers deliver migrants to formal agencies.

Such programs have been studied by environmental economists, but little research has been done on the usefulness of strategically varying the conservation contract's length. This paper uses theory and simulation to investigate the optimal contract length of land conservation programs when a policy maker tries to maximize the present discounted value of the stream of environmental benefits from the program. We find that contract length should vary with characteristics of the ecological processes that yield benefits from land retirement. Optimal contracts are longer when the environmental benefits in question things like woodland biodiversity take time to develop. However, it is not typically optimal to have the indefinitelylived contracts favored by some conservation groups, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> to <b>offer</b> contracts as long as the maturation period for the environmental services in question. In general, the optimal contract length depends on the trade off between an ecological effect (increasing the environmental benefits from one farmer) and an enrollment effect (increasing the number of farmers enrolled).

It created complications for many propertied families, especially from about the late 17th to the early 19th century, leaving many individuals wealthy in land but heavily in debt, often due to annuities chargeable on the estate payable to the patriarch's widow and younger children, where the patriarch was swayed by sentiment not to establish a strict concentration of all his wealth in his heir leaving his other beloved relatives destitute.
