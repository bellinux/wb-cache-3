He published a book, <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> Colony (1908), to explore ideas about emigrating back to Africa. He died in 1924 at the age of 67.|$|E

25|$|Boötes is {{in a part}} of the {{celestial}} sphere facing away from the plane of <b>our</b> <b>home</b> Milky Way galaxy, and so does not have open clusters or nebulae. Instead, it has one bright globular cluster and many faint galaxies. The globular cluster NGC 5466 has an overall magnitude of 9.1 and a diameter of 11 arcminutes. It is a very loose globular cluster with fairly few stars and may appear as a rich, concentrated open cluster in a telescope. NGC 5466 is classified as a Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class 12 cluster, reflecting its sparsity. Its fairly large diameter means that it has a low surface brightness, so it appears far dimmer than the catalogued magnitude of 9.1 and requires a large amateur telescope to view. Only approximately 12 stars are resolved by an amateur instrument.|$|E
25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize <b>our</b> <b>home</b> front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E

500|$|On June 12, 1895, Walker's wife Arabella died {{of cancer}} at 32 years old; he {{remarried}} three years later to Ednah Mason, another former Oberlin student. The same year, Walker {{was found guilty of}} mail robbery and was sentenced to one year in prison which he served in Miami County and Jefferson County Jail. After his release during the turn of the century, Walker jointly owned the Union Hotel in Steubenville with Weldy, and managed the Opera House, a movie theater in nearby Cadiz. As host to opera, live drama, vaudeville, and minstrel shows at the Opera House, Walker became a respected businessman and patented inventions that improved film reels when nickelodeons were popularized. In 1902, the brothers explored ideas of Black nationalism as editors for The Equator, though no copies exist today as evidence. Walker expanded upon his works about race theory in The Equator by publishing the book <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> Colony (1908). Regarded as [...] "the most learned book a professional athlete ever wrote", <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> Colony shared Walker's thesis on the victimization of the black race and a proposal for African-Americans to emigrate back to Africa.|$|E

[...] Fleetwood's biographer, David Zang, has written that Fleetwood [...] "was effected by the political vigilance which his younger brother, Weldy, had brought to the black cause." [...] In the credits to <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> Colony, Fleetwood was identified as the author, and Weldy was identified as [...] "General Agent," [...] though much {{of the book is}} written in the first-person plural. [...] In the book, the Walkers wrote: [...] "The only practical and permanent solution of the present and future race troubles in the United States is entire separation by Emigration of the Negro from America." [...] They added: [...] "The Negro race will be a menace and the source of discontent as long as it remains in large numbers in the United States.
