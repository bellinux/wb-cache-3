40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} a new test of tonic pain in rats {{which can be}} used as an animal model of persistent pain.

The second experiment investigated the effect of morphine and aspirin on the response to an intermediate dose <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> venom. Finally, the third experiment examined the response to concurrent injections <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> venom and formalin. Subcutaneous injection <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> venom produced local inflammation, marked edema, and tonic pain responses. Increasing doses <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> venom produced higher mean pain scores and increased durations of responding. Pain responses lasted up to approximately one hour and the inflammation and edema were virtually gone by 8 hours with the lower doses <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> venom tested and by 2 days with the two highest doses tested. Analgesia was produced by morphine and aspirin, indicating that the bee venom test can be used to test analgesic drugs. Concurrent administration <b>of</b> <b>bee</b> venom and formalin produced responses similar to formalin alone, with an increased duration of responding at higher intensities.
