5|$|In 1906, Cuba was in {{the midst}} of a {{constitutional}} crisis as a result of a disputed election and an attempt by elected President Tomás Estrada Palma to stay in power after the conclusion of his term. This led to a revolt, and the U.S. military sent in 5,600 men to reassert control over the country in what would be called the Second Occupation <b>of</b> <b>Cuba.</b> This was permitted under the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1903, a treaty that stipulated the degree of United States intervention in Cuba. After a brief period of stabilization by Secretary Taft, Magoon was appointed governor under the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>Cuba,</b> effectively with absolute authority and backed by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|In Haiti, the {{southern}} {{periphery of the}} hurricane killed three people in Port au Prince. Later, Donna brushed the north coast <b>of</b> <b>Cuba</b> with strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing damage along much of the coast. In Gibara, the storm wrecked 80houses.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October, Kennedy was {{informed}} that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, {{could come up with}} no way of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade <b>of</b> <b>Cuba.</b> Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion <b>of</b> <b>Cuba.</b> Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.|$|E

5|$|On October9, {{the fifth}} {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} 1910season formed from a tropical disturbance in the extreme southern Caribbean, {{to the north of}} Panama. It tracked steadily northwestward, and attained tropical storm intensity on October 11. It continued to strengthen, and became a hurricane the next day. On October13, the storm was observed to the southwest <b>of</b> <b>Cuba.</b> Early on October 14, the hurricane briefly reached an intensity corresponding to Category 3 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before tracking ashore along the western tip <b>of</b> <b>Cuba.</b> However, it weakened somewhat after crossing the island. Upon emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane slowed considerably.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} coast <b>of</b> <b>Cuba,</b> the {{hurricane}} caused waves {{of up to}} 13feet (4m) high and winds gusts peaking at 42mph (67km/h), causing numerous tourists and workers on the Isle of Youth and Cayo Largo del Sur to leave for safer grounds.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1849 and 1850, they contended with Narciso López, the Venezuelan radical who led {{repeated}} filibustering expeditions in {{an attempt}} to conquer the island <b>of</b> <b>Cuba.</b> The annexation <b>of</b> <b>Cuba</b> was the object of fascination among many in the South, who saw in Cuba a potential new slave state, and López had several prominent Southern supporters. López made generous offers to American military leaders to support him, but Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal. They issued a blockade, and later, authorized a mass arrest of López and his fellows, although the group would eventually be acquitted. They also confronted Spain, which had arrested several Americans on the charge of piracy, but the Spaniards eventually surrendered them to maintain good relations with the U.S.|$|E
5|$|About 36hours {{prior to}} the {{hurricane}} making landfall, {{when it was still}} south <b>of</b> <b>Cuba,</b> the Miami Weather Bureau issued a hurricane alert for South Florida. About 18hours before landfall, the alert was replaced by a hurricane warning. The advance warning time was believed to have prevented many deaths; however, the population was considered complacent with the warning, causing additional damage when they executed improper preparations, such as securing windows.|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier's, Reasons of State (El recurso del método, 1974), is a {{synthesis}} of several historical figures from Latin American, most prominently Gerardo Machado, dictator <b>of</b> <b>Cuba.</b> This fictional character, in his bid to be refined, spends half {{of his life in}} Europe, perhaps reminiscent of Sarmiento's dichotomy of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy.|$|E

5|$|Formation of a {{well-defined}} eye and central dense overcast signaled Dennis's intensification {{into a major}} hurricane. The powerful storm soon struck Granma Province, Cuba, as a Category4 early on July8; violent winds battered the province and caused extensive damage. Paralleling the western coast <b>of</b> <b>Cuba,</b> Dennis attained its peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) later that day before making a second landfall in the country, this time in Matanzas Province. Interaction with the mountains <b>of</b> <b>Cuba</b> caused significant weakening; however, once Dennis emerged over the Gulf of Mexico on July9, {{it was able to}} quickly reorganize. The hurricane reached Category4 strength for a third time on July10 as it approached Florida, weakening somewhat before striking the state. Dramatic weakening ensued once the cyclone moved ashore. Dennis lingered as a tropical depression and remnant low for roughly a week, traversing the Mississippi River Valley and Ohio River Valley before finally dissipating over Ontario on July18.|$|E

5|$|In 1975 and 1976 most foreign forces, {{with the}} {{exception}} <b>of</b> <b>Cuba,</b> withdrew. The last elements of the Portuguese military withdrew in 1975 and the South African military withdrew in February 1976.
