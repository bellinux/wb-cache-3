30|$|Nanostructure hybrid organic–inorganic {{composites}} {{have attracted}} considerable attention recently, {{both from the}} perspectives of fundamental research and their technological applications[1 – 3]. One approach for preparing these materials is via sol–gel process. In the inorganic matrix, components are formed in situ through hydrolysis and condensation of metal oxide precursors, while the organic matrix undergoes simultaneous polymerization. However, the sol–gel approach is limited by the evaluation of volatile biproducts and concomitant shrinkage when the hybrid is processed at elevated temperature[4, 5]. The sol–gel method {{is one of the most}} suitable methods to prepare the silica gel through siloxane linkages by the hydrolysis and condensation reactions. The silica hybrid materials greatly depend on the interaction between the organic polymers and inorganic alkoxides and their homogeneous distribution through hydrogen bonding, covalent bonding, formation of stereo regular complex, and π-π and ionic interactions[6 – 8]. The Michael addition reaction in polymer synthesis and applications in emerging technologies, composites, coatings, and optical coatings are outlined in the article[9]. Organic–inorganic hybrid nanocomposites are a new category of high-performance materials which is currently an area that has received extensive interests for other matrix of polyimide (PI)-SiO 2 [10, 11], PI-Al 2 O 3 [12], and PI-TiO 2 [13 – 15]; these composites have been successfully synthesized. Many researches have been focusing on developing the PI-inorganic hybrid nanocomposites, such as the use of dianhydride and diamine to synthesize the PI matrix and the use of metal alkoxides to provide the inorganic network. Nanocomposites can be prepared through different processes. Among those successful ones[16 – 19], the in situ polymerization and gelation reaction is a type of processing in which the inorganic phase was generated from the metal alkoxide precursors through hydrolysis and condensation reactions that took place simultaneously with the polymerization reaction. Wang and Chang and other researchers[20, 21] prepared the hybrid nanocomposite films of TiO 2 in the PI matrix from 2, 5 -bis (4 -aminophenyl) 3, 4 -oxadiazole, 4, 4 ′-oxydiaphthalic anhydride, and titanium precursors by an in situ sol–gel process. The titanium precursor was prepared by mixing tetraethyl titanate (TET) and acetyl acetone (acac) in the solution of alcohol and water. These nanocomposites exhibited fairly good optical transparency at 40 wt.% of TiO 2 content. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) results showed that the size of the TiO 2 particle increased from 10 to 40 nm[20 – 22]. Several successful examples of in situ polymerization and gelation reaction processes could be found in the literature. The polymer nanocomposites were prepared using poly(amic acid) solution by the condensation of 3, 3 ′, 4, 4 ′-benzonphenone tetra carboxylic dianhydride and 4, 4 ′-oxydianhydride 4, 4 ′-oxydianiline (ODA) then added TET followed by thermal imidization from PI/TiO 2 hybrid nanocomposites. They reported that nanosized inorganic TiO 2 network dispersed in PI films at an average diameter of 1.5 nm at TiO 2 content of 12 wt.%[22 – 24]. The poly(amide-imide)/TiO 2 (PAI/TiO 2) nanocomposite films obtained 4, 4 ′-oxy(phenyl trimellimide) and ODA using tert-butyl benzoic acid as the mono functional endcapper; with TET, these composite films exhibited high transparency and had well-dispersed nanosized TiO 2 in the PAI matrix[25 – 27]. The size of the TiO 2 network increased from 5 to 50 nm when the TiO 2 content was increased from 4 % to 18 % by weight. While large sized, nanosized inorganic particles made the nanocomposite films, transparent in such the particle size effect, hydrogen bonding between the amide group in the PAI and the hydroxyl groups on the inorganic oxides played an important role in making such small particle size possible[28 – 30]. According to these reports, the sol–gel process is one of the most commonly used processes of preparing titanium dioxide. However, in the process for preparing titanium dioxide, there are a few technical problems that must be resolved. First of all the titanium alkoxide is a highly reactive compound when it is exposed to moisture, and white precipitate will form rapidly. In order to prepare nanosized TiO 2 suspension solution, the pH values and the use of chelating agents are crucial in the reaction steps[31]. It is reported elsewhere in the literature that[32 – 34] prepared high refractive index thin films of pyrometallic dianhydride titania hybrid materials from dianhydride, γ-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (γ-APS), and titanium isopropoxide via sol–gel process followed by spin coating and multi-step backing; through adjustment in the concentration and reaction time, they were able to produce thin films of hybrid inorganic content at 59.2 %. Therefore, the transparent polymer hybrid used for lenses has about 90 % transmittance/cm. Typical materials PMMA, PC, polystyrene, and styrene-MMA copolymers have been used for the lenses in projection television and lenses for using compact disk. The plastic materials in optical disk circuit need to be highly transparent, resistant to heat, low impurities, and must have a low double refractive index and low fluidity. However, no materials with these properties have yet been found or developed. Semiconductor-mediated photocatalytic oxidation has been accepted as a promising method for the removal of organic contaminants from waste water. Among the semiconductors employed, TiO 2 is known to be a good photocatalyst because of its high photosensitivity, non-toxicity, easy availability, strong oxidizing power, and long-term stability[35, 36]. Existing bulk semiconducting materials possess low surface area, less absorption property, and fast electron–hole recombination. In order to circumvent such problems, researchers are interested in recent days in the synthesis of nanomaterials for environmental applications[34 – 36]. The polymer metal oxide hybrid nanocomposites contained bimetallic dopants of the titanium and barium oxides. The precursors of metal oxides were formed from tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) and barium carbonate, which were then mixed with poly(amic acid) solution followed by thermal imidization. The synthesized hybrid nanocomposites with inorganic particles are smaller than 50 nm, and the dielectric constant increased from 3.5 to 4.2 when the inorganic content increased from 1 to 10 wt.%. Polyimides are considered to be one of the most important super-engineering materials due to their thermal stability as well as the superior mechanical properties at elevated temperature[37, 38]. Since the polyimide/silica hybrid materials have been prepared successfully through the sol–gel process[39], more attention were given to the field[34 – 40]. Recently, metal-containing polyimide/titania hybrids were also prepared[41]. The key challenge for the preparation of the hybrid materials is how to control the phase separation between the organic and inorganic moieties. The phase behavior is connected with the interaction between the organic segment and the inorganic network in the hybrids. Hydrogen bonding or covalent bonding is usually used to prevent phase separation[42]. Recently, the sol–gel process is a novel technique for the preparation of nanocrystalline TiO 2. It has been demonstrated that through the sol–gel process, the physico-chemical and electrochemical properties of TiO 2 can be modified to improve its efficiency. It provides a simple and easy means of synthesizing nanoparticles at ambient temperature under atmospheric pressure, and this technique does require simple setup. Since this method is a solution process, it has all the advantages over other preparation techniques in terms of purity, homogeneity, felicity, and flexibility in introducing dopants in large concentrations, stoichiometry control, ease of processing, and composition control. Through the sol–gel process, the growth of TiO 2 colloids in sub-micrometer range can be effectively controlled by hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxides in aqueous medium[43]. Nanosize TiO 2 used so far in photocatalytic applications has been prepared by hydrolysis of titanium precursors followed by annealing, flame synthesis, and hydrothermal and sol–gel processes. In most studies, attempts have been made to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 only by varying the calcination temperature and, in a few cases, aging period and drying conditions[40 – 43]. Among the various techniques under the development, the sol–gel process has been found to be extremely suitable as it enables good control of composition and optical behavior of the final nanomaterials. In recent years, silica-titania hybrid organic–inorganic materials have been studied as a promising system for photonic applications[41 – 43], and low loss wave guide based on the organically modified alkoxides has been fabricated by the sol–gel process. Therefore, the sol–gel integrated optics is beginning to show potential applications, and it stimulates the studies on <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>guide</b> material which have been explored for a long time and such sol–gel materials used for optical applications[40]. In the area of advanced oxidation technology, titanium dioxide semiconductor photocatalysis has been widely studied because of its potential application in air clean-up and water purification. TiO 2 is largely used as photocatalyst due to its beneficial characteristics: high photocatalytic efficiency, physical and chemical stability, low cost, and low toxicity[40 – 42]. TiO 2 /SiO 2 composites are very promising in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis since they could provide simultaneously enhanced photocatalytic and thermal properties compared to pure TiO 2 photocatalyst. It has been reported that photocatalytic reactivity of TiO 2 /SiO 2 nanocomposites is highly dependent on the Ti/Si ratios. The photocatalytic activity and mechanical stability were reported to improve by the addition of about 50 % SiO 2 [40 – 48]. Moreover, in the present work, an attempt has been made to develop the silica/titania-incorporated transparent maleimide-functionalized polystyrene to improve the thermochemical and optical characteristics with γ-APS, TEOS, and titanium isopropoxide through the Michael addition reaction at relatively low temperature through the sol–gel method. Furthermore, the organic–inorganic transparent hybrid nanocomposite materials were characterized by FTIR, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), optical images, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and TEM analyses.|$|E

The results equally apply to other systems described by the non-linear Schrödinger equations, and should be of interest when designing <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>guides...</b>|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} {{rapid manufacturing}} methods {{for the construction}} of fluoropolymer microfluidic devices were investigated: (1) fluoropolymer/epoxy laminate/fluoropolymer structures, (2) fluoropolymer/fluoropolymer structures and (3) fluoropolymer/epoxy laminate/glass structures. The structures are chemically and physically robust and the fluoropolymer constructs can be used for <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>guiding.</b> Principles behind the use of fluoropolymer waveguide constructs and a basic theoretical analysis of the improvements they offer are presented. The otherwise problematic bonding of the polymers was facilitated by chemical (sodium naphthalene) surface treatment. The effects of the process were characterized by contact angle and bond strength measurements. For demonstration purposes, microfluidic channels were fabricated using Ordyl SY epoxy laminate (methods 1 and 3) and hot embossing of the polymers (method 2). The first method (fluoropolymer/epoxy laminate/fluoropolymer) proved to be the most reliable and successful, in particular when bonding the various layers.

40|$|GaN-based vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are {{expected}} to exhibit several advantages over their already widely used edge-emitting counterparts, including lower manufacturing costs, circular output beams, and longer lifetime. However, {{in contrast to the}} great success of GaN-based edge-emitting lasers in recent years, GaN-VCSELs still face significant challenges. Electrically pumped devices have been demonstrated only recently and they exhibit severe performance restrictions. We here analyze these recently manufactured GaN-VCSELs using advanced laser simulation software. The simulation self-consistently combines carrier transport, photon emission, and multi-mode <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>guiding.</b> For the quantum wells, Schrödinger and Poisson equations are solved iteratively at every bias point to account for the Quantum-Confined Stark Effect. Our analysis shows that thick quantum wells allow for the almost complete elimination of the built-in quantum well polarization field. The simulations also reveal several performance limiting effects, e. g., gain-peak offset, current crowding, and electron leakage. Design optimization options are discussed and simulated...|$|R
40|$|Large {{amplitude}} water {{waves on}} deep water {{has long been}} known in the sea faring community, and the cause of great concern for, e. g., oil platform constructions. The concept of such freak waves is nowadays, thanks to satellite and radar measurements, well established within the scientific community. There are a number of important models and approaches for the theoretical description of such waves. By analyzing the scaling behavior of freak wave formation in a model of two interacting waves, described by two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations, we show that there are two different dynamical scaling behaviors above and below a critical angle θc of the direction of the interacting waves below θc all wave systems evolve and display statistics similar to a wave system of non-interacting waves.

40|$|The time-independent {{nonlinear}} Schrödinger {{equation is}} solved for two attractive delta-function shaped potential wells where an imaginary loss term is added in one well, and a gain {{term of the}} same size but with opposite sign in the other. We show that for vanishing nonlinearity the model captures all the features known from studies of PT symmetric <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>guides,</b> e. g., the coalescence of modes in an exceptional point at a critical value of the loss/gain parameter, and the breaking of PT symmetry beyond. With the nonlinearity present, the equation is a model for a Bose-Einstein condensate with loss and gain in a double well potential. We find that the nonlinear Hamiltonian picks as stationary eigenstates exactly such solutions which render the nonlinear Hamiltonian itself PT symmetric, but observe coalescence and bifurcation scenarios different from those known from linear PT symmetric Hamiltonians.

40|$|The {{telecommunications}} {{revolution has}} created a strong motivation to build photonic devices of ever smaller size and higher density. Using photosynthetic structures found in nature as an inspiration, we synthesized artificial structures that act like diffusive waveguides. These waveguides use FRET to transport energy, and we demonstrated the idea with 3 - and 5 -fluorophore structures which utilize DNA as a scaffold. A quantitative model that explains the results and provides the mechanism behind the energy transfer is also presented. Most man-made photonic devices for <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>guiding</b> {{are based on the}} classical physics of bulk materials: Max-well’s equations allow propagating modes in the far field, and the wavelength of light imposes a fundamental lower limit on device size. 1 - 3 However, Nature has evolved several examples of photonic nanostructures to guide light over much smaller length scales for “light harvesting ” in plants and photosynthetic bacteria. 4 - 5 This solution is fundamentally quantum mechanical and is related to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). 6 - 10 FRET is a near field dipole...|$|R
