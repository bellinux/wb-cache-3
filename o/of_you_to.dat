5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. The last thing I want any <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> think is that we are putting out too many releases." ...|$|E
500|$|Anti-German {{sentiment}} rose {{among the}} British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen's clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill's remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg's resignation was delayed by the King's {{opposition to the}} appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, [...] "I beg <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> release me. I am {{on the verge of}} breaking down & I cannot use my brain for anything". On 13 November he wrote to Churchill's Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, [...] "It was an awful wrench, but I had no choice from the moment it was made clear to me that the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to support me by some public pronouncement." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{edition of}} October 1, 1990 of People {{included}} {{an interview with}} then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country.

500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E
500|$|When Pedro II {{left the}} palace, the {{soldiers}} who were standing guard outside instinctively presented arms, and he responded by raising his hat. A few close friends voluntarily accompanied the Imperial Family into exile, including André Rebouças and Franklin Dória, baron of Loreto. [...] Very few were on hand to witness the departure. They {{were taken to the}} steamship Parnaíba and after that to the ship Alagoas, in which they sailed the next day to Europe. Before the final departure, Pedro II sent a short message to his faithful friend the Marquis of Tamandaré, who had remained at his side until embarkation: [...] "What is done, is done. It remains to all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> establish order and to consolidate your institutions." [...] After learning that the Emperor had left, Benjamin Constant spoke: [...] "It is fulfilled, the most painful of our duties." [...] Major Carlos Nunes de Aguiar later recalled saying to Rui Barbosa, who had been at his side witnessing the departure from afar: [...] "You were right to weep when the Emperor left." [...] Historian Lilia Moritz Schwarcz said that it was [...] "the end of the monarchy, but not of myth, called d. Pedro." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for Vocal Duo of the Year at the 1994 Tejano Music Awards, where the Barrio Boyzz and Selena performed the track. John Lannert of Billboard called [...] "Donde Quiera Que Estés" [...] a [...] "pop/dance monster" [...] during its reign {{on the top of}} Latin charts in 1994. After Selena's death, Lannert wrote a retrospective article on the singer for Billboard released on 10 June 1995, he called [...] "Donde Quiera Que Estés" [...] a [...] "pop duet smash". After Selena was inducted into the Billboard Latin Music Hall of Fame on that same issue, Lannert allude the song as being a [...] "rhythmic pop number". On his album review of Dreaming of You, Paul Verna of Billboard called the track a [...] "smash collaboration". Marco Torres wrote in the Houston Press that [...] "Donde Quiera Que Estés" [...] is [...] "probably the best music video of all time". He further wrote that Selena [...] "showcases her pop-princess qualities by teaming up with New York City Latino pop group [...] Barrio Boyzz". Torres also states that [...] "this song about first loves is the perfect balance of harmony, sultry whispers and Selena's ability to turn an otherwise mediocre song into a spectacular hit." [...] The Argus-Press believed that [...] "Donde Quiera Que Estés" [...] and Selena's subsequent single [...] "Amor Prohibido", were added on Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> [...] "show how her style grew." [...] Reviewing [...] "Wherever You Are", Howard Cohen and Fernando Gonzalez of The Day, called the track a hip-hop number.|$|E
500|$|With Barrett {{seemingly}} {{detached from}} proceedings, {{it came down}} to Waters and Wright to provide adequate material. The opening, [...] "Let There Be More Light", penned by Waters, continues the space rock approach established by Barrett. [...] "Let There Be More Light" [...] evolved from a bass riff that was part of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". Both [...] "Remember a Day" [...] and [...] "See-Saw" [...] use the childlike approach that was established on their debut. Wright remained critical of his early contributions to the band. [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] was first performed with Barrett in 1967. The success of the track was such that it remained in their live setlist until 1973 where it appeared in a greatly extended form. Waters later performed the track during solo concerts from 1984 and later. Waters borrowed the lyrics from a book of Chinese poetry from the Tang Dynasty, like Barrett had used in [...] "Chapter 24". [...] "Corporal Clegg", is the first Pink Floyd song to address issues of war, a theme which would endure throughout the career of Waters as a songwriter for the band, culminating on the 1983 album The Final Cut. [...] "A Saucerful of Secrets" [...] was originally written as a new version of [...] "Nick's Boogie". The track is titled as four parts, on Ummagumma. A staple in the band's live set until summer 1972, a live version of the song was recorded on 27 April 1969 at the Mothers Club in Birmingham for inclusion on Ummagumma. [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] refers to Barrett's departure from the group ("It's awfully considerate <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> think of me here / And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here"). A promotional video was recorded for the track. The band's management wanted to release the song as a single, before being vetoed by both the band and producer Norman Smith.|$|E
