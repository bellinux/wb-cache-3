We've raised <b>our</b> <b>kids</b> in a {{religious}} way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in.

25|$|In {{my career}} when I prosecute {{the worst of}} the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only {{appropriate}} punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on <b>our</b> <b>kids,</b> and he's even against the death penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. Our next congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{have felt that}} the [...] "Mature" [...] rating is too broad; video game {{journalist}} Ben Kuchera noted that Halo 3—a sci-fi first-person shooter whose level of violence was, in his opinion, comparable to a Star Wars film, had received an M rating for [...] "Blood and Gore," [...] "Mild Language" [...] and [...] "Violence". He argued that [...] "having a game like Halo 3 share the same rating as Saints Row IV, which carries the 'Blood,' Intense Violence,' 'Partial Nudity,' 'Sexual Content,' 'Strong Language' and 'Use of Drugs' descriptors was always silly, and it weakened {{the thrust of the}} ratings system." [...] Likewise, he felt that the tone and content of the PG-13 rated film The Dark Knight was relatively harsher to children than that of the Saints Row series due to the latter's light-hearted tone, but still noted that [...] "as parents we know what's right and what isn't for <b>our</b> <b>kids,</b> and being aware of the content they consume is a large part of our job as parents."
