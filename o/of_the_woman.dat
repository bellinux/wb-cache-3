5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> and her lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. Back in the car, she imagines her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyoncé's character appears {{on the beach in}} a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> resting her head on her lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes that she must set her relationship back on the right track. In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E

5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home.

5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E
5|$|In 1209, the Jain scholar, minister, {{builder of}} temples and army {{commander}} Janna wrote, among other classics, Yashodhara Charite, a {{unique set of}} stories in 310verses dealing with sadomasochism, transmigration of the soul, passion gone awry and cautionary morals for human conduct. The writing, although inspired by Vadiraja's Sanskrit classic of the same name, is noted for its original interpretation, imagery and style. In one story, the poet tells of the infatuation of a man for his friend's wife. Having killed his friend, the man abducts the wife, who dies of grief. Overcome by repentance, he burns himself on the funeral pyre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman.</b> The stories of infatuation reach a peak when Janna writes about the attraction of Amrutamati, the queen, to the ugly mahout Ashtavakra, who pleases the queen with kicks and whip lashes. This story has piqued the interest of modern researchers. In honour of this work, Janna received the title Kavichakravarthi ("Emperor among poets") from his patron, King Veera BallalaII. His other classic, Anathanatha Purana (1230), is an account {{of the life of the}} 14thtirthankar Ananthanatha.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at Bryn Mawr College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience. It {{was the first time}} she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> who lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, {{as though he had}} come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 2006, {{a private}} party {{was held at}} the Jena Fair Barn. Bailey and four other black youths tried to enter the party at about 11:00p.m. According to U.S. Attorney Washington, they were told by a woman that no one was allowed inside without an invitation. The youths persisted, stating that some friends were already at the party. A white male, who was not a student, moved in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> and a fight ensued. After the fight broke up, the woman told both the white male and the black {{students}} to leave the party. Once outside, the black students were involved in another fight with a group of white males who were not students. Justin Sloan, a white male, was charged with battery {{for his role in the}} fight and was put on probation. Bailey later said that one of the white males broke a beer bottle over his head, but there are no records of Bailey receiving medical treatment.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{potential}} of the young boy, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for James's early education, which in the Victorian era was largely the job <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> of the house. At eight he could recite long passages of Milton and the whole of the 119th psalm (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of scripture was already very detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. James's education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life. His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a sixteen-year-old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man John hired to instruct his son, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward. John dismissed the tutor in November 1841 and, after considerable thought, sent James to the prestigious Edinburgh Academy. He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.|$|E

50|$|One {{randomized}} {{trial of}} postmenopausal {{women who had}} already fractured vertebra compared teriparatide at either 20 or 40 micrograms per day with placebo.

5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> as she fans herself (the fan itself {{displays a}} classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine {{growing on the}} side of the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> {{has also}} been a matter of debate. The inscription which accompanies her image clearly includes her title, despotissa, as well as the word “daughter”. Based on a possible reading of her name as Anna, she has been identified as Anna Neda, the Serbian wife of Michael Shishman, which is in line with the first identification of the despot. Nikolova believes that {{it is possible that the}} woman is Anna Neda even if the despot is her son rather than her husband. She theorises that Anna Neda settled in Vidin after Michael Shishman's second marriage and owned a personal domain which included Donja Kamenica. Another reading of the inscription deciphers the name of the despotissa as Elena.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} a {{combination}} of fact and fiction. Blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel, but especially in The Feast of the Goat because Vargas Llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters. Some characters are fictional, and those that are non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people. While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive, they recount actual crimes of the regime, such as the murder of the Mirabal sisters. However, other details are invented by Vargas Llosa, such as Amadito's murder of the brother <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> he loved.|$|E
