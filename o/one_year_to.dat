5|$|A vast {{marshland}} {{could only}} have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25million and 2million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from <b>one</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E
5|$|Adventure was {{conceived}} as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately <b>one</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E

5|$|By 1943, the Allies {{had gained}} air superiority over Germany, and bombings of German cities and {{industry}} had become commonplace. However, the Allies in their strategic bombing campaign did not concentrate on industry, and Speer {{was able to}} overcome bombing losses. In spite of these losses, German production of tanks {{more than doubled in}} 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for Kriegsmarine submarines was reduced from <b>one</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> two months.

5|$|Freshwater marl prairies {{are similar}} to sloughs, but lack the slow {{movement}} of surface water; instead, water seeps through a calcitic mud called marl. Algae and other microscopic organisms form periphyton, which attaches to limestone. When it dries {{it turns into a}} gray mud. Sawgrass and other water plants grow shorter in freshwater marl than they do in peat, the other type of soil in the Everglades which is found where water remains present longer throughout the year. Marl prairies are usually under water from three to seven months of the year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged for longer than nine months and sometimes remain under water from <b>one</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> the next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating a monoculture. Other grasses, such as muhly grass (Muhlenbergia filipes) and broad-leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Animals living in the freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry {{in some parts of the}} year; alligators play a vital role in maintaining life in remote parts of the Everglades by burrowing in the mud during the dry season, creating pools of water where fish and amphibians survive from <b>one</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> the next. Alligator holes also attract other animals who congregate to feed on smaller prey. When the region floods again during the wet season, the fish and amphibians who were sustained in the alligator holes then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.|$|E
5|$|Ixodid ticks require three hosts, {{and their}} life cycle {{takes at least}} <b>one</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> complete. Up to 3,000 eggs are laid on the ground by an adult female tick. When the larvae emerge, they feed {{primarily}} on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they detach from their host and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then feed on larger hosts and molt to adults. Female adults attach to larger hosts, feed, and lay eggs, while males feed very little and occupy larger hosts primarily for mating.|$|E
