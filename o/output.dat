The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%.

30|$|Several {{ideas and}} {{methods have been}} {{proposed}} to incorporate undesirable <b>outputs</b> into DEA approaches while assuming asymmetrical treatments of disposability between desirable <b>outputs</b> and undesirable <b>outputs</b> when production possibilities are defined [9]. An efficiency improvement strategy for inefficient DMUs is developed by holding one or two inputs, desirable <b>outputs</b> or undesirable <b>outputs</b> constant. For example, input orientation refers to a strategy that considers how much inputs can be reduced while holding both desirable and undesirable <b>outputs</b> unchanged (i.e., [10]). Some others suggest a bads orientation strategy, which considers how bads can be reduced while holding inputs and desirable <b>outputs</b> unchanged (i.e., [11]). Tyteca [11] also considers the third strategy, which examines how much bads and inputs can be reduced while holding desirable <b>outputs</b> unchanged. The other recent strategy to incorporate undesirable <b>outputs</b> is to consider the proportional reduction in inputs and undesirable <b>outputs</b> and the proportional increase in desirable <b>outputs</b> [12]. Based on the earlier method of simultaneous change in desirable <b>outputs</b> and undesirable <b>outputs</b> following a hyperbolic function where fixed inputs are assumed, Chung et al. [13] proposed an application of a directional distance function {{as well as a}} productivity index known as the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index. The directional distance function (DDF) defines a strategy in which desirable and undesirable <b>outputs</b> are simultaneously changed. While the efficiency measurement with a DDF model in a single year is measured as the Luenberger productivity index, an alternate application of the DDF model between t and t[*]+[*] 1 to measure the Luenberger productivity index {{in such a way that}} a Malmquist productivity index is constructed can generate the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index. Therefore, the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index can be further decomposed into efficiency change (catch-up) and technical progress (frontier-shift).|$|R
5|$|Early {{photovoltaic}} systems <b>output</b> decreased {{as much as}} 10%/year, but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5%/year, with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate, so that a system would lose only 12% of its <b>output</b> performance in 25 years. A system using modules which degrade 4%/year will lose 64% of its <b>output</b> during the same period. Many panel makers offer a performance guarantee, typically 90% in ten years and 80% over 25 years.
