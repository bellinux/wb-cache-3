Treated leachate was used at different dilution levels as biofertilizer for {{the cultivation of}} Brassica rapa <b>L.</b> (<b>leafy</b> <b>vegetable).</b> A treatment with inorganic fertilizer at the same N-equivalent as the leachate, and a control (water) were also included. Physical growth parameters (leaf length, leaf width, stem height) and harvest parameters (total number of leaves, root length and dry weights of different plant parts) were determined. The dry-weights of leaf, root and stem in (both) treatments had significantly higher biomass over the control. B. rapa receiving 25 %DTL had the highest specific growth rate for leaf length (0. 53 mm/d) and leaf width (0. 39 mm/d). Heavy metal accumulations in B. rapa grown with leachate and in B. rapa bought from the market were compared with the permissible concentration limit of FAO/WHO. Inorganic fertilizer did not give a better fertilizing effect in terms of plant yield and growth than the leachate treatments according to this study, but heavy metal accumulation makes the leachate unfit for fertilization of edible plants like Brassica rapa L...|$|R

This paper reports experiments in which treated leachate was used at different concentrations with predetermined N content for fertigation of Brassica rapa <b>L.</b> (<b>leafy</b> <b>vegetable).</b> An inorganic fertiliser, with N content {{equivalent to the}} leachate amount, was also prepared, {{as well as a}} control. Growth (leaf length, leaf width and stem height), harvest parameters (total number of leaves, root length and root dry weight) and specific growth rates (mm/day) were determined for three consecutive seasons. The dry weights of leaves, roots and stems in the leachate treatments were within the ranges of 1. 95 – 3. 60 g, 1. 18 – 3. 60 g and 0. 33 – 1. 37 g, with biomasses of 1. 75 g, 1. 14 g and 0. 2 g, respectively, which were higher than those of the control. B. rapa L. fertigated with 25 % diluted treated leachate recorded high specific growth rate and a leaf length of 0. 53 mm/day and 0. 23. 17 ± 0. 58 cm, respectively (%N= 0. 023; p"less than" 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract. Once <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> are picked, {{metabolism}} and inoculating microbes affect {{the quality of}} the products badly. This paper included a brief introduction on the various factors affecting the freshness and shelf-life of <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables,</b> with 3 types of treatments: antimicrobial gas or washing solutions (ozone, hydrogen peroxide, peroxyacetic acid, chlorine, electrolyzed oxidizing water, and silver solution), that are broadly applied on post-harvest <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> that help to reduce both spoilage microorganisms and pathogens. <b>Leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> {{are an important part of}} a daily diet which provide various vitamins and minerals essential for growth and health, such as vitamin A and iron. However, after harvesting them, the most spoilage of <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> are caused by microbial activity. Thus, there is a need for a freshness-keeping technology that can be applied during storage and transport. Various methods have been developed to preserve the freshness of <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Most freshness preserving methods focus on reducing or inhibiting microbial population, growth and activity, with more attention being placed in reducing and inhibiting food-borne pathogens such as Eschericia coli, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. Ozone (O 3) O 3 can be used as a relatively safe fruit and vegetable sanitizer as O 3 spontaneously decompose into nontoxic compounds, such as oxygen. By attacking cell envelopes, leakage of cell contents resulted in cell lysis; by attacking enzymes, O 3 interrupts the enzyme activity of microorganisms; while attacking the nucleic materials, O 3 interferes with the transcription activity of microorganisms [1] O 3 can be used to inhibit pathogens on <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Sing...|$|R
