The inversion is accomplished by defining closeness measures which allow diagnostic reasoning from <b>observed</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> cause of failures. The closeness measures are motivated by a Lukasiewicz operator which {{takes into account the}} distance from an <b>observed</b> <b>symptom</b> set <b>to</b> the modeled <b>symptom</b> set for all failure combinations. Hypothesized failures are then ranked according to maximum closeness measure and minimum cover, i. e., number of faults. Within the realm of fuzzy logic we show the graphical representation and solution of fuzzy belief nets...|$|R

The mCPP concentration was 320 ng/mL in plasma and 2300 ng/mL in urine. Amphetamine (40 ng/mL), benzoylecgonine (47 ng/mL) and alcohol (0. 7 g/L) were also detected in plasma.

40|$|An {{observed}} {{mortality and}} {{reduction in the}} growth rate of trees in forests across the United States and Europe led to the proposal of a number of possible causes for the forest decline. Connecting all the <b>observed</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> a single proposed cause has proven difficult. The term "decline" describes complex diseases that result in a progressive weakening of trees and lead to dieback, the death of portions of the foliated canopy (21). Gradual loss of vigor involving reduced growth rate and increased susceptibility to secondary stresses typically ensues. Death may occur unless the stress is removed. Among the factors that could have an effect on {{the growth rate of}} plants are climate conditions, soil moisture and nutrient availability, competition, insects, fungi, disease, and air pollution. Research focusing on the role of air pollutants in triggering the forest decline is complicated by the complex nature of the problem evident in the large number of variables introduced by other influencing factors. A single physiological effect may result from one or many causes. In turn, that symptom may become a factor that predisposes, incites, or contributes to still other physiological effects. Declines have been widespread in European and North American forests in recent decades. Economic and ecological impacts are great enough to cause much concern among scientists and in the forest industry. Indiana is not exempt from the problem of forest decline. White ash trees in northern Indiana forests have experienced alarming canopy dieback and mortality in recent years. This research paper will have as its purposes a review of the pertinent literature and a presentation of data describing the growth rate of white ash trees in Indiana.

Cases of the syndrome were first observed in three elderly female patients suffering from presenile dementia. Each of these women were undergoing treatment with the antipsychotic drug methylperone, haloperidol {{or a combination of}} the two. The use of neuroleptic drugs caused the patients to exhibit a lateral flexion along with a rotation of the trunk. As the patients walked they experienced an increase in rotation.

40|$|Abstract—We {{anticipate}} future attacks would evolve {{to become}} more sophisticated to outwit existing intrusion detection tech-niques. Existing anomaly analysis techniques and signature-based detection practices can no longer effective. We believe intrusion detection systems (IDSs) {{of the future will}} need to be capable to detect or infer attacks based on more valuable information from the network-related properties and characteristics. We observed that even though the signatures or traffic patterns of future steal-thy attacks can be modified to outwit current IDSs, certain beha-vioral aspects of an attack are invariant. We propose a novel ap-proach that jointly monitors network activities at three different levels: transport layer protocols, (vulnerable) network services, and invariant anomaly behaviors (called attack symptoms). Our system, SecMon, captures the network behaviors by simulta-neously performing cross-level state correlation for effective de-tection of anomaly behaviors. For the most part, the invariant anomaly behavior has not been fully exploited in the past. A probabilistic attack inference model is also proposed for attack assessment by correlating the <b>observed</b> attack <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> achieve the low false alarm rate. The evaluations demonstrate our prototype system is efficient and effective for sophisticated attacks, including polymorphism, stealthy, and unknown attack...|$|R
40|$|Bleaching {{refers to}} the loss of colour in symbioses between dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium and marine benthic animals, e. g. corals. Bleaching {{generally}} results in depressed growth and increased mortality, and it can be considered as a dele-terious physiological response or ailment. An explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching comprises three elements: the external factors or triggers of bleaching, e. g. elevated temperature; the symptoms, including elimination of algal cells and loss of algal pigment; and the mechanisms, which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers, resulting in the <b>observed</b> <b>symptoms.</b> The extent <b>to</b> which bleaching in different symbioses and in response to different triggers involves common mechanisms is currently unknown, but a contribution of interactions between the algal and animal partners to bleaching is predicted. Symbioses vary in their susceptibility to bleaching as a result of genetic variation in Symbiodinium and acclimatory responses of the animal. The evolu-tionary explanation for bleaching is obscure. Perhaps, bleaching was of selective advantage to the animal hosts under different (more benign?) environmental conditions than the present, or bleaching may be a negative by-product of an otherwise advantageous symbiotic trait, such as the elimination of damaged algal cells...|$|R

Propranolol had been stopped 1 to 14 days before each acute event because of angiographic study (seven patients), increasing symptoms (three), acute coronary insufficiency (one), asymptomatic bradycardia (one), elective surgery (one) and unknown reasons (two). Before abrupt {{cessation of}} propranolol treatment anginal symptoms had been stable in six instances but had increased in the other nine.

Three other patients underwent aortocoronary bypass surgery; perioperative acute myocardial infarction occurred in two.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Subjective, self-rated {{improvement}} {{in patients with}} schizophrenia spectrum disorders can carry significance as a first-person account of treatment outcome, and can be of importance for the individual patient's acceptance of further treatment, including psychological treatments. This study assessed the concordance between post-treatment subjective improvement and the <b>observed</b> <b>symptom</b> change after a psychotic episode. DESIGN: Longitudinal study based on daily symptom ratings. METHOD: The study sample consisted of 43 younger, primarily first- or second-episode patients. <b>Observed</b> <b>symptom</b> change was calculated as both pre-post differences and symptom trajectories. Subjective improvement was assessed {{at the end of}} treatment by using the 'Emotional and Behavioural Changes in Psychotherapy Questionnaire' (VEV), a retrospective measure of subjective change. RESULTS: The findings indicated no significant concordance between pre-post differences in symptoms and self-rated improvement, nor were final levels of <b>symptoms</b> related <b>to</b> subjective improvement. Higher initial and mean symptom levels for positive <b>symptoms</b> were related <b>to</b> a lower degree of subjective improvement. A shorter duration of an initial trend-like {{improvement in}} psychosis was shown to be associated with greater subjective improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective assessment of improvement may differ markedly from symptom change. In psychotic episodes, more severe initial positive symptoms as well as a delayed improvement of positive symptoms may be related to a reduced subjective experience of improvement {{for the duration of the}} entire episode. The treatment of psychosis should take a possible discordance between subjective and objective change into account...|$|R
