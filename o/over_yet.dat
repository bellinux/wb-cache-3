5|$|With The Evil Thing destroyed, Max, Sean and Cassie save Priscilla. She angrily {{yells at}} Cassie and calls her a witch, and Sean rejects Priscilla {{in favor of}} Cassie. After Priscilla leaves, they save the pizza {{delivery}} man, who offers them free pizza in return for releasing him, then follows Priscilla to hit on her, to her disgust. Cassie and Sean burn the book and set aside all their thoughts about The Evil Thing. Sean leaves shortly afterward. Cassie and Max's parents then come home and find the book in the fireplace. The father mockingly reads it out loud, reviving The Evil Thing. The film concludes with Cassie realizing that The Evil Thing has been brought back to life {{and that it is}} not <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 2 January 1987, at Perth, Australia batted first, {{and with}} Dean Jones smashing 121, the Aussies rattled 271/6(50 overs). Pakistan started briskly, but lost too many early wickets. When Mujtaba came to bat the Paks were {{struggling}} at 129/6, {{and the game}} looked <b>over.</b> <b>Yet,</b> Mujtaba {{changed the course of}} the match, with a brilliant 60* (of just 56 balls). Showing maturity beyond his years, he shared 3 partnerships, 53 with Manzoor Elahi (48), 53 more with WK Saleem Yousuf (31), and 43 with Wasim Akram, to take Pakistan to a 1 wicket victory. He was adjudged the Man of the Match.|$|E
25|$|A similar custom {{is celebrated}} among Orthodox Christians in Serbia on 15 February (2 February {{according}} to the local religious Julian calendar) during the feast of celebration of Sretenje or The Meeting of the Lord (Candlemas). It is believed that the bear will awaken from winter dormancy on this day, and if it sees (meets) its own shadow in this sleepy and confused state, it will get scared {{and go back to}} sleep for an additional 40 days, thus prolonging the winter. Thus, if it is sunny on Sretenje, it is a sign that the winter is not <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b> If it is cloudy, it is a good sign that the winter is about to end.|$|E

25|$|As Australian number 8 Steve Tuynman {{took the}} ball {{from the back of}} the scrum, he searched for Nick Farr-Jones, utilising the blind under Alan Jones' command. Farr-Jones {{occupied}} Campese opposite winger and passed the ball to him, allowing Campese to run along the left wing. At the start of his run, Campese ran past Butler, who was unable to make the defending tackle. But Campese's run was not <b>over</b> <b>yet,</b> he swerved past the Welsh fullback, and executed a wonderful sidestep to get past the Welsh inside center. Campese's sidestep led him toward a group of defenders, so he then offloaded to Simon Poidevin, who quickly passed the ball to Michael Lynagh who scored an easy try under the post. Australia won 28–9 in one of their greatest victories at the time.|$|E
25|$|Durham were a {{prime example}} of how the lack of three men can change a team. Three months earlier, Michael Hussey, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison had been firing for the Durham lads as they beat Leicestershire by an innings and 216 runs, the highest margin of victory in the County Championship so far this season - before this match. Without these three, and only with Nathan Astle and Ashley Noffke by way of replacement, they {{collapsed}} to 167 against the bowling of Glen Chapple and Gary Keedy, before Mal Loye made a double ton and Dominic Cork an unbeaten ton to give Lancashire a 363-run lead on first innings. Then, Chapple took four for 18, as Durham rolled <b>over</b> <b>yet</b> again for 135 - {{and all of a sudden}} the league leaders were transformed into laughing stocks.|$|E
25|$|The ten {{remaining}} war-junks anchored at {{the entrance}} of Bias Bay. Unbeknownst to the British, thirteen additional junks were nearby. Chui A-poo survived the battle, but the danger was not <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b> Commander Hay ordered that on 1 October, the remaining junks be attacked, so he sent a letter to Rear Admiral Sir Francis Augustus Collier requesting reinforcements while he prepared for further fighting. Collier dispatched the small six-gun sloop-of-war HMS Fury to the scene along with boats of marines from HMS Hastings. Under Commander John Willcox, the Fury arrived off Bias Bay where the Columbine and Canton were anchored. The pirates at this time fled further into the bay, but were still trapped by the Royal Navy. Only the small Pinghoi Creek provided a possible avenue for departure. On 1 October, the British attacked, destroying 23 additional junks and leaving Chui A-poo's base in ruins.|$|E

Muttiah Muralitharan, the Sri Lankan off-spinner, took four for 19 in four <b>overs,</b> <b>yet</b> Ackerman made 79 not out amid the carnage, lifting Leicestershire Foxes to 146 for 7. However, Stuart Law took matters into his own hands, bludgeoning twelve fours and four sixes on his way to 92 not out - the highest score of the season so far - and Lancashire won with four wickets and 23 deliveries to spare.|$|R

25|$|Vortigern agreed. Upon {{receiving}} the invitation, Octa, Ebissa, and another lord, Cherdich, immediately left for Britain with three hundred ships. Vortigern received them kindly, {{and gave them}} ample gifts. With their assistance, Vortigern defeated his enemies in every engagement. All the while Hengist continued inviting <b>over</b> <b>yet</b> more ships, adding to his numbers daily. Witnessing this, the Britons tried to get Vortigern to banish the Saxons, but {{on account of his}} wife he would not. Consequently, his subjects turned against him and took his son Vortimer for their king. The Saxons and the Britons, led by Vortimer, met in four battles. In the second, Horsa and Vortimer's brother, Catigern, slew one another. By the fourth battle, the Saxons had fled to Thanet, where Vortimer besieged them. When the Saxons could no longer bear the British onslaughts, they sent out Vortigern to ask his son to allow them safe passage back to Germany. While discussions were taking place, the Saxons boarded their ships and left, leaving their wives and children behind.|$|E
25|$|Hence Halbertsma {{expected}} to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment seemed almost within his grasp, but each time it slipped away. His sharp pen probably {{played a role in}} this, but there were other reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of Belgium, which at that time had just seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded. That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the University of Leiden, was scant consolation to him. In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced {{on the edge of a}} burn-out for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed <b>over</b> <b>yet</b> again, he went through a deep crisis. It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, that he seems to have achieved a state of mental composure.|$|E
25|$|Six {{minutes into}} the second quarter, Cowboys linebacker Lee Roy Jordan tackled Unitas, causing him to fumble. Dallas {{recovered}} the loose ball at the Baltimore 28 and capitalized three plays later, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Morton to Thomas to establish a 13-6 lead. The next time the Colts had the ball they quickly turned it <b>over</b> <b>yet</b> again, with Unitas unleashing a fluttering interception to Renfro while being hit fiercely on a pass. Unitas was knocked {{out of the game}} permanently on the play with a rib injury and was replaced by Earl Morrall, who was widely blamed for the Colts loss in Super Bowl III. The Cowboys, starting from their own 15, were unable to score any points off the turnover. After sustaining a 15-yard pass interference penalty, they punted. After regaining possession, the Colts offense, led by Morrall, stormed {{all the way to the}} Cowboys 2-yard line with less than two minutes remaining in the half. However, the Cowboys defense stiffened. Colts running back Norm Bulaich was stuffed on three consecutive rushing attempts from inside the 2-yard line. On fourth down, Morrall threw an incomplete pass, turning the ball over on downs and ending the half with Dallas leading 13–6.|$|E

25|$|After {{these events}} Psylocke's powers changed once again; she now possessed both telepathic and telekinetic abilities, {{but with her}} psionic {{potential}} divided between them, neither ability is {{as strong as it}} once was. The following days saw Betsy travel back in time alongside Beast's X-Club. Psylocke also led the X-Club in a mission to raise Asteroid M, which was {{at the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean, to serve as the X-Men's new base of operations and a haven for mutantkind, called Utopia. Soon after, Psylocke went to Japan with Wolverine to re-inter her former body. Upon arriving, she was ambushed by the Hand, who destroyed her original body at the behest of Matsu'o Tsurayaba. Enraged, Psylocke tracked Matsu'o down, finding him terribly disfigured as the result of Wolverine's yearly revenge on Matsu'o for his role in the murder of Mariko Yashida. Matsu'o, now missing both hands and other body parts, desired an honorable death and wanted Psylocke to grant him that honor since he could not hold a blade to perform seppuku himself. This put Psylocke at odds with Wolverine, who felt that Matsu'o's punishment was not <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b> Psylocke engaged Wolverine in a brutal fight which ended in a truce. With Wolverine's permission, Psylocke finished Matsu'o off mercifully, using her telepathy to project illusions into his mind of his body restored and of Kwannon embracing him. Psylocke quickly killed him with her psi-blade.|$|E

500|$|After a poor race in Canada, {{where he}} stalled {{on the grid}} before the {{formation}} lap before receiving a ten-second stop-go penalty as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race started, Coulthard said that Ferrari could still {{be caught in the}} season's nine remaining races: [...] "We have to look towards Magny-Cours and put this (Montreal) race behind us. The championship is not <b>over</b> <b>yet</b> and although we cannot change what happened in Canada, we can try to close the gap." [...] Former World Champion and President of the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) Jackie Stewart backed Coulthard to clinch the title after Häkkinen's continuing run of poor results. Michael Schumacher came into the race confident that his car would perform well at the circuit. Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore played down his team's chances saying, [...] "We need a miracle to finish on the podium." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} leg, Shankly was adamant that Liverpool would still progress: [...] "This tie {{is by no}} means <b>over</b> <b>yet.</b> We will win easily. We will smash in at least seven goals. This was ridiculous. Ajax played {{defensive}} football on their own ground. We never play well against defensive teams." [...] Such was the shock at the result that Shankly's claim was taken seriously. The defeat convinced Shankly that adopting Ajax's patient, passing style was the key to success in Europe. The defeat is still Liverpool's record defeat in European competition. Michels was worried that Liverpool might adopt aggressive tactics in the second leg: [...] "Our fear is that Liverpool may try to eliminate us through rough play. They showed some of this rough play in the first leg and they will play even harder in front of their own supporters". He also admitted that his side had some luck in the first leg but was adamant they would progress: [...] "There are not many great players in this Liverpool side, but they are all fighters. I agree we had some luck in Amsterdam, but I am sure we will go through." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Zandvoort, Rindt gained {{confidence}} in the new Lotus 72, describing it as [...] "the best racing car that exists at the moment". But he continued to have problems. During practice for the French Grand Prix, Rindt opted to drop his new all-enveloping Bell-Star crash helmet, finding it too hot. He went back to using his open-front helmet, only to be hit in the face by a stone from another car, causing a deep cut on his right cheek. He also suffered a steering failure on his car. Furious <b>over</b> <b>yet</b> another mechanical problem, he stormed into the Lotus garage and yelled at Colin Chapman: [...] "If this happens again and I survive, I will kill all of you!" [...] Rindt {{was still able to}} win the race, taking the lead in the championship. The next race was the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. Jacky Ickx established an early lead ahead of Brabham and Rindt, but when Ickx's transmission failed, Rindt seized the opportunity to pass Brabham for the lead. Brabham was then able to regain the top spot on lap 69 as Rindt missed a gear and looked the certain winner, only to repeat his misfortune of Monaco: on the last lap, he ran out of fuel, allowing Rindt to take his third win in a row. His victory was cast into doubt shortly after the race when Chief Scrutineer Cecil Mitchell found the rear aerofoil not at the regulated height. Rindt was provisionally disqualified, only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation.|$|E
