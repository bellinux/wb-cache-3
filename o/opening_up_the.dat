5|$|A local architect, Thomas Fosbrooke, {{carried out}} the first archaeological {{investigation}} of the site in 1900, and extensive restoration work took place the following years. The Rawdon family were given a government grant for further repairs in 1912 {{and they began to}} start charging visitors for entry. The family found themselves unable to afford to maintain the castle, and by the early 1930s the walls had become unstable and dangerous. The castle was placed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1932, who carried out repairs, replacing some stonework and <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> surrounding grounds to visitors.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{government}} began {{the construction of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway between eastern Canada and British Columbia in 1881, with the aim of <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> north-western territories for settlement. In response, the mounted police moved their headquarters to the town of Regina, the new territorial capital which had been founded alongside the railway line. The force was increased in size to 500 in 1882 to cope with the increased tasks being demanded of it, and the police began to use the railway to bring in recruits more easily from the eastern provinces.|$|E

The fire station closed in 1986, since when it has been largely unused despite several redevelopment proposals. It was placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register in 2001 and in 2010 Manchester City Council served a compulsory purchase order on the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels. Britannia announced in 2015 their intention to sell the building <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> possibility of redevelopment after nearly 30 years of dereliction.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Switzerland {{approved}} 1 billion francs of supportive {{investment in}} the poorer Southern and Central European countries in support of cooperation and positive ties to the EU as a whole. A further referendum {{will be needed to}} approve 300 million francs to support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission. The Swiss have also been under EU and sometimes international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and to raise tax rates to parity with the EU. Preparatory discussions are being opened in four new areas: <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> electricity market, participation in the European GNSS project Galileo, cooperating with the European centre for disease prevention and recognising certificates of origin for food products.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 1789, Representative James Madison {{introduced}} nine {{amendments to}} the constitution in the House of Representatives. Among his recommendations Madison proposed <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Constitution and inserting specific rights limiting the power of Congress in Article One, Section 9. Seven of these limitations would {{become part of the}} ten ratified Bill of Rights amendments. Ultimately, on September 25, 1789, Congress approved twelve articles of amendment to the Constitution, each consisting of one one-sentence paragraph, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison's original proposal that the articles be incorporated into {{the main body of the}} Constitution, they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it. Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution. Article Two became part of the Constitution on May 5, 1992, as the Twenty-seventh Amendment. Article One is technically still pending before the states.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} impacts of the {{revolution}} in Zanzibar was to break {{the power of the}} Arab/Asian ruling class, who had held it for around 200 years. Despite the merger with Tanganyika, Zanzibar retained a Revolutionary Council and House of Representatives which was, until 1992, run on a one-party system and has power over domestic matters. The domestic government is led by the President of Zanzibar, Karume being the first holder of this office. This government used the success of the revolution to implement reforms across the island. Many of these involved the removal of power from Arabs. The Zanzibar civil service, for example, became an almost entirely African organisation, and land was redistributed from Arabs to Africans. The revolutionary government also instituted social reforms such as free healthcare and <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> education system to African students (who had occupied only 12% of secondary school places before the revolution).|$|E
5|$|The Broadcasting Act 1990 led to {{the brief}} decline of UK pirate radio by {{encouraging}} diversity in radio and <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> development of commercial radio. Many pirate radio stations such as the London-based dance music station Kiss FM applied for licenses to the new Radio Authority and went legitimate. However, the number of unlicensed broadcasts has since increased, partly because many non-licensed broadcasters believed that the 1990 Act had actually undermined community-based stations and small scale radio entrepreneurs. Of the pirate radio stations that gained a license in the 1990s, such as Kiss FM, FTP in Bristol, WNK Radio in Haringey and KFM Radio in Stockport, only a few, such as Sunrise Radio in London, remained {{in the hands of}} the original owners. Most have become significantly more mainstream and target a broad audience as a result of commercial pressures to achieve greater audience numbers and a particular audience type sought by advertisers.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} left Henry with no legitimate son, {{his various}} nephews now the closest male heirs. Henry {{announced he would}} take a new wife, Adeliza of Louvain, <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> prospect of a new royal son, and the two were married at Windsor Castle in January 1121. Henry appears to have chosen {{her because she was}} attractive and came from a prestigious noble line. Adela seems to have been fond of Henry and joined him in his travels, probably to maximise the chances of her conceiving a child. The White Ship disaster initiated fresh conflict in Wales, where the drowning of Richard, Earl of Chester, encouraged a rebellion led by Maredudd ap Bleddyn. Henry intervened in North Wales that summer with an army and, although the King was hit by a Welsh arrow, the campaign reaffirmed royal power across the region.|$|E

5|$|While <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> attic door, Kyle is {{seized by}} an {{attacker}} and killed. They {{find out that}} the killer is Billy Lenz's sister Agnes, who has also set up the corpses of the sorority sisters around a Christmas tree. After Leigh falls through the floor of the attic, Kelli is attacked by both Agnes and Billy. While fighting, the Christmas tree catches fire while she and Agnes fall down into one of the holes in the wall. Managing to escape with Leigh's help, they set the house on fire and reach the hospital. At the hospital, Agnes, who had survived the fire, kills Leigh but Kelli manages to kill her using a defibrillator. When Billy chases her to the stairs, Kelli manages to knock him over, impaling him on the finial of a Christmas tree and finally killing him. She is last seen staring at Billy's corpse.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E
5|$|Nasmyth {{was also}} a highly {{influential}} teacher at the Trustee's Academy in Edinburgh. Among his students were painters who took the landscape tradition into the nineteenth century. They included Andrew Wilson (1780–1840), who would become Master of the Academy in 1818, the watercolourist Hugh William Williams (1773–1829), clergyman and artist John Thompson of Duddingston (1778–1840) and probably the artist that would be most directly influenced by Nasmyth, John Knox (1778–1845). Williams' most famous work are interpretive versions of Greek landscapes, based on sketches taken on his travels there, among them The Temple of Poseidon, Cape Sunium (1828). His close friend John Thompson focused on a dark dramatic version of Scottish landscape, as in his most famous work Fast Castle from Below (1824). Knox directly linked Nasmyth's style with the Romantic literature of Walter Scott. Knox's Landscape with Tourists at Lock Katrine (c. 1820), was a commentary on the tourist trade that {{grew up in the}} Trossachs {{in the aftermath of the}} publication of Scott's poem The Lady of the Lake in 1810. He {{was also a}}mong the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow. Towards the end of his career he undertook panoramic works of the views from the top of Ben Lomond, which played a part in <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Highlands as a spectacle that would be taken up by artists in the second half of the century.|$|E

5|$|Saint and Dayuma, in {{conjunction}} with SIL, negotiated {{the creation of an}} official Huaorani reservation in 1969, consolidating the Huaorani and consequently <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> area to commerce and oil exploration. By 1973, over 500 people lived in Tihueno, of which more than half had arrived in the previous six years. The settlement relied on aid from SIL, and as a Christian community, followed rules foreign to Huaorani culture like prohibitions on killing and polygamy. By the early 1970s, SIL began to question whether their impact on the Huaorani was positive, so they sent James Yost, a staff anthropologist, to assess the situation. He found extensive economic dependence and increasing cultural assimilation, and as a result, SIL ended its support of the settlement in 1976, leading to its disintegration and the dispersion of the Huaorani into the surrounding area. SIL had hoped that the Huaorani would return to the isolation in which they had lived twenty years prior, but instead they sought out contact with the outside world, forming villages of which many have been recognized by the Ecuadorian government.|$|E
5|$|The post-1785 period {{would see}} {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} of the college under Principal William Cleaver. The college began to be populated by gentlemen, its income doubling between 1790 and 1810, and academic success considerable. Efforts to reconstruct Brasenose were not completed, however, until {{the second half of}} the century with the addition of New Quad between 1886 and 1911. Brasenose's financial position remained secure, although under the tenure of Principal Edward Hartopp Cradock Brasenose's academic record waned greatly, with much of its success focussed on sports– where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing. The mid-Century Royal Commissions were navigated– although they were opposed in form, their recommendations welcomed including the submission of accounts. The election of Charles Buller Heberden as Principal in 1889 led to a reversal in Brasenose's academic failures, although its sporting performance suffered. Heberden was the first lay Principal, presiding over an increasingly secular college, <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> library to undergraduates, instituting an entrance exam for the first time and accepting Rhodes scholarships.|$|E
5|$|On 19 March 1662, Abraham Shipman was {{appointed}} the first Governor and General of the city, and his fleet arrived in Bombay in September and October 1662. On {{being asked to}} hand over Bombay and Salsette to the English, the Portuguese Governor contended that the island of Bombay alone had been ceded, and alleging irregularity in the patent, he {{refused to give up}} even Bombay. The Portuguese Viceroy declined to interfere and Shipman was prevented from landing in Bombay. He was forced to retire to the island of Anjediva in North Canara and died there in October 1664. In November 1664, Shipman's successor Humphrey Cooke agreed to accept Bombay without its dependencies. However, Salsette, Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala still remained under Portuguese possession. Later, Cooke managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala for the English. On 21 September 1668, the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668, led to the transfer of Bombay from Charles II to the English East India Company for an annual rent of £10 (equivalent retail price index of £1,226 in 2007). The Company immediately set about the task of <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> islands by constructing a quay and warehouses. A customs house was also built. Fortifications were built around Bombay Castle. A Judge-Advocate {{was appointed}} for the purpose of civil administration. George Oxenden became the first Governor of Bombay under the English East India Company on 23 September 1668. Gerald Aungier, who was appointed Governor of Bombay in July 1669, established the first mint in Bombay in 1670. He offered various business incentives, which attracted Parsis, Goans, Jews, Dawoodi Bohras, Gujarati Banias from Surat and Diu, and Brahmins from Salsette. He also planned extensive fortifications in the city from Dongri in the north to Mendham's Point (near present-day Lion Gate) in the south. The harbour was also developed during his governorship, with space for the berthing of 20 ships. In 1670, the Parsi businessman Bhimjee Parikh imported the first printing press into Bombay. Between 1661 and 1675 there was a sixfold increase in population from 10,000 to 60,000. Yakut Khan, the Siddi admiral of the Mughal Empire, landed at Bombay in October 1672 and ravaged the local inhabitants there. On 20 February 1673, Rickloffe van Goen, the Governor-General of Dutch India attacked Bombay, but the attack was resisted by Aungier. On 10 October 1673, the Siddi admiral Sambal entered Bombay and destroyed the Pen and Nagothana rivers, which were very important for the English and the Maratha King Shivaji. The Treaty of Westminster concluded between England and the Netherlands in 1674, relieved the British settlements in Bombay of further apprehension from the Dutch. In 1686, the Company shifted its main holdings from Surat to Bombay, which had become the administrative centre of all the west coast settlements then. Bombay was placed at the head of all the Company's establishments in India.|$|E
