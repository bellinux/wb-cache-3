5|$|Leaders of the Southern Baptists and United Methodists led {{opposition}} to the amendment during Wilkinson's administration, activating the Coalition Against a State Lottery. Despite the opposition, Kentucky voters approved the lottery amendment {{by a vote of}} 694,577 to 446,937 in the November 1988 elections. Days after the election, Wilkinson signed a proclamation calling a special legislative session to begin November 28 to pass legislation to implement the lottery. The call instructed the legislature to consider a bill based on the recommendations of Wilkinson's lottery commission. The recommendations included the establishment of a lottery board whose president and members would be appointed by the governor and could only be removed by the governor, and earmarked the first year's proceeds to be split evenly between early childhood education programs, programs for the elderly, and a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. Legislators insisted on more legislative control of the lottery and did not favor explicit earmarks for the proceeds, preferring to allocate them in the 1990 legislative session. They also objected to the lottery board's exemption from <b>open</b> <b>records</b> and open meetings laws.|$|E
5|$|Steve Fossett {{was well}} known for his world records and adventures in balloons, sailboats, gliders, and powered aircraft. He was an aviator of {{exceptional}} breadth of experience. He wanted {{to become the first}} person to achieve a solo balloon flight around the world (finally succeeding on his sixth attempt, in 2002, becoming the first person to complete an uninterrupted and unrefueled solo circumnavigation of the world in any kind of aircraft). He set, with co-pilot Terry Delore, 10 of the 21 Glider <b>Open</b> <b>records,</b> including the first 2,000km Out-and-Return, the first 1,500km Triangle and the longest Straight Distance flights. His achievements as a jet pilot in a Cessna Citation X include records for U.S. Transcontinental, Australia Transcontinental, and Round-the-World westbound non-supersonic flights. Prior to Fossett's aviation records, no pilot had held world records in more than one class of aircraft; Fossett held them in four classes.|$|E

500|$|In March 2016, the Campaign for Accountability (CfA), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group, made {{a request}} to Davis for access to public records under the Kentucky <b>Open</b> <b>Records</b> Act, seeking copies of {{retainer}} agreements and lawyer-client engagement agreements between Davis and her attorneys at Liberty Counsel. Liberty Counsel, which responded to the request on Davis' behalf, refused to comply, arguing that the documents were preliminary and private records {{are not subject to}} the Act. CfA appealed to the Office of the Kentucky Attorney General, which under Kentucky law has the authority to make binding rulings on the <b>Open</b> <b>Records</b> Act, and resubmitted its request to Davis' office in April 2016. The Attorney General's Office sought to privately review the records at issue to determine if an exemption applied, but Liberty Counsel refused to make most of the documents available for a private review. In an opinion issued on June 30, 2016, the Attorney General's Office determined that Davis had violated the <b>Open</b> <b>Records</b> Act, saying that her conduct had the effect of [...] "intentionally frustrating the attorney general's review of an <b>open</b> <b>records</b> request" [...] which [...] "would subvert the General Assembly's intent behind providing review by the attorney general." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} primary election, Williams {{made a series}} of {{politically}} unsavvy remarks in an interview published by a weekly online magazine devoted to Kentucky agricultural issues; among the gaffes were calling the state agricultural development board and long-time Kentucky Democratic Senator Wendell H. Ford [...] "a bunch of damn liars". State Democratic chairman Jonathan Miller called Williams' statements [...] "offensive" [...] and said that several of the party's executive committee members desired to have Williams removed as the party's candidate. In June, Williams was arrested on misdemeanor charges of menacing, disorderly conduct, and harassment for allegedly threatening his niece, the city clerk of Glasgow, Kentucky, because she did not produce records he had requested under Kentucky's <b>open</b> <b>records</b> law. His trial was not scheduled until after the election.|$|E

In some respects the Open was even tougher than the 1992 contest, with only one player finishing under par - champion Tiger Woods. Woods scored 65-69-71-67 to tie a U.S. <b>Open</b> <b>record</b> with 272, and set a U.S. <b>Open</b> <b>record</b> by finishing 12 under par, 15 shots ahead of the runners-up, the largest margin of victory ever in a major championship.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the trial}} ended, the District Attorney's office {{received}} numerous open record requests for the videotape. David McDade inquired of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia whether the videotape {{had to be}} released under the <b>Open</b> <b>Records</b> Act. The Council concluded that [...] "if no one has filed for a protection order ... claiming that disclosure of the video tape would invade individual privacy, we can find no reason why disclosure of the video tape is not required under ... the <b>Open</b> <b>Records</b> Act." [...] Ignoring {{the fact that it}} was the Legislature that wrote the <b>Open</b> <b>Records</b> Law (and which caused the initial controversy by refusing to apply the [...] "Romeo and Juliet" [...] clause retroactively), Georgia State Sen. Emanuel Jones said he would introduce legislation to block district attorneys from handing over photographic images in sex cases. [...] "'I'm going to call it the David McDade Act,' Jones said. 'Sometimes we have to protect our kids from district attorneys.'" [...] Because the participants shown having sex in the video were under 18, the videotape constitutes child pornography under federal law. [...] The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act prohibits prosecutors from allowing defendants in criminal proceedings to possess a copy of any evidence that constitutes child pornography, even if the purpose is to mount a defense against the charge. Under this law, Wilson and his defense team are prohibited from having a copy of the videotape that prosecutor McDade has distributed to anyone else who has requested it.|$|E

In May 2013, Bernadette competed at the 10th International Association of Ultrarunners World 24 Hour Championships, where she ran 216.343 km, breaking five Australian and three Canadian records along the way, including the Canadian female <b>open</b> 24 hour <b>record.</b> However, at the Coburg 24 Hour Carnival and concurrent Australian National 24 Hour Championships in April 2014, Bernadette bettered that performance with 238.261 km, breaking her own Canadian <b>open</b> <b>record</b> as well as the Australian 24hr <b>open</b> <b>record.</b> Her 100-mile split time of 15hr 38 min 18sec broke both the Canadian and Australian <b>open</b> 100 mile <b>records.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Fletcher's term {{in office}} was marred by a hiring scandal that {{involved}} violations of the state merit system.

Patton, regarding acceptable and unacceptable hiring under the merit system.

2500|$|Picking {{up where}} he had left off in 1999, Woods started 2000 with his fifth {{consecutive}} victory and began a record-setting season. He extended his win streak to six at the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February with a memorable comeback—trailing by seven strokes with seven holes to play, he finished eagle-birdie-par-birdie for a 64 and a two-stroke victory. His six consecutive wins were the most since Ben Hogan in 1948 and only five behind Byron Nelson's record of eleven in a row. In the 2000 U.S. Open, he broke or tied nine U.S. <b>Open</b> <b>records</b> with his 15-shot win, including Old Tom Morris's record for the largest victory margin ever in a major championship, which had stood since 1862, and became the Tour's all-time career money leader. He led by a record ten strokes going into the final round, and Sports Illustrated called it [...] "the greatest performance in golf history." [...] In the 2000 Open Championship at St Andrews, which he won by eight strokes, he set the record for lowest score to par (−19) in any major tournament, and Woods at one time held at least a share of that record in all four major championships (since eclipsed by Rory McIlroy's −16 at the 2011 U.S. Open and Jason Day's −20 at the 2015 PGA Championship). At 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam.|$|E
