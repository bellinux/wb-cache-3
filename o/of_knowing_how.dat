At that time, Dan Meyer and Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in Popular Electronics. Meyer had built a million dollar a year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts wanted to do the same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business.

Regarding the previous statement, the singer said she wanted people to understand that she was normal, and how they could relate to her. Tisdale titled the album Headstrong, because she calls herself a [...] "headstrong" [...] type of person, commenting that she was the term in the sense <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> she wants to look, sing, and come across.

500|$|Cobain's rhythm guitar style, which {{relied on}} power chords, low-note riffs, and a loose left-handed technique, {{featured}} the key components to the band’s songs. Cobain would often initially play a song's verse riff {{in a clean}} tone, then double it with distorted guitars when he repeated the part. In some songs the guitar would be absent from the verses entirely to allow the drums and bass guitar to support the vocals, or it would only play sparse melodies like the two-note pattern used in [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Cobain rarely played standard guitar solos, opting to play slight variations of the song's melody as single note lines. Cobain's solos were mostly blues-based and discordant, which music writer Jon Chappell described as [...] "almost an iconoclastic parody of the traditional instrumental break", a quality typified by the note-for-note replication of the lead melody in [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] and the atonal solo for [...] "Breed". When asked about their musical education, the band states {{that they had no}} formal musical training. In fact, Cobain says: [...] "I have no concept <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> to be a musician at all what-so-ever... I couldn't even pass Guitar 101".|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to ensure {{conflicts}} of interests are managed constructively, in the 1960s Johnson began a program of teaching elementary, secondary, and university students to be “peacemakers” in the sense <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> to engage in integrative negotiations and mediate peer conflicts. [...] The Teaching Students To Be Peacemakers program consists of (a) teaching students how conflicts are potentially constructive, (b) the strategies for managing conflicts, (c) how to engage in integrative negotiations, and (d) how to mediate conflicts among peers. [...] All students in a class or school are trained, and then each takes his or her turn at being a peer mediator. [...] While there are many conflict resolution and peer mediation training programs, what makes this one unique {{is that it is}} based on the theory concerning constructive conflict and has been more thoroughly researched.|$|E

2500|$|P. P. Carp was {{an outspoken}} critic of generic intolerance, seeing it as the enemy of civic values. Speaking in 1892, he theorized: [...] "Culturally speaking, the first sign of a {{backward}} state is intolerance. When somebody thinks that only he is right, that there is nothing outside his brain and absolutely nothing in social life, he is an uncultured being, who never had a chance <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> varied, how many, there are manifestations of human thinking." [...] As Carp noted, the natural breakdown of [...] "forms without content", and the disruption of traditional lifestyles, had made it tempting for regular Romanians, and for crowd-pleasing orators, to use the Jew as a scapegoat. Carp's political isolation was only increased by such discourse. According to Virgil Nemoianu, Carp was his usual [...] "trenchant" [...] speaker on this subject as well. Historian Armin Heinen notes that, with the minor socialist movement and, at times, Maiorescu, Carp was {{one of the very few}} to demand collective Jewish emancipation in the final quarter of the 19th century.|$|E
