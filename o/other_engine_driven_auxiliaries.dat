50|$|The BM-27 Uragan {{is capable}} of {{launching}} 220 mm rockets from 16 launch tubes mounted on the rear of a ZIL-135 8x8 chassis. This vehicle is extremely {{similar to that used}} in the FROG-7 free flight rocket system. It has two gasoline engines that power its 20 tonnes to a maximum speed of 65 kilometers per hour. One <b>engine</b> <b>drives</b> the four wheels on the left of the truck, while the <b>other</b> <b>engine</b> <b>drives</b> the four wheels on the right. The ZIL-135 has eight wheel drive, but only the front and rear axles are used for steering. It has a maximum cruising range of 500 kilometers.|$|R

5000|$|The flight {{engineer}} ("air engineer" [...] in the Royal Air Force) is {{primarily concerned with}} the operation and monitoring of all aircraft systems, [...] and is required to diagnose, and where possible rectify or eliminate, any faults that may arise. On most multi-engine airplanes, the FE sets and adjusts engine power during take off, climb, cruise, go-arounds, or at any time the pilot flying requests a specific power setting to be set during the approach phase. The FE sets and monitors major systems, including fuel, pressurization and air conditioning, hydraulic, electrics (<b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> generators, <b>auxiliary</b> power units), gas turbine compressor/air turbine motor (APU, GTC, ATM), ice and rain protection (engine and nacelle anti-ice, window heat, probe heater), oxygen, fire and overheat protection of all systems, liquid cooling system (Boeing E-3), draw through cooling system (Boeing E-3), forced air cooling system (Boeing E-3), and powered flying controls.|$|R
5000|$|A pulsejet {{engine is}} an {{air-breathing}} reaction engine that employs an ongoing sequence of discrete combustion events {{rather than one}} sustained combustion event. This clearly distinguishes it from <b>other</b> reaction <b>engine</b> types such as rockets, turbojets and ramjets, which are all constant combustion devices. All <b>other</b> reaction <b>engines</b> are <b>driven</b> by maintaining high internal pressure; pulsejets are driven by an alternation {{between high and low}} pressure. This alternation is not maintained by any mechanical contrivance, but rather by the natural acoustic resonance of the rigid tubular engine structure. The valveless pulsejet is, mechanically speaking, the simplest form of pulsejet, and is, in fact, the simplest known air-breathing propulsion device that can operate [...] "statically", i.e. without forward motion.|$|R
40|$|The {{testing of}} a {{prototype}} of an automotive Stirling engine, the Mod II, is discussed. The Mod II is a one-piece cast block with a V- 4 single-crankshaft configuration and an annular regenerator/cooler design. The initial testing of Mod II concentrated on the basic <b>engine,</b> with <b>auxiliaries</b> <b>driven</b> by power sources external to the engine. The performance of the engine was tested at 720 C set temperature and 820 C tube temperature. At 720 C, it is observed that the power deficiency is speed dependent and linear, with a weak pressure dependency, and at 820 C, the power deficiency is speed and pressure dependent. The effects of buoyancy and nozzle spray pattern on the heater temperature spread are investigated. The characterization of the oil pump and the operating cycle and temperature spread tests are proposed for further evaluation of the engine...|$|R

50|$|Front mounted {{longitudinal}} <b>engines</b> with rear-wheel <b>drive</b> (FR) is {{a common}} layout of luxury cars. European marques like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar have almost never adopted front mounted <b>engines</b> with front-wheel <b>drive</b> (FF) and retained a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars. Japanese brands such as Lexus and Infiniti also have predominantly FR lineups. The FR layout, while {{more expensive than the}} FF, has been retained by these luxury manufacturers as it allows for higher performance engines (particularly the straight-6, V8, and <b>other</b> <b>engine</b> configurations with more cylinders), better handling, and a smoother ride.|$|R
