5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, the {{influence}} of the romance tradition <b>of</b> <b>Arthur</b> continued, through novels such as T. H. White's The Once and Future King (1958) and Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon (1982) in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant (from 1937 onward). Tennyson had reworked the romance tales <b>of</b> <b>Arthur</b> to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Bradley's tale, for example, takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives <b>of</b> <b>Arthur</b> found in medieval materials, and American authors often rework the story <b>of</b> <b>Arthur</b> to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy. The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical Camelot (1960) and the Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone (1963); Camelot, with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding <b>of</b> <b>Arthur,</b> was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition <b>of</b> <b>Arthur</b> is particularly evident and, according to critics, successfully handled in Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac (1974), Eric Rohmer's Perceval le Gallois (1978) and perhaps John Boorman's fantasy film Excalibur (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).|$|E
5|$|Among {{the bands}} that {{regularly}} played the university, including Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd, they were particularly impressed by The Crazy World <b>of</b> <b>Arthur</b> Brown, and recruited an organist, Nick Pearne, {{to match the}} format <b>of</b> <b>Arthur</b> Brown's band. Along with two female dancers, the initial line-up was Hammill on guitar and vocals, Smith on drums, wind instruments and vocals, and Pearne on organ (though he did not initially have an instrument). According to Smith, the band initially played as a two-piece, with Smith occasionally using a typewriter as a percussion instrument; their first gig as a three-piece was in the student union, which lasted five minutes before the group's amplifiers blew up.|$|E

In this case, the contribution is remarkably given by a global unipotent weighted orbital integral. As a corollary, we get integral formulas for some <b>of</b> <b>Arthur's</b> global coefficients.

5|$|King Arthur is {{a legendary}} British leader who, {{according}} to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders {{in the late}} 5th and early 6th centuries AD.

The sparse historical background <b>of</b> <b>Arthur</b> is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas.
