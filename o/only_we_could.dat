Tucker concluded by saying that the event was [...] "easily one of the best Manias of the last ten years" [...] and that [...] "the future certainly does look bright. If <b>only</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have said our good-byes properly".|$|E

2500|$|But oh, if <b>only</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do Hernani {{instead that}} would be tremendous. [...] I know that it would mean {{a great deal of}} trouble for the poet but my first task would be to try and {{compensate}} him..... all he would have to do would be to condense and tighten up; the action is already there ready made, and it's all immensely good theatre. Tomorrow I'll write at length to Piave setting out all the scenes from Hernani which seem to me suitable.|$|E
