5|$|The current Laplace {{resonance}} {{is unable}} to pump the <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity</b> of Ganymede to a higher value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible. The Ganymedian <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity</b> is somewhat puzzling; {{if it is not}} pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede. This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago. Because Ganymede's <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity</b> is relatively low—on average 0.0015—tidal heating is negligible now. However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able to pump the <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity</b> to a value as high as 0.01–0.02. This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.|$|E
5|$|Of all the {{measured}} parameters for this planet, the value for <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity</b> {{is the most}} uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity is inconsistent {{with the presence of}} the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3AU. If the eccentricity was actually this high, the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity of about 0.10–0.15. If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet's <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity</b> are needed to explain the dust distribution.|$|E

5|$|Mars has a {{relatively}} pronounced <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity</b> of about 0.09; {{of the seven}} other planets in the Solar System, only Mercury has a larger <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity.</b> It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much more circular orbit. At one point, 1.35 million Earth years ago, Mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002, much {{less than that of}} Earth today. Mars's cycle of eccentricity is 96,000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years. Mars has a much longer cycle of eccentricity, with a period of 2.2 million Earth years, and this overshadows the 96,000-year cycle in the eccentricity graphs. For the last 35,000 years, the orbit of Mars has been getting slightly more eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the other planets. The closest distance between Earth and Mars will continue to mildly decrease for the next 25,000 years.|$|E

Thus, an interesting and important question will be whether extrasolar planetary systems could have structures like Kuiper Belt or asteroid belt. We investigate the stability of these planetary systems with different <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricities</b> by the similar procedures in Rabl & Dvorak (1988) and Holman & Wiegert (1999).

5|$|The moons of Jupiter and Saturn {{are thought}} to have formed through co-accretion, a similar process to that {{believed}} to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. Whereas Jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular, planet-like orbits, Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn's system and possesses a high <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity</b> not immediately explained by co-accretion alone. A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn's system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter's Galilean satellites, but that they were disrupted by a series of giant impacts, which would go on to form Titan. Saturn's mid-sized moons, such as Iapetus and Rhea, were formed from the debris of these collisions. Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan's <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{orbits of}} Solar System planets are nearly circular.

40|$|We {{probe the}} ability of various types of post-Newtonian(PN) -accurate {{circular}} templates to capture inspiral gravitational-wave (GW) signals from compact binaries having tiny <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricities.</b> The GW signals are constructed by adapting the phasing formalism, available in T.

40|$|Orbits {{of known}} extrasolar planets that are located outside the tidal {{circularization}} regions of their parent stars are often substantially eccentric. By contrast, planetary orbits in our Solar System are approximately circular, reflecting planet formation within a nearly axisymmetric, circumsolar disk. We propose that <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricities</b> may be generated by divergent orbital migration of two planets in a viscously accreting circumstellar disk. The migration is divergent {{in the sense}} that the ratio of the orbital period of the outer planet to that of the inner planet grows. As the period ratio diverges, the planets traverse, but are not captured into, a series of mean-motion resonances that amplify their <b>orbital</b> <b>eccentricities</b> in rough inverse proportion to their masses.
