5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results {{in a series of}} genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E

5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales.

The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
