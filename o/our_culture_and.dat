500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The Daily Telegraph, British doctor and science writer James Le Fanu was critical, and commented that Taylor did not {{acknowledge}} [...] "the explanatory gap" [...] between current understanding of the brain's structure and [...] "what it does, how we think, feel and emote". Le Fanu concluded, [...] "The paradox of Brainwashing is {{that it would have been}} a much more interesting book if Dr Taylor had pursued the contrarian view of seeking to explain why that 'explanatory gap' is not merely unbridged but, with the advance of the neurosciences, now seems to be unbridgeable. A brain that was simple enough to be fully known would be too simple to contain conscious observers who might know it." [...] Nigel Hawkes of The Times criticized what he saw as Taylor's conclusion that [...] "we are all a little bit brainwashed by <b>our</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> experience" [...] and noted that this assessment places Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple group in the same classification as the tabloid press. [...] A review in Financial Times by Jerome Burne was also critical, and he commented that Taylor does not convey [...] "a clear enough message" [...] in the work.|$|E

Madonna had the idea for the music video in November 2002, then she and Åkerlund developed the idea to make an anti-war and anti-fashion mini-movie. With [...] "American Life", she took her music videos to a different level by focusing on war, politics and, according to media interpretation, the then-upcoming invasion of Iraq. [...] "It is an antiwar statement..." [...] she subsequently clarified, [...] "but it's not necessarily against this war. At any given moment there's at least 30 wars going on in this world and I'm against all of them." [...] Shortly after it was filmed, Warner Bros. Records released a statement regarding the music video: [...] " [...] expresses a panoramic view of <b>our</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> looming war through the view of a female superhero portrayed by Madonna. Starting as a runway show of couture army fatigues, the fashion show escalates into a mad frenzy depicting the catastrophic repercussions and horrors of war." [...] An exclusive sneak peek of the video was available on VH1's program Backstage at the Grammys.|$|E

Dearboy graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice from AME Zion College. He is the Project Manager for Liberia Trading & Investment Company (LINTRACO), one of Liberia's newest trading groups. Dearboy has a huge following among Liberians in the diaspora, particularly in the United States. In an interview posted on Oberia.net, Sundaygar said: [...] "Outside Liberia, my music is highly appreciated and supported by those who think my music helps virtually transport and reconnect them with their homeland. I find it gratifying that they support me. However, it is very disappointing that such support is not given to my music or artists locally. I also think that my music comes fore front as we rebuild our lives and try to reconsolidate <b>our</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> tradition." [...] Speaking on the challenges currently facing the Liberian Music Industry, Dearboy said: [...] "Not many local artists listen to other music and try to emulate or learn from them. Plus, the local market is not accustomed to promoting what belongs to them. They prefer something from outside. Perhaps, the generally quality of production does not meet the standard as those produced in other countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Psychoanalysis {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as both radical and conservative. By the 1940s, {{it had come to}} be seen as conservative by the European and American intellectual community. Critics outside the psychoanalytic movement, whether on the political left or right, saw Freud as a conservative. Fromm had argued that several aspects of psychoanalytic theory served the interests of political reaction in his The Fear of Freedom (1942), an assessment confirmed by sympathetic writers on the right. In [...] (1959), Philip Rieff portrayed Freud as a man who urged men {{to make the best of}} an inevitably unhappy fate, and admirable for that reason. In the 1950s, Herbert Marcuse challenged the then prevailing interpretation of Freud as a conservative in Eros and Civilization (1955), as did Lionel Trilling in Freud and the Crisis of <b>Our</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>and</b> Norman O. Brown in Life Against Death (1959). Eros and Civilization helped make the idea that Freud and Karl Marx were addressing similar questions from different perspectives credible to the left. Marcuse criticized neo-Freudian revisionism for discarding seemingly pessimistic theories such as the death instinct, arguing that they could be turned in a utopian direction. Freud's theories also influenced the Frankfurt School and critical theory as a whole.|$|E
60|$|We {{may well}} be on our guard against a vaunting nationalism. It retards our culture. There should be no {{confusion}} of the second-rate values of most of our American products with the supreme values of the greatest British classics. We may work, of course, toward an ultimate appreciation of these greatest things. We fail, however, in securing such appreciation because we have failed to enlist those forms of interest which vitalize and stimulate literary studies--above all, the patriotic or national interest. Concord and Cambridge should be dearer, as they are nearer, to the young American than even Stratford and Abbotsford; Hawthorne should be as familiar as Goldsmith; and Emerson, as Addison or Burke. Ordinarily it is not so; and we suffer the consequences in the failure of our youth to grasp the spiritual ideals and the distinctively American democratic spirit which find expression in the greatest work of our literary masters, Emerson and Whitman, Lowell and Lanier. <b>Our</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> our nationalism both suffer thereby. Our literature suffers also, because we have not an instructed and interested public to encourage excellence.|$|E
