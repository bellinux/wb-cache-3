And unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe.|$|E
500|$|The {{existing}} audio was remastered using reverberation, depth, {{and spatial}} effects {{to enhance the}} overall ambiance of the game; one example a developer from Raven made note <b>of</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Layering out multiple sounds now makes a big difference". Other sound effects that were not present in Modern Warfare were also used, including unused audio channels that had been created for the original, but due to restraints had not been included during its development. The original music and voice performances were retained, {{with the exception of}} the campaign dialogue spoken by Al-Asad which was amended and re-recorded.|$|E
500|$|All we can {{be certain}} <b>of</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> {{if there was a}} bishop of Llanbadarn in 601 – and {{possibly}} 720 – there appears to have been none in later years (though note the later use of the style [...] "bishop" [...] during Gerald of Wales's visit in 1188). But that did not diminish the power and influence of the clas at Llanbadarn Fawr. By the middle of the ninth century the clas was clearly the wealthiest in the province. The renowned Asser, scholar and adviser to Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, may have been educated at Llanbadarn Fawr. If this is correct it would be a strong indication that Llanbadarn's reputation for learning was well-founded.|$|E

500|$|The {{symbol of}} the slave ship is furthered by {{specific}} set designs, including the round window in Ben Geisler's office which resembles a porthole, {{as well as the}} walkway leading to Mayhew's bungalow, which resembles the boarding ramp of a watercraft. Several lines of dialogue make clear by the film's end that Barton has become a slave to the studio: [...] "he contents of your head", Lipnick's assistant tells him, [...] "are the property of Capitol Pictures". After Barton turns in his script, Lipnick delivers an even more brutal punishment: [...] "Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write". This contempt and control is representative of the opinions expressed by many writers in Hollywood at the time. As Arthur Miller said in his review of Barton Fink: [...] "The only thing about Hollywood that I am sure <b>of</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> its mastication of writers can never be too wildly exaggerated".|$|E

500|$|Orville {{followed}} his brother's success by demonstrating another nearly identical Flyer to the United States Army at Fort Myer, Virginia, starting on September 3, 1908. On September 9, {{he made the}} first hour-long flight, lasting 62 minutes and 15 seconds. On September 17, Army lieutenant Thomas Selfridge rode along as his passenger, serving as an official observer. A few minutes into the flight {{at an altitude of}} about , a propeller split and shattered, sending the Flyer out of control. Selfridge suffered a fractured skull in the crash and died that evening in the nearby Army hospital, becoming the first airplane crash fatality. Orville was badly injured, suffering a broken left leg and four broken ribs. Twelve years later, after he suffered increasingly severe pains, X-rays revealed the accident had also caused three hip bone fractures and a dislocated hip. The brothers' sister Katharine, a school teacher, rushed from Dayton to Virginia and stayed by Orville's side for the seven weeks of his hospitalization. She helped negotiate a one-year extension of the Army contract. A friend visiting Orville in the hospital asked, [...] "Has it got your nerve?" [...] "Nerve?" [...] repeated Orville, slightly puzzled. [...] "Oh, do you mean will I be afraid to fly again?

500|$|During the {{beginning}} of season three, Chris Carabott from IGN described Ben as [...] "one of the best 'villains on television', due to his 'eerie manner' and 'methodical delivery'". Later in the season Carabott {{had a problem with}} Ben being so deceptive, as [...] "anything he imparts must be taken with a grain of salt". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly also noted this, saying [...] "I don't trust Ben. I have no idea when he's lying and when he's telling the truth. The only thing I'm reasonably sure <b>of</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> everything he says is for the purpose of impacting a character — and the audience". Ben's father issues revealed towards the end of season three are described as [...] "not the most original Lost character trait by any means but it is the thrust behind Ben's development into the genocidal maniac he eventually becomes". Following the penultimate episode of the season, Carabott stated [...] "Even with his limited screen time, Michael Emerson's performance shines through and we hope that he survives the events of the finale because we love seeing his character every week." [...] Erin Martell from TV Squad picked the Others as one of her season three highlights, partly due to the development of Ben, adding [...] "I cannot even picture the final three seasons without Ben". Martell also gave six reasons to look forward to season four, one of which was Ben Linus.|$|E
