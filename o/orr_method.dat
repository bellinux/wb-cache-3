40|$|The optimal ranking regime (<b>ORR)</b> <b>method</b> {{was used}} to {{identify}} 6 – 100 -year time windows containing significant ranking sequences in 55 western US streamflow reconstructions, and reconstructions {{of the level of}} the Great Salt Lake and San Francisco Bay salinity during 1500 – 2007. The method's ability to identify optimally significant and non-overlapping runs of low- and high-rankings allows it to re-express a reconstruction time series as a simplified sequence of regime segments marking intra- to multi-decadal (IMD) periods of low or high streamflow, lake level, and salinity. Those ORR sequences, referred to here as Z -lines, can be plotted to identify consistent regime patterns in the analysis of numerous reconstructions. The Z -lines for the 57 reconstructions evaluated here show a common pattern of IMD cycles of drought and pluvial periods during the late 16 th and 17 th centuries, a relatively dormant period during the 18 th century, and the reappearance of alternating dry and wet IMD periods during the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Although this pattern suggests the possibility of similarly active and inactive oceanic modes in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, such centennial-scale patterns are not evident in the ORR analyses of reconstructed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and North Atlantic sea-surface temperature variation. However, given the inconsistency in the analyses of four PDO reconstructions, the possible role of centennial-scale oceanic mechanisms is uncertain. In future research the <b>ORR</b> <b>method</b> might be applied to climate reconstructions around the Pacific Basin to try to resolve this uncertainty. Given its ability to compare regime patterns in climate reconstructions derived using different methods and proxies, the method may also be used in future research to evaluate long-term regional temperature reconstructions...|$|E

40|$|The optimal ranking regime (<b>ORR)</b> <b>method</b> {{was used}} to {{identify}} intradecadal to multidecadal (IMD) time windows containing significant ranking sequences in U. S. climate division temperature data. The simplicity of the ORR procedure’s output—a time series’ most significant nonoverlapping periods of high or low rankings—makes it possible to graphically identify common temporal breakpoints and spatial patterns of IMD variability in the analyses of 102 climate division temperature series. This approach is also applied to annual Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) climate indices, a Northern Hemisphere annual temperature (NHT) series, and divisional annual and seasonal temperature data during 1896 – 2012. In addition, Pearson correlations are calculated between PDO, AMO, and NHT series and the divisional temperature series. Although PDO phase {{seems to be an}} important influence on spring temperatures in the northwestern United States, eastern temperature regimes in annual, winter, summer, and fall temperatures are more coincident with cool and warm phase AMO regimes. Annual AMO values also correlate significantly with summer temperatures along the Eastern Seaboard and fall temperatures in the U. S. Southwest. Given evidence of the abrupt onset of cold winter temperatures in the eastern United States during 1957 / 58, possible climate mechanisms associated with the cause and duration of the eastern U. S. warming hole period—identified here as a cool temperature regime occurring between the late 1950 s and late 1980 s—are discussed...|$|E

Introduction Radial basis functions have been extensively used for interpolation [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] regression and classification due to their universal approximation properties and simple parameter estimation. The parameter estimation requires a (pseudo) inversion of a (possibly sparse) matrix. The possible numerical instability of the inversion (which is aggravated when the number of training patterns is small compared to the dimensionality) may be partially alleviated by further parame [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In Part I of this paper, {{the optimal}} ranking regime (<b>ORR)</b> <b>method</b> {{was used to}} {{identify}} intradecadal to multidecadal (IMD) regimes in U. S. climate division temperature data during 1896 – 2012. Here, the method is used to test for annual and seasonal precipitation regimes during that same period. Water-year mean streamflow rankings at 125 U. S. Hydro-Climatic Data Network gauge stations are also evaluated during 1939 – 2011. The precipitation and streamflow regimes identified are compared with ORR-derived regimes in the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), and indices derived from gridded SST anomaly (SSTA) analysis data. Using a graphic display approach that allows for the comparison of IMD climate regimes in multiple time series, an interdecadal cycle in western precipitation is apparent after 1980, as is a similar cycle in northwestern streamflow. Before 1980, IMD regimes in northwestern streamflow and annual precipitation are in approximate antiphase with the PDO. One of the clearest IMD climate signals found in this analysis are post- 1970 wet regimes in eastern U. S streamflow and annual precipitation, {{as well as in}} fall [September–November (SON) ] precipitation. Pearson correlations between time series of annual and seasonal precipitation averaged over the eastern United States and SSTA analysis data show relatively extensive positive correlations between warming tropical SSTA and increasing fall precipitation. The possible Pacific and northern Atlantic roots of the recent eastern U. S. wet regime, as well as the general characteristics of U. S. climate variability in recent decades that emerge from this analysis and that of Part I, are discussed...|$|E

The proposed <b>ORR</b> scheduling <b>method</b> {{is compared to}} greedy scheduling. In greedy scheduling, the base station selects the best user based on a certain criterion without any consideration for fairness. On the other hand, ORR scheduling guarantees full fairness and each user will be served by excluding the previous selected users from the competition in the next round. The selected user spatially multiplexes his data over the transmit antennas. This spatial multiplexing (SM) scheme provides high data rates, while multiuser diversity obtained from scheduling improves {{the performance of the}} uplink system. The results show the performance and capacity gains obtained by scheduling. The greedy scheduler captures full multiuser diversity. In contrast, the ORR scheduler provides substantial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains compared to round robin while guaranteeing full fairness to all users.|$|R

30|$|Minimum {{miscibility}} {{pressure can}} be determined by several different procedures, which can be grouped into two general divisions: (1) experimental and (2) non-experimental methods. The slim tube test (Yellig and Metcalfe 1998) is utilized as the standard experimental method to estimate MMP. Other experimental MMP techniques are the rising bubble/falling drop experiments (Zhang et al. 2018), mixing cell experiments (Stalkup 1983), interface or surface laser light scattering spectroscopy (ILLS or SLLS) (Dorshow 1995), the vanishing interfacial tension technique (Rao 1997) and the oil swelling/extraction test (Abedini et al. 2014; Sharbatian et al. 2018). Because the experimental measurement of MMP is time-consuming and costly, it is desirable to establish alternative (non-experimental) methods for determining and/or predicting MMP. Empirical correlations, ternary representation/limiting tie line approach (Whitson and Michelsen 1989), slim tube simulation (Elsharkawy et al. 1992), mixing cell models (Yuan 2003) and analytical <b>methods</b> (<b>Orr</b> 2007) are the five non-experimental approaches widely applied to establish MMP values (Ahmadi-Rahmatabadi 2011).|$|R
