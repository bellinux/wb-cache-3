30|$|Still, all the {{measurement}} {{locations in the}} National military museum {{were found to be}} similar or better than typical European “historic house museums”. The observed reduction in the photo-oxidizing load and risk inside the enclosures in the Warehouse for foreign uniforms (1) and the contemporary history room in the main museum building (3) was an expected protective effect of the enclosures. The higher measured photo-oxidizing impact inside the wooden chest in the probative storage room (2) than in this room itself was thus surprising. This could be due to some unidentified oxidation impact, but probably more likely due to dust accumulation on the dosimeter glass, as the dosimeter was positioned horizontally besides rough textile materials (see Fig.  1, position 2 b). Although dust accumulation was probably not a risk for the objects in this case, this points to the possible damage risks that may occur when co-locating sensitive objects with objects or materials which off-gas or release harmful substances. The slightly higher acidic impact measured inside all the enclosures than in the respective rooms in the National military museum is typical. It is well known that the levels of gaseous organic compounds are usually higher inside than outside of enclosures [9, 12, 38]. This is due to the larger emitting surfaces as compared to the volumes and usually lower ventilation rates of enclosures as compared to rooms. The small differences between the measured acidic impact in the enclosures and the rooms in the National military museum indicated little risk related to organic acid <b>off</b> <b>gassing</b> in the enclosures. This may be due to relatively low emitting materials and/or ventilation effects in the enclosures. The emission from materials is typically reduced as they age, and the aging of enclosures contribute to lower internal <b>off</b> <b>gassing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Testing in {{relevant}} environments {{is key to}} exploration mission hardware development. This is true on {{both the}} component level (in early development) and system level (in late development stages). During ISRU missions the hardware will interface with the soil (digging, roving, etc) in a vacuum environment. A relevant test environment will therefore involve a vacuum chamber with a controlled, conditioned simulant bed. However, in earth-based granular media, such as lunar soil simulant, gases trapped within the material pore structures and water adsorbed to all particle surfaces will release when exposed to vacuum. Early vacuum testing has shown that this gas release can occur violently, which loosens and weakens the simulant, altering the consolidation state. The Vacuum Facility # 13, a mid-size chamber (3. 66 m tall, 1. 5 m inner diameter) at the NASA Glenn Research Center has been modified to create a soil mechanics test facility. A 0. 64 m deep by 0. 914 m square metric ton bed of lunar simulant was placed under vacuum {{using a variety of}} pumping techniques. Both GRC- 3 and LHT- 3 M simulant types have been used. An electric cone penetrometer was used to measure simulant strength properties at vacuum including: cohesion, friction angle, bulk density and shear modulus. Simulant disruptions, caused by <b>off</b> <b>gassing,</b> affected the strength properties, but could be mitigated by reducing pump rate. No disruptions were observed at pressures below 2. 5 Torr, regardless of the pump rate. However, slow <b>off</b> <b>gassing</b> of the soil lead to long test times, a full week, to reach 10 - 5 Torr. This work highlights the need for robotic machine-simulant hardware and operations in vacuum to expeditiously perform (sub-) systems tests...|$|E

We analyzed container air with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (TD- 2 D-GC-MS/FPD) and assessed whether {{the concentration of}} the volatiles benzene and 1, 2 -dichloroethane exceeded recommended exposure limits (REL). Products were taken from transport containers and analyzed for outgassing of volatiles. Furthermore, experimental outgassing was performed on packaging materials and textiles, to simulate the hazards tainting from globally shipped goods. The mean amounts of benzene in analyzed container air were 698 -fold higher, and those of ethylene dichloride were 4. 5 -fold higher than the corresponding REL. More than 90 % of all containers struck with toluene residues higher than its REL. For 1, 2 -dichloroethane 53 % of containers, transporting shoes exceeded the REL. In standardized experimental fumigation of various products, outgassing of 1, 2 -dichloroethane under controlled laboratory conditions took up to several months. Globally produced transported products tainted with toxic industrial chemicals {{may contribute to the}} mixture of volatiles in indoor air as they are likely to emit for a long period.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} public concern that coal seam gas (CSG) production will affect groundwater {{quality and quantity}} in adjacent or overlying aquifers. To assess this risk {{there is a need}} to map pathways of hydraulic connectivity using geochemical and hydraulic measurements. We demonstrate that measurements of methane concentration and isotopic composition, dissolved organic carbon isotopes and tritium activity data delineate potential pathways of hydraulic connectivity between the Walloon Coal Measures (WCM - the target formation for CSG production) and the Condamine Alluvium, which is the primary freshwater aquifer in the Condamine Catchment, south-east Queensland, Australia. The Walloon Coal Measures is a 700 m thick, low-rank CSG resource that is overlain by sandstone formations, which form part of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB). The Condamine Alluvium fills a paleovalley carved through the above formations. At 19 locations, both groundwater and degassing air samples were collected from irrigation bores. Degassing air samples were collected using an SKC 222 - 2301 air pump, which pumped the gas into 3 L Tedlar bags. The groundwater was analysed for tritium and dissolved organic carbon isotopes. A mobile methane survey was undertaken to collect continuous air samples around areas of agricultural and unconventional gas production. We use isotope mixing plots to identify the isotopic source signature of methane in the air samples from the <b>off</b> <b>gassing</b> irrigation bores and ambient air samples adjacent to CSG water holding ponds. Samples cluster along clear trend lines within the mixing plot and indicate potential local natural hydraulic connectivity between the target WCM and the overlying Condamine Alluvium...|$|E

The <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> from vitrification process leaves the melter at temperature of 600 0 C composed of NOx, Ru and particle. The treatment consist of cooling, scrubbing and filtering of the <b>off</b> <b>gas.</b> The cooling is performed by air film cooler, the scrubbing is performed by a series of submerged bed scrubber, venturi scrubber and water scrubber.

The dark side of such consents may bear health risks in international transport and production sharing. In fact, between 10 % and 20 % of all containers arriving European harbors were shown to contain volatile toxic substances above the exposure limit values. Possible exposure to these toxic chemicals may occur not only for the applicators but also the receiver by <b>off</b> <b>gassing</b> from products, packing materials or transport units like containers. A number of intoxications, some with lethal outcome, occur not only during the fumigation, but also during freight transport (on bulk carriers and other transport vessels), {{as well as in the}} logistic lines during loading and unloading. Risk occupations include dock-workers, seafarers, inspectors, as well as the usually uninformed workers of importing enterprises that unload the products. Bystanders as well as vulnerable consumers may also be at risk. Ongoing studies focus on the release of these toxic volatile substances from various goods. It was shown that the half-lives of the off-gassing process range between minutes and months, depending on the toxic substance, its chemical reactivity, concentration, the temperature, the contaminated matrix (goods and packing materials), and the packing density in the transport units. Regulations on declaration and handling dangerous goods are mostly not followed. It is obvious that this hazardous situation in freight transport urgently requires preventive steps. In order to improve awareness and relevant knowledge there is a need for more comprehensive information on chemical hazards and a broader implementation of the already existing regulations and guidelines, such as those from ILO, IMO, and national authorities. It is also necessary to have regular controls by the authorities on a worldwide scale, which should be followed by sanctions in case of disregarding regulations. Further, fumigated containers must have a warning sign corresponding to international recommendations and national regulations, and freight documents have to indicate any potential hazard during stripping the goods...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{research}} has shown that SCR catalysts employed for nitrogen-oxide reduction can effectively oxidize mercury. This report discusses initial results from fundamental investigations into the behavior of mercury species in the presence of SCR catalysts at Southern Research Institute. The testing was performed at Southern Research's Catalyst Test Facility, a bench-scale reactor capable of simulating gas-phase reactions occurring in coal-fired utility pollution-control equipment. Three different SCR catalysts are currently being studied in this project [...] honeycomb-type, plate-type, and a hybrid-type catalyst. The catalysts were manufactured and supplied by Cormetech Inc., Hitachi America Ltd., and Haldor-Topsoe Inc., respectively. Parametric testing was performed to investigate the contribution of flue-gas chemistry on mercury oxidation via SCR catalysts. Methods and procedures for experimental testing continue to be developed to produce the highest quality mercury-oxidation data. During this past quarter, it was discovered that long periods (12 - 24 hours) are required to equilibrate the catalysts in the system. In addition, after the system has been equilibrated, operational changes to temperature, gas concentration, or flow rate shifts the equilibrium, and steady-state must be reestablished, which can require as much as twelve additional hours per condition change. In the last quarter of testing, it was shown that the inclusion of ammonia had a strong effect on the oxidation of mercury by SCR catalysts, both in the short-term (a transitional period of elemental and oxidized mercury <b>off</b> <b>gassing)</b> and the long-term (less steady-state mercury oxidation). All experiments so far have focused on testing the catalysts in a simulated Powder River Basin (PRB) flue-gas environment, which contains lower sulfur and chlorine than produced by other coals. In the next quarter, parametric testing will be expanded to include flue gases simulating power plants burning Midwestern and Eastern coals, which are higher in sulfur and chlorine. Also, the isolation of such gases as hydrogen chloride (HCl), ammonia (NH{sub 3 }), and sulfur trioxide (SO{sub 3 }) will be investigated. All of these efforts will be used to examine the kinetics of mercury oxidation across the SCR catalysts with respect to flue gas composition, temperature, and flow rate...|$|E

Man must therefore be positioned to not only travel to, but also, to readily adapt to numerous and varying environments. For this mass migration across the galaxies nothing is as import to the human race as is NASA's future missions into Low Earth Orbit (LEO), to the moon, and/or Mars. These missions will form the building blocks to eternity for mankind. From these missions, NASA will develop the foundations for these building blocks based on sound engineering and scientific principles, both known and yet to be discovered. The integrity of the program will lead to development, tracking and control of the most basic elements of hardware production: That being development and control of applications of space flight materials. Choosing the right material for design purposes involves many considerations, such as governmental regulations associated with manufacturing operations, both safety of usage and of manufacturing, general material usage requirements, material longevity and performance requirements, material interfacing compatibility and material usage environments. Material performance is subject to environmental considerations in as much as a given material may perform exceptionally well at standard temperatures and pressures while performing poorly under non-standard conditions. These concerns may be found true for materials relative to the extreme temperatures and vacuum gradients of high altitude usage. The only way to assure that flight worthy materials are used in design is through testing. However, as with all testing, it requires both time on schedule and cost to the operation. One alternative to this high cost testing approach is to rely on a materials control system established by NASA. The NASA community relies on the MAPTIS materials control system founded at MSFC and supported by the other NASA Centers. This system is a data bank of all materials used in space flight operations. These materials are rated for several characteristics that are common concerns in high altitude or deep space usage: Odor, <b>off</b> <b>gassing,</b> material fluid compatibility, toxicity, corrosion susceptibility, stress corrosion susceptibility, etc...|$|E

In this study adsorption as a purification tool was used to obtain high H 2 content of gas mixture from SMR <b>off</b> <b>gas.</b> Zeolites and metal organic framework were used as an adsorbent. CO 2 equilibrium studies on K rich NaX zeolites, prepared with ultrasonic and traditional methods, and metal organic framework MIL 53 (Al) shows high adsorption on zeolites than MIL 53 (Al) up to 1 atm. K rich zeolites give lower adsorption than NaX zeolite. Adsorption isotherms obtained for MIL 53 (Al) is linear (favorable for zeolites). This makes MIL 53 (Al) is an promising adsorbent for high pressure application. Adsorption equilibrium at 5 atm shows that NaX zeolite is good adsorbent for the SMR <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> with the following orders: CO 2 >CH 4 >CO> H 2. Kinetics of SMR <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> in MIL 53 (Al) were studied by using Zero Length Column (ZLC) method.
