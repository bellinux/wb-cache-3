Two back-to-back thyristor switches per phase are required, and the device provides fast and continuously variable voltage magnitude and phase shift control at the expense of some waveform distortion. A dynamic simulation computer programme, which is based on the state-space approach, is developed. A three-phase control unit, to control the thyristor switchings on each phase, is described and the theoretical waveforms are verified by both experimental tests and digital computer studies.

40|$|The {{smart grid}} is a {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{that aims to}} revolutionize the whole electricity supply chain including generation, transmission and distribution systems in order to overcome the multiple challenges currently facing the electric power grid. The smart grid {{could be seen as}} a modern electrical power grid in which information as well as electricity flows among all nodes in the system, information is continuously collected, processed and hence used to control and coordinate the different system components such as distributed generation (DG) units, capacitor banks, <b>voltage</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>transformers,</b> etc. Therefore distributed intelligence and two-way data communication links are essential components in implementing the smart grid vision. There are numerous research efforts that focus on implementing the smart grid vision in electrical power distribution systems, most of which only target one aspect of the distribution system control and operation, e. g. a control system for voltage control, another one for DG control, a third one for protection, etc. The coexistence of such control strategies in a distribution system raises some concerns about their overall performance, their interactions with the other control strategies, and whether these control systems can adapt to changes in distribution system connectivity. In this PhD thesis we try to address these issues by proposing an implementation of the smart grid vision for distribution systems that provides an integrated design of power systems, communication systems and control strategies. A unified and flexible framework that incorporates all the different aspects of distribution system control and operation is proposed. Distributed processing units equipped with wireless communication capabilities are used to continuously process the local data along with the data received from other nodes and forward the results to neighboring nodes in the system, which in turn process the received data and share the results with their neighbors. Consequently, changes in any of the system components (load values, status of DG etc.) are taken into account in the calculations as soon as they occur, and the results are forwarded to relevant nodes in the systems. This way the information “propagates” throughout the system resulting in a seamless control and coordination among all the system components. Simulation of the electrical power distribution and the communication systems reveal the effectiveness of the proposed framework to control and coordinate multiple capacitor banks, DG units and <b>voltage</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>transformers</b> with changing load levels. It also reveals the potential of the proposed framework to operate in real-time by combining the real-time measured quantities with computer analysis in order to control the different system components within the time frame of normal non-emergency operating conditions. An experimental setup is built and used as a test bed for the proposed framework in order to assess the performance of the different ideas and techniques proposed in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Since <b>regulating</b> <b>transformers</b> {{have proved}} to be ef-ficient in {{controlling}} the power flow and <b>regulating</b> the <b>voltage,</b> they are more and more widely used in today’s environment of en-ergy production, transmission and distribution. This changing en-vironment challenges protection engineers as well to improve the sensitivity of protection, so that low-current faults could be de-tected (like turn-to-turn short circuits in transformer windings) and a warning message could be given. Moreover, the idea of an adaptive protection that adjusts the operating characteristics of the relay system in response to changing system conditions has became much more promising. It improves the protection sensitivity and simplifies its conception. This paper presents an adaptive adjust-ment concept in relation to the position change of the on load tap changer for universal differential protection of regulating trans-formers; such a concept provides a sensitive and cost-efficient pro-tection for <b>regulating</b> <b>transformers.</b> Various simulations are car-ried out with the Electro-Magnetic Transients Program/Alterna-tive Transients Program. The simulation results indicate the func-tional efficiency of the proposed concept under different fault con-ditions; the protection is sensitive to low level intern faults. The paper concludes by describing the software implementation of the algorithm on a test system based on a digital signal processor.
