25|$|Passion {{begins with}} a long {{introductory}} foray into the Western philosophical tradition of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger {{that is at the}} heart of <b>our</b> <b>relations</b> with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion {{is at the heart of}} this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.|$|E

When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of <b>our</b> <b>relations</b> and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E

2500|$|The Hungarian government's decade-long {{efforts to}} have U.S. visa {{requirements}} abolished for Hungarian citizens {{finally came to}} fruition on 17 November 2008 when the United States decided to include Hungary in its Visa Waiver Program.

Kinga Göncz, the country's then foreign minister, even {{went as far as}} to describe it as [...] "a landmark in <b>our</b> <b>relations</b> , since the visa waiver was essentially the single unresolved issue." [...] However, Hungarian President László Sólyom, who had promised upon his election in 2005 never to visit the United States as long as fingerprint requirements were part of U.S. visa procedures, refused to sign the agreement on the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, fearing it would give the United States too much access to Hungary's criminal registry.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} in 1939, antisemitism was escalating, and hostility towards Jews was a mainstay of the right-wing political forces post-Piłsudski regime and also the Catholic Church. Discrimination and violence against Jews had rendered the Polish Jewish population increasingly destitute, as was the case throughout much of Central and Eastern Europe. Despite the impending threat to the Polish Republic from Nazi Germany, there was little effort seen in the way of reconciliation with Poland's Jewish population. In July 1939 the pro-government Gazeta Polska wrote, [...] "The fact that <b>our</b> <b>relations</b> with the Reich are worsening does not in the least deactivate our program in the Jewish question—there is not and cannot be any common ground between our internal Jewish problem and Poland's relations with the Hitlerite Reich." [...] Escalating hostility towards Polish Jews and an official Polish government desire to remove Jews from Poland continued until the German invasion of Poland.|$|E
2500|$|The {{growing number}} of en{{franchise}}d black people in the Cape led him to raise the franchise requirements in 1892 to counter this preponderance, with drastic effects on the traditional Cape Qualified Franchise. By simultaneously limiting the amount of land black Africans were legally allowed to hold while tripling the property qualifications required to vote, Rhodes succeeded in disenfranchising the black population, as, to quote Richard Dowden, most would now [...] "find {{it almost impossible to}} get back on the list because of the legal limit on the amount of land they could hold". In addition, Rhodes was an early architect of the Natives Land Act, 1913, which would limit the areas of the country that black Africans were allowed to less than 10%. At the time, Rhodes would argue that [...] "the native is to be treated as a child and denied the franchise. We must adopt a system of despotism, such as works in India, in <b>our</b> <b>relations</b> with the barbarism of South Africa." ...|$|E
2500|$|St Thomas Aquinas interprets 'You should {{love your}} {{neighbour}} as yourself' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar {{of love for}} others. Considering that [...] "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" [...] and quotes Aristotle that [...] "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in <b>our</b> <b>relations</b> to ourselves," [...] he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, {{the good of the}} whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.|$|E

I submit, by contrast, that we should view ourselves as sharing a space with these entities: we should consider our own liability for actions that could bring harm to them, and we can appreciate as much if we only look at <b>our</b> <b>relation</b> to animals. I argue that we can draw on that relation to better frame <b>our</b> <b>relation</b> to artificial entities...|$|R
