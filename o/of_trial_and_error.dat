5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the top-down perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> With a true top-down view, players would be unable to see characters' faces and bodies. To circumvent this issue, objects in the world were tilted at an angle so that they were more visible in the top-down view. Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the stereoscopic 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging and dropping them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature felt too sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E
5|$|Hudson {{explained}} {{that they wanted to}} evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of Knights of the Old Republic into a real-time third-person shooter interface. The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also designed so that players would not need to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough, and went through a lot <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> to balance the combat between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.|$|E
5|$|So the {{production}} could be managed {{in the short}} time available, the movie's development was separated into three phases, with each phase being dedicated to a particular part of {{the production}} process and run by a different unit director answering to Nozue. The movie went through multiple phases <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> until the final product was solidified. Kingsglaive was kept a secret until 2016 when it was near completion, as the developers felt that they had announced its parent video game too early. So as to remain close to the development of Final Fantasy XV, the lead staff of Kingsglaive moved from Visual Works to Business Division 2, the department of Square Enix responsible for the game's development. This was part of an overall shift in development methods when the game was changed from a spin-off to a mainline entry. In addition to the staff of Advent Children, Western companies in gaming and movie production were involved: Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the Assassin's Creed series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including Jurassic World (2015) and the television series Game of Thrones. According to Nozue, around 50 different companies were involved in the film's production: among these was Europe-based company Puppetworks Animation Studio. The internal team was estimated at around 50 people. The cooperation of studios overseas meant that work on the movie could proceed continuously. Without this external aid, Nozue estimated that they would have needed a staff of five hundred people to complete the film in the given timeframe.|$|E

25|$|The Upper Hunter {{region was}} first planted in 1860 by a German settler named Carl Brecht. From his {{vineyard}} planted {{at the junction}} of Wybong Creek and the Goulburn river, Brecht's wines would win numerous gold medals at international wine competitions in the 1870s. Brecht's success would spur some interest in the area but the same turn of the 20th century events that saw decline throughout the Hunter Valley would compound to virtually extinguish all viticulture in the Upper Hunter. It wasn't until the 1960s when Penfolds purchased land near Brecht's old Wybong estate that significant viticulture interest in the Upper Hunter re-emerged.

Nearly 500 families accepted the offer and settled in the Barossa Valley.

25|$|The {{two primary}} grapes of the Cote de Nuits, pinot noir and Chardonnay, are {{believed}} to be indigenous to the Burgundy wine region. Through centuries <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error,</b> the two varieties have shown to produce the most consistent quality in the region. Broadly speaking, pinot noir tends to be planted in areas with high proportion of marl while Chardonnay is most often found in vineyards that are dominated by limestone. As the Cote de Nuits has many areas with significant amounts of marl, pinot noir is the dominant planting in the area. As a grape variety, pinot noir is very reflective of the terroir it is grown in which, coupled with the highly variable soils of the area, can cause two Cote de Nuits wine producers in the same year and by the same producer to be dramatically different due to where exactly they were grown.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, {{with his}} post {{doctoral}} researcher, William von Eggers Doering, Woodward reported {{the synthesis of}} the alkaloid quinine, used to treat malaria. Although the synthesis was publicized as a breakthrough in procuring the hard to get medicinal compound from Japanese occupied southeast Asia, in reality it was too long and tedious to adopt on a practical scale. Nevertheless, it was a landmark for chemical synthesis. Woodward's particular insight in this synthesis was to realise that the German chemist Paul Rabe had converted a precursor of quinine called quinotoxine to quinine in 1905. Hence, a synthesis of quinotoxine (which Woodward actually synthesized) would establish a route to synthesizing quinine. When Woodward accomplished this feat, organic synthesis was still largely a matter <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error,</b> and nobody thought that such complex structures could actually be constructed. Woodward showed that organic synthesis could {{be made into a}} rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure.

Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E

Kaneko felt at first that the game was an [...] "odd job", but over time he became deeply involved as the game graduated into being an important project for him. It {{was the first time}} the team had tried development with the Dreamcast, which proved more versatile and powerful than expected. The developers initially wanted a [...] "neat" [...] development project, but demands came for a more expansive project, resulting in the game's scale greatly increasing and the development process becoming chaotic, with more staff coming on board to help development. Due to these factors, the period <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> when creating the gameplay lasted much longer than intended. The first-person perspective combined with sword-based action was chosen to create a unique feel for the game. While 3D elements had been included in earlier Atlus titles, Maken X was the first time Atlus used both full 3D visuals and full-motion 3D CGI cutscenes. The game was also the first time the Megami Tensei team had attempted development of a game outside the role-playing genre.|$|E

Recording largely took place at AV Happenings {{during the second half}} of 2002, with the band working through the night so as not to disturb staff who worked in other parts of the building during the day. According to bassist Guto Pryce this involved a fair amount <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> as the band [...] "didn't really know what [...] were doing". Soundproof booths were improvised by setting up tents in the office corridors: [...] "we'd record a guitar and it'd sound rubbish and we had to figure out why.

You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models.

After {{the release of}} Valkyria Chronicles II, the staff {{took a look at}} both the popular response for the game and {{what they wanted to do}} next for the series. Like its predecessor, Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable: this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II, and they had not come up with the [...] "revolutionary" [...] idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3.
