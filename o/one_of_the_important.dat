The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>important</b> bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
