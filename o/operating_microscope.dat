25|$|Surgery {{can be done}} in case a {{peripheral}} nerve has become cut or otherwise divided. This is called peripheral nerve reconstruction. The injured nerve is identified and exposed so that normal nerve tissue can be examined above and below the level of injury, usually with magnification, using either loupes or an <b>operating</b> <b>microscope.</b> If a large segment of nerve is harmed, as can happen in a crush or stretch injury, the nerve will need to be exposed over a larger area. Injured portions of the nerve are removed. The cut nerve endings are then carefully reapproximated using very small sutures. The nerve repair must be covered by healthy tissue, which {{can be as simple as}} closing the skin or it can require moving skin or muscle to provide healthy padded coverage over the nerve. The type of anesthesia used depends on the complexity of the injury. A surgical tourniquet is almost always used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Ever {{since the}} {{development}} of the first applications in image-guided therapy (IGT), the use of head-mounted displays (HMDs) was considered an important extension of existing IGT technologies. Several approaches to utilizing HMDs and modified medical devices for augmented reality (AR) visualization were implemented. These approaches include video-see through systems, semitransparent mirrors, modified endoscopes, and modified <b>operating</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Common to all these devices is the fact that a precise calibration between the display and three-dimensional coordinates in the patient’s frame of reference is compulsory. In optical see-through devices based on complex optical systems such as <b>operating</b> <b>microscopes</b> or <b>operating</b> binoculars—as {{in the case of the}} system presented in this paper—this procedure can become increasingly difficult since precise camera calibration for every focus and zoom position is required.

40|$|AIM: Free {{microvascular}} tissue transfers {{have become}} today a key instrument for the surgical treatment of wide loss of tissue, but their employment implies mandatory {{use of the}} right visual magnification means. Until now these instruments were mainly loupes and <b>operating</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Our study is focusing {{on the use of}} a new visual system [...] Varioscope AF 3 -A [...] in the reconstructive microsurgery field. METHODS: Varioscope AF 3 -A (Life Optics, Vienna, Austria) has been employed in our Institute in 10 microvascular reconstructions, where different free flaps were used in head and neck reconstruction. RESULTS: All the flaps took and only one developed a partial necrosis. We have also noticed, by using this new instrument, a learning curve with a progressive contraction of the operating time. In all cases we have operated on 2 mm caliber vessels or more and on tissues that didn't previously undergo radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The employment of a visual magnification mean, as Varioscope AF 3 -A, allows autofocus (from 3. 6 X to 7. 2 X) and a wide vision. It can be easily used with substantial advantages for the surgeon in performing microvascular anastomosis. Partial drawbacks are the equipment high cost and weight, compared to the loupes and a stronger ocular stress due to the continuous autofocus compared to the static <b>operating</b> <b>microscopes...</b>|$|R

50|$|Similar to {{the early}} years of FESS - {{functional}} endoscopic sinus surgery, EES has been controversial since early descriptions in the 1960s. One of the benefits of an endoscope compared to the microscope is the wide-field view of the middle ear afforded by the location of the light source {{at the tip of the}} instrument and the availability of various types of angled lenses. Middle ear procedures that utilize a rigid endoscope for viewing may reduce the need to drill for enhanced exposure of the operative field. The traditional otologic <b>operating</b> <b>microscopes</b> typically require larger portals (e.g., postauricular approaches) to enable adequate passage of light for intraoperative viewing and follow-up surveillance in the clinic. One handed dissection is cited as the main drawback to EES.|$|R
