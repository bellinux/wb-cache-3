5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; {{he decided that he}} did not have the {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> can never be undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E

25|$|Finally, O'Connor {{rejected}} the FBI's argument that all its sources must be confidential {{in order to}} maintain effective law enforcement. The presumption <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> that the FBI makes of presuming that a source and documents related to a source are confidential simply {{based on the fact that}} a source gave information to the FBI in the course of a criminal investigation was also rejected by Justice O'Connor. She stated that any source related to any type of criminal case the FBI handles should not be considered confidential simply because information was given for a criminal case. While she believed that murder cases would warrant an accurate presumption <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> she opposed the view that the FBI can presume confidentiality for every type of criminal case it deals with.|$|E
40|$|The law {{of online}} {{relationships}} {{has a significant}} flaw—it regularly fails {{to account for the}} possibility of an implied confidence. The established doctrine <b>of</b> implied <b>confidentiality</b> is, without explanation, almost entirely absent from online jurisprudence in environments where it has traditionally been applied offline, such as with sensitive data sets and intimate social interactions. Courts’ abandonment <b>of</b> implied <b>confidentiality</b> in online environments should have been foreseen. The concept has not been developed enough to be consistently applied in environments such as the Internet that lack obvious physical or contextual cues of confidence. This absence is significant because implied confidentiality could be the missing piece that helps resolve the problems caused by the disclosure of personal information on the Internet. This Article urges a revival <b>of</b> implied <b>confidentiality</b> by identifying from the relevant case law a set <b>of</b> implied <b>confidentiality</b> norms based upon party perception and inequality that courts should be, but are not, considering in online disputes. These norms are used to develop a framework for courts to better recognize implied agreements and relationships of trust in all contexts...|$|R

25|$|O'Connor did, however, {{state that}} the Court accepts certain forms of {{categorical}} presumptions <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> But these categorical presumptions {{are a lot more}} narrowly defined than what the FBI had previously used. Justice O'Connor gave the scenario of a paid informant as an example of an accepted categorical presumption <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder cases like this one, informants may also expect to have their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of the confidentiality of any documents related to an informant for a murder case.|$|E

25|$|The ethical {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> requires that information shared by a client with a therapist {{in the course}} of treatment is not shared with others. This principle bolsters the therapeutic alliance, as it promotes an environment of trust.

This includes instances of suicidal behavior or homicidal plans, child abuse, elder abuse and dependent adult abuse.|$|E
