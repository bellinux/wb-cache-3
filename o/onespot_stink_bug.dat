Knowledge of spatial and temporal availability and distribution of <b>stink</b> <b>bugs</b> in host plants is necessary for appropriate timing and placement of flowering plants in agroecosystems. <b>Stink</b> <b>bugs</b> move between closely associated host plants throughout the growing season in response to deteriorating suitability of their host plants. In peanut-cotton farmscapes, <b>stink</b> <b>bugs</b> develop in peanut, and subsequently the adults disperse into adjacent cotton. Parasitism of Nezara viridula (L.) adults by Trichopoda pennipes (F.) at the peanut-cotton interface was significantly higher in cotton with a strip of milkweed or buckwheat between the two crops than in cotton alone. Milkweed and buckwheat also provided nectar {{to a wide range}} of insect pollinators. Monarch butterflies fed on milkweed. When placed between peanut and cotton, a strip of soybean was an effective trap crop for cotton, reducing economic damage.

Recent increases in <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> populations, importantly the invasive Halyomorpha halys (Stål 1855), has caused unprecedented economic losses in the mid-Atlantic United States. To inform integrated pest management programs, I quantified the spatial heterogeneity of <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> population density in field crops at multiple spatial scales (field edge, entire fields and regional), and identified the associated environmental factors and the underlying ecological mechanisms (i. e. climatic tolerances, resource quality and availability). At corn and soybean field edges, highest density of <b>stink</b> <b>bugs</b> {{was limited to the}} first few crop rows. At some study sites, fields adjacent to woods and buildings harbored higher density of <b>stink</b> <b>bugs</b> than those adjacent to open areas. Injury to corn kernel damage, and soybean pod and seed increased with <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> density, and was highest at the field edges. <b>Stink</b> <b>bug</b> density was also positively associated with yield loss in soybean. In entire fields of corn-soybean, H. halys was found in very low density or absent beyond 25 m from the field edge. At study sites with high <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> populations, interpolated density values showed potential dispersal of H. halys, particularly adults and large nymphs, from corn into soybean, coinciding with the end of dough stage in corn and beginning of soybean seed development stage. Temperature and developed areas, and proportion of forest and crop areas were important predictors of regional patterns in H. halys and Chinavis hilaris abundance, respectively. For Euschistus servus, temperature and forest cover influenced patterns at broad spatial scale. Adjacent habitat influence, with highest abundance along woods, on <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> density was limited to within field scale, and difference in abundance between sites was driven primarily by temperature gradient.
