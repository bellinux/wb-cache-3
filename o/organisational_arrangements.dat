40|$|Indigenous {{education}} in Australia {{has not been}} successful for two main reasons. First, {{there has not been}} a close and respectful relationship established between schools and their local Indigenous communities so that the purpose, process and outcomes of schooling can be constantly discussed and refined. Second, the white curriculum has found it extremely difficult to incorporate Indigenous knowledge, history and culture so that school subjects can relate to daily community life. Both problems stem from a highly conservative view of schooling and society. Australian Indigenous peoples make up only a very small proportion of the population and many schools will only have a small number of Indigenous students enrolled, if at all. Teachers may feel that they lack appropriate background knowledge when working with Indigenous children and may be uncertain of how to transform the white curriculum so that it is more culturally inclusive. This chapter describes the development of narrative curriculum and the identification of exemplars of knowledge so that the regular programs offered by neighbourhood schools can be respectful of Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing, It suggests community learning circles as the main <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> to enable the participation of Elders, family members and children in democratic school life...|$|R

The study sorts to diagnose sources of {{and the presence}} of different types of conflicts in the South African Mission (SAM). The researcher made a diagnosis of different conflicts that existed in the South African Mission in Namibia with an attempt to reconstruct an approach to manage conflicts in organisations. In an attempt to address the fundamental problem of the study, the researcher adopted a qualitative approach to the study. The analysis was based on literature reviews and journal articles published on the topic understudy. The study makes a contribution into identifying different conflicts wants that are presence within organisations. The findings established that different types of conflicts such as emotional, task and interpersonal conflicts, amongst others, do exist within the South African Mission, and members of the SAM have difference experiences of these conflicts related to their work responsibilities and to human as well. The study revealed that, both these aspects have significant effect on the personal life and working life of members in the South African Mission.

40|$|Home {{ownership}} {{comes in}} a variety of forms. Owners of single-family dwellings generally enjoy a high degree of control and autonomy. Many home owners, however, are in circumstances which involve greater collective interest, medium and high-rise environments and significant state involvement and regulation. In such situations, tensions and conflicts can arise among residents and others stakeholders in relation to a range of management and maintenance issues and between owners and the wider public interest. This involves constraints on individual freedom and the necessity for co-operation. This paper discusses these and related issues with a particular focus on owners 2 ̆ 7 corporations in Hong Kong. In the Hong Kong context, home owners are most typically in large scale, high rise and often technically complex environments. The particular form of the owner corporation is explored in relation to its history of development, its significance in the home ownership sector and its legal structure. Owner corporations raise a number of issues of participation and democracy. These include the anti-democratic <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> of owners 2 ̆ 7 corporations which tends to limit rather than enhance participation of ordinary owners, the impact of owners 2 ̆ 7 corporations in reinforcing class and income gaps as well as debates on individualism/collectivism and public/private dimensions.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{organisation}} of a company’s external communications has been characterised by enduring debate exemplified in the discussions {{on the relationship between}} marketing and public relations as well as, more recently, in arguments for a greater "integration " or interaction between and consolidation of a company’s communication disciplines. Despite this prolific attention to communication organi-sation in the literature, having resulted in a number of normative prescriptions and suggestions, there has been little if any actual empirical research on aspects of communication organisation across companies. Moreover, within the little prior empirical research, scant attention has been given, firstly, to conceptual develop-ment in the sense of defining constructs and developing valid measures of commu-nication organisation, and, secondly, to the contextual factors that may make a particular <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> of communication disciplines either more or less appropriate for a particular company. This paper therefore develops and tests a number of literature-derived propositions relating organisational dimensions to conditions in a company’s internal and external environments. Findings of an exploratory empirical study show that the organisational relationship (in the form of different types of interaction and their degree of formalisation) between the two primary departments involved in a company’s external communication programmes are correlated with such internal environmental conditions as the departments’ domain similarity and resource dependence, as well as the prevailing organisa-tional norms and cultural conditions within a company...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research into}} the kinematic robustness of autonomous robotic systems. Kinematic structures typical of those employed in the manipulation and locomotion elements of planetary exploration vehicles are represented using Graph Theory techniques, extended by the novel concept of the Constraints Matrix. This replaces the elements (zeroes and ones) of the standard adjacency matrix of the interchange graph of a kinematic system by integer elements representing the numbers of constrained degrees of freedom (dof) throughout the system. It is shown that, as motion faults develop progressively within a particular kinematic system, the succession of kinematic states lies along a trajectory in an abstract kinematic fault space derived from Constraints Matrix eigenvalues. For a 3 -link system, progressing along the trajectory, the change from one kinematic state to the next {{is accompanied by a}} rotation of the corresponding (Constraints Matrix) orthonormal eigenvectors, according to the nature of each fault that has occurred. Thus, aspects of the robustness to, and recovery from kinematic faults, of a kinematic system are represented in geometrical terms.

40|$|Party {{government}} is the <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> that characterises many parliaments in contemporary democracies, including Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Two basic conditions of party government specify that (1) parties must formulate policies for enactment once in office, and (2) parties in office must give high priority to carrying out party policies, and must be sufficiently cohesive or disciplined to enable this implementation. Nonetheless, theories of party government and indeed parties themselves emerged well after the establishment of representative legislatures. Consequently {{there is a great}} deal of tension and many inconsistencies between the constitutional and legal design of parliaments that were intended to comprise of independent/constituency representatives, and the political reality and current practice of party government. A potentially uncomfortable situation has developed whereby MPs hold dual responsibilities to their party and the public that may theoretically conflict. This paper contrasts the obligations MPs assume as party agents with their legal and constitutional responsibilities as parliamentarians. Analysing legal precedent from Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, I argue that in the vast majority of instances a party (or its members) cannot legally mandate their elected MPs to act in accordance with their policy wishes. In the absence of legal sanctions, the paper briefly examines the various other ways in which political parties hold their MPs to account (transparent decision-making, preselections, branch meetings, disciplinary bodies), and evaluates their effectiveness.

40|$|As a {{means of}} {{addressing}} observed inadequacies in school curricula, the Catholic Special Education and Guidance Service, Brisbane Catholic Education Office in 1980 established a partial withdrawal centre for counsellor-selected gifted children. The Learning Enrichment Centre (L. E. C.) aimed to - 1) {{meet the needs of}} enrolled gifted students by - a) providing appropriate learning experiences; and b) providing an administrative arrangement (partial withdrawal) which afforded them the opportunity to interact with like minds; 2) {{meet the needs of the}} system by - a) developing and evaluating units of work for gifted students; b) conducting workshops, seminars and in-service days for teachers. In 1984 the L. E. C. curriculum was designed and implemented in accordance with Maker's model of curriculum modification for gifted students (Maker, 1982). This model outlines a set of principles which Maker claims, recognize the characteristics and needs of gifted students and guide the development of a qualitatively different curriculum. In making decisions about design and implementation of Maker's curriculum modifications, factors related to the setting, the teachers and the students were considered. The overall purpose of the Study was to assist teachers in making rational decisions about future L. E. C. provision. In particular the Study was to collect information on the worth of the program - its relative strengths and weaknesses - and the influence on the curriculum of the administrative arrangement. The program was evaluated by ascertaining levels of satisfaction typically expressed by the students. Of secondary concern was whether the <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> of partial withdrawal had inhibited or enhanced the program's intentions. It was acknowledged that unfavourable attitudes of parents, classroom teachers or peers could conceivably alter students' receptivity of the program. In Term 4, two parallel questionnaires, one addressing the L. E. C., the other the regular classroom, were administered to the students. By comparing responses on matching items, levels of satisfaction with the L. E. C. curriculum were determined. Selected items on the L. E. C. instrument were further to reveal how students felt about the administrative provision and whether classroom teachers and peers were perceived to be supportive. Subsequent to program completion, a questionnaire was mailed to parents bo ascertain their support for the program by asking them how their child's emotional behaviour had changed as a result of LEC attendance. Also they were to indicate whether they preferred that enrichment occur in the regular classroom or partial withdrawal setting. To confirm the students' impressions of classroom teacher support and interest, parents were requested to comment on their understanding of it. Student responses indicated that they found their LEC experiences to be particularly interesting and enjoyable, and the LEC teachers to be kind, helpful, friendly and fair. These perceptions differed significantly from their perceptions of school. Elements of the Maker model which were consistently most valued by the group were the Process modifications, 'Freedom of Choice' and 'Higher Levels of Thinking'. Parents proved to be supportive of the LEC program. Although some would have preferred classroom enrichment to partial withdrawal, they felt that schools could not currently provide it. It was the students' viewpoint that interactions with peers and classroom teachers were not adversely affected by their LEC participation. Classroom teachers were seen to be generally supportive and interested - a perception incidentally not shared by parents and LEC teachers. Perceived positive attitudes towards their LEC involvement most likely enhanced student satisfaction with the program. The evaluation unequivocally indicated that the LEC program based on Maker's model appealed to the students. Though withdrawal from class possibly contributed to program satisfaction, the level of satisfaction was very high and could not be attributed solely to hidden curriculum efects (the <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement).</b> The Study concluded that use of the Maker model as a guide for developing LEC curricula should continue but that parent and classroom teacher attitudes towards the administrative arrangement should be regularly monitored as they appeared to have the potential to enhance or reduce students' receptivity of the program. As a result of Study, various procedures for the conduct of future evaluations were recommended...|$|R

The CIOs in the South African public sector are referred to as GITOs, the position in government departments that was established by a Cabinet memorandum in the year 2000. By 2001, the South African government developed an e-government policy framework which presents the basis for implementation of e-government initiatives by several stakeholders including the GITOs. A qualitative study was undertaken based on the case study of four national departments to determine the performance of the GITOs in the implementation of this policy.

The findings identifies the barriers for the GITOs to implement the e-government policy to include, weak policy, lack of strategic leadership, critical ICT skills, infrastructure, uncoordinated funding and low levels of e-readiness by departments.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} franchising in service provision, job creation and self employment opportunities is widely reported (Spinelli, Rosenberg, & Birley, 2004). In Australia, franchising currently contributes approximately $ 130 {{billion to the}} Australian economy representing 10 percent of national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Frazer, Weaven & Wright, 2008). Current research suggests {{that much of the}} future growth in franchising in many world economies will be attributable to the growth in multi-unit franchising arrangements (Weaven & Frazer, 2007). Multi-unit franchising (MUF) refers to an <b>organisational</b> <b>arrangement</b> in which franchisees are allowed to own more than one unit within the same franchise system. However, the existence of multi-unit franchising remains a curious anomaly. In particular, from an agency theoretic perspective, multi-unit franchising appears to represent a suboptimal alternative to traditional dyadic revenue sharing arrangements as it contradicts incentives rationales for franchising choice. However, the ubiquity and popularity of this organisational form has generated consistent debate regarding the relative merits of this growth strategy. Over the last 15 years there has been a myriad of research explaining and examining the area multi-unit franchising. Areas of particular interest have focused upon expansionary strategies, motivations and incentives, and differences between single-unit and multi-unit operations. Further research has explored the challenges which chain organisations encounter when employing a MUF framework (e. g., Bradach, 1995; Garg, Rasheed & Priem, 2005). However, whilst it is evident that growth has occurred throughout the franchising literature in relation to MUF, significant gaps still exist. For example, with the notable exception of Bradach (1995) limited research has explored the key factors (imperatives) essential for multi-unit franchising to succeed (i. e., operational performance), hence, ensuring sustainability of franchise systems. Moreover, previous research has not empirically examined franchise system performance within the context of different organisational forms of MUF that are distinguished by their influence upon the extent of direct franchisor control, rate of system expansion and management of system operations. Therefore, in order to empirically examine the influence of the four franchising imperatives (i. e., (1) unit growth, (2) uniformity, (3) local responsiveness and, (4) system wide adaptation) upon operational performance from a multi-unit perspective (i. e., (1) master franchising, (2) area development franchising, (3) area representative franchising and (4) incremental franchising), further exploration of the four franchising imperatives is warranted. This represents an important gap in the literature. The literature presents only one previous study (Garg et al., 2005) which has examined the four franchising imperatives proposed by Bradach (1995), however this study was limited as (1) only three of the four franchising imperatives were examined and (2) the study (Bradach, 1995) did not provide a comparison between the four different multi-unit franchising forms. As such, this research provides a comprehensive insight into the outcomes which were found to influence the four franchising imperatives upon operational performance across the four multi-unit franchising governance models.
