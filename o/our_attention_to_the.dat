5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E

Two months later, Nomura released a drawing of Lightning along with the words [...] "She must not be forgotten". On January 11, 2011, Square Enix registered the domain name FinalFantasy13-2game.com via a proxy company that it had used to register websites for several other unannounced games. Final Fantasy XIII-2 was officially announced at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo on January 18, 2011. The teaser trailer showed Lightning, outfitted in armor, drawing her weapon and engaging Caius, who was not yet named. To promote the game's release in Japan, Japanese singer Yuko Oshima was appointed the leader of a group of thirteen official test players.|$|E

[...] Dana Stevens of the Slate magazine is also among those who gave the film a positive review, she stated: [...] "Blood Diamond is a by-the-numbers message picture, to be sure... But the director, Edward Zwick, is craftsman enough that the pace never slackens, the chase scenes thrill, and the battle scenes sicken. And if it makes viewers think twice about buying their sweethearts that hard-won hunk of ice for Christmas, so much the better." [...] Ty Burr of the Boston Globe, after giving the film a positive review, stated: [...] "As an entry in the advocacy-entertainment genre, in which glamorous movie stars bring <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plight of the less fortunate, Blood Diamond is superior to 2003's ridiculous Beyond Borders while looking strident and obvious next to last year's The Constant Gardener.|$|E

The Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv {{constant}} s(G) of G {{is defined as}} the smallest integer l∈N such that every sequence S over G of length |S|≥ l has a zero-sum subsequence T of length |T|= (G).

In this paper we pay <b>our</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> groups of the form C_ 2 ^r- 1 ⊕ C_ 2 n, where r≥ 3 and n> 2.

40|$|There {{are a lot}} of aspects for {{evaluation}} of odor. Not only the hedonics aspects but also the pleasantness aspects are very important for the building design. Authors have investigated the sensory evaluation of odor from building materials and turned <b>our</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> psychological process of odor evaluation. In this paper, odors emitted from four building materials that is wood, wood flooring, Tatami (Japanese traditional rush mat) and concrete were adopted and the sensory evaluation tests by human subjects were conducted. Odor intensity, hedonics, preference and acceptability were voted by ten young subjects. The impressions of odor represented by familiarity, freshness, complexity and warmness were evaluated as well. The correlations of each evaluation were investigated and tried to make a model of the psychological process of sensory evaluation by means of multiple regression analysis. As a result, odor acceptability was proved to be largely influenced by odor intensity, secondly the hedonics of odor led the evaluation of acceptability. Odor impressions decide the hedonics of odor, and especially the familiarity and complexity were proved <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> important factors...|$|R
