40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{of detection}} and tracking of multiple small moving space junks under the complex star sequential images is proposed in this paper. Firstly we take image smoothing and adaptive threshold segment {{to improve the}} weight <b>of</b> <b>junks.</b> Furthermore, back neighborhood frame correlation (BNFC) is proposed to detect and locate the junk which is sheltered by bigger interfaced stars. Through cross projection method, we could extract the centroid <b>of</b> the moving <b>junks.</b> At last, the Kalman Filter is used to track and estimate the trajectory <b>of</b> moving <b>junks.</b> Experiments show that through this algorithm the multiple small space junks could be detected and tracked effectively and accurately under complex star background with good performance in low error rate and good real-time processing. © 2016 SPIE. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{primary failure}} {{condition}} in adventure games, inherited from more action-oriented games, is player death. Without the clearly identified enemies of other genres, its inclusion in adventure games is controversial, and many developers now either avoid it or take extra steps to foreshadow death.

Infocom's text adventure The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy {{has been criticized for}} a scenario where failing to pick up a pile <b>of</b> <b>junk</b> mail {{at the beginning of the}} game prevented the player, much later, from completing the game. The adventure games developed by LucasArts purposely avoided creating a dead-end situation for the player due to the negative reactions to such situations.|$|E
