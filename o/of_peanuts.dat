5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri <b>of</b> <b>peanuts</b> known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} thing about shelling is to remove the shell <b>of</b> <b>peanuts</b> with the smallest damage to the seed. The moisture of the unshelled peanuts is controlled to avoid excessive frangibility of the shells and kernels, which in turn, reduces the amount of dust present in the plant. After, the peanuts are sent to a series of rollers set specifically for the batch <b>of</b> <b>peanuts,</b> where they are cracked. After cracking, the peanuts go through a screening process where they are inspected for contaminants.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : GIS, GPS, RS and Precision FarmingInternational audienceShucking {{is one of}} the {{necessary}} parts for the deep process <b>of</b> <b>peanut,</b> and has great impact on the quality <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> kernel. Taking the shucking force as the evaluation indicator, the effects of mechanical and physical characteristics, which include the loading orientation, loading rate, moisture content, partical size and the number <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> kernel, on peanut shucking were investigated by means of single factor test. The results show that: 1) the loading orientation and moisture content affect the shucking force significantly, and the needed force is the minimum when the peanut is vertically placed and loaded. With the decrease of moisture content, the needed force decreases gradually. 2) the loading rate, particle size and the number <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> kernel have no great effect on the shucking force, but the deformation and maximum shucking force vary with the loading rate. Additionally, the needed force increases with the number <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> kernel. The research results can provide some reference for the designment <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> sheller and selection of the technique parameters...|$|R
50|$|Hosts that {{suffer from}} late leaf spot include {{groundnut}} species {{belonging to the}} genus Arachis hypogaea, and peanuts. Late leaf spot <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> that produces sexual spores {{is referred to as}} Mycosphaerella berkeleyi, whereas the asexual spore is referred to as Cercosporidium personatum. Late leaf spot <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> symptoms usually appear between 30-50 days following planting. Symptoms include dark brown to black pin-point spots on the upper and under side of the leaf surface. This contrasts the fewer, lighter brown spots that early leaf spot <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> presents. Late leaf spot <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> produces symptoms later in the season. These spores can be seen without magnification and give the spot a velvety appearance as opposed to early leaf spot <b>of</b> <b>peanut,</b> which can be seen with higher magnification. Even though these differences are slight, it is what helps to distinguish between the two pathogens.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{a common}} {{environment}} for processing different powder foods in the industry has increased the risk <b>of</b> finding <b>peanut</b> traces in powder foods. The analytical methods commonly used for detection <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) represent high specificity and sensitivity but are destructive and time-consuming, and require highly skilled experimenters. The feasibility of NIR hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is studied for the detection <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> traces down to 0. 01 % by weight. A principal-component analysis (PCA) was carried out on a dataset <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> and flour spectra. The obtained loadings were applied to the HSI images of adulterated wheat flour samples with peanut traces. As a result, HSI images were reduced to score images with enhanced contrast between peanut and flour particles. Finally, a threshold was fixed in score images to obtain a binary classification image, and the percentage <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> adulteration was compared with the percentage of pixels identified as peanut particles. This study allowed the detection <b>of</b> traces <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> down to 0. 01 % and quantification <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> adulteration from 10 % to 0. 1 % with a coefficient of determination (r 2) of 0. 946. These results show the feasibility of using HSI systems for the detection <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> traces in conjunction with chemical procedures, such as RT-PCR and ELISA to facilitate enhanced quality-control surveillance on food-product processing lines...|$|R

40|$|SCOPE: The {{cross-linking}} {{of proteins}} by enzymes to form high-molecular-weight protein, aggregates {{can be used}} to tailor the technological or physiological functionality of food products. Aggregation of dietary proteins by food processing may promote allergic sensitization, but the effects of enzymatic cross-linking of dietary proteins on the allergenic potential of food are not known. In this study, the bioavailability and the sensitizing or tolerizing potential <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> proteins (PE) cross-linked with microbial tyrosinase from Trichoderma reesei and mushroom tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus, were investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The impact of cross-linking of PE on the in vitro bioavailability <b>of</b> fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled <b>peanut</b> proteins was tested in a Caco- 2 cell monolayer and by competitive ELISA. The in vivo allergenicity or capacity to induce oral tolerance in mice were measured by serum levels of PE-specific antibodies and T cell cytokine production after exposure to PE and cross-linked PE. CONCLUSION: Enzymatic processing <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> proteins by the two tyrosinases increased the bioavailability <b>of</b> major <b>peanut</b> allergen Ara h 2, but did not significantly change the allergenic or tolerizing properties <b>of</b> <b>peanut.</b> Enzymatic treatment <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> proteins yielded cross-linked proteins with preserved molecular and immunological features <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> allergens...|$|R

40|$|Background Peanut allergy is {{characterized}} by a high frequency of severe and occasionally fatal reactions. Objective To determine if there are features of the in vitro cellular response that may account for the observed severity <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> allergy. Methods Skin-prick testing (SPT), RAST assay of serum peanut-specific and total IgE and mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferative responses to crude peanut protein were measured in 44 peanut allergics with varying severity of clinical reactions. PBMC responses of 13 non-peanut allergic controls (six atopic) were also studied. Results Subjects' PBMCs proliferated more than controls', even without stimulation. Subjects' PBMC proliferative responses did not correlate with clinical severity, SPT weal size or peanut-specific IgE levels. Controls’ PBMCs did not respond to peanut. There was no correlation between PBMC response and time since last reaction to peanut. Subjects' PBMCs responded more than controls, to mitogen as well as allergen. Proliferation increased with increasing concentration <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> protein (P < 0. 0001). Conclusion PBMCs <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> allergics demonstrate a dose-dependent response to peanut which does not correlate with clinical severity, SPT reaction or levels <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> specific IgE. The response is antigen-specific. Peanut protein is not mitogenic and is not acting as a superantigen. While there are non-specific differences in the PBMC responses <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> allergic individuals compared with atopic and non-atopic controls, these differences do not explain the unique severity <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> allergy...|$|R
