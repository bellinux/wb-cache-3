5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} <b>often</b> difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were <b>often</b> uncertain, as young new officials <b>often</b> needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would <b>often</b> compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs <b>often</b> sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are <b>often</b> {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes <b>often</b> make mistakes, {{and this is one}} of the reasons why RNA viruses <b>often</b> mutate to form new strains.|$|E
5|$|Apples are <b>often</b> eaten raw. The {{whole fruit}} {{including}} {{the skin is}} {{suitable for human consumption}} except for the seeds, which may affect some consumers. The core is <b>often</b> not eaten and is discarded. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples.|$|E

60|$|The {{deceitful}} strength {{which had}} buoyed Eva {{up for a}} little while was fast passing away; seldom and more seldom her light footstep was heard in the verandah, and <b>oftener</b> and <b>oftener</b> she was found reclined on a little lounge by the open window, her large, deep eyes fixed on the rising and falling waters of the lake.|$|R
60|$|But {{in general}} {{there will not}} be this extreme {{inequality}} in the degree in which the demand in the two countries varies with variations in the price. The advantage will probably be divided equally, <b>oftener</b> than in any one unequal ratio that can be named; though the division will be much <b>oftener,</b> on the whole, unequal than equal.|$|R
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is <b>often</b> seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is <b>often</b> assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and <b>often</b> goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is <b>often</b> rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity <b>often</b> leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Ann Schuyler {{was known}} for her {{precocious}} writing ability, and was <b>often</b> asked to recite her poems, which ranged from sentimental or humorous to sophisticated or satirical. She would <b>often</b> compose impromptu poems {{at the request of}} friends.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Dyson sphere {{originated}} in fiction, {{and it is}} a concept that has appeared <b>often</b> in science fiction since then. In fictional accounts, Dyson spheres are most <b>often</b> depicted as a Dyson shell with the gravitational and engineering difficulties of this variant noted above largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|As seen in {{the credits}} for tracks Young has {{appeared}} on, there are <b>often</b> multiple people who contribute to his songs (although <b>often</b> in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer).|$|E
5|$|Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate, a young apathetic intern at {{the parks}} department. She cares little for her internship, and <b>often</b> shows {{annoyance}} {{at having to}} complete tasks. Due to her rebellious and emotionless attitude, she is <b>often</b> annoyed by her co-workers, especially Leslie.|$|E
5|$|Beiderbecke's cornet {{style is}} <b>often</b> {{described}} by contrasting it with Armstrong's markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos <b>often</b> {{took advantage of}} that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong <b>often</b> soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong <b>often</b> emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.|$|E

5|$|Boletus reticulatus is {{very similar}} to B.aereus, also {{occurring}} during the summer months under broad-leaved trees.

Omskirk {{put it on the}} table in its original glass, and Braithwaite filled Redclyffe's glass and his own, and raised the latter to his lips, with a frank expression of his mobile countenance.|$|R

5|$|Cuisine {{varies by}} region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common {{throughout}} the country. A typical dish {{is based on}} cocoyams, maize, cassava (manioc), millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or yams, <b>often</b> pounded into dough-like fufu. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients. Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken <b>often</b> reserved for special occasions. Dishes are <b>often</b> quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and Maggi.|$|E
5|$|Data Recorders – These are <b>often</b> {{placed in}} {{ambulances}} to record such information as speed, braking power and time, activation of active emergency warnings such as lights and sirens, {{as well as}} seat belt usage. These are <b>often</b> used in coordination with GPS units.|$|E
5|$|Elvish {{greetings}} can {{be expressed}} both by voice and by hand, and <b>often</b> involve {{a combination of the}} two. Elvish greetings are <b>often,</b> but not always, used just prior to a conversation. From the Lord of the Rings it appears that Elves do not have a very elaborate greeting ritual.|$|E

5|$|Ever {{since the}} Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589), {{painting}} {{had become an}} art of high sophistication that {{was associated with the}} gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry. During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would <b>often</b> meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) and his accomplice Mi Fu (1051–1107) <b>often</b> partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was <b>often</b> proposed. The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were <b>often</b> collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting.|$|E
5|$|Fieldfares <b>often</b> nest {{in small}} colonies, {{possibly}} {{for protection from}} predators. The nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid. The chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight. There may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north. Migrating birds and wintering birds <b>often</b> form large flocks, <b>often</b> {{in the company of}} Redwings.|$|E
