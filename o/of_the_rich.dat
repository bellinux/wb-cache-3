5|$|Argentina {{possesses}} definite comparative {{advantages in}} agriculture, {{as the country}} is endowed with {{a vast amount of}} highly fertile land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income. By 1913, Argentina was the world's 10th wealthiest nation per capita.|$|E
5|$|As {{the revolt}} and raids were {{occurring}} in Campania, {{which was a}} vacation region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> and influential in Rome, {{and the location of}} many estates, the revolt quickly {{came to the attention of}} Roman authorities.

The Sommerheim Park Archaeological District in Millcreek Township, Pennsylvania west of the city, includes artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas, {{as well as from}} the Early and Middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000 BCE to 500 CE.|$|E
5|$|Marley was correct. In 1864, just 14 {{years after}} the {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> source of ironstone, Bolckow, Vaughan and Company Ltd was registered with capital of £2,500,000, making it the largest company ever formed up to that time.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Wirotomo, Sudirman {{spent a year}} at a Muhammadiyah-run teacher's college in Surakarta, but later dropped out owing {{to a lack of}} funds. In 1936 he {{returned}} to Cilacap to teach at a Muhammadiyah-run elementary school, having been trained by his teachers at Wirotomo; that year he married Alfiah, a former schoolmate and the daughter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> batik merchant Raden Sastroatmojo. After the marriage Sudirman lived at his father-in-law's house in Cilacap so he could save money for his own home. The couple went on to have three sons, Ahmad Tidarwono, Muhammad Teguh Bambang Tjahjadi, and Taufik Effendi, and four daughters, Didi Praptiastuti, Didi Sutjiati, Didi Pudjiati, and Titi Wahjuti Satyaningrum.|$|E
5|$|Carved {{designs in}} lacquerware and designs glazed onto {{porcelain}} wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity {{to those in}} painting. These items {{could be found in}} the homes of the wealthy, alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade, ivory, and cloisonné. The houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework. The writing materials in a scholar's private study, including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood, were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal.|$|E
5|$|Dirleton Castle {{stands on}} a rocky outcrop, at the heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> {{agricultural}} lands of the barony of Dirleton, and guards the coastal approach to Edinburgh from England, via the port of North Berwick. The ruins comprise a 13th-century keep, and a 16th-century house which the Ruthvens built adjacent. Only the basement levels survive of the 14th- and 15th-century additions built by the Haliburtons, although these comprised a large hall and tower house along the east range. Other buildings within the courtyard have also been demolished. Surrounding the castle are gardens, {{which may have been}} first laid out in the 16th century, although the present planting is largely of the 20th century. The garden walls enclose a 16th-century doocot, or pigeon house.|$|E

5|$|Even liberal {{senators}} were agitated by {{the proposed}} changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, and argued that a tribune who opposes {{the will of the}} people in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> is not a true tribune. The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} {{reported}} throughout the state. About one-seventh {{of the cotton}} crop was destroyed by Octave. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> topsoil crop was washed downstream into large reservoirs. Furthermore, agriculture damage totaled about $97.5 million. Damage to homes totaled $17 million while damages to business exceeded $6 million in damage. Public property damage reached $55.7 million. A father, mother, and two children were swept off their truck in Ash Fork. Two navy officers where killed on September 30 near Ostman when their jet crashed. On October 1, a man drowned in the Santa Cruz river. Another person drowned in a wash near Tucson when his truck stalled. In addition, a taxi driver and a passenger died when tried to cross a flooded river.|$|E
5|$|France in the 12th {{century was}} a loose {{collection}} of counties and smaller polities, under the minimal {{control of the}} king of France. The king's power was linked to his control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> province of Île-de-France, just {{to the east of}} Stephen's home county of Blois. In the west lay the three counties of Maine, Anjou and Touraine, and to the north of Blois was the Duchy of Normandy, from which William the Conqueror had conquered England in 1066. William's children were still fighting over the collective Anglo-Norman inheritance. The rulers across this region spoke a similar language, albeit with regional dialects, followed the same religion, and were closely interrelated; they were also highly competitive and frequently in conflict with one another for valuable territory and the castles that controlled them.|$|E

5|$|Imelda's Blue Ladies—specifically Maria Luisa, a {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> Madrigal {{family and the}} wife of Dr. Vasquez—contributed to the fashion spending of Imelda. In 1968, Maria Luisa accompanied Imelda on an overseas trip, during which Imelda and daughter Imee spent $3.3 million. It was also {{at this time that}} Dr. Daniel Vasquez and Maria Luisa opened a Citibank account. On November of the same year, the couple added Fernanda Vazquez as a joint holder of the bank account. An allegation that Imelda and Fernanda Vasquez {{are one and the same}} is validated by the fact that the notations for the bank account had Imelda Marcos's handwriting.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's {{geographical}} {{location in the}} Midwest, its large population, and its agricultural production made the state's wartime support critical to the Union's success. Indiana, with the fifth-largest population of the states that remained in the Union, could supply much-needed manpower for the war effort, its railroad network {{and access to the}} Ohio River and the Great Lakes could transport troops and supplies, and its agricultural yield, which became even more valuable to the Union after the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> farmland of the South, could provide grain and livestock.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Army of Northern Virginia won {{a major victory}} over the Army of the Potomac at the Battle of Chancellorsville (April 30 May 6, 1863), Robert E. Lee decided upon a second {{invasion}} of the North (the first was the unsuccessful Maryland Campaign of September 1862, which ended in the bloody Battle of Antietam). Such a move would upset U.S. plans for the summer campaigning season and possibly reduce {{the pressure on the}} besieged Confederate garrison at Vicksburg. The invasion would allow the Confederates to live off the bounty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> Northern farms while giving war-ravaged Virginia a much-needed rest. In addition, Lee's 72,000-man army could threaten Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and possibly strengthen the growing peace movement in the North.|$|E

5|$|The rural Fasci in {{particular}} were a curious phenomenon: both ancient and modern. They combined millenarian aspirations with urban intellectual leadership often {{in contact with}} workers’ organizations and ideas in the more industrialized Northern Italy. According to the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, the Fasci were millenarian insofar as the socialism preached by the movement was seen by the Sicilian peasantry as a new religion, the true religion of Christ – betrayed by the priests, {{who were on the}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> – that foretold the dawn of a new world, without poverty, hunger and cold, in accordance with God’s will. The Fasci, which included many women, were encouraged by the messianic belief that {{the start of a new}} reign of justice was looming and the movement spread like an epidemic.|$|E
5|$|This period, {{between the}} eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a {{tripartite}} {{struggle for the}} resources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> Gangetic plains, {{each of these three}} empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, giant lemurs {{existed on}} Madagascar. Now {{represented}} only by recent or subfossil remains, they were modern forms {{that were once}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation. Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in their living relatives. All 17extinct lemurs were larger than the extant (living) forms, some weighing as much as 200kg (440lb), and {{are thought to have}} been active during the day. Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled ecological niches that either no longer exist or are now left unoccupied. Large parts of Madagascar, which are now devoid of forests and lemurs, once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20lemur species covering the full range of lemur sizes.|$|E
