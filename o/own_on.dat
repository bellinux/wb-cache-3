5|$|Batik was {{mentioned}} in the 17th century Malay Annals. The legend goes when Laksamana Hang Nadim was ordered by Malacca King, Sultan Mahmud, to sail to India to buy 140 pieces of serasah cloth (batik) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each. Unable to find any that fulfilled the requirements explained to him, he made up his <b>own.</b> <b>On</b> his return unfortunately his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces, earning displeasure from the Sultan.|$|E

However, the Board {{ultimately}} had the relic relocated to the Cathedral of Saint Henry in Helsinki, the oldest church in the modern Catholic Diocese of Finland, because Catholics still actively venerate the relic as sacred. Since then, it has been located inside the altar of the Catholic cathedral.|$|E

5|$|According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was {{the first}} Mega Man game to be {{outsourced}} to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its <b>own</b> <b>on</b> the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.|$|E
5|$|De Montfort's {{coalition}} {{began to}} quickly fragment, Henry regained his {{freedom of movement}} and renewed chaos spread across England. Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute, as had been {{laid out in the}} Treaty of Kingston; de Montfort was initially hostile to this idea, but, as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well. Henry went to Paris in person, accompanied by de Montfort's representatives. Initially de Montfort's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the Mise of Amiens, condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford. Louis had strong views of his <b>own</b> <b>on</b> the rights of kings over those of barons, but was also influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope. Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements, Henry returned to England in February 1264, where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision.|$|E

5|$|Early that month, the Stavka issued {{orders to}} Southwestern Strategic Direction {{headquarters}} for an offensive in the region, after the victories following the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation and the Barvenkovo–Lozovaya Offensive Operation in the Donbas region. The forces of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and Lieutenant General Kirill Moskalenko penetrated German positions {{along the northern}} Donets River, east of Kharkov. Fighting continued into April, with Moskalenko crossing the river and establishing a tenuous bridgehead at Izium. In the south, the Soviet 6th Army had limited success defending against German forces, which managed to keep a bridgehead of their <b>own</b> <b>on</b> the east bank of the river. Catching the attention of Stalin, it set the pace for the prelude to the eventual offensive intended to reach Pavlohrad and Sinelnikovo and eventually Kharkov and Poltava.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{were formed}} in 2005 {{by a group}} of Manchester United {{supporters}} following the club's controversial takeover by Malcolm Glazer which led to hundreds of supporters defecting from the club. Without a stadium of their own they agreed to use Bury's Gigg Lane stadium, but the agreement continued at the cost of approximately £5,000 per match. Within a year, the fan-owned club set aspirations to build its own 7,000 to 10,000 capacity stadium as close to Manchester city centre as possible by 2012 and consequently entered into negotiations with New East Manchester and Manchester City Council to develop their plans. Despite attendances averaging over 2,000 in their first few seasons, the fact that the club did not have access to a stadium of its <b>own</b> <b>on</b> its match days was a contributory factor in the club's financial loss for three years (£42,267 in 2007, £40,669 in 2008 and £9,663 in 2009).|$|E
5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their <b>own</b> <b>on</b> the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils.|$|E

5|$|On June 23, 2002, Los Infernales won the Mexican National Trios Championship from Olímpico, Mr. Niebla and Safari. After {{they won}} the {{championship}} they began feuding with La Familia de Tijuana (Nicho el Millonario, Halloween and Damián 666). The trio lost the title to La Familia on September 27, 2002 but continued feuding into 2003. When Nicho stopped appearing for CMLL the trios championship was vacated but Los Infernales refused to take them without a match. This storyline led to an eight-team trios title tournament whichLos Infernales did not win. Instead Los Infernales did win a tournament to become the number one contenders for the CMLL World Trios Championship but lost to champions Black Tiger III, Dr. Wagner Jr. and Universo 2000 on August 1, 2003. At {{the end of the}} year, Averno and Mephisto turned on Satánico but there was little to feuding afterwards they split from the group and ventured out on their <b>own.</b> <b>On</b> February 4, 2004 Mephisto defeated El Satánico to win the CMLL World Welterweight Championship at CMLL’s home at Arena México.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, the Japanese {{established}} a naval refueling, communications, and seaplane reconnaissance base on Tulagi and the nearby islets of Gavutu and Tanambogo, and in July 1942 began to build a large airfield on nearby Guadalcanal. The Japanese activities on Tulagi and Guadalcanal were observed by Allied reconnaissance aircraft, {{as well as by}} Australian coastwatcher personnel stationed in the area. Because these activities threatened the Allied supply and communication lines in the South Pacific, Allied forces counter-attacked with landings of their <b>own</b> <b>on</b> Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August 1942, initiating the critical Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces that, along with the New Guinea campaign, decided {{the course of the war}} in the South Pacific.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of continued control of Alberta's resources {{by the federal}} government extended beyond the merely financial. As Alberta's smaller towns and rural areas were being connected to the electrical grid, Calgary Power made an application to the federal government for hydroelectric rights on the upper Bow River. Not wanting these rights to fall into private hands, Brownlee made an application of his <b>own</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the Alberta government. It was denied by Charles Stewart, federal Minister of the Interior and the Premier of Alberta whom the UFA had defeated in 1921.|$|E

5|$|The {{respective}} {{forces of}} the royal and baronial armies have been estimated to be 10,000 and 5,000 strong. Montfort, facing such unfavourable numbers, decided to concentrate his forces on {{the centre of the}} enemy’s front, hoping to drive a wedge through the line. Though the tactics were initially successful, the baronial forces soon lost the initiative, especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable, and deserted at an early point. The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort's, surrounding them. With Montfort confronted by a force twice the size of his <b>own,</b> <b>on</b> unfavourable ground, the battle rapidly turned into a massacre.|$|E
5|$|This set {{the pattern}} for the six-year {{conflict}} between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians tried {{to put pressure on}} the Sultan, by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman Crusade, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their <b>own</b> <b>on</b> Venetian possessions in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Icelandic or Faroese, {{the long}} history of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, {{particularly}} Old Norse and Norman French, left a profound mark of their <b>own</b> <b>on</b> the language, such that English shares substantial vocabulary and grammar similarities with many languages outside its linguistic clades, while also being unintelligible with any of those languages. Some scholars have even argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole – a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.|$|E

5|$|Vocalizations made {{by right}} whales are not {{elaborate}} {{compared to those}} made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500Hz. The purpose of the sounds is not known but may {{be a form of}} communication between whales within the same group. Northern right whales responded to sounds similar to police sirens—sounds of much higher frequency than their <b>own.</b> <b>On</b> hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular interest because northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this information may be useful in attempts {{to reduce the number of}} ship-whale collisions or to encourage the whales to surface for ease of harvesting.|$|E
5|$|Wallace, {{who was a}} cadet of the Officers Training Corps, was {{commissioned}} second lieutenant in the 5th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's <b>Own)</b> <b>on</b> 5 August 1914, while still an undergraduate.

There, he participated in the First Battle of the Aisne and was active on the Western Front at Frelinghien and Ploegsteert Wood.|$|E
5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his <b>own</b> <b>on</b> Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E
