Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp's residence. When Sharp {{answered}} the door, the visitor grabbed him with his left hand and used his right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger. Sharp died at approximately two <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E

Like Admiral Yi's {{previous}} battles, the Japanese {{were unable to}} respond effectively to the Korean's tactics. The tightness of Noryang Strait hindered lateral movement, and Yi's maneuvers prevented the Japanese fleet from boarding their enemies' vessels, their primary naval tactic.|$|R
5|$|In 1981 Icke {{became a}} sports {{presenter}} for the BBC's national programme, Newsnight, which {{had begun the}} previous year. Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on {{the first edition of}} the BBC's Breakfast Time, British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news for them until 1985, which meant getting up at two <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> five days a week. In the summer of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted Grandstand, at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme. He also published his first book that year, It's a Tough Game, Son!, about how to break into football.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of the debris of the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him {{would have to be a}} much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E
5|$|Becoming a Peking opera {{performer}} {{requires a}} long and arduous apprenticeship beginning from an early age. Before the 20th century, pupils were often handpicked {{at a young age}} by a teacher and trained for seven years on contract from the child's parents. Since the teacher fully provided for the pupil during this period, the student accrued a debt to his master that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organized schools. Students at these schools rose as early as five <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> for exercises. Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and senior students performed in outside theatres in the evening. If they made any mistakes during such performances, the entire group was beaten with bamboo canes. Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930, but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. New schools were not opened until 1952.|$|E

She went to general quarters at nine, loaded her pivot guns with shell, and cleared for action. The warship entered the strait at 10:45 and beat to quarters. Soon, three signal guns boomed from the landward, alerting the batteries and ships of Lord Mori of Wyoming's arrival.|$|R
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About two <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is {{like that of a}} dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
5|$|This left Chaltin's {{expedition}} as the spearhead for Leopold's northern campaign, and {{the commandant}} continued his mission despite the grave loss of Dhanis' forces. Chaltin {{had in his}} column eight companies, each containing one-hundred Congolese soldiers led by a Belgian lieutenant. He {{was accompanied by a}} contingent of five hundred Azande under chiefs Renzi and Bafuka. The expedition reached the Nile on 14 February 1897, where a small party of Mahdists from Rejaf exchanged fire with Chaltin's scouts. After two days of waiting for the supply train and rear guard to arrive, a Mahdist force approached the Belgian camp in the evening of 16 February, and prepared to attack. Chaltin ordered his artillery to fire at the Mahdists, causing the assembled rebels to flee under the barrage. The next day, at six <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> Chaltin took to the offensive and began to advance on Rejaf.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year-long}} {{struggle}} with cancer, {{surrounded by his}} family, Grant died at 8 <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> in the Mount McGregor cottage on July 23, 1885, {{at the age of}} 63. Sheridan, then Commanding General of the Army, ordered a day-long tribute to Grant on all military posts, and President Grover Cleveland ordered a thirty-day nationwide period of mourning. After private services, the honor guard placed Grant's body on a special funeral train, which traveled to West Point and New York City. A quarter of a million people viewed it in the two days before the funeral. Tens of thousands of men, many of them veterans from the Grand Army of the Republic marched with Grant's casket drawn by two dozen horses to Riverside Park in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan. His pallbearers included Union generals Sherman and Sheridan, Confederate generals Simon Bolivar Buckner and Joseph E. Johnston, Admiral David Dixon Porter, and Senator John A. Logan, the head of the GAR. Following the casket in the seven-mile-long procession were President Cleveland, the two living former presidents Hayes and Arthur, all of the President's Cabinet, as well as the justices of the Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. The home was a self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at three <b>o’clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E
5|$|At nine <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> {{students}} began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises {{in defiance of}} Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired tear gas shells towards the gate to warn the students. A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When {{a group of students}} sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar. As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began. At the assembly, six legislators including Manoranjan Dhar, Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and Dhirendranath Datta requested that chief minister Nurul Amin visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning. This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed. However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.|$|E
5|$|Elvas {{was reached}} by the Spanish army on 22 October and a siege begun. Although the fortifications could not ensure safety from a {{full-scale}} assault supported with heavy guns, they enabled the defenders to withstand a considerable attack for enough time to allow the Portuguese to mobilize a relief army in Estremoz, firstly under André de Albuquerque and later under António Luís de Meneses, Count of Cantanhede. On 17 January, around 8 <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> the Portuguese attacked the Spanish in their trenches. The battle was undecided in its initial stages, as the Duke of San Germán and other Spanish generals {{made every effort to}} collect their troops and recover the lost ground, but after some time, the Portuguese forces of Cantanhede managed to break the lines and the Spanish retreated to Badajoz with great loss: from the initial army of 17, 500 men, only 5,000 infantry men plus 1,300 horsemen managed to reach Badajoz, and all the artillery together with 5,000 men, 15,000 firearms, luggage and correspondence, were captured. The Portuguese army again besieged Badajoz shortly after, bringing events in the region full circle, but failed once again to take the city. By then, the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees had ended Spains's war with France and the recovery of Portugal had become the main objective of Philip IV.|$|E

From laden asses vegetables were unloaded, from little carts all kinds of things, boots, pots, tin-ware, hats, sweet-things, and heaps of corn and beans and seeds. By eight <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> December <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> market was <b>in</b> full swing: a great crowd of handsome mountain people, all peasants, nearly all in costume, with different head-dresses.|$|R
5|$|Having {{begun to}} push back the feeble French forces from Marmont's VI's Corps the day before, Blücher {{occupied}} Champaubert early on 14 February, sending his vanguard forward, {{as far as the}} village of Fromentières and then Vauchamps. Marmont, commanding only the Lagrange division and 800 men from the Ricard division, had cautiously pulled his men back towards Montmirail, where he began to receive reinforcements. Towards 9 <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> Blücher set Zieten's brigade and some cavalry in motion from Vauchamps towards Montmirail. To their surprise, Marmont's men didn't give ground this time and vigorously counterattacked, pushing Zieten's advance guard back into the village of Vauchamps. The accompanying Prussian cavalry was dispersed by a violent French cannonade. With now both brigades of Ricard's division available, Marmont launched these men against the Prussian position at Vauchamps, with the 1st brigade on his right, advancing under the cover of the Beaumont forest, south of the Montmirail-Vauchamps road and the 2nd brigade on his left, north of the road, advancing frontally towards the position. Marmont also had with him his own escort cavalry squadron and four élite Imperial Guard duty squadrons from the Emperor's own escort, under general Lion. Marmont's leftmost brigade entered Vauchamps, but, with the village heavily invested with Zieten's Prussian defenders, the Frenchmen were soon repulsed, with the Prussians in pursuit. Marshal Marmont then launched his five squadrons to the rescue and the cavalry promptly forced the Prussians back to the village, with one of their battalions taken prisoner, after taking refuge in an isolated farm.|$|E

60|$|Some days passed, the scrivener being {{employed}} upon another lengthy work. His late remarkable conduct {{led me to}} regard his ways narrowly. I observed that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any where. As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be outside of my office. He was a perpetual sentry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner. At about eleven <b>o'clock</b> though, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> I noticed that Ginger Nut would advance toward <b>the</b> opening <b>in</b> Bartleby's screen, as if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat.

60|$|By chance I {{have got}} a fine effect <b>in</b> churches at <b>the</b> five <b>o'clock</b> mass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>the</b> worshipers are nearly all peasants {{who have come to}} market, and who are pretty sure, each one, to have a bundle or basket. At this hour the sacristan is heavy with sleep; he dodges uncertainly at the tapers as he lights and extinguishes them; and his manner to the congregation, as he passes through it to the altar, is {{altogether}} rasped and nervous. I think it is best to be one's self a little sleepy,--when the barefooted friar at the altar (if it is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church of the Scalzi, say) has a habit of getting several centuries back from you, and of saying mass to the patrician ghosts from the tombs under your feet and there is nothing at all impossible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance angels and cherubs in marble, floating and fatly tumbling about on the broken arches of the altars.|$|R

40|$|On {{the base}} of related hail data in Chongqing from 1901 to 2010, this paper {{analyses}} and researches <b>in</b> detail <b>the</b> hail’s spatial-temporal distribution characteristic.

There were less hail disasters in early 40 years of last century. After that it increased significantly in each age till 1970 ’s. The hail’s number is highest in 1975. But in recent 30 years, the yearly hail number of Chongqing has decreased. Except January, there has possibility of hail disaster <b>in</b> Chongqing. But <b>the</b> hail disaster mainly concentrated from March to August. And April has highest hail number. The hail disaster occurs mainly from 14 to 2 <b>o’clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next <b>morning.</b> At spatial distribution, the eastern part of Chongqing had more hails than the western part. The northeastern part had more chances of hail disaster than southeastern. The reasons of this spatial distribution are landform and cold air moving path...|$|R
