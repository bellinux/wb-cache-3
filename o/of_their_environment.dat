5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment.</b> Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms {{could be used in}} bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E
5|$|In this period, {{while the}} Great Migration of African Americans {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment.</b> At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{concept of}} ecosystem {{can be traced}} back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ("Man and Nature"). Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment</b> to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.|$|E

25|$|Archaic Homo sapiens had robust skeletons {{indicating}} that they lived a physically demanding life; this can mean that anatomically modern humans, with their gracile frames, had become dependent on technology rather than on raw physical power {{to meet the challenges}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jared Diamond, in , {{argues that}} {{cultures}} self-limit when they exceed the sustainable carrying capacity <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment,</b> and {{the consumption of}} strategic resources (frequently timber, soils or water) creates a deleterious positive feedback loop that leads eventually to social collapse and technological retrogression.|$|E
50|$|The Italian {{crested newt}} is a poikilothermic ectotherm. This {{means that they}} do not thermoregulate by {{internal}} forces, but rather adopt the temperature of the surrounding conditions. This can be either advantageous or problematic, depending on the situation. Because of the phase-changes of T. carnifex, there will be a large variation in the temperature <b>of</b> <b>their</b> surrounding <b>environments.</b> This means {{that it is necessary to}} use mainly behavioral mechanisms to survive in the changing temperature <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environments.</b>|$|R

25|$|Most Pygmy {{communities}} are partially hunter-gatherers, living partially but not {{exclusively on the}} wild products <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment.</b> They trade with neighbouring farmers to acquire cultivated foods and other material items; no group lives deep in the forest without access to agricultural products.|$|E
25|$|Flexible or {{opportunistic}} breeders mate {{whenever the}} conditions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment</b> become favorable. Their ability and motivation to mate are primarily independent of day-length (photoperiod) and instead rely on cues from short-term changes in local conditions like rainfall, food abundance and temperature. Another {{factor is the}} presence of suitable breeding sites, which may only form with heavy rain or other environmental changes.|$|E
25|$|The {{hippocampus}} provides {{animals with}} a spatial map <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment.</b> It stores information regarding non-egocentric space (egocentric means {{in reference to}} one's body position in space) and therefore supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory. This means that it allows for viewpoint manipulation from memory. It is however, important for long-term spatial memory of allocentric space (reference to external cues in space). Maintenance and retrieval of memories are thus relational or context dependent. The hippocampus makes use of reference and working memory and has {{the important role of}} processing information about spatial locations.|$|E

As time goes on, Alice and Rufus’ relationship begins to seem more like a miserable married couple while Dana and Kevin become somewhat distant.|$|E
25|$|Diamond {{uses the}} Spanish conquistador's conquering of the Americas {{as a case}} study for his theory. He argues that the Europeans took {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment</b> to build large and complex states complete with advanced technology and weapons. The Incans and other native groups were not as blessed, suffering from a north–south orientation that prevented the flow of goods and knowledge across the continent. The Americas also lacked the animals, metals, and complex writing systems of Eurasia which prevented them from achieving the military or biological protections needed to fight off the European threat.|$|E
25|$|These {{cells are}} found in all regions {{of the brain and}} spinal cord. Microglial cells are small {{relative}} to macroglial cells, with changing shapes and oblong nuclei. They are mobile within the brain and multiply when the brain is damaged. In the healthy central nervous system, microglia processes constantly sample all aspects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment</b> (neurons, macroglia and blood vessels). In a healthy brain, microglia direct the immune response to brain damage and {{play an important role in}} the inflammation that accompanies the damage. Many diseases and disorders are associated with deficient microglia, such as, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ALS.|$|E

25|$|Placing {{importance}} on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas, {{which has been}} shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown that students who participate in outdoor education programs show a greater understanding <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment,</b> greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm for school and learning. Green spaces have also been shown connect urban dwellers of all ages with nature, even when dominated by invasive species. Reconnecting people with nature is especially important for conservation because there is a tendency for people to use the biodiversity present in the landscape they grew up in as a point of comparison for future trends (see Shifting baseline).|$|E

25|$|By October 1945, DDT was {{available}} for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning. Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring. It cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>environment</b> and health effects. The book claimed that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause cancer and that their agricultural use {{was a threat to}} wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States. A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but its limited and still-controversial use in disease vector control continues, because of its effectiveness in reducing malarial infections, balanced by environmental and other health concerns.|$|E
