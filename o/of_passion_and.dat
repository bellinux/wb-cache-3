She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment <b>of</b> <b>passion,</b> <b>and</b> he dies.|$|E
5|$|The Rage {{played in}} the 4,500 seat EnCana Events Centre where their first win came on September 24, 2010, against the Alaska Avalanche. Their final home game was a loss to the Wenatchee Wild in March 2012. The team's name and symbol was {{intended}} to represent an outward expression <b>of</b> <b>passion</b> <b>and</b> internal desire to dominate other teams. The Rage players, all aged between 15 and 20 years old in accordance with league rules, were active with charities and within the community. Prior to the team's formation, the ownership group attempted to establish the team in the British Columbia Hockey League but were refused with the league citing {{the lack of a}} competitive base for a northern division. The group also attempted to establish the team in the Alberta Junior Hockey League but that league was not interested in expanding or re-locating teams at that time. Another unsuccessful attempt at moving the team to either of those league was made before their dissolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{second section}} turns to {{different}} kinds of poems: heroic, pastoral, tragedy, comedy, satire and lyric. The third and longest section discusses poetic practice: what to write about, what the distinctive qualities of good poetry are, and what rules apply to individual genres. Scott uses a variety of examples from classical and modern poetry to illustrate how poetry achieves its purpose to teach, move and delight. Scott, following Julius Caesar Scaliger, dwells in particular on the four virtues of poetry that apply to both the poet's choice of material and style: Scott writes that Scaliger observes that to strike with the pleasure of our poem the doors of men's sense these four virtues are especially requisite: first a proportionableness or uniformity; secondly variety; thirdly sweetness; lastly that energeia, force effectualness, or vigour, which is the character <b>of</b> <b>passion</b> <b>and</b> life of persuasion and motion' (p. 33).|$|E

He became popular on campus as a result. Shortly after school he joined (now P-Square's official choreographer), Nonso Asobe's (a.k.a. Don Flexxx) dance group Ignite and performed in many events. Then in 2006 he featured on popular African act, D'banj's smashing hit, Why Me video as a dancer and on DJ Zeez's, Same Ni video. His dancing career was steady-rising towards peak when busy radio schedules among other activities choked out the time he made out for professional dancing.|$|E
25|$|In the 1630s he {{engaged in}} {{an affair with a}} married woman named Costanza (wife of his {{workshop}} assistant, Matteo Bonucelli, also called Bonarelli) and sculpted a bust of her (now in the Bargello, Florence) during the height of their romance. She later had an affair with his younger brother, Luigi, who was Bernini's right-hand man in his studio. When Gian Lorenzo found out about Costanza and his brother, in a fit of mad fury, he chased Luigi through the streets of Rome and into the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, threatening his life. To punish his unfaithful mistress, Bernini had a servant go to the house of Costanza, where the servant slashed her face several times with a razor. The servant was later jailed, and Costanza was jailed for adultery; Bernini himself was exonerated by the pope, even though he had committed a crime in ordering the face-slashing. Soon after, in May 1639, at age forty-one, Bernini wed a twenty-two-year-old Roman woman, Caterina Tezio, in an arranged marriage, under orders from Pope Urban. She bore him eleven children, including youngest son Domenico Bernini, who would later be his first biographer. After his never-repeated fit <b>of</b> <b>passion</b> <b>and</b> bloody rage and his subsequent marriage, Bernini turned more sincerely to the practice of his faith, according to his early official biographers.|$|E

Bette and Valérie are pure wickedness, and even celebrate the ruin of their targets. As one critic says, [...] "life's truths are viewed in their most atrocious form". Mocking {{the use of the}} guillotine during the French Revolution while acknowledging her own malicious intent, Valérie says with regard to Delilah: [...] "La vertu coupe la tête, le Vice ne vous coupe que les cheveux."

500|$|Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair {{proposed}} that although its [...] "themes <b>of</b> <b>passion</b> <b>and</b> heartache may be universal" [...] the film may be [...] "too gay", speaking [...] "in a vernacular that, I'd guess, only queer people are fully fluent in." [...] Lawson {{stated that the}} film's lack of [...] "gushing melodrama" [...] put it at a disadvantage. [...] Dorothy Snarker of IndieWire attributed the omissions to the Academy's demographics. Snarker agreed with Lawson that Carol may be too gay and too female [...] "for the largely old white male voting base" [...] to connect with. Snarker also considered that the successes of the LGBT rights movement in the U.S. may have been {{partly responsible for the}} lack of [...] "political urgency" [...] around the film.|$|E

500|$|Cristina Kirchner, {{the first}} elected female {{president}} in Argentine history, is a Peronist who has occasionally {{been referred to}} as [...] "The New Evita." [...] Kirchner says she does not want to compare herself to Evita, claiming she was a unique phenomenon in Argentine history.

On 26 July 2002, the 50th anniversary of Eva Perón's death, a museum opened in her honor called Museo Evita. The museum, created by her great-niece Cristina Alvarez Rodriquez, houses many of Eva Perón's clothes, portraits, and artistic renderings of her life, and has become a popular tourist attraction. The museum was opened in a building that was once used by the Eva Perón Foundation.|$|E
500|$|... "Como Duele" [...] is a latin pop ballad about [...] "the monotony that {{attacks the}} couples that have many years together, the lack <b>of</b> <b>passion</b> <b>and</b> regretted love {{that seems to}} pose over them." [...] Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic called the song [...] "phenomenal", and {{considered}} it as to be [...] "his biggest hits in years". He also named it, alongside [...] "Sin Ti.. Sin Mi" [...] and [...] "El Del Espejo", to be a standout track from the album. An editor from El Mercurio Online commented that [...] "Como Duele" [...] is [...] "a ballad of merciless chords and lyrics plagued of contradictions made metaphors." [...] He also stated that [...] "Is the logic of [...] 'Olvidarte', that song in which the guatemalan talked about making something as difficult as 'pulling the hair out of a bottle'," [...] and compared it to his past song [...] "Olvidarte", from Sin Daños a Terceros.|$|E
500|$|The seventh track [...] "If We're in Love" [...] was {{released}} as the album's lead single.

[...] "Ramalama (Bang Bang)", the eighth track, contains a chorus of onomatopoeic lyrics delivered over a tribal rhythm. The title track uses overdriven guitar parts and layers of overdubbed vocals. Its lyrics caution {{a woman who has}} become out of control and its title was chosen to contrast feelings <b>of</b> <b>passion</b> <b>and</b> melancholy. [...] "Off on It", a more experimental song with an unsteady rhythm, precedes [...] "Prelude to Love in the Making", an excerpt of less than one minute taken from [...] "Love in the Making" [...] on Sequins 2. The album closes with [...] "The Closing of the Doors", a cabaret-style ballad driven by the piano.|$|E

500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas.

Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common.

[...] He further described it as [...] "big and bombastic and full of guitars". The track features combative lyrics and repeated chants of [...] "We will rise again". Nadia Noir of CBS News felt that [...] "conquistador" [...] is an [...] "apt title" [...] for the [...] "bombastic blitzkreig-rock tune, an apocalyptic summons to something greater". Michael Depland of MTV explained that the song's lyrics suggest [...] "tumult and upheaval", while critic Emily Zemler from Billboard magazine wrote that its chanting chorus makes the song feel [...] "almost like a war cry". In {{a preview of the}} record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse felt that the track is [...] "self-detonated with the band's recognizable alt-rock bombast, complete with soaring violins," [...] and noted that it [...] "closed with a massive, stadium-filling chorus, delivered in [...] famous screamo vocal." ...|$|E
