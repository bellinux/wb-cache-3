With the information provided by the PF and the EKF, two residual based diagnosis systems and two likelihood based diagnosis systems are created. The results with the PF and the EKF are evaluated for both types of systems using real measurement data.

40|$|Neutrino Astronomy aims to scientifically exploit neutrinos {{as a new}} cosmic {{messenger}} {{to explore}} high energy astrophysical phenomena in the TeV-PeV energy range. The very low fluxes and the small interaction crosssection of neutrinos with matter require the construction of massive detectors. When the incoming neutrino direction can be reconstructed with a reasonable angular accuracy, the detector is dubbed "telescope", since the neutrinos, having no electric charge, point back to their source. In the Cherenkov technique, the observation of the neutrino is carried out through the detection of the Cherenkov light induced by the charged relativistic particles produced in the neutrino interaction with matter, mainly the muon {{in the case of}} the charged current interactions of muon neutrinos. From the arrival time and position of the detected Cherenkov photons induced by those secondary particles which cross the medium where the detector is located, information on the neutrino direction and energy can be inferred. Since the optical properties of the medium in which the telescope is located determine the transmission of the Cherenkov photons, a proper understanding of the influence of these properties in the track reconstruction and detector performance is required. The ANTARES deep-sea neutrino detector is the first fully operational undersea neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. It consists in a three-dimensional layout of 885 photomultipliers (PMTs) arranged in 12 detection lines plus one instrumentation line. Each detection line has 25 storeys, each of them containing triplets of PMTs housed in optical modules (OMs) and independent modules with the associated electronics. Some of these storeys are equipped with extra devices for time calibration and positioning of the detector. The Optical Beacon system, in particular, was designed for the in-situ time calibration of the apparatus, i. e. for the proper synchronization of its OMs. Although originally designed to this end, the <b>OB</b> <b>system</b> can be used to have a handle on the optical properties of the surrounding water.

In this sense, some optical properties of the water namely, transmission, absorption and effective scattering lengths are measured with the <b>OB</b> <b>system.</b> Additionally, a complementary study on how such properties influence the reconstruction of tracks and the detector performance is carried out. To reach this goal, special calibration runs were commissioned and new instruments for water properties measurements were built and operated, e. g. the multiwavelength beacon and the nano-beacons. The tuning of the operating parameters and the handling of such devices once installed in the detector were also tasks performed during this work to achieve the aforementioned goal. Likewise, the development of specialised software codes for calibration and physical analyses together with the production of large simulation samples were, in addition, an important part of this work...|$|R

Overnight (18 h) exposure of mice to a temperature of 4 degrees C led to the disappearance of ob mRNA in epididymal white fat, and subsequent studies showed that a cold-induced loss of ob mRNA could occur in as little as 2 - 4 h of exposure to 4 degrees C. When mice exposed to cold for 18 h were returned to the warm (24 degrees C), there was a rapid stimulation of {{the expression of the}} ob gene, the mRNA returning within 2. 5 h. Administration of noradrenaline led to a reduction in the level of ob mRNA in mice maintained in the warm, while isoprenaline resulted in the disappearance of the mRNA; these changes in ob mRNA were paralleled by similar changes in lipoprotein lipase mRNA. In contrast to white fat, the level of lipoprotein lipase mRNA in brown adipose tissue was increased by noradrenaline and isoprenaline.

40|$|In mammals, new neurons are {{generated}} {{throughout the entire}} lifespan in two restricted areas of the brain, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) – olfactory bulb (<b>OB)</b> <b>system.</b> In both regions newborn neurons display unique properties that clearly distinguish them from mature neurons. Enhanced excitability and increased synaptic plasticity enables them to add specific properties to information processing by modulating the existing local circuitry of already established mature neurons. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been suggested {{to play a role}} in spatial-navigation learning, spatial memory and spatial pattern separation. Cumulative evidences implicate that adult-born OB neurons contribute to learning processes and odor memory. We recently demonstrated that the cell fate determinant TRIM 32 is upregulated in differentiating neuroblasts of the SVZ-OB system in the adult mouse brain. The absence of TRIM 32 leads to increased progenitor cell proliferation and less cell death. Both effects accumulate in an overproduction of adult-generated OB neurons. Here, we present novel data from behavioral studies showing that such an enhancement of OB neurogenesis not necessarily leads to increased olfactory performance but in contrast even results in impaired olfactory capabilities. In addition, we show at the cellular level that TRIM 32 protein levels increase during differentiation of neural stem cells. At the molecular level, several metabolic intermediates that are connected to glycolysis, glycine or cysteine metabolism are deregulated in TRIM 32 knockout mice brain tissue. These metabolomics pathways are directly or indirectly linked to anxiety or depression like behavior. In summary, our study provides comprehensive data on how the impairment of neurogenesis caused by the loss of the cell fate determinant TRIM 32 causes a decrease of olfactory performance as well as a deregulation of metabolomic pathways that are linked to mood disorders...|$|R
