5|$|At {{the time}} of construction, the {{railways}} provided a leap in transport for the communities it passed through. NSB saw beautiful and grandeur stations {{as a way to}} draw patronage, and chose, in addition to impressive architecture, to build a park adjacent each stations. As construction went by, funding for stations were reduced, resulting in less grandeur further north. Most stations had two stories and an attic, although some of the stations serving lesser places had smaller buildings. From Steinkjer to Skogn, the ground floors were built in random rubble. As construction continued, budgets were reduced and station costs were cut. From Rinnan to Sparbu, the ground floors were instead built in brick, and from Mære and north, the stations have wooden ground floors. In addition to a station buildings, stations consisted of an <b>outhouse</b> and a freight house; selected stations also featured a water tower and motive power depot.|$|E
5|$|Moncton's {{shipbuilding}} era {{began in}} 1840 {{with the arrival}} of Stewart Russell, a shipbuilder from Hopewell. Russell built the Aginora, which sailed down the Petitcodiac River to trade at the ports in Saint John and New England. The ship and its crew sank in a storm on 24 December 1850, during a trip to Boston for Christmas. A ferry service on the Petitcodiac River was launched around 1841, thanks to a license obtained by Simon <b>Outhouse.</b> The Larch, built by Stephen Binney in 1845, was another important vessel, becoming the largest to sail on the river. But {{it was not until the}} arrival of Joseph Salter in 1846 that the shipbuilding boom began: a shipyard founded by Binney and Salter produced 24 vessels from 1847 to 1859, and employed almost 500 of the 1,000 inhabitants in Moncton. Salter would become the first mayor of Moncton in April 1855, the year the town was incorporated.|$|E

For example, an opulent 19th century antebellum example (a three-holer) is at the plantation area at the state park in Stone Mountain, Georgia. The <b>outhouses</b> of Colonial Williamsburg varied widely, from simple expendable temporary wood structures to high-style brick. See Jefferson's matched pair of eight-sided brick privies. Thomas Jefferson designed and had built two brick octagons at his vacation home. Such <b>outhouses</b> are sometimes considered to be overbuilt, impractical and ostentatious, giving rise to the simile [...] "."
