40|$|ABSTRACT Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2. 0 - 2. 1 Ga) {{intrusive}} rocks exposed {{along the southern}} border of the São Francisco Craton have been divided into three suites: granite suite, TTG (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite) suite, and gabro-diorite suite. The granite suite comprises two distinct groups of plutons, one composed of highly differentiated peraluminous granites, and the other including less evolved metaluminous to peraluminous high-K granites. It is suggested that granitic plutons are not derived from a single magma source, probably due to their association {{to more than one}} stage of the <b>orogen</b> <b>evolution.</b> TTG and gabro-diorite suites follow a calc-alkaline trend, and may constitute a single large suite originated from mantle-derived magmas at a plate margin setting. However, chemical data of some granodioritic plutons of the TTG suite indicates contribution of crust-derived material...|$|E
40|$|Despite much progress, many {{questions}} remain regarding the potential dynamic coupling between atmospheric and lithospheric {{processes in the}} long-term evolution of mountain belts. As a complement to recent efforts to discover the interrelationships among climate, topography, erosion, and rock deformation under conditions of mass-flux steady state, we explore orogen response to changes in climate and tectonic influx. We derive an analytical model that predicts a powerful climatic control on <b>orogen</b> <b>evolution</b> and distinct, potentially diagnostic, responses to climatic and tectonic perturbations. Due to isostatic compensation, the near-surface rock uplift rate during transients is tightly coupled to climate-modulated erosional efficiency. System response is approximately exponential, with a characteristic response timescale that is inversely proportional to the climate- and lithology-modulated erosional efficiency, and is largely insensitive to initial conditions, tectonic influx, and both the sign and magnitude of perturbations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractReconstruction of the Neoproterozoic supercontinent Rodinia shows near {{neighbour}} {{positions of}} the South Indian Cratons and Western Australian Cratons. These cratonic areas are characterized by extensive Paleoproterozoic tectonism. Detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal data of the Satpura Mountains of India indicates presence {{of at least three}} episodes of Proterozoic orogeny at ∼ 2100 – 1900 Ma, ∼ 1850 Ma and ∼ 1650 Ma, and associated basin development and closing. A subdued imprint of the Grenville orogeny (∼ 950 Ma) is also found in rock records of this Mountain Belt. The Capricorn Orogen of Western Australia also shows three episodes of orogeny: Opthalmian–Glenburgh Orogeny (2100 – 1950 Ma), Capricorn Orogeny (∼ 1800 Ma) and Mangaroon Orogeny (∼ 1650 Ma), and basin opening and closing related to these tectonic movements. These broad similarities suggest their joint evolution possibly in a near neighbour position during Paleoproterozoic Era. In view of juxtaposition of the Western Australia along the east coast of India, at the position of the Eastern Ghats, during Archean, it is suggested that the breaking of this Archean megacraton at ∼ 2400 Ma led to northward movement of the broken components and formation of the Satpura–Capricorn Orogen (at ∼ 2100 and ∼ 1800 Ma) due to the collision of cratonic blocks with the pre-existing northern cratonic nuclei of India and Western Australia. This is also the time of formation of the supercontinent Columbia. A phase of basin opening followed the ∼ 1800 Ma event, followed by another phase of collisional event at ∼ 1600 Ma {{at the site of the}} Satpura–Capricorn <b>Orogen.</b> Subsequent <b>evolutions</b> of the Satpura and the Capricorn Orogens differ slightly, indicating separate evolutional history...|$|R
40|$|The eastern fl ank of the Appalachian orogen is {{composed}} of extensive Neoproterozoic–early Paleozoic crustal blocks that originated in a peri-Gondwanan setting. Three of these blocks record the evolution of Neoproterozoic magmatic-arc systems, including Carolinia in the southern Appalachians and Ganderia and Avalonia in the northern Appalachians. Relationships among these three crustal blocks are impor-tant for understanding both the accretionary history of the <b>orogen</b> and the <b>evolution</b> of the Iapetus and Rheic Oceans, fi rst-order geographic features of the Paleozoic globe. Traditionally, Carolinia and Avalonia have been considered to represent a single microcontinental magmatic arc that accreted to Laurentia in the middle to late Paleo-zoic. The early lithotectonic history (ca. 680 – 570 Ma) of the two blocks is obscure; however, their latest Neoproterozoic-Paleozoic histories are distinct. This disparity is manifest in the fi rst-order features of (1) timing and style of magmatic-arc cessation and (2) {{the nature of their}} Paleozoic lithotectonic records. Magmatic arc activity ceased in Avalonia in the late Neoproterozoic (ca. 570 Ma), succeeded by extension-related mag...|$|R
40|$|The Himalayan orogen {{represents}} a ‘‘Composite Orogenic System’’ in which channel flow, wedge extrusion, and thrust stacking operate in separate ‘‘Orogenic Domains’’ with distinct rheologies and crustal positions. We analyze 104 {{samples from the}} metamorphic core (Greater Himalayan Sequence, GHS) and bounding units of the Annapurna-Dhaulagiri Himalaya, central Nepal. Optical microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analyses provide a record of deformation microstructures and an indication of active crystal slip systems, strain geometries, and deformation temperatures. These data, combined with existing thermobarometry and geochronology data are used to construct detailed deformation temperature profiles for the GHS. The profiles define a three-stage thermokinematic evolution from midcrustal channel flow (Stage 1, > 7008 C to 550 – 6508 C), to rigid wedge extrusion (Stage 2, 400 – 6008 C) and duplexing (Stage 3, < 280 – 4008 C). These tectonic processes are not mutually exclusive, but are confined to separate rheologically distinct Orogenic Domains that form the modular components of a Composite Orogenic System. These Orogenic Domains may be active {{at the same time}} at different depths/positions within the <b>orogen.</b> The thermokinematic <b>evolution</b> of the Annapurna-Dhaulagiri Himalaya describes the migration of the GHS through these Orogenic Domains and reflects the spatial and temporal variability in rheological boundary conditions that govern orogenic systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} Middle to Late Miocene {{evolution}} of the Transylvanian Basin {{was determined by the}} bordering Carpathian <b>orogen</b> <b>evolution,</b> the tectonic events being well recorded by the sedimentary history. The basin evolved in a back-arc setting, under a regional, compressional stress field. The major tectonic events produced during the Late Sarmatian and Post-Pannonian were related to the reactivation of the pre-Badenian fault systems. The Transylvanian Basin got uplifted after the Late Pannonian (? during the Pliocene), and at least 500 m of sedimentary cover was eroded. Based on seismic and well-log interpretation, core and outcrop sedimentology, and microfauna, eight sequences were defined. The early Middle Miocene sequences are roughly synchronous to five 3 rd order global sea-level cycles. Most of the recognized sequence boundaries are enhanced by regional tectonic events. The sedimentary evolution was also strongly influenced by salttectonics, active starting with the Late Sarmatian. Two sequences were identified in the Lower Badenian deposits. The third sequence (late Early Badenian to early Mid Badenian) preserves information about deeper shelf settings.

40|$|Many clues – already {{described}} in preceding papers (SCALERA, 2005 a, 2005 b, 2006 a, 2006 b, 2007 a, 2007 b) –, {{coming from a}} number of different fields, lead to an unitary interpretation for the involved phenomena and to a new interpretation of the orogenic processes and fold belt building. The unexpected inhomogeneous ‘filamentous’ distribution of the deep hypocentres on the Italian, Mediterranean and global Wadati-Benioff zones, the high velocity anomalies revealed by the seismic tomographies under the orogenic belt, the geochemical analysis of gas emissions and volcanic rocks, paleogeographic reconstructions and paleontologic fossils finding, all have called for a common schemata (SCALERA, 2005 a, 2005 b, 2006 a, 2006 b, 2007 a, 2007 b). The aforementioned clues, can certainly be considered each separated from the other, with the obvious result of finding non-unitary explanations, but if they are scrutinized all together, the whole set points to vertical displacements of materials as the main process responsible of earthquakes, orogenesis and volcanic phenomena. Then a model of the evolution of an idealised fold belt, without using the subduction concept, in a non-collisional view, should be searched for. In the following rows a proposal of model is presented (fig. 1 and fig. 2). In this initial formulation the <b>orogen</b> <b>evolution</b> sketch is a mono-vergence and its phases of evolution are analogous to the different phases that can be distinguished from south to north on Apennines and Alps, and on the Himalayas at a more mature stage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNorthern Sweden is {{currently}} experiencing active exploration within a new gold ore province, {{the so called}} Gold Line, situated southwest of the well-known Skellefte VMS District. The largest known deposit in the Gold Line is the hypozonal Fäboliden orogenic gold deposit. Mineralization at Fäboliden is hosted by arsenopyrite-rich quartz veins, in a reverse, mainly dip-slip, high-angle shear zone, in amphibolite facies supracrustal host rocks. The timing of mineralization is estimated, from field relationships, at ca. 1. 8 Ga. The gold mineralization is hosted by two sets of mineralized quartz veins, one steep fault–fill vein set and one relatively flat-lying extensional vein set. Ore shoots occur at the intersections between the two vein sets, and both sets could have been generated from the same stress field, during the late stages of the Svecofennian <b>orogen.</b> The tectonic <b>evolution</b> during the 1. 9 – 1. 8 Ga Svecofennian orogen is complex, as features typical of {{both internal and external}} orogens are indicated. The similarity in geodynamic setting between the contemporary Svecofennian and Trans-Hudson orogens indicates a potential for world-class orogenic gold provinces also in the Svecofennian domain. The Swedish deposits discussed in this paper are all structurally associated with roughly N–S striking shear zones that were active at around 1. 8 Ga, when gold-bearing fluids infiltrated structures related to conditions of E–W shortening...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAs several {{modeling}} studies indicate, {{the structural}} expression and dynamic behavior of oro-genic mountain belts are dictated {{not only by}} their rheological properties or by far-field tectonic motion, {{but also by the}} efficiency of erosion and sedimentation acting on its surface. Until recently, numerical inves-tigations have been mainly limited to 2 -D studies because of the high computational cost required by 3 -D models. Here, we have efficiently coupled the landscape evolution model Cascade with the 3 -D thermome-chanically coupled tectonics code FANTOM. Details of the coupling algorithms between both codes are given. We present results of numerical experiments designed to study the response of viscous-plastic crustal materials subjected to convergence and to surface processes including both erosion and sedimentation. In particular, we focus on the equilibration of both the tectonic structures and on the surface morphology of the orogen. We show that increasing the efficiency of fluvial erosion increases the frontal thrust angle, which in turn decreases the width of the orogen. In addition, the maximum summit elevation of the <b>orogen</b> during transient <b>evolution</b> is significantly higher in those models showcasing surface processes than those that do not. This illustrates the strong coupling between tectonics and surface processes. We also demon-strate that an along-strike gradient of erosion efficiency can have a major impact upon the landscape mor-phology and the tectonic structure and deformation of the orogen, in both the across-strike and along-strike directions. Overall, our results suggest that surface processes, by enhancing localization of deforma-tion, can act as a positive forcing to topographic building...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{integrated}} petrographic, metamorphic, and geochronological investigation of granulite-facies aluminous gneisses {{from the central}} Grenville Province in Québec, Canada. The project aimed at characterizing the gneiss protoliths and reconstructing the metamorphic history of the region. The results {{provide insight into the}} evolution of the Laurentian margin upon which the Grenville orogen is built, and contribute {{to our understanding of the}} Grenvillian orogeny. The rocks come from a metasedimentary sequence and a volcanogenic bimodal (felsic-mafic) sequence, both exposed in the orogenic hinterland. They consist of garnet–biotite–quartz–K-feldspar– plagioclase with kyanite in the north (high-pressure segment) and sillimanite in the south (mid-pressure segment), and display microstructural evidence of anatexis. The nature of the protoliths was constrained by zircon textures and in situ U–Pb ages obtained via laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA– ICPMS). Detrital zircon grains from the metasedimentary samples show Laurentian affinities, with ages between 2700 and 1500 Ma. In contrast, well-preserved igneous zircon grains from a sample of the bimodal sequence suggest a deposition age of 1238 ± 13 Ma, coeval with an episode of crustal extension in the central Grenville <b>orogen.</b> The metamorphic <b>evolution</b> of the aluminous rocks is inferred by interpretation of microstructures and mineral chemistry within the framework of isochemical pressure– temperature (P–T) diagrams (i. e., pseudosections), and in situ (LA–ICPMS) U–Pb dating of monazite. Data from a kyanite-bearing rock record a steep P–T path peaking at 14. 5 kbar and 860 – 900 °C, as in other parts of the high-P segment. In contrast, sillimanite-bearing rocks record large variations in T relative to P with a peak at 9. 5 kbar and 850 °C. Monazite mainly occurs in the rock matrix, where it commonly shows complex internal textures. Areas dark on backscattered electron (BSE) images record ages of 1070 – 1020 Ma with a main cluster at 1060 Ma. The large spread of ages in individual samples is consistent with a protracted residence of the host rocks under high-T conditions. In contrast, BSE-bright rims within matrix grains recorded ages of 1010 – 990 Ma, attributed to (re) crystallization that was promoted by fluid infiltration of the host rocks. This late event is coeval with ultra-potassic magmatism in this area and may record the orogenic collapse...|$|R
40|$|The {{continental}} redbeds {{from the}} Internal Domains of the central-western Mediterranean Chains {{have an important}} role in the palaeogeographic and palaeotectonic reconstructions of the Alpine circum-Mediterranean <b>orogen</b> <b>evolution</b> since these redbeds mark the Triassic- Jurassic rift-valley stage of Tethyan rifting. The composition and the sedimentary evolution of the Middle Triassic to Lowermost Jurassic continental redbeds of the San Marco d’Alunzio Unit (Peloritani Mountains, Southern Italy), based on mineralogical and chemical analyses, suggests that the studied mudrock sediments share common features with continental redbeds that constitute the Internal Domains of the Alpine Mediterranean Chains. Phyllosilicates are the main components in the mudrocks. The 10 A ° -minerals (illite and micas), the I–S mixed layers, and kaolinite are the most abundant phyllosilicates. The amount of illitic layers in I–S mixed layers coupled with the illite crystallinity values (IC) are typical of high degree of diagenesis, corresponding to a lithostatic/tectonic loading of about 4 – 5 km. The mineralogical assemblage coupled with the A-CN-K plot suggest post-depositional K-enrichments. Palaeoweathering proxies (PIA and CIW) record intense weathering at the source area. Further, the studied sediments are affected by reworking and recycling processes and, as consequence, it is likely these proxies monitor cumulative effect of weathering. The climate in the early Jurassic favoured recycling and weathering occurred under hot, episodically humid climate with a prolonged dry season. The source-area is the low-grade Paleozoic metasedimentary basement. Mafic supply is minor but not negligible as suggested by provenance proxies...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} considering coupling between a deforming elasto-visco-plastic fold thrust belt, fexural subsidence and diffusional surface processes is solved using the Finite Element Method to investigate how the mechanical behaviour of brittle-ductile wedges infuences {{the development of}} foreland basins. Results show that, depending mainly {{on the strength of}} the basal decollement, two end-member types of foreland basin are possible. When the basal detachment is relatively strong, the foreland basin systemis characterised by: (1) Highly asymmetrical orogen formed by thrusts concentrated in the incoming pro-wedge. (2) Sedimentation on retro-side takes place in one major foredeep basin which grows throughout <b>orogen</b> <b>evolution.</b> (3) Deposition on the pro-side occurs initially in the foredeep, and continues in the wedge-top before isolated basins are advected towards the orogen core where they become uplifted and exhumed. (4) Most pro-wedge basins show an upward progression from lowaltitude, foredeep deposits at the base to high altitude, wedge-top deposits near the surface. In contrast, when the basal detachment behaves weakly due to the presence of low viscosity material such as salt, the foreland basin system is characterised by (1) Broad, low relief orogen showing little preferential vergence and predominance of folding relative to faulting. (2) Deposition mainly in wedge-top basins showing growth strata. (3) Many basins are initiated contemporaneously but form discontinuously due to the locus of active deformation jumping back and forth between different structures. Model results successfully reproduce first order observations of deforming brittle-ductile wedges and foreland basins. Moreover, the results support and provide a framework for understanding the existence of two main end-member foreland basin types, simple and complex, associated with fold-thrust belts whose detachments are relatively strong and weak, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In the Kraków-Lubliniec {{section of}} the major Hamburg-Kraków-Dobrogea Fault Zone (HKDFZ), the Stephanian-Early Permian magmatic {{activity}} was simultaneous with subsidence/uplift of formed blocks. In {{the proximity of the}} uplifted areas the sedimentation started with fanglomerates, distally passing into playa siltstone and was accompanied by volcanism. In the Nieporaz-Brodła graben, basaltic trachyandesite a-a lava flows with autoclastic breccias reach ca. 150 m in thickness. The weathering recorded as adhesive rims around breccia clasts reflects palaeosoil formation during quiescence periods between the eruptions. The eruptions were effusive although scoriaceous lava indicates high volatile content of the magma. The water content before eruption had to be over 2 wt. percent. Only then the crystallisation model predicts accurately the type, composition and order of the crystallising phases. Thus, the basaltic trachyandesite magma originated from a source containing hydrous phase (i. e., amphibole or phlogopite). All the studied basaltic trachyandesites had fayalitic olivine on their liquidus reflecting the crystallisation stage in a magma chamber at crustal depths. During final decompression on the magma ascent due to water exsolution, the olivine was followed by plagioclase, spinel, augite, ilmenite, apatite, K-feldspar and residual high-K rhyolitic glass. The high potassium content of these volcanics was thus a primary feature reflecting the source geochemistry and differentiation trend, and its consequence was potassium metaso- matism. Due to water exsolution the glass was altered, however, homogenous interstitial glass survived in some rocks. The glass is strongly enriched in incompatible trace elements, showing that it is a highly fractionated residual melt fraction of the basaltic trachyandesite magma. Thus, the glass geochemistry reflects the trend of fractional crystallisation indicating that co-occurring K-rich felsic rocks were not derived from the same magma. All the basaltic trachyandesites studied have calc-alkaline to alkaline affinity. They contain fayalitic olivine and are low in MgO 0. 5 - 0. 80 and small Eu/Eu* > 0. 9 - 1. 0 anomalies suggesting fractionation of plagioclase. The Eu/Eu* anomaly is probably compensated by amphibole retaining in the source. Negative Nb, Ti anomalies suggest Fe-Ti oxide fractionation characteristic for calc-alkaline evolution trend. A significant enrichment in LREE relatively to HREE (La/Yb > 10) indicates subduction-related metasomatism. However, the described tectonic context is inconsistent with subduction related characteristics. Concluding, the observed geochemical characteristics indicate remarkable role of water in magma evolution. The volcanism was related to strike-slip dextral movement along the Kraków-Lubliniec section of HKDFZ, transformed into crustal extension and subsidence, the features typical for the formation of pull-apart basins, in the late stages of the Variscan <b>orogen</b> <b>evolution...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study {{of some of the}} {{processes}} which operate at mid crustal levels (10 - 20 km) during the emplacement of granitoid magmas, with particular reference to the process of in-situ expansion and the association between magma emplacement and <b>orogen</b> <b>evolution.</b> A number of plutons were studied to assess this the Ardara pluton from Donegal, NW Ireland, together with the Atibaia, Morro Azul, Imbiricu and Itapeti plutons from the Rio Paraiba do Sul shear belt (RPSSB), Sao Paulo state, SE Brazil. The emplacement of the Ardara pluton {{has been the subject of}} studies by many authors since the 1950 's. It has been interpreted as a diapir ascending along a thrust, a granite balloon which forcefully created more than 60 % of its space and, most recently, as a set of nested diapirs which forcefully created only 30 % of their own space. Field mapping together with the determination of finite strain within the pluton, shortening estimates, shear sense determinations, petrographic deformation fabrics and computer modelling indicates that: i) the pluton displays a concentrically increasing finite strain and it expanded in-situ from a central 'injection point', having possibly ascended along a shear zone-related conduit; ii) the country rocks partitioned intense strains into the 500 m closest to the pluton, a deformation feature which is shown to be consistent with a power-law wallrock theology; Hi) earlier granite pulses and the country rock were 'shouldered aside' to the east and west, expansion of the pluton, which was preferentially in a northwards direction; iv) that the intrusion related shortening preserved within the wallrocks was approximately equivalent to the strain preserved within pluton and the space requirements for the pluton are essentially met by preserved forceful emplacement-related strains; and v) if the pluton magma is considered as having ascended through dyke-like conduits emplacement could occur in a minimum of ~ 4000 yrs, whereas magma ascent as a Hot Stokes diapir would require hundreds of thousands to millions of years for complete emplacement. Finally, the Ardara pluton does not conform to any of the established criteria for diapir-like ascent of a magma body and the data demonstrate it to be a testable example of a pluton which expanded entirely in-situ. The Rio Paraiba do Sul shear belt (RPSSB) is a dextral transpressional segment of the Late Precambrian Brasiliano-Pan African orogenic belt. The studied plutons were emplaced in the latter stages of this orogen in close spatial association with one of the many northeast-southwest trending, sub-vertical, continental-scale shear zones. All the granites show a similar emplacement and deformation history despite their different petrographic features and isotopic ages. This history consists of an early shallowly dipping, low angle fabric, in the country rocks, associated with crustal thickening, the later development of dominantly dextral sub-vertical shear zones, followed by the emplacement of the studied plutons and finally overprinting by a pervasive dextral plane strain and late-stage discrete mylonitic shears. Field examination demonstrates that: i) each of the plutons preserves an internally homogeneous emplacement-related finite strain, weak magmatic fabric, magma sheets and weakly deformed wallrocks; ii) magmatic shear sense determinations and wallrock deformation fabrics indicate that, during emplacement, the RPSSB was extending (at least at the emplacement level) in an east-west direction creating sinistral dilatational pull-aparts along the major shear zones, into which granitic magma was preferentially emplaced; and Hi) within this generally extensional context there was a component of long axis perpendicular in-situ forceful expansion, this created no more than 20 % of the width of any one granite. Applying a simple pull-apart extension model suggests that pluton emplacement was associated with approximately 40 % regional extension sub-parallel to the former orogenic convergence direction. This emplacement, as a result of sheeting through dyke-like conduits, requires thousands of years, rather than the millions of years required for ascent and emplacement of a Hot Stokes diapir. Interpreting these results suggests that the intruded granitoids are associated with a mid-crustal component of orogen perpendicular extension I collapse during the latter stages of the Brasiliano orogeny. Such extension I collapse could have been initiated by: a cessation in continental convergence or; by the delamination of a thickened thermal boundary layer, a process which has been suggested to be the driving force behind orogenic collapse in younger orogenic belts. These examples demonstrate that: i) 'forceful' balloon-like emplacement of granitic magma can occur; ii) there are very close inter-relationships between granite emplacement and orogenic dynamics; and Hi) that 'space' for granitoid magma can be created by a combination of forceful and dilatational and fault-related mechanisms...|$|E
