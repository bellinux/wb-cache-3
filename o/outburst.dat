5|$|The Aurigids had a {{spectacular}} <b>outburst</b> in 1994, when many grazing meteors—those {{that have a}} shallow angle of entry and seem {{to rise from the}} horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though {{there were only a few}} visual observers for part of the <b>outburst,</b> the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 <b>outburst</b> of the Aurigids was predicted by Peter Jenniskens and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid <b>outburst,</b> many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 <b>outburst,</b> the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.|$|E

5|$|Each November, the Andromedids {{meteor shower}} appears to radiate from Andromeda. The shower peaks in mid-to-late November every year, {{but has a}} low peak rate of fewer than two meteors per hour. Astronomers have often {{associated}} the Andromedids with Biela's Comet, which was destroyed in the 19th century, but that connection is disputed. Andromedid meteors are known for being very slow and the shower itself {{is considered to be}} diffuse, as meteors can be seen coming from nearby constellations as well as from Andromeda itself. Andromedid meteors sometimes appear as red fireballs. The Andromedids were associated with the most spectacular meteor showers of the 19th century; the storms of 1872 and 1885 were estimated to have a peak rate of two meteors per second (a zenithal hourly rate of 10,000), prompting one Chinese astronomer to compare the meteors to falling rain. The Andromedids had another <b>outburst</b> on December 3–5, 2011, the most active shower since 1885, with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 50 meteors per hour. The 2011 <b>outburst</b> was linked to ejecta from Comet Biela, which passed close to the Sun in 1649. None of the meteoroids observed were associated with material from the comet's 1846 disintegration. The observers of the 2011 <b>outburst</b> predicted outbursts in 2018, 2023, and 2036.|$|E

40|$|Background:  Temper <b>outbursts</b> {{in youth}} with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) {{are a common}} source of concern, but remain poorly understood. This study examined a set of hypotheses related to: (a) the prevalence of temper <b>outbursts</b> in paediatric OCD, (b) the associations of temper <b>outbursts</b> with OCD severity and depressive symptoms; and (c) the influence of temper <b>outbursts</b> on treatment response. Methods:  The prevalence of temper <b>outbursts</b> was estimated in a specialist OCD clinical sample (n = 387) using parent- and child-report. This was replicated in a community sample (n = 18, 415). Associations of temper <b>outbursts</b> with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and with depressed mood were examined using logistic regression models. The influence of temper <b>outbursts</b> on treatment response was examined in a subsample of 109 patients treated with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with or without medication. Results:  Over a third of young people with OCD displayed temper <b>outbursts,</b> and rates were similar across the clinical and community samples. Temper <b>outbursts</b> were {{two to three times}} more common in youth with OCD than in healthy controls. However, OCD symptom severity was not a strong predictor of child- or parent-reported temper <b>outbursts.</b> Instead, both child- and parent- reported temper <b>outbursts</b> were significantly associated to depressive symptoms. CBT strongly reduced OCD and depressive symptoms, as well as the severity of temper <b>outbursts.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} post-treatment OCD or depression scores between those with temper <b>outbursts</b> compared to those without. Conclusions:  Temper <b>outbursts</b> are common in youth with OCD and are particularly related to depressed mood. They improve with CBT for OCD and do not seem to impede OCD treatment response...|$|R

One of the 1970 <b>outbursts</b> is symmetric in its intensity profile, while the two <b>outbursts</b> in 1971 have short exponential profiles separated by 80 days. Despite suggestive recurrence periods of approximately 85 and approximately 150 days evident in the time intervals between the <b>outbursts,</b> there is no single statistically significant recurrence time on which the <b>outbursts</b> recur consistently. In the 1970 symmetric event, there is evidence for a period of either 4. 10 or 5. 19 days. Drawing upon the analogy with SU Ursa Majoris dwarf novae, we suggest that the short period is orbital and any longer period would be associated with a precession period of the accretion disk...|$|R

In this work, we aim to constrain the physical parameters of the central engine of the HLX- 1 <b>outbursts</b> in the framework of the black hole accretion.

40|$|We {{show that}} if the dwarf-nova disc {{instability}} model includes the effects of heating by stream impact and tidal torque dissipation in the outer disc, the calculated properties of dwarf-nova <b>outbursts</b> change considerably, and several notorious deficiencies of this model are repaired. In particular: (1) outside-in <b>outbursts</b> occur for mass transfer rates lower than in the standard model as required by observations; (2) the presence of long (wide) and short (narrow) <b>outbursts</b> with similar peak luminosities is a natural property of the model. Mass-transfer fluctuations by factors ~ 2 can explain the occurrence of both long and short <b>outbursts</b> above the cataclysmic variable period gap, whereas below 2 hr only short normal <b>outbursts</b> are expected (in addition to superoutbursts which are not dealt with in this article). With additional heating by the stream and tidal torques, such fluctuations can also explain the occurrence of both outside-in and inside-out <b>outbursts</b> in SS Cyg and similar systems. The occurrence of outside-in <b>outbursts</b> in short orbital-period, low mass-transfer-rate systems requires the disc to be {{much smaller than the}} tidal-truncation radius. In this case the recurrence time of both inside-out and outside-in <b>outbursts</b> have a similar dependence on the mass-transfer rate.

40|$|Be/X-ray binary systems exhibit both {{periodic}} (Type I) X-ray <b>outbursts</b> {{and giant}} (Type II) <b>outbursts,</b> whose origin has remained elusive. We suggest that Type II X-ray <b>outbursts</b> occur when a highly misaligned decretion disk around the Be star becomes eccentric, allowing the compact object companion {{to capture a}} large amount of material at periastron. Using 3 D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations we model the long term evolution of a representative Be/X-ray binary system. We find that periodic (Type I) X-ray <b>outbursts</b> occur when the neutron star is close to periastron for all disk inclinations. Type II <b>outbursts</b> occur for large misalignment angles and are associated with eccentricity growth that occurs on a timescale of about 10 orbital periods. Mass capture from the eccentric decretion disk results in an accretion disk around the neutron star whose estimated viscous time is long enough to explain the extended duration of Type II <b>outbursts.</b> Previous studies suggested that the <b>outbursts</b> are caused by a warped disk but our results suggest that this is not sufficient, the disk must be both highly misaligned and eccentric to initiate a Type II accretion event.

The remarkable alternations of the <b>outbursting</b> states in V 503 Cyg support the presence of mechanisms of suppressing normal <b>outbursts</b> and premature quenching superoutbursts, which have been proposed to explain some unusual SU UMa-type <b>outbursts.</b> The observed temporal variability of the suppressing/quenching mechanisms in the same object suggests that these mechanisms are not primarily governed by a fixed system parameter but more reflect state changes in the accretion disk...|$|R

5|$|Corona Borealis {{is home to}} two {{remarkable}} {{variable star}}s. T Coronae Borealis is a cataclysmic variable star {{also known as the}} Blaze Star. Normally placid around magnitude 10—it has a minimum of 10.2 and maximum of 9.9—it brightens to magnitude 2 in a period of hours, caused by a nuclear chain reaction and the subsequent explosion. T Coronae Borealis {{is one of a handful}} of stars called recurrent novae, which include T Pyxidis and U Scorpii. An <b>outburst</b> of T Coronae Borealis was first recorded in 1866; its second recorded <b>outburst</b> was in February 1946. T Coronae Borealis is a binary star with a red-hued giant primary and a white dwarf secondary, the two stars orbiting each other over a period of approximately 8 months. R Coronae Borealis is a yellow-hued variable supergiant star, over 7000 light-years from Earth, and prototype of a class of stars known as R Coronae Borealis variables. Normally of magnitude 6, its brightness periodically drops as low as magnitude 15 and then slowly increases over the next several months. These declines in magnitude come about as dust that has been ejected from the star obscures it. Direct imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope shows extensive dust clouds out to a radius of around 2000AU from the star, corresponding with a stream of fine dust (composed of grains 5nm in diameter) associated with the star's stellar wind and coarser dust (composed of grains with a diameter of around 0.14µm) ejected periodically.|$|E

Time-resolved photometry revealed {{the presence of}} signals with a period of 0. 0832 ± 0. 0019 d, which is 3. 6 σ longer than the orbital period (0. 07635 d) of this system. We attributed this signal to superhumps, based on its deviation from the orbital period and its characteristic profile. During this anomalous state of SU UMa, normal <b>outbursts</b> were almost suppressed, in spite of relatively regular occurrences of superoutbursts. We consider that an ensuing tidally unstable state following the preceding superoutburst can be a viable mechanism to effectively suppress normal <b>outbursts,</b> resulting in an anomalously <b>outbursting</b> state...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a model for}} the long term evolution of a circumplanetary disk that is fed mass from a circumstellar disk and contains regions of low turbulence (dead zones). We show that such disks can be subject to accretion driven <b>outbursts,</b> analogous to <b>outbursts</b> previously modeled in the context of circumstellar disks to explain FU Ori phenomena. Circumplanetary disks around a proto-Jupiter can undergo <b>outbursts</b> for infall accretion rates onto the disks in the range ~ 10 ^{- 9 } to 10 ^{- 7 } M_sun/yr, typical of accretion rates in the T Tauri phase. During <b>outbursts,</b> the accretion rate and disk luminosity increases by several orders of magnitude. Most of the planet mass growth during planetary gas accretion may occur via disk <b>outbursts</b> involving gas that is considerably hotter than predicted by steady state models. For low infall accretion rates less than ~ 10 ^{- 10 } M_sun/yr that occur in late stages of disk accretion, disk <b>outbursts</b> are unlikely to occur, even if dead zones are present. Such conditions are favorable for the formation of icy satellites. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|R
