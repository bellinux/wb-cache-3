5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy</b> and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E

Both conditions are anxiety disorders which can be highly disruptive to everyday functioning yet are often concealed by those affected, out of shame, or feelings <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy.</b> She has said her anxiety disorders make it impossible for her to go to the cinema or board an airplane (in an interview she wished to be able to fly to New York to see the skyscrapers one day before dying), and incapable of taking part in any ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Perceptions of penis size are culture-specific. In Ancient Greece and in Renaissance art, a small penis {{which had}} not been circumcised was {{perceived}} as desirable in a man, whereas a large or circumcised penis was considered comical or grotesque. Ancient Rome {{may have had a}} contrary view, and a larger penis size was preferred in medieval Arabic literature. Males may quite easily underestimate the size of their own penis relative to that of others, and many men who believe that their penis is of inadequate size have average-sized penises. The perception of having a large penis is often linked to higher self-esteem. Fears of shrinking of the penis in folklore have led to a type of mass hysteria called penis panic, though the penis legitimately can shrink in size due to scar tissue formation in the penis from a medical condition called Peyronie's disease. Marketers of penis enlargement products exploit fears <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy,</b> but there is no consensus in the scientific community of any non-surgical technique that permanently increases either the thickness or length of the erect penis that already falls into the normal range.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years later}} (the {{timeline}} of Soulcalibur II, Soulcalibur III and Soulcalibur IV), news reach {{her that the}} Emperor destroyed and massacred Xiwei, the center of government in the Empire's western territory under the public justification of a revolt, believing that the fortress had been withholding Soul Edge from him. He asks Xianghua to investigate the ruins, as her experience could be useful in locating the sword among the rubble. Xianghua finds out the truth behind the attack from Ming spies. Though she believed that she had destroyed Soul Edge, pieces of it are rumored to exist in this place and so Xianghua decides to find every fragment and destroy them. She lefts on a second journey alone, convinced {{that this was a}} burden she has to bear after she failed to destroy Soul Edge completely the first time. During her adventure, Xianghua is reunited with Kilik. While on their journey, they are attacked by Zasalamel, who gravely injures Kilik. Xianghua takes Kilik back to his home, where she hears that he would make full recovery. After leaving a letter for him, she departs seeking an old general whom Edge Master has arranged for her to meet. Training with the general, Xianghua's skills improve significantly but she is unable to shake off an overwhelming feeling <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy</b> due to her failure to help Kilik. On the general's sage advice, she then begins to train her mind to become more fluid and allow her heart to filter in both the good and the bad. After months of training, she feels that she was ready and bid farewell to the general, beginning her journey anew to fight by herself. While traveling west on the Silk Road, she reunites with Kilik. Together they travel to India to find Maxi, but he does not join them. Xianghua swears to destroy the Soul Edge properly and once and for all.|$|E

By his mid-twenties, {{he decided that he}} did not want to tour any longer, so he took two breaks. His first break was as an infantry soldier, medic, and rifleman in the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Australia's regular army from 1982 to 1985. He played the bagpipes in parades and on training missions, but ended his military service in July 1985 and suffered from a bad back as a result of his training. He also went backpacking in the U.K., listening to roots music, to children's music by artists like Raffi, and to recordings of children's books.|$|E

At Jim's new company, Pam gives Darryl a thumbs up as he heads into the interview room, and then is chatted up by an employee who says [...] "Jim speaks about you all the time" [...] and we [...] "can't wait for you to move here." [...] The thought of moving to Philadelphia disturbs her. Meanwhile, Darryl initially fumbles his interview due to nerves and feelings <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy,</b> but everyone else helps calm him down, and he makes a strong reversal. Darryl concludes the interview by attempting to shoot a basket with the room's sports decorations, but instead knocks a light fixture into the fish tank, electrocuting all the fish. Pam commiserates with Darryl over this embarrassing misstep. Jim returns to inform Darryl that although {{he will have to}} pay for the fish, he has the job. During the drive home, Darryl gushes over his new job and the chance to live in Philadelphia while Pam worries about where she and her family will be in the future.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{uses her}} many roles, incarnations, and identities {{throughout}} her books {{to illustrate how}} oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in Caged Bird, Angelou demonstrates the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her [...] "Mary". [...] Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the [...] "hellish horror of being 'called out of [...] name'". [...] Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image. The renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy</b> and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish, but feels vindicated when, as she leaves her employer's home, Mrs. Cullinan finally gets her name right. Another incident {{in the book that}} solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time. Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally [...] "in control of her fate". [...] This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend. These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the next}} ten years, Seel grew further apart from his wife, tormented by {{feelings}} <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy,</b> shame, and confusion about his sexuality.

After one of his sons threatened to never see him again if he did not stop drinking, he joined a counselling group. In 1979, when he was working for an insurance company, still trying for reconciliation with his estranged wife, he attended a discussion in a local bookshop for the launch of the French edition of Heinz Heger's The Men with the Pink Triangle, a memoir of the concentration camp experiences of Josef Kohout. After the event Seel met with the speakers, and a meeting was organized for the next day. Heger's book inspired Seel's coming out as a gay man and as a victim of the Nazis.

2500|$|A copy of The History of a Drowning Boy {{remains in}} the {{possession}} of one of many individuals with whom Nilsen corresponds and in whom Nilsen holds unquestioning trust. In his autobiography, Nilsen states that, beginning with his service in the British Army, he constantly lived two separate lives: his [...] "real life" [...] and his [...] "fantasy life". He writes: [...] "When I was with people, I was in the [...] "real" [...] world, and in my private life, I snapped instantly into my fantasy life. I could oscillate between the two with instant ease." [...] With reference to his murders, Nilsen claims that his emotional state upon the dates of the murders, in conjunction with the amount of alcohol he had consumed, were both core factors in his decision to kill. He further emphasises that, when feeling low, seizing an opportunity to satisfy the sexual fantasies he had developed in which the victim would be the young, attractive and passive partner, and he the older active partner, would temporarily relieve him of a general feeling <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Marie Lafarge {{was born}} in Paris in 1816, the {{daughter}} of an artillery officer.

Marie lost her father to a hunting accident at the age of twelve; her mother, who remarried soon after, died seven years later. [...] At eighteen, Marie was adopted by her maternal aunt, who was married to the secretary-general of the Bank of France. The two women did not get along. [...] Despite the fact that her foster parents treated her well and sent her to the best schools, Marie was kept aware of her status as a poor relative. Because she attended an elite school, Marie interacted with daughters of the moneyed aristocracy. She used every means to persuade them that she too came from a wealthy family, and she became envious when she saw her friends marrying rich noblemen. [...] However, Marie had little say in the matter of matrimony. [...] Her marriage dowry of 90,000 francs, while considerable, was not that impressive considering her family's status, and Marie was left with feelings <b>of</b> <b>inadequacy,</b> which fueled her pride and ambition.|$|E
