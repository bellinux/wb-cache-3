5|$|Impressed by Betances' credentials, Angiolillo later {{approached}} Betances {{before the}} incident, and discussed his plans with him, which originally implied killing {{one or more}} young members of the Spanish royal family. Betances then dissuaded him from doing this. Angiolillo then apparently suggested Cánovas as a target instead. There is evidence that Betances financed Angiolillo's travel to Spain, and used his contacts to have Angiolillo reach and enter Spanish territory under a false identity. Further speculation that Angiolillo used a firearm that Betances himself furnished for him appears to be unfounded (although Betances, who was a fan of firearms himself —he taught a Cuban revolutionary leader <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a Remington machine gun once— gave at least one {{as a gift to}} one of his acquaintances).|$|E

Leviticus 26 provides a detailed list of rewards for following God's commandments and a detailed list of punishments for not following them.

25|$|Slow steaming, as {{used by the}} Triple E class, {{is one way of}} {{managing}} capacity and reducing fuel consumption. The order for many big ships is a gamble on Maersk's part that Chinese exports will continue to grow. Lack of market growth {{in the second half of}} 2012 caused Maersk to postpone a decision <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Triple E class. Five Triple E-class vessels were to be delivered in 2013, with an impact sometime in 2014 with eight or nine Triple E-class vessels operating. Maersk already uses approximately 100 ships on the Asia-Europe route, which is their most important. SeaIntel expects about 46 ships with more than 10,000 TEU each to be delivered worldwide in 2013. The construction of newer, larger ships has influenced development plans at ports such as London Gateway and JadeWeserPort in Wilhelmshaven (Germany), and Algeciras and Tanjung had bigger cranes installed. The maximum number of TEUs carried in one trip was 18,024 in January 2015, in Algeciras, Spain.|$|E

500|$|When Margaret Sanger, an {{advocate}} of access to contraception, coined the term [...] "birth control" [...] and disseminated information about various methods in the June 1914 issue of her magazine The Woman Rebel, she received aggressive support from Goldman, who had already been active in efforts to increase birth control access for several years. In 1916, Goldman was arrested for giving lessons in public <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> contraceptives.

500|$|These {{toxicity}} tests provide, in {{the words}} of a 2006 United States National Academy of Sciences report, [...] "critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential". Animal tests may overestimate risk, with false positive results being a particular problem, but false positives appear not to be prohibitively common. Variability in results arises from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans.

The author asserts that {{in at least one}} case in 2005, a person was killed because they were thought to be a terrorist holding a bomb. It was later revealed that this person suffered from mental illness and may have had a medical history of bipolar disorder.

[...] The section includes statistics and back-stories for alternatives classic undead monsters, including ten different ghosts, six liches, 19 skeletons, ten vampires, and fifteen zombies.|$|E

The writers' problem was that they could not get a realistic idea <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it. One idea had actually been to have a killer hack up his victim, place the dismembered limbs into a self-cleaning oven, then vacuum out the remains and have the bag filled with the victim.

500|$|The fourth English edition, {{published}} in 1769, was personally supervised by Franklin while visiting London from Philadelphia. He made several corrections on {{different parts of}} the first three editions and wrote explanatory notes. One important correction Franklin noted in the Forward was that Letters 1 and 2 had been transposed and he had corrected that. He added a letter that was important to him. It was a letter to Collinson dated March 28, 1747. Franklin had thanked him for the gift of the German [...] "electric tube" [...] with directions <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it to make electricity. He was much appreciative of this, so he made that particular one Letter #1. This then advanced the numbering sequence of the Letters by one from the first three editions.|$|E
500|$|Meyszner's {{reports to}} Himmler fuelled {{distrust}} of the Serbian security forces, stating that it was [...] "insane" [...] to arm the 16,000-strong Serbian State Guard, as he believed that their loyalties lay with the royalist Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, not with the Germans or the Nedić regime. The depths to which Turner and Meyszner's personal vendetta plunged is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} they could not even agree <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the funds stolen from Serbian Jews killed as part of the Final Solution in 1941 and the first half of 1942. On 1 August 1942, Kuntze was replaced as Wehrmacht Commander in South-East Europe by Luftwaffe Generaloberst Alexander Löhr, another Austrian. In early September 1942, Meyszner filed an official report with Himmler alleging that Turner had breached section 90 of the German Penal Code by betraying state secrets. Concerned by this attack, in mid-September Turner issued an order to his staff directing them to defer to the authority of the HSSPF and his staff in all police matters and also many other administrative and highly political matters, such as the approval of events, gambling, right of assembly and monitoring of commerce. The dispute was so out-of-hand that only outside intervention would be effective. In October, the Main SS Personnel Office sent an emissary to Belgrade to investigate and report on the situation. This report described the behaviour of both Turner and Meyszner as [...] "shameful" [...] but the die was cast.|$|E
500|$|Beryl {{took over}} as George's manager, and changed aspects of his act, {{including}} the songs and jokes. She instructed him <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his hands, and how to work his audience. She also persuaded him to change his stage dress to black tie—although he appeared {{in a range of}} other costumes too—and to take lessons in how to play the ukulele properly. By June 1926 he was proficient enough to earn a one-off record deal—negotiated by Beryl—to sing six of his father's songs for the Edison Bell/Winner label. Formby spent the next few years touring, largely in the north, but also appearing at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, his official London debut. Although he had a further recording session in October 1929, performing two songs for Dominion Records, [...] "Beryl's avaricious demands would prevent any serious contract from coming George's way", according to David Bret, Formby's biographer. That changed in 1932, when Formby signed a three-year deal with Decca Records. One of the songs he recorded in July was [...] "Chinese Laundry Blues", telling the story of Mr Wu, which became one of his standard songs, and part of a long-running series of songs about the character. Over the course of his career Formby went on to record over 200 songs, around 90 of which were written by Fred Cliffe and Harry Gifford. In the 1932 winter season Formby appeared in his first pantomime, Babes in the Wood, in Bolton, after which he toured with the George Formby Road Show around the north of England, with Beryl acting as the [...] commère; the show also toured in 1934.|$|E
