500|$|Meany {{opposed the}} antiwar {{candidacy}} of U. S. Senator George McGovern {{for the presidency}} against incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972 despite McGovern's generally pro-labor voting record in Congress. However he declined to endorse Nixon. <b>On</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation in September 1972, Meany criticized McGovern's statements that the US should respect other peoples' rights to choose communism {{by pointing out that}} there had never been a country that had freely voted for communism. Meaney accused McGovern of being [...] "an apologist for the Communist world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{continuing}} student {{protests against}} the war brought Agnew's scorn. In a speech on April 28 in Hollywood, Florida, Agnew stated that responsibility of the unrest lay with those who failed to guide them, and suggested that the alumni of Yale University fire its president, Kingman Brewster. The Cambodia incursion brought more demonstrations on campus, and on May 3, Agnew went <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation to defend the policy. Reminded that Nixon, in his inaugural address, had called for the lowering of voices in political discourse, Agnew commented, [...] "When a fire takes place, a man doesn't run {{into the room and}} whisper... he yells, 'Fire!' and I am yelling 'Fire!' because I think 'Fire!' needs to be called here". The Kent State shootings took place the following day, but Agnew did not tone down his attacks on demonstrators, alleging that he was responding to [...] "a general malaise that argues for violent confrontation instead of debate". Nixon had Haldeman tell Agnew to avoid remarks about students; Agnew strongly disagreed and stated that he would only refrain if Nixon directly ordered it.|$|E
500|$|Throughout April, {{the draft}} efforts continued, and Perot {{appeared}} on talk shows, discussing his plans and positions on political issues. During {{an appearance on}} Larry King Live, Perot stated that he was closer to a decision on a potential campaign, {{and that he was}} willing to spend $100 million of his own money to finance it. On the Today Show he was interviewed by Katie Couric, and proposed to cut Medicare and Social Security for [...] "people who don't need it". He appeared <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation later in the month, and argued that wealthy Americans should spend more than average Americans to eliminate the budget deficit. His budget numbers were contested by Tim Russert on Meet the Press, during a heated interview, after which, a frustrated Perot considered dropping out of the race. [...] C-SPAN ran a speech by Perot, where he announced that he hoped to run a campaign without [...] "political pros" [...] to avoid the [...] "dirty tricks" [...] of past campaigns. After this appearance, campaign consultant Raymond Strother explained to Perot that professionals such as pollster Mark Penn were essential to a successful campaign. In late April, Perot hired former Chicago Tribune editor James Squires as press spokesman to handle the large volume of interview requests from the media. At the end of the month, Perot realized that he had spent too much time visiting talk shows, and announced that he would spend his next few weeks focusing on the issues.|$|E

500|$|On June 29, 2008, Clark made {{comments}} <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation {{that were}} critical of Republican John McCain, {{calling into question}} the notion that McCain's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president. [...] "I certainly honor [...] service as a prisoner of war", Clark said, [...] "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded—it wasn't a wartime squadron. He hasn't been in there and ordered the bombs to fall." [...] When moderator Bob Schieffer noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he [...] "ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down", Clark responded that, ultimately, Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience, as McCain has done throughout his campaign. Clark's retort, however, is what drew rebuke. In referring to McCain's military experience, he stated: [...] "Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president." [...] Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark's comment. However, Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as MoveOn.org and military veteran groups such as VoteVets.org; Obama ultimately stated that Clark's comments were [...] "inartful" [...] and were not intended to attack McCain's military service. In the days following the controversial interview, Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat. In each program, Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honors McCain's service, he has serious concerns about McCain's judgment in matters of national security policy, calling McCain [...] "untested and untried".|$|E
500|$|On October 24, Trump {{appeared}} on Meet the Press, where {{he announced that}} he would officially join the Reform Party. [...] During the interview, Trump questioned why a politician was better suited to be president than him, commenting [...] "I understand this stuff." [...] He said that the Republican Party has become [...] "too crazy right." [...] Notably, he identified Buchanan as a [...] "Hitler-lover" [...] and mused, [...] "I guess he's an anti-Semite [...] [...] [...] He doesn't like the blacks, he doesn't like the gays. [...] It's just incredible that anybody could embrace this guy." [...] As for his reputation as a womanizer, Trump said he would not run if he believed it would be an impediment. [...] The next day, Trump formally joined the Reform Party, changing his voter registration from Republican to Independence Party, the New York affiliate of the Reform Party. [...] On the same day, Buchanan announced that he too would leave the Republican Party to join with the Reform Party and attempt to obtain its presidential nomination. Buchanan said he refused to engage in a [...] "name-calling" [...] contest with Trump but made a thinly veiled attack against Trump's wealth, arguing, [...] "I don't believe the Reform Party nomination can be bought, and I don't believe the Presidency can be bought." [...] <b>On</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation, Pat Choate, the Reform Party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, said Trump would [...] "make a good candidate," [...] but argued that Buchanan could challenge Trump [...] "on the merits" [...] and that Trump and the media were misrepresenting Buchanan's views through [...] "hate politics." [...] Other party members expressed reservations about Trump's comments and personal life. [...] Verney wondered [...] "what the compelling reason is for him to seek the presidency." [...] Trump acknowledged himself as [...] "certainly controversial" [...] but labeled himself as [...] "a great businessman," [...] who would [...] "make the greatest treaties that this country's seen in a long time." [...] On Fox News Sunday, he criticized U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and said that as president he himself would fill the position and negotiate trade deals with other countries. [...] He identified France, Japan, Germany, and Saudi Arabia as nations taking advantage of badly negotiated trade deals with the United States.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{appearance}} <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation, Wasserman Schultz said, [...] "The Republicans {{have a plan}} to end Medicare as we know it. What they would do is they would take the people who are younger than 55 years old today and tell them, 'You know what? You're on your own. Go and find private health insurance in the health-care insurance market.. Four non-partisan fact-checkers called her claim false. She then came under criticism for her comments on Washington Watch with Roland Martin, in which she said, [...] "You have the Republicans, who want to literally drag us {{all the way back to}} Jim Crow laws and literally—and very transparently—block access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates". The next day, she stated that [...] "Jim Crow was the wrong analogy to use".|$|E

2500|$|Huckabee echoed his {{statement}} {{when he appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation {{on the morning of}} August 12. [...] "We're in fact in the first tier, I think, by everybody's estimation, and here's why," [...] Huckabee told Jim Axelrod. [...] "It wasn't just that we surprised people with a second showing, it's that we did it with so few resources. I mean, this really was feeding the 5,000 with two fish and five loaves, an amazing kind of day for us." [...] Looking beyond Iowa, former Governor of South Carolina and Huckabee supporter David Beasley said that Huckabee is filling the void created by the lack of a social conservative in the race. He said that [...] "I really believe now that the conservative voters will begin to coalesce behind Mike Huckabee...and it's going to be infectious in New Hampshire and South Carolina" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 January 2012, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation that Iran was {{not trying}} to develop a nuclear weapon, but was trying to develop a nuclear capability. [...] He also urged Israel to work {{together}} rather than make a unilateral strike on Iran’s nuclear installations. On 1 August 2012, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta while in Israel said that the United States had [...] "options," [...] including military options, to prevent Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon, should diplomacy fail. [...] In 2012, sixteen U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, reported that Iran was pursuing research that could enable it to produce nuclear weapons, but was not attempting to do so. The senior officers of all of the major American intelligence agencies stated that there was no conclusive evidence that Iran has made any attempt to produce nuclear weapons since 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Republicans had {{nominated}} {{the conservative}} Goldwater, who shared Wallace's {{opposition to the}} Civil Rights Act {{on the basis of}} states' rights and found considerable support among southerners. This caused a precipitous drop in support for Wallace's threatened general election campaign, and on June 18, Wallace biographer Dan T. Carter notes that Goldwater gave [...] "a brief speech whichnbsp&— in substance if not tonenbsp&— could have been written by George Wallace." [...] By July 13, Gallup polls showed that Wallace support in a general election match-up had plummeted to below 3% outside the south. Even in the south, he polled third in a three-way race against Johnson and Goldwater. Goldwater reportedly welcomed Wallace's support but firmly refused him a spot as vice-presidential candidate. With a conservative already facing off against Johnson, Wallace stayed his nascent plans for a third-party run until the 1968 election, ending his campaign with an appearance <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation on July 19; however, he did not endorse Goldwater. In the general election, Goldwater repudiated Wallace and denied courting his vote, which Wallace took as a personal insult.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the 2012 SBL season, Purser re-joined the Wildcats as a development player for the 2012/13 season. With co-captain Brad Robbins ruled out of Perth's season opener against the New Zealand Breakers in Auckland on 5 October 2012, the [...] "highly-related" [...] Purser was added to the squad for the New Zealand trip. On 22 November 2012, also against the Breakers, Purser played in the Wildcats' first ever win at Perth Arena. Purser received more significant opportunities in 2012/13 due to a number of injuries to teammates, travelling to Auckland again later in the season to play against the Breakers on 1 February 2013. For {{the second year in a}} row, the Wildcats finished the regular season in second place behind the Breakers, this time with a 22–6 record. The Wildcats swept the Wollongong Hawks 2–0 in their semi-final series, with Purser seeing 26 seconds in Game 1 on 28 March 2013 in Perth. The Wildcats went <b>on</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> Breakers in the NBL Grand Final series, where they were defeated 2–0. Over 14 contests in 2012/13, Purser totalled 11 points.|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich has {{frequently}} criticized {{what he termed}} [...] "judicial activism" [...] and in an appearance <b>on</b> <b>Face</b> <b>the</b> Nation in 2011 suggested that Congress should subpoena federal judges and force them to explain themselves before Congress. When host Bob Schieffer asked how he would force federal judges to comply with congressional subpoenas, Gingrich said he would send the U.S. Capitol Police or U.S. Marshals to arrest the judges and force them to testify. Gingrich's proposal drew criticism across the political spectrum. Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe (who described it as [...] "a frontal assault on {{the independence of the}} federal judiciary" [...] and [...] "one of the craziest and most obviously unconstitutional things the former Speaker has ever proposed"), prominent conservative lawyer Bruce Fein (who wrote that [...] "Gingrich unwittingly is proposing to overthrow the Constitution that he would be pledged to uphold and defend if elected"), and U.S. District Judge John L. Kane (who wrote that Gingrich's proposal would contravene {{the rule of law and}} the notion of judicial independence as set forth in Federalist No. 78). Eventual 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former Republican Attorneys General Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, conservative attorney Edward Whelan and the nonpartisan Justice at Stake group all criticized Gingrich's comments for similar reasons.|$|E
2500|$|While {{initially}} touted {{to return}} to Augusta State University for the 2011/12 season as late as 11 July 2011, Purser announced just three days later that he was unlikely to play another NCAA season. While Purser said he enjoyed his time with the Jaguars, he said it may be better for {{him to stay in}} Perth, citing [...] "At this stage it looks like I might be staying, just because academically my units that I've started back here [...] don't match up. I think, just looking at a number of factors, that I may be staying." [...] Soon after, Purser informed coach Dip Metress of his departure, after joining a shortlist of players fighting for the final spot on the Perth Wildcats roster – the most successful team in the National Basketball League (NBL). Joining Purser on the shortlist included three members of the Wildcats' 2010/11 extended squad – Greg Hire, Tom Jervis and Everard Bartlett. No matter the outcome, Wildcats coach Rob Beveridge guaranteed Purser involvement with the team in 2011/12, with the worst-case scenario being a development player role. Not to Purser's displeasure, on 11 August, Hire was awarded with the final roster spot. Purser was undeterred by the Wildcats' decision not to award the final spot to him, instead relishing the prospect of becoming an NBL development player. Purser appeared in 10 games for the Wildcats during the 2011/12 season, scoring a total of 20 points. Highlights for Purser included scoring 6 points in 5½ minutes against the New Zealand Breakers at home on 23 December 2011 in just his third NBL game; being nominated for the NBL's Round 23 Play of the Week for his athletic three-point play in the final period against the Cairns Taipans on 11 March 2012; and being nominated for the NBL Rookie of the Year Award. The Wildcats finished the regular season in second place with a 19–9 record and took down the third-seeded Gold Coast Blaze 2–1 in the semi-finals, with Purser seeing game time in Game 3 on 7 April 2012. The Wildcats went <b>on</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Breakers in the NBL Grand Final series, where they were defeated 2–1.|$|E
