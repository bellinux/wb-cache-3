40|$|The United Kingdom Tax {{system is}} not neutral {{with respect to a}} Company’s {{investment}} and financing decisions, that is incentives and disincentives to invest in particular projects or use particular types of financing arise through the imposition of taxation. Such biases may increase or decrease the value of capital projects, and if a company is to be certain of making accurate investment decisions the incremental tax flows arising due to the project must be included in the evaluation. The tax flows arising through the acceptance of a project may differ depending on the company's or group's tax profile, and therefore the <b>overall</b> <b>tax</b> <b>position</b> of the company or group must be considered. The thesis explains the legislation relating to the taxation of corporate groups and suggests that because the tax system is so complicated, a computerised model is probably necessary. The author's computerised model is developed and tested in the thesis, comparing evaluations conducted using the procedures and assumptions of groups in the surveys, with those of the simulation model. It is shown that both understatements and overstatements occur through incorrectly allowing for taxation. The results of two empirical surveys are presented. The first, a postal survey, discusses the methods used by companies to incorporate tax in their project appraisals, and the second, based on interviews, provides a review of the whole capital budgeting process.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of micro backward looking methodology, we propose and compute an effective <b>overall</b> <b>tax</b> rate for Bucharest Stock Exchange traded companies for 2000 – 2009 period. We tried to capture all public finance liabilities that a company has to cope with {{as a share of}} turnover, no matter if they are related to capital or labour, or if they are included or not in the production costs. Therefore, we propose the concept of corporate effective <b>overall</b> <b>tax</b> rate and we make some calculations using detailed data from companies’ financial reports. We show that effective <b>overall</b> <b>tax</b> rate have constantly decrease throughout the period surveyed, except for the year 2009, when the economic crisis took its toll from the companies turnover, thus making the effective tax rate to increase. Second, although the effective tax rate due to social security contributions decreased during the period, the share attributable to social security contributions in the <b>overall</b> <b>tax</b> rate increased, mainly due to the corporate income tax rate cut. Third, the tax burden generated by other significant taxes (mainly local taxes) is generally bigger than initially thought. In fact, we show that, among all public finance liabilities, corporate income tax has the lowest share of turnover for Bucharest Stock exchange traded companies...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} Sandmo’s (1989) {{definition}} of neutrality, {{the objective of}} the thesis is to measure investment distortions in the Petroleum Tax Act (PTA) before and after the reduction of investment uplift in May 2013. The study relies on one unified model and applies two different approaches, where the model is based on the research conducted by Lund (1987, 1992). Neutrality is analysed from a governmental point of view with a contingent claims analysis (CCA). This method is consistent with the neutrality properties of Boadway and Bruce (1984) and Fane (1987). Thereafter, neutrality is evaluated from a petroleum industrial perspective applying a discounted cash flow (DCF) method. The effect of the reduced uplift is analysed for a firm outside <b>tax</b> <b>position</b> and a company in <b>tax</b> <b>position.</b> Investment distortions are illustrated by comparing the neutrality properties of the PTA, against the neutral Brown cash flow tax and the Norwegian General Tax Act. The results show that if companies apply a CCA, they have incentives to overinvest. After the reduction of uplift, the incentives to overinvest have been reduced, and tax revenue has increased. In contradiction, if firms outside <b>tax</b> <b>position</b> use a DCF method the PTA gives incentives to underinvest, and the effect on tax income is uncertain. For a company in <b>tax</b> <b>position,</b> the DCF results show that the PTA is relatively neutral and tax income has increased after the reduction of uplift. This implies it is an advantage to be in <b>tax</b> <b>position,</b> creating barriers to entry from an industrial perspective. Based on these results, we find it likely that the PTA has become more neutral and tax income increased after the reduction of uplift...|$|R

40|$|A firm's {{deferred}} <b>tax</b> <b>position</b> {{can affect}} its incentives {{to lobby for}} or against tax reform, {{as well as how}} the firm is affected by a transition from one tax regime to another. We compile disaggregated deferred <b>tax</b> <b>position</b> data for a sample of large U. S. firms between 1993 and 2004 to analyze the incentives created by these positions and to explore how these positions might affect firm behavior before and after a pre-announced tax rate change. We find substantial heterogeneity in the size and sign of deferred <b>tax</b> <b>positions.</b> While half of our sample firms report a deferred <b>tax</b> <b>position</b> of less than three percent of assets, approximately ten percent report a position in excess of ten percent of assets. Although one might expect firms to defer the reporting of income when there is a pre-announced reduction in the corporate tax rate, we find that approximately one third of the firms in our sample would have an incentive to accelerate income in such a setting because doing so would maximize the value of their net operating loss carryforwards. We estimate that if the federal statutory corporate tax rate had been reduced from 35 to 30 percent in 2004, the resulting revaluation of deferred tax assets would have increased net income in that year by an average of 16. 5 percent for firms with a net deferred tax liability, while reducing net income by an average of 11. 4 percent for those firms with a net deferred tax asset.
