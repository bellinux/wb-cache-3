25|$|A {{sequence}} is an <b>ordered</b> <b>list.</b> Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms). Unlike a set, order matters, and {{exactly the same}} elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. Most precisely, a sequence {{can be defined as}} a function whose domain is a countable totally ordered set, such as the natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|One case {{in which}} peek is not trivial is in an <b>ordered</b> <b>list</b> type (i.e., {{elements}} accessible in order) implemented by a self-balancing binary search tree. In this case find-min or find-max take O(log n) time, as does access to any other element. Making find-min or find-max take O(1) time {{can be done by}} caching the min or max values, but this adds overhead to the data structure and to the operations of adding or removing elements.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} with vectors, the graphical representation {{may be too}} cumbersome. Vectors in an n-dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as coordinate vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system. The endpoint of a vector can be identified with an <b>ordered</b> <b>list</b> of n real numbers (n-tuple). These numbers are the coordinates of the endpoint of the vector, {{with respect to a}} given Cartesian coordinate system, and are typically called the scalar components (or scalar projections) of the vector on the axes of the coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|Positional {{parameters}} are the typical <b>ordered</b> <b>list</b> of parameters that most programming languages use. All parameters {{may also be}} passed by using their name in an unordered way. A named-only parameter can only be passed by specifying its name (that is, it never captures a positional argument), and are indicated with a leading : character. Slurpy parameters (indicated by an * before the parameter name) are Perl 6's tool for creating variadic functions. A slurpy hash will capture remaining passed-by-name parameters, whereas a slurpy array will capture remaining passed-by-position parameters.|$|E
25|$|This {{timeline}} of mosasaur {{research is}} a chronologically <b>ordered</b> <b>list</b> of important fossil discoveries, controversies of interpretation, and taxonomic revisions of mosasaurs, {{a group of}} giant marine lizards that lived during the Late Cretaceous Epoch. Although mosasaurs went extinct millions of years before humans evolved, humans have coexisted with mosasaur fossils for millennia. Before the development of paleontology as a formal science, these remains would have been interpreted through a mythological lens. Myths about warfare between serpentine water monsters and aerial thunderbirds told by the Native Americans of the modern western United States may {{have been influenced by}} observations of mosasaur fossils and their co-occurrence with creatures like Pteranodon and Hesperornis.|$|E

25|$|Systematic {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} interval sampling) relies on arranging {{the study population}} according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that <b>ordered</b> <b>list.</b> Systematic sampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element from then onwards. In this case, k=(population size/sample size). It {{is important that the}} starting point is not automatically the first in the list, but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the kth element in the list. A simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory (an 'every 10th' sample, also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10').|$|E
25|$|This {{timeline}} of pterosaur {{research is}} a chronologically <b>ordered</b> <b>list</b> of important fossil discoveries, controversies of interpretation, and taxonomic revisions of pterosaurs, the famed flying reptiles of the Mesozoic era. Although pterosaurs went extinct {{millions of years}} before humans evolved, humans have coexisted with pterosaur fossils for millennia. Before the development of paleontology as a formal science, these remains would have been interpreted through a mythological lens. Myths about thunderbirds told by the Native Americans of the modern western United States may {{have been influenced by}} observations of Pteranodon fossils. These thunderbirds were said to have warred with water monsters, which agrees well with the co-occurrence of Pteranodon and the ancient marine reptiles of the seaway over which it flew.|$|E

[...] The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus Homo {{is part of}} the geology of Scotland. Prehistory in Scotland ends {{with the arrival of the}} Romans in southern Scotland in the 1st century AD and the beginning of written records. The archaeological sites and events listed are the earliest examples or among the most notable of their type.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} three generic types of collection: <b>ordered</b> <b>lists,</b> dictionaries/maps, and sets. <b>Ordered</b> <b>lists</b> allows the {{programmer}} to insert items {{in a certain}} order and retrieve those items in the same order. An example is a waiting list. Two interfaces {{are included in the}} <b>Ordered</b> <b>Lists</b> which are the List Interface and the Queue Interface. Dictionaries/Maps store references to objects with a lookup key to access the object's values. One example of a key is an identification card. The Map Interface is included in the Dictionaries/Maps. Sets are unordered collections that can be iterated and where similar objects are not allowed. The Interface Set is included.|$|R

500|$|At {{the end of}} the war in November 1918, the {{maintenance}} of Commonwealth graves passed to Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). From June 1921, the Belgian War Graves Commission appointed a supervisor to maintain the German graves as the Germans could not do so themselves on account of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1926, Belgium and Germany reached an agreement for the gradual transfer of maintenance responsibility to the Official German Burial Service in Belgium (...) representative at the embassy to Germany in Brussels. The Germans officially referred to the cemetery as Ehrenfriedhof Saint-Symphorien-Spiennes. Number 191. The name recognized that the cemetery was both located in close proximity to the town of Saint-Symphorien and technically located in the administrative areas of Spiennes while concurrently incorporating the number assigned to the cemetery in a Belgian <b>ordered</b> <b>list</b> of German cemeteries.|$|E

One such case is when the chromosome is an <b>ordered</b> <b>list,</b> such as an <b>ordered</b> <b>list</b> of the cities to be travelled for the traveling salesman problem. There are many crossover methods for ordered chromosomes. The already mentioned N-point crossover can be applied for ordered chromosomes also, but this always needs a corresponding repair process, actually, some ordered crossover methods are derived from the idea. However, sometimes a crossover of chromosomes produces recombinations which violate the constraint of ordering and thus need to be repaired. Several examples for crossover operators (also mutation operator) preserving a given order are given in: ...|$|E
