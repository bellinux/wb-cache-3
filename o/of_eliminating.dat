5|$|A world map is {{available}} and, at the beginning, the player is allocated {{one of the}} twenty regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each representing a level, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. The goals for each level are straightforward: they generally fall along the lines <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching the player the basics. Special items are hidden throughout certain levels. Such items perform actions such as increasing the player's creatures' experience level, or revealing the map. They can reveal a hidden level, where the player must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods with the intention <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to}} the Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

Also the third phase was large enough to provide a significant placing. Thus Flamengo and América-RJ are given both 5th place, for instance, instead of 7th and 8th according to CBF.

Meanwhile, Marius realizes that the band of barbarians he encountered years ago had invaded Rome and slain his father at Nero's instigation as a means <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> a political rival. Furthermore, the Celts, led by a just-escaped Boudica, lay siege to York, with XIV Legion tasked with defending it until Commodus can escape. In the end, Marius sacrifices himself to buy time for the final ships to sail, but is resurrected by the goddess Summer, who tasks him with taking on the mantle of Damocles, a legendary Roman general who was abandoned to his enemies for political expediency. In that guise, Summer tells him to avenge his family and comrades, and save Rome.|$|E
5|$|In 1646, the Parliamentary Colonels John Birch and Robert Kyrle marched {{south from}} their {{successful}} Siege of Hereford and besieged the castle, {{with the aim}} <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> {{one of the few}} remaining Royalist strongholds. There was some personal animosity between Lingen and Birch, and both were outspoken, impulsive men. Birch's first move was to prevent further attacks from Lingen, and on 9March he burned the weakly defended stables in a surprise night attack, driving away the Royalist horses and temporarily denying the Royalist forces' mobility. Birch was unable to press home his advantage however, and over the next few months Lingen succeeded in replacing some of his horses and resumed his attacks on Parliamentary forces.|$|E

40|$|As the ciliated {{protozoan}} Tetrahymena thermophila {{develops a}} new macronucleus (MAC) from products of its micronucleus (MIC), several repetitive sequences are {{eliminated from the}} MAC genome. Four MIC DNA clones containing repetitive sequences that are eliminated from the MAC were obtained. One clone contains a representative from each of three families <b>of</b> <b>eliminated</b> sequences. One, present in 200 – 300 copies in the MIC, is almost completely eliminated from the MAC. A second, present in approximately 50 copies in the MIC, is scattered throughout the genome, although {{up to half of}} the family members examined could be localized to chromosome 2. Approximately one tenth of the members of this less repetitive family persist in the MAC while the rest are eliminated. The third type <b>of</b> <b>eliminated</b> sequence has three to four members, all <b>of</b> which are <b>eliminated</b> from the MAC. Three of the members are located on three of the five MIC chromosomes, and one could not be mapped. This sequence is clustered with the other two families of sequences in at least three of the four sites. All three types <b>of</b> <b>eliminated</b> sequences are found in similar arrangements in the MIC of several different inbred strains of T. thermophila. ...|$|R

5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E
5|$|The WSGA, led by Frank Wolcott (WSGA Member {{and large}} North Platte rancher), hired gunmen with the {{intention}} <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> alleged rustlers in Johnson County and breaking up the NWFSGA. By that time, prominent names in Wyoming started taking sides. Acting Governor Amos W. Barber supported the cattlemen, who blamed the small ranchers and homesteaders for the criminal activity in the state, while former cowboy and sheriff of Buffalo (the county seat of Johnson County), Red Angus, supported the homesteaders, who believed that the cattle barons were stealing their land.|$|E
5|$|Treaties between European {{settlers}} and the Dakota and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands {{and on to}} smaller reservations. In 1861, residents of Mankato formed the Knights of the Forest, with a goal <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> all Indians from Minnesota. As conditions deteriorated for the Dakota, tensions rose, leading to the Dakota War of 1862. The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Dakota and the exile {{of most of the}} rest of the Dakota to the Crow Creek Reservation in Dakota Territory. As many as 800 white settlers died during the war.|$|E

5|$|After {{a decade}} out of politics, Willis was chosen without {{opposition}} as the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1943. Infighting among the state's Democrats combined with Willis's popular proposal {{to eliminate the}} state income tax carried him to a narrow victory over J. Lyter Donaldson. Willis was opposed by Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the Kentucky General Assembly. The end of World War II in 1945 brought sizable budget surpluses to the state, and disagreements over how to spend the excess funds spilled over into special legislative sessions. Willis was not able to realize his campaign promise <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> the state income tax because the legislature expanded the budget far beyond what he proposed. Nevertheless, he was able to forge a record of modest accomplishments, including constructing five tuberculosis hospitals across the state and significantly increasing funding for education. Following his term as governor, he served on various state boards and commissions, but failed in his only attempt to return to elective officea 1952 campaign against Bert T. Combs to return to the Court of Appeals. Willis died on April 1, 1965, and is interred at Frankfort Cemetery in the capital city of Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and {{exhausted}} {{by the time he}} reached Asunción. As he did not feel up to the task of pursuing López into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{continued}} the project <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> at-grade crossings between streets and railroads, the Montclair Branch {{was the next}} to receive the structural change. Bloomfield criticized the Lackawanna railroad for making a disgrace of the community. The railroad proposed using $700,000 (1911 USD) of funds to construct a brand new station at Watsessing Avenue along with a new downtown Bloomfield Station. The cost of elevating and depressing the railroad came up to about $20,000 (1911 USD) for the Lackawanna. This contract by the railroad and township was approved after negotiations dating back to 1908. The negotiations included a park to be built between both stations {{on both sides of}} the railroad. The park land cost the township $50,000 to buy for the construction, and it was to be turned over to the Essex County Park Commission.|$|E

5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to add that the bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} dead.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Egyptian General Headquarters (GHQ) in Cairo, {{sent the}} 139th Sa'iqa Group with its two battalions to Ismailia. They {{were given the}} {{objective}} <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> Israeli forces up to the Deversoir area and destroying Israeli bridges across the Suez Canal. A team of frogmen was attached for that end, and the group had no armor or heavy weaponry, and their only transports were large military trucks. GHQ did not include Second Army command {{in any of the}} planning, and in fact only notified Second Army of the operation on the morning of October 19, when the Sa'iqa Group had already begun moving to Ismailia from Cairo. This alarmed Second Army command, and Khalil ordered military police to stop the 139th Sa'iqa Group's vehicles at Abu Suweir, and have its commander, Colonel Osama Ibrahim, arrive at his headquarters in Ismailia. Ibrahim arrived that evening and met Khalil and Shazly. Both men were shocked when they learned of Ibrahim's objectives, imaginary as they were and impossible to achieve, an indication of the state of confusion in GHQ at the time. Khalil canceled the entire operation and placed the Sa'iqa unit under Second Army's command instead, and Ibrahim in turn notified GHQ of his new orders. By midnight he was at Khalil's headquarters once more, where he was informed GHQ's reply: Ibrahim would proceed with his original mission.|$|E
5|$|On Cybertron Cyclonus, {{dispatched}} {{from the}} Dead Universe {{on a mission}} to activate the Nega-Core, inadvertently alerts the Autobots to his presence, but is still able to activate the Core, as well as its lethal guardian Thunderwing. On Garrus-9 Prime calls in the Wreckers to deal with the escalating situation as Nemesis Prime leads the forces of the Dead Universe from the Benzuli expanse. Meanwhile, Hardhead accompanies Nightbeat to Gorlam Prime in an attempt to find his missing memories. Attacked by Micromasters, Nightbeat is taken control of by Jhiaxus and Hardhead reluctantly eliminates him, before disappearing into the dimensional portal. A furious Nemesis Prime realizes he must do Nightbeat's job <b>of</b> <b>eliminating</b> Optimus Prime personally. The Wrecker's assault on Thunderwing proves futile, while Arcee teams up with Banzai-Tron to track down the escaped Monstructor, and Jetfire prepares to use Thunderwing's technology to enable other Autobots to survive the effects of the Benzuli expanse. Dealer's attempt to retrieve the Magnificence for himself backfires when a suspicious Hot Rod uses it to confirm his doubts about Dealer, who is promptly killed. Hot Rod then uses the Magnificence to locate the other Nega-Cores and their guardians, (Sixshot and Monstructor), and passes the information on. Jetfire then formulates a plan to override Jhiaxus' control of them via taking over their mental link. Nemesis Prime attacks Optimus on Garrus-9 personally, but is betrayed and killed by Galvatron, who is then tossed into a solar pool by Prime. Jetfire's plan works, as Cloudburst's team, now equipped with Thunderwing's technology, is able to dispose of the Nega-Cores in the Dead Universe, closing it off completely. Jhiaxus is hunted down on Gorlam Prime by Arcee and Hardhead (now undead like the Dead Universe's inhabitants), where his immortality means Arcee can kill him over and over. On Earth, Sideswipe, having beaten Straxus and Grindcore, decides he has proven himself and leaves without Sunstreaker. Over the following years, Gorlam Prime evolves into a new Cybertron, and its inhabitants evolve into beings like Transformers. But on Garrus-9, Galvatron still lives within the solar pool. In the aftermath of this, the former Decepticon assassin Drift, his outlook changed by meeting the legendary third faction of Cybertronians, attempts to rescue Autobot captives from a Decepticon ship, and ends up crossing path with Kup and the Wreckers. An impressed Kup, believing everyone deserves a second chance, offers him a spot on his new commando squad.|$|E

5000|$|Common Foe - Commonly {{used when}} {{supplies}} and/or player staminas are low or total player count is high, this format pits individual players or small teams {{against each other}} in an open-ended game format allowing extended rest time and reduced paint usage. The basic idea is to start with a normal elimination game played between two even teams, A and B. A third team of equal force, C, stays on the sidelines. When the total number <b>of</b> <b>eliminated</b> players between A and B equals the strength of team C, that team enters the game against the remaining players of A and B, which now turn to fight the [...] "common foe". The eliminated players from A and B form a new sideline team, D, which enters the game when the bench <b>of</b> <b>eliminated</b> players fills up again. Play continues in this fashion, with surviving members of all previous teams allying against each new team entering from the sidelines, until either a prescribed number of new teams has entered, or until the majority <b>of</b> <b>eliminated</b> players have insufficient paint, air or stamina to rejoin the game as a new team. The [...] "winning" [...] players are either the ones who have been eliminated the fewest times, as indicated by tally marks on their hands made by a sideline ref each time they hit the bench, or alternately, the surviving members of the [...] "oldest" [...] team still in play win, as evidenced by letters written on their hand.|$|R
