5|$|At Copán ritual offerings were {{deposited}} {{around the}} city's stelae {{until at least}} 1000, which may represent the <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> a surviving elite that still remembered its ancestors, or {{may be due to}} highland Maya still regarding the city as a place of pilgrimage long after it had fallen into ruin. A small number of sculpted stelae once stood at Cerro Quiac in the Guatemalan Highlands, and are presumed to have been erected by Mam Maya in the 13th or 14th century. At Lamanai in Belize, Classic period stelae were repositioned upon two small Postclassic platforms dating to the 15th or 16th century. At La Milpa, also in Belize, at around the time of Spanish contact in the late 16th century a tiny remnant Maya population started to make <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> Conquest-period pottery to stelae, perhaps in an effort to invoke the ancestors to help resist the Spanish onslaught. A plain stela in Twin Pyramid Group R at Tikal was removed by the local inhabitants some time during the Postclassic; its accompanying altar was also moved but abandoned some distance from its original location. Some plain stelae were raised at Topoxté in the Petén Lakes region of Guatemala in the Postclassic; these were perhaps covered in stucco and painted. This may represent a revival of the katun-ending ceremonies that occurred in the Classic Period, and reflected ties with the northern Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|Burial 116 is {{the tomb}} of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, {{below the level of}} the Great Plaza.

The body of the king was covered with large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king. One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade mosaic vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself.|$|E
5|$|Different factions {{may have}} {{existed in the}} royal court. The k'uhul ahaw and his {{household}} would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included ritual dances, presentation of war captives, <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.|$|E

The Court Astronomer also upheld a literacy test of 9,000 characters for nominees aspiring to become subordinate officials for either the Minister Steward or Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk. These nominees were often recommended subordinates of commandery-level Administrators. Other subordinates of the Minister of Ceremonies reported illegal acts at ancestral temples, prepared sacrificial <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> food and wine at shrines and temples, and arranged for the music and dancing that accompanied ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar {{says that}} Chamunda was {{originally}} {{a form of}} Devi worshipped by the Munda peoples of the Vindhya range of central India. These tribes were known to offer goddesses animal as well as human sacrifices along with ritual <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> liquor. These methods of worship were retained in Tantric worship of Chamunda. He proposes the fierce nature of this goddess is due of her association with Vedic Rudra (identified as Shiva in modern Hinduism), identified with fire god Agni at times.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E

5|$|As the new decade began, KKR began {{restructuring}} RJR. In January 1990, it {{completed the}} sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt. Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution {{as part of the}} original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion. In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the success}} of the Winter Classic and its predecessor, outdoor games have been held during {{subsequent}} seasons, and the Winter Classic has become an annual NHL tradition. The next Winter Classic was held on January 1, 2009, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, matching the Detroit Red Wings against the Chicago Blackhawks. Winter Classics have been held in every year since, except for 2013, which was interrupted by the 2012–2013 NHL lockout. Three Heritage Classics, one in 2011, one in 2014, and one in 2016 have been held since.

The burning of the incense was {{symbolic}} of the prayer of the people rising up to God ( [...] ; [...] ). The <b>offering</b> <b>of</b> incense had to take place after the sacrifice, because only after the atonement could communion with God take place.

5|$|Further {{light is}} shed upon Amenhotep's funerary cult by {{multiple}} documents which appear to detail the rituals dedicated to Amenhotep. Three papyri {{from the time}} of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests, and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet Habu illustrate select rites and spells. The bulk of the rituals concern preparing for and conducting the daily <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> libations for the idol, including a recitation of a ḥtp-dỉ-nsw formula, and purifying and sealing the shrine {{at the end of the}} day. The remainder of the rites concern how to conduct various feasts throughout the year. In these cases, Amenhotep's idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself, which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, the City {{announced}} that its official annual Christmas tree lighting, {{which had been}} held at Daley Center since 1966 (except for 1982), would {{be held at the}} park in order that the official Christmas tree of the city could be closer to ice skating at McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink, the annual Christmas caroling at Cloud Gate and to the new <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> the nearby Maggie Daley Park. The annual lighting will occur near Michigan Avenue and Washington Street. Some parties opposed the move that separated the annual tree from the Christkindlmarket and the Chicago Picasso. The city's first official tree lighting by Mayor Carter Harrison, Jr. in 1913 had been held in Grant Park on Michigan Avenue two blocks south of the new location.|$|E
5|$|Smoke Imix {{demolished}} the Papagayo {{phase and}} ritually interred the broken remains of its sculpted monuments, accompanied by stone macaw heads {{from an early}} version of the ballcourt. He then built a pyramid over the earlier phases, nicknamed Mascarón by archaeologists. It in turn was developed into the Chorcha pyramid {{with the addition of a}} long superstructure with seven doorways at the front and back. Before a new building was built over the top, the upper sanctuary was demolished and a tomb was inserted into the floor and covered with 11 large stone slabs. The tomb contained the remains of an adult male and a sacrificed child. The adult's badly decayed skeleton was wrapped in a mat and accompanied by <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> fine jade, including ear ornaments and a necklace of sculpted figurines. The burial was accompanied by <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> 44 ceramic vessels, jaguar pelts, spondylus shells, 10 paintpots and one or more hieroglyphic books, now decayed. There were also 12 ceramic incense burners with lids modeled into human figurines, thought to represent Smoke Imix and his 11 dynastic predecessors. The Chorcha building was dedicated to the long-lived 7th-century king Smoke Imix and it is therefore likely that the remains interred in the building are his. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had sealed the Chorcha phase under a new version of the temple, nicknamed Esmeralda, by AD710. The new phase bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, which contains a lengthy dynastic history. K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil built over the Esmeralda phase in the mid-8thcentury. He removed the Hieroglyphic Stairway from the earlier building and reinstalled it into his own version, while doubling the length of its text and adding five life-size statues of rulers dressed in the garb of Teotihuacano warriors, each seated on a step of the stairway. At the base of the stairway, he also raised StelaM, with his own image. The summit shrine of the temple bore a hieroglyphic text composed of full-figure hieroglyphs, each placed beside a similar glyph in faux-Mexican style, giving the appearance of a bilingual text.|$|E

5|$|The {{marriage}} {{tradition of}} the vodiondry, still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, {{is said to have}} originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondrymeat from the hindquarters of a sheepwhich he believed to be the tastiest portion. The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due. From the time of Andriamanelo forward, it became a marriage tradition for the groom to offer vodiondry to the bride's family. Over time the customary <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> meat have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic piastre, sums of money and other gifts.|$|E
5|$|As the Enterprise arrives, {{the crew}} members explore the <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> Farpoint Station and {{establish}} relations with their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn (Michael Bell). The crew becomes suspicious when items they desire seem to appear out of nowhere moments later, and are unable to identify the power source that feeds the station. Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn does not offer an explanation. As the Enterprise crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station, and abducts Zorn. Before Picard orders the ship's phasers to be fired at the craft, Q appears {{to remind him of}} humanity's trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft. The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and they are able to free Zorn. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station. He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, while attempting to care for it, they also exploited its ability to synthesize matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit is trying to help free its mate by attacking those who hold it captive.|$|E
5|$|Hindu {{philosopher and}} saint Adi Shankara (c. 8th century) is {{believed}} to have established Govardhana matha in Puri, with Vimala as its presiding goddess. According to Starza (author of The Jagannatha Temple at Puri), the Jagannath Temple was once a centre of worship for the Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, along with their consorts and the three central forms of the Hindu Goddess, Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Parvati (in the form of Vimala). The Shri Vidya sect devoted to Goddess worship was strong here until the 17th century. Slowly, Shri Vidya and Shiva-centric Shaiva traditions were eroded but remnants continue, with the Vishnu-centric Vaishnavism becoming the sole tradition. The Tantric Panchamakara, which includes fish, meat, liquor, parched grain and ritual intercourse, were replaced with vegetarian offerings and dance of devdasis. Fish was caught locally and offered to the goddess. King Narasimhadeva, who ruled between 1623–47, ended the meat and fish <b>offerings</b> <b>of</b> the goddess, although the tradition was later partly revitalized. Today, the goddess is offered meat and fish on special days.|$|E
