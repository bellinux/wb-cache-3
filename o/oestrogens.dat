The {{incidence}} of gastric cancer is much higher in men than in woman, and a similar sex difference is also seen in a rat experimental model of gastric cancer. AIMS: Evidence for a functional <b>oestrogen</b> receptor in normal gastric mucosa and cancer has been sought. METHODS: <b>Oestrogen</b> receptor and the <b>oestrogen</b> inducible genes pS 2 and ERD 5 were sought by northern blot analysis and in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. <b>Oestrogen</b> receptor protein was studied by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: mRNA for <b>oestrogen</b> receptor was detected in cancer and normal gastric mucosa. Enzyme immunoassay for <b>oestrogen</b> receptor showed a mean of 1. 8 fmol/mg protein in cancer and 13. 7 fmol/mg in paired normal mucosa. The <b>oestrogen</b> inducible genes pS 2 and ERD 5 were also detected in both cancer and normal mucosa, with expression localised to epithelium. Expression of pS 2 was lower in cancer compared with normal mucosa, whereas ERD 5 expression was higher in cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Significant amounts of <b>oestrogen</b> receptor were expressed in gastric mucosa with a lower amount in cancer. <b>Oestrogen</b> inducible genes were also expressed differentially but were not found to correlate closely with <b>oestrogen</b> receptor. <b>Oestrogen</b> receptor functionality remains to be demonstrated in the stomach...|$|R

40|$|<b>Oestrogen</b> is {{synthesized}} in {{the male}} reproductive system by at least three different cell types; Sertoli, Leydig and germ cells.

40|$|<b>Oestrogen</b> {{replacement}} therapy reportedly suppresses hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses to an emotional stressor in postmenopausal women. However, most {{studies in the}} rat suggest a facilitatory role for <b>oestrogen</b> in the control of HPA axis function. One explanation for this difference may be the regimen of <b>oestrogen</b> replacement: during <b>oestrogen</b> {{replacement therapy}}, <b>oestrogen</b> levels are low and constant whereas most animal studies examined the HPA axis response when <b>oestrogen</b> levels are rising. In the present study, we assessed HPA axis stress responses in mature ovariectomized rats after plasma <b>oestrogen</b> levels had been maintained at physiological levels for a prolonged period (25 or 100 pg/ml for 7 days). In the case of both an emotional stressor (noise) and a physical stressor (immune challenge by systemic interleukin- 1 beta administration), <b>oestrogen</b> replacement suppressed stress-related Fos-like immunolabelling, in hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells and plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone responses. From the present data, and past reports, it appears unlikely that these effects of <b>oestrogen</b> are due to a direct action on corticotropin-releasing factor or oxytocin cells. Therefore, to obtain some indication of <b>oestrogen</b> 2 Ì† 7 s possible site(s) of action, Fos-like immunolabelling was mapped in the amygdala and in brainstem catecholamine groups, which are neuronal populations demonstrating substantial evidence {{of involvement in the}} generation of HPA axis stress responses. In the amygdala, <b>oestrogen</b> replacement suppressed central nucleus responses to immune challenge, but not to noise. Amongst catecholamine cells, <b>oestrogen</b> replacement was more effective against responses to noise than immune challenge, suppressing A 1 and A 2 (noradrenergic) and C 2 (adrenergic) responses to noise, but only A 1 responses to immune challenge. These data suggest that, as in postmenopausal women on <b>oestrogen</b> replacement therapy, chronic low-level <b>oestrogen</b> replacement can suppress HPA axis stress responses in the rat. Moreover, <b>oestrogen</b> appears to exert effects at multiple sites within putative HPA axis control pathways, even though most of the relevant neuronal populations do not contain genomic receptors for this gonadal steroid and the pattern of <b>oestrogen</b> action differs for an emotional vs a physical stressor...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground/PurposeUrinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) is {{the most}} common bacterial infection in women and increases in frequency post menopause. Falling <b>oestrogen</b> levels after menopause result in urogenital atrophy, which can be effectively treated by topical and oral <b>oestrogen</b> therapy. <b>Oestrogen</b> deficiency also results in alteration in vaginal flora and gram-negative faecal colonisation. Together with atrophic urogenital tissue change, these factors can predispose to ascending UTIs. It is proposed that <b>oestrogen</b> therapy can restore the normal premenopausal vaginal flora and acidic pH and can improve urogenital atrophy, prolapse, and cystocele, thus reducing the recurrence rate of UTIs in postmenopausal women. MethodsA literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL was performed for randomised controlled trials in which recurrence of UTI in postmenopausal women for <b>oestrogen</b> versus placebo or other intervention was the primary outcome. ResultsFive clinical trials and two relevant meta-analyses were identified. <b>Oestrogen</b> cream was shown to reduce recurrence of UTI (p< 0. 001) similar to <b>oestrogen</b> pessary (p= 0. 008). Oral <b>oestrogen</b> was less effective, with only one small trial showing any benefit, with no trend toward benefit with oral <b>oestrogen</b> on meta-analysis (risk ratio, 1. 08; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 88 â€“ 1. 33). On direct comparison with antibiotic prophylaxis, patients receiving antibiotics had significantly fewer episodes of symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria: 0. 6 episodes per woman per year instead of 1. 6 episodes per woman per year in those treated with <b>oestrogen.</b> ConclusionOral <b>oestrogen</b> did not reduce the recurrence of UTI and had systemic side effects. There is evidence to support the use of local <b>oestrogen</b> {{in the form of a}} pessary or cream that was generally well tolerated. However, local <b>oestrogen</b> was not shown to be more effective than oral antibiotic prophylaxis.

All cases were <b>oestrogen</b> receptor +, node negative, primary breast tumours from patients who later had no disease progression (tamoxifen sensitive) or whose disease progressed while on tamoxifen (tamoxifen resistant). Using an antibody to <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-beta that detects multiple forms of this protein (total) but not an antibody that detects only full-length <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-beta 1, {{it was found that}} high total <b>oestrogen</b> receptor beta protein expressors were more frequently observed in tamoxifen sensitive tumours than resistant tumours (Fisher's exact test, P= 0. 046). However, no significant differences in the relative expression of <b>oestrogen</b> receptor Î² 2, <b>oestrogen</b> receptor Î² 5 and full-length <b>oestrogen</b> receptor Î² 1 RNA in the tamoxifen sensitive and resistant groups were found.

Altogether, there is little evidence for altered coregulators expression in breast tumours that are de novo tamoxifen resistant.

Aim: To {{evaluate the}} effects of a newly developed and highly selective <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-beta agonist (KB 9520) on experimental intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Methods: In vitro, {{the effects of}} KB 9520 on apoptosis and proliferation of HuH- 28 cells, HuH- 28 cells with selective <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-beta silencing (by small interfering RNA), HepG 2 cells (<b>oestrogen</b> receptor-alpha and <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-beta negative) and HepER 3 cells (HepG 2 cells transformed to stably express <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-alpha) were evaluated. In vivo, the effects of KB 9520 on experimental intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, induced by thioacetamide administration were tested. Results: In vitro, KB 9520 induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HuH- 28 cells. KB 9520 effects were absent in cells lacking <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-alpha and beta (HepG 2) and in cells expressing only <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-alpha (HepER 3); its pro-apoptotic effect was impaired in cells where <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-beta expression was decreased by specific small interfering RNA. In vivo, KB 9520 inhibited experimental intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma development in thioacetamide-treated rats and promoted tumour regression in rats where tumour was already established. In treated animals, tumour areas showed reduced proliferation but increased apoptosis. Conclusions: KB 9520 induced apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma by selectively acting on <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-beta, suggesting that <b>oestrogen</b> receptor-beta selective agonists may be a novel and effective therapeutic option for the medical treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Systematic review and meta-analysis. Medline. Eight observational studies and nine randomised controlled trials. Studies on hormone replacement therapy that reported venous thromboembolism. REVIEW MEASURES: Homogeneity between studies was analysed using chi(2) and I(2) statistics. Overall risk of venous thromboembolism was assessed from a fixed effects or random effects model. Meta-analysis of observational studies showed that oral <b>oestrogen</b> but not transdermal <b>oestrogen</b> increased the risk of venous thromboembolism. Compared with non-users of <b>oestrogen,</b> the odds ratio of first time venous thromboembolism in current users of oral <b>oestrogen</b> was 2. 5 (95 % confidence interval 1. 9 to 3. 4) and in current users of transdermal <b>oestrogen</b> was 1. 2 (0. 9 to 1. 7). Past users of oral <b>oestrogen</b> had a similar risk of venous thromboembolism to never users. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using oral <b>oestrogen</b> was higher {{in the first year}} of treatment (4. 0, 2. 9 to 5. 7) compared with treatment for more than one year (2. 1, 1. 3 to 3. 8; P< 0. 05). No noticeable difference in the risk of venous thromboembolism was observed between unopposed oral <b>oestrogen</b> (2. 2, 1. 6 to 3. 0) and opposed oral <b>oestrogen</b> (2. 6, 2. 0 to 3. 2).

He reasoned that an equally accurate method for timing ovulation in the human would allow the same progress to be made. Furthermore, as Nature uses the interaction between oestrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries to manifest oestrus, measurement of these hormones was the most likely method of achieving his aim.
