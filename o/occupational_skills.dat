40|$|This study {{examined}} the relation of fluid and crystallized intelligence with extrinsic (<b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> level, income) and intrinsic (job satisfaction) career success {{as well as the}} incremental predictive validity of conscientiousness and its facets. Participants (N = 121) completed the Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales (RIAS), the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and reported their <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> level, income and job satisfaction. Results revealed that crystallized intelligence was positively related to <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> level, but not to income. The association of crystallized intelligence and job satisfaction was negative and stronger for the lowest <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> level, whereas it was non-significant for higher levels. Fluid intelligence showed no association with career success.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} wage rates and the racial composition of jobs, using large cross-sectional and longitudinal samples constructed from monthly Current Population Surveys for 1983 - 92. Support is found for a "quality sorting" model that posits an equilibrium in which the racial composition of jobs serves as a skill index of unmeasured labor quality. Estimation of standard wage-level equations shows that wages of {{both black and white}} workers are substantially lower in occupations with a high density of blacks. Consistent with the quality sorting hypothesis, the magnitude of the relationship is reduced sharply after accounting for <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> measures. Longitudinal wage-change estimates controlling for person-specific quality indicate little if any causal effect of racial composition on wages. Estimates of racial discrimination are reduced only moderately after accounting for racial composition; unexplained differentials occur within occupations or reflect inter-occupational differences uncorrelated with racial composition and <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> measures. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the risk of experiencing unwanted sexual advances at work (UWSA) is greater for precariously-employed workers in comparison to those in permanent or continuing employment. Methods: A cross-sectional population-based telephone survey was conducted in Victoria (66 % response rate, N= 1, 101). Employment arrangements were analysed using eight differentiated categories, as well as a four-category collapsed measure to address small cell sizes. Self-report of unwanted sexual advances at work was modelled using multiple logistic regression in relation to employment arrangement, controlling for gender, age, and <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> level. Results: Forty-seven respondents reported UWSA in our sample (4. 3 %), mainly among women (37 of 47). Risk of UWSA was higher for younger respondents, but did not vary significantly by <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> level or education. In comparison to Permanent Full-Time, three employment arrangements were strongly associated with UWSA after adjustment for age, gender, and <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> level: Casual Full-Time OR = 7. 2 (95 % Confidence Interval 1. 7 - 30. 2); Fixed-Term Contract OR = 11. 4 (95 % CI 3. 4 - 38. 8); and Own-Account Self-Employed OR = 3. 8 (95 % CI 1. 2 - 11. 7). In analyses of females only, the magnitude of these associations was further increased. Conclusions: Respondents employed in precarious arrangements {{were more likely to report}} being exposed to UWSA, even after adjustment for age and gender. Implications: Greater protections from UWSA are likely needed for precariously employed workers...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis determines the primary reasons why first-term enlistees assigned to critical occupations decide against reenlisting in the Marine Corps. The reasons given for not reenlisting {{are determined by}} analyzing responses to the Marine Corps Enlisted Separation Questionnaire over the period of fiscal 1985 through fiscal 1989 (third quarter). Questionnaire responses are analyzed using cross-tabulations and frequency distributions according to demographic characteristics (marital status, gender, race, and pay grade) and <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> requirements. The results suggest that, for most Marines, lack of promotion opportunity {{is the main reason}} for not reenlisting. Other reasons vary by demographical and <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> groups. Family separation influences the decisions of women and E- 5 s, while Marines in more technical specialties are more concerned with compensation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the patterning of exposures to occupational hazards {{in relation to}} <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> level {{as a proxy for}} pay rate, testing the general hypothesis that exposures to occupational hazards increase in prevalence with decreasing skill level. A population-based telephone survey was conducted on a random sample of working Victorians (N = 1, 101). A set of 10 indicators of exposure to occupational hazards were analysed individually and as a summary scale in multivariate regression models. A significant increasing trend in hazardous working conditions from the highest to lowest <b>occupational</b> <b>skill</b> level was observed, with those in lower skill level jobs twice as likely to be exposed as those at the highest skill level. This overall trend was driven primarily by higher exposure in the middle skill level group (technicians and skilled trades) as well as the lowest (labourers and elementary clerical), the two main blue-collar groups. Findings provided partial support for the hypothesised relationship. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} asset {{specificity}} {{has become very}} prominent {{in the literature on}} skill formation, welfare states and labour markets. Building on the varieties of capitalism (VoC) school, this paper points out three distinct shortcomings of this literature: first, the VoC approach does not fully account for the variation of skill regimes in coordinated market economies (CMEs); second, the VoC approach underestimates the importance of authoritative certification in determining the real portability of vocational skills; and third, the complementarities between skill formation and social policies are different from what is expected in the VoC contributions. I argue that the variation of skill regimes in CMEs covers not one, but two separate dimensions: firms’ involvement in skill formation and the vocational specificity of the education system. On the basis of three case studies, I demonstrate the existence of three distinct skill regimes in CMEs: the segmentalist (firm-based) skill regime of Japan, the integrationist (school-based <b>occupational)</b> <b>skill</b> regime of Sweden and the differentiated (workplace-based <b>occupational)</b> <b>skill</b> regime of Germany...|$|R
