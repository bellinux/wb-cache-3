40|$|In {{the current}} article we {{describe}} the newly emerging field of occupational travel medicine, that is, protecting {{the health and safety}} of individuals who regularly travel overseas for work. In recent years as the world embraces a global economy, travelling long distances, particularly by air, has become a common feature in many types of employment. Although most jobs traditionally required people to travel short distances to and from work either by car or public transport, an increasingly large proportion of society are now travelling internationally, usually via aircraft, as part of their job. Many occupations also involve transportation to tropical areas where various diseases exist that may not be present in the worker’s home country. For these reasons, while the clinical needs of the <b>occupational</b> <b>traveller</b> may appear similar to the general tourist, various interrelated factors combine to make travelling for work a much less pleasant experience. Health professionals in travel, tropical and occupational medicine need to work closely together to meet the needs of this steadily growing workforce demographic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{records the}} author’s {{reflections}} on a five-month study leave involving interviews with <b>occupational</b> <b>Travellers</b> {{and their teachers}} in five countries between February and July 1999. The focus is on ways in which elements of the researcher’s subjectivity were mediated and negotiated through interactions with the interviewees and others, processes that both clarified and contested those elements for the researcher. The argument is advanced that, like <b>occupational</b> <b>Travellers</b> when interacting with non-itinerants, the author simultaneously engaged in ‘strategic essentialism’ (Spivak with Rooney, 1997) and strove for anti-essentialism {{in the form of}} ‘outsidedness’ from, and ‘creative understanding’ with, others (Bakhtin, 1986). This suggests that the interplay between essentialism and anti-essentialism is complex and fluid for both educational researchers and <b>occupational</b> <b>Travellers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Travelling funfair showmen are a {{community}} of <b>travellers</b> officially called <b>occupational</b> <b>Travellers,</b> that can be categorised broadly defined as a business community of travelling show, circus communities and fairground families. <b>Occupational</b> <b>travellers</b> travel for work across Scotland, {{the rest of the}} UK and into Europe. The Show/Fairground community is close knit, with ties often existing between the older Romanichal families, although showmen families are a distinct group and have a vibrant social scene centered both around the summer fairs and the various sites and yards used as winter quarters. Many Scottish show and fairground families live in winter communities based mainly in the east end of Glasgow. Housing an estimated 80% of all showfamilies Glasgow is believed to have the largest concentration of Showmen quarters in Europe, centred mostly in Shettleston, Whiteinch and Carntyne.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{two groups of}} {{educational}} consumers: mature age universisty bridging students, and <b>occupational</b> <b>Travellers.</b> Drawing on Campion's (1997) notion of de-differentiation and Giroux's (1990) concept of border crossing, we argue that the generic skills approach to lifelong learning is potentially antithetical to these learners' specialised educational needs...|$|R
5000|$|Further {{examples}} {{include the use of}} Parlyaree/Polari among Fairground Travellers in the UK and the development of unique jargons, customs and traditions [...] Linguistically, many <b>Occupational</b> <b>Travellers</b> in the fairground and circus worlds have cultural affinities with Romani groups, such as significant traces of the Romani language and matriarchial forms of social organisation.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} <b>Occupational</b> <b>Travellers</b> are not {{defined as an}} ethnic group, even though they display certain common features; {{they tend to be}} insular favouring {{intermarriage}} resulting in long lineages and a strong sense of cultural homogeneity (The Showman's Guild of Great Britain and Ireland requires that applicants for membership have a parent from the Show Traveller community).|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{there are}} the <b>Occupational</b> <b>Travellers</b> - Travelling Showpeople/Show Travellers (known in France as Forains Industriel), Circus and Bargees. These groups formed around {{particular}} crafts and professions that required frequent mobility. Groups such as Travelling Showpeople usually follow a set pattern of nomadism year after year. Membership of these groups have, over the years been drawn from other communities (including, {{in the case of}} travelling funfairs and circuses, Romani people).|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Australian {{travelling}} {{show and}} circus people constitute two distinct groups of <b>occupational</b> <b>travellers.</b> Commonalities {{between the groups}} include their deviation from the 'norm' of fixed residence, with consequent challenges for conventional, site-based schooling, and their pride in distinctive cultural traditions. Differences include divergent patterns of itinerancy, social categorisation and institutional organisation and lobbying power, with resultant disparities in educational provision. Educational decision makers need to understand these kinds of commonalities and differences if groups such as Australian show and circus people are {{to have access to}} equitable and meaningful opprtunities and experiences...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} project that involves non-mobile academics researching the educational experiences of two communities of fairground people presents several {{ethical and methodological}} risks. The researchers argue, however, that such a project {{provides an opportunity for}} particular findings that might not arise in research conducted by fairground people alone. Drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin's (1986) concepts of 'outsidedness' and 'creative understanding', the authors posit a two-way flow of information and communication that benefits both the <b>occupational</b> <b>Travellers</b> and the researchers. These concepts enable the construction of a useful framework for analysing and negotiating the play of different interests in the context of both the {{research project}} and the contemporary university research environment, with broader implications for understanding and performing the ethics of educational research...|$|R

This paper is a first attempt to collate and describe developments from four separate transnational projects. It draws from both internal, and publicly available, project documentation to explore evolving learning environments and emergent issues. In particular, there is a discussion of the parental role in home-based, mediated, settings, and an argument that an increased understanding of the potential of this role is central to effective user needs analysis and environmental design...|$|R

Drawing on qualitative research with the Australian show people since 1992, this article deploys the concept of 'sedentarism' to highlight the ambivalently valorised live experiences and educational opportunities of the show people.

40|$|As {{is often}} the case, the genesis for this edited {{collection}} of journal articles was serendipitous. The second editor had despatched copies of some recent publications to international contacts with a shared involvement in researching the education of <b>occupational</b> <b>Travellers</b> (see Moriarty & Hallinan and Anteliz, Danaher & Danaher, this volume). Dr Martin Levinson acknowledged receipt of the publications in an electronic mail message (personal communication, 5 March 2001), {{and in so doing}} raised the following point: [...] . I must confess that some time before the completion of my own research project I was beginning to distance myself from many of the other researchers in the field. That {{is not to say that}} I do not respect their contribution [...] .. My reservations grew, nevertheless, as I became more deeply involved with Travellers themselves. The feeling tended to be that they were excluded from the dialectic concerning their own lives. There was a feeling that for all the papers and conferences, little had been achieved here [in England] to improve the situation with regard to site provision and access to health and education. Finally, despite all the meetings I had attended, it struck me that the convictions of certain academics as to what was best for the travelling community were not necessarily shared by the group in question...|$|R
40|$|This paper’s {{objective}} is to articulate possible lessons for conceptualising and interrogating academic mobility to be learned by drawing on contemporary thinking about two key social and educational issues: the knowledge economy and sustainability. In turn, the paper also explores how current understandings of academic mobility can contribute to challenging and extending the comprehension of those issues. The theoretical framework is composed of the concepts of situated learning, systems thinking, risk and capacity building, clustered around {{the ways in which}} various groups of <b>occupational</b> <b>Travellers</b> conform to and depart from the notion of mobile learning communities (Danaher, Moriarty, & Danaher, 2009). The paper’s principal finding is twofold. Firstly, concepts associated with the knowledge economy and sustainability are helpful in extending our current understandings of the manifestations and effects of academic mobility in different contexts. In particular, those manifestations and effects demonstrate the impact of changing notions of knowledge and its intersection with economic and social life, as well as enhanced comprehension of the benefits and costs of academic mobility when evaluated against a fluid and situated view of sustainability. Secondly, constructing academic mobility through the lens of mobile learning communities adds to the depth and richness of contemporary conceptualisations of the knowledge economy and sustainability, thereby highlighting the ongoing significance of academic mobility as a growing field of scholarship. Seen from this perspective, mobile learning communities can indeed teach us valuable lessons for and from academic mobility, the knowledge economy and sustainability. ...|$|R

Drawing on qualitative research with the Australian show people since 1992, this paper deploys the concept of ‘sedentarism’ to highlight the ambivalently valorised lived experiences and educational opportunities of the show people. In particular, the paper explores the pedagogical and policy implications of efforts to disrupt and transform the marginalising impact of sedentarism, which constructs mobility as the other in relation to fixed residence. Specifically, it is argued that anti-sedentarism makes possible the identification and interrogation of three distinct pedagogies of mobility pertaining to the show people, revealing differing stances on intersections of mobility and education. The first is teaching about anti-sedentarism, which involves demonstrating the value of the informal learning that takes place on the show circuits so that the show people’s mobility does not throw a negative light on their learning on the run. The second is teaching through anti-sedentarism, which centres on informing non-show people about the lives of show people and their contributions to cultural, economic and social life in Australia. The third is teaching towards anti-sedentarism, entailing the mapping and valuing of multiple forms of mobility. The paper considers implications for policy actions of these three pedagogies of mobility about and for the Australian show people. These implications are identified through the lens of assumptions underpinning the current Commonwealth Government policy statement on student mobility. The argument is that the evidence from the show people’s experiences suggests that pedagogies of mobility represent one among several possible ways forward in pursuing anti-sedentarism and in imagining anew traditional education for contemporary mobile learners...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the current pastoralists' education situation in Uganda {{in the context}} of the education policy established, and non-formal education interventions being conducted among the Bahima and Karimojong pastroralists by both Governmental and Non-Governmental Organizations, as an attempt to address the problems and issues of illiteracy and pastoral development. It is evident that education for pastoralists in Uganda creates a social consciousness with values, norms, knowledge and skills, which have a complex and dynamic relationship among the pastoralists. The problems of investigation in this research focus on information available on the functioning of pastoralism for effective provision of non-formal education programmes to the Bahima and Karimojong pastoralists; and how effectively the providers of non-formal education programmes can integrate the nomadic livelihood in the provision of non-formal education The literature review has focused on the Bahima and Karimojong pastoralists, but attempts have also been made to draw relevant lessons from other nomadic groups like Gypsies, <b>travellers,</b> and <b>occupational</b> <b>travellers.</b> The review has been intended to sharpen specific aspects related to pastoral and national education practices that can enable appropriate and strategic provision and implementation of non-formal education programmes to occur among the Bahima and Karimojong pastoralists in their pastoral context. Qualitative research methods used in the study were fundamentally relevant and suited for locating the meaning that semi-nomadic Bahima and Karimojong pastoralists placed on events, processes and structures of their lives, their perceptions, assumptions, prejudgments, presumptions, and for connecting these meanings to the social world around them. Presentation and analysis of data is divided into three sections including a recast of the items in the interview schedules, a summary of the research findings presented on a conceptually clustered Matrix Sheet, and a presentation of the data analysis resulting form the data displayed on the Matrix Sheet. Recommendations of the study have been clustered under the following three thematic categories: · Relevance of non-formal education programmes to the Bahima and Karimojong pastoraslist, · Factors for implementation of non-formal education programmes, and · Strategies for implementation and sustenance of non-formal education programmes among the Bahima and Karimojong pastoralists.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesSince {{the initial}} {{discovery}} of Plasmodium knowlesi in Malaysia, {{cases have been}} reported from several neighbouring countries. Tourism has also resulted in {{an increasing number of}} cases diagnosed in Europe, America, and Oceania. In this review we focus on the risk of the travel-associated acquisition of P. knowlesi malaria. MethodsA search of the literature in PubMed was carried out to identify articles and literature on the distribution of P. knowlesi infections in Southeast Asia and details of its acquisition and importation by travellers to other continents. The cut-off date for the search was December 1, 2013. Search words used were: “Plasmodium knowlesi”, “Plasmodium knowlesi infections”, “Plasmodium knowlesi travellers”, “Plasmodium knowlesi prevalence”, “Plasmodium knowlesi host”, “Plasmodium knowlesi vector” “Plasmodium knowlesi RDT”, and “Plasmodium knowlesi Malaysia”. Traveller numbers to Malaysia were obtained from the Tourism Malaysia website. ResultsA total of 103 articles were found. Using a selection of these and others identified from the reference lists of the papers, we based our review on a total of 66 articles. ResultsP. knowlesi malaria appears to be the most common malaria species in Malaysian Borneo and is also widely distributed on the Malaysian mainland. Furthermore, locally transmitted cases of P. knowlesi malaria have been reported in Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, Myanmar, Indonesian Borneo, and Cambodia. Two cases have been reported from non-endemic countries in Asia (Japan and Taiwan) in people with a history of travel to Malaysia and the Philippines. Twelve cases were imported to their home countries by travellers from other continents: two from the USA, two from the Netherlands, two from Germany, and one each from Spain, France, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and New Zealand. In most cases, the infection was associated with a trip to or near forested areas. The symptoms were fever (n= 12), headache (n= 6), chills (n= 6), nausea (n= 4), myalgia (n= 3), back pain (n= 3), abdominal problems (n= 1), anorexia (n= 2), fatigue (n= 2), malaise (n= 1), arthralgia (n= 1), sore throat (n= 1) vomiting (n= 2), and jaundice (n= 1). All patients were treated successfully with currently available antimalaria treatments. The identification of the pathogen by microscopy can be problematic due to the morphological similarity of P. knowlesi to Plasmodium malariae. ConclusionP. knowlesi appears to be a threat not only to the local population in Malaysia, but also to the estimated 25 million annual tourists and <b>occupational</b> <b>travellers</b> to Malaysia, especially those who visit rural, forested areas of the country.

40|$|What {{is it to}} wear a uniform? Why—and to what effect—do some {{occupational}} groups voluntarily adopt tacit dress codes? Descriptions of English commercial travellers {{have frequently}} highlighted their physical appearance and in particular their modes of dress. These descriptions show remarkable continuity {{over long periods of}} time. Travellers were noted for their exuberant, "flashy" clothing. These modes of dress were a significant element of the vibrant occupational culture in which travellers participated but, at the same time, such ways of dressing marked out travellers among their fellow citizens and were often highlighted in broader critiques of the traveller's character and, by extension, role in society. The ways in which travellers chose to dress {{and the ways in which}} they and others reacted to and spoke about those choices can tell us much about the ways in which this significant occupational group negotiated the task of creating for itself meaningful roles and identities. However, as with other aspects of their <b>occupational</b> culture, <b>travellers</b> faced significant challenges in using dress to positive effect. Dress was part of the process through which the emotional labor involved in this occupation was, literally, embodied and, sometimes, resisted and subverted. In the twentieth century, travellers' dress codes underwent some significant changes. The "dandyism" with which they had long been associated was reduced but not eliminated. However, there persisted an (albeit altered) tacit dress code or "uniform. " These changes reflected the changing societal and organizational contexts within which travellers were working, changes that imposed a new set of pressures on them and increasingly restrained their independence. "Embodying" still took place but did so in way that was more repressive. At the same time, travellers' dress spoke of their relationships to wider issues, including class, masculinity, sexuality, and, ultimately, modernity and the self. Sharing characteristics with other archetypes of the modern urban scene, such as the flanêur, the dandy, the masher, and the swell, the protean commercial traveller, with his shimmering and alluring but shallow surface appearance, appeared to presage the passing of the solidities and certainties of the world pre-modernity. Thus, attention to dress codes among occupational groups such as travellers has the potential to illuminate not only organizational shifts and effects but also much wider processes in society...|$|R
