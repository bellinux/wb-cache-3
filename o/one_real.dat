25|$|The non-real {{roots of}} a real {{polynomial}} with real coefficients can be grouped into pairs of complex conjugates, namely with the two members of each pair having imaginary parts that differ only in sign and the same real part. If the degree is odd, then by the intermediate value theorem {{at least one of}} the roots is real. Therefore, any real matrix with odd order has at least <b>one</b> <b>real</b> eigenvalue, whereas a real matrix with even order may not have any real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors associated with these complex eigenvalues are also complex and also appear in complex conjugate pairs.|$|E
25|$|In complex {{analysis}} {{of one and}} several complex variables, Wirtinger derivatives (sometimes also called Wirtinger operators), named after Wilhelm Wirtinger who introduced them in 1927 {{in the course of}} his studies on the theory of functions of several complex variables, are partial differential operators of the first order which behave in a very similar manner to the ordinary derivatives with respect to <b>one</b> <b>real</b> variable, when applied to holomorphic functions, antiholomorphic functions or simply differentiable functions on complex domains.
