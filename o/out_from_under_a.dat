40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{citizenship}} education, disability and d/Deafness at the Ontario Institution for the Education of the Deaf (OIED), 1870 - 1914. It employs a critical reading of school related documents, including the school newspaper, The Canadian Mute, {{to examine how}} citizenship education evolved at the OIED and contributed to a (re) construction of the d/Deaf citizenship ideal. This (re) construction took place over two distinct periods: 1870 to 1906, the “new” d/Deaf citizenship; and, 1907 to 1914, the “spoken” d/Deaf citizenship. During this timeframe, the OIED undertook a deliberate, structured program to rescue the educated d/Deaf student <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>an</b> expansive disability label that characterized “disabled” persons as lazy, immoral, criminal, insane, unintelligent, and financial burdens. Through the OIED’s three pronged education program – d/Deaf pedagogy (teaching communication), academic and vocational curricula – the “good” d/Deaf citizen evolved as an intelligent, active, financially independent person who was cognisant of how her/his d/Deafness reflected on the broader d/Deaf community...|$|R
500|$|A further {{inspiration}} {{came from}} a story in Charlie Chaplin's autobiography; while touring with a British musical theatre, he stayed at a tenement home. After dinner, the family took him upstairs to meet their son, pulling him <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> bed. The son ("a half man with no legs, an oversized, blond, flat-shaped head, a sickening white face, a sunken nose, a large mouth," [...] according to Chaplin) [...] "flopp around" [...] while they sang and danced. Morgan used this incident within the screenplay, although at Wong's suggestion they changed the character to the boy's mother. It took some time for the concepts to come together into a story; elements {{first appeared in the}} second season episode [...] "Humbug", written by Morgan's brother Darin and featuring a cast of circus sideshow performers. The episode incorporated several themes that had an influence on [...] "Home", including the use of a [...] "benign soul trapped in the body of a monster".|$|E

The first-ever glimpse of a Dalek mutant, in The Daleks, was a claw peeking <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> Thal cloak after it {{had been removed from}} its casing. The mutants' actual appearance has varied, but often adheres to the Doctor's description of the species in Remembrance of the Daleks as [...] "little green blobs in bonded polycarbide armour". In Resurrection of the Daleks a Dalek creature, separated from its casing, attacks and severely injures a human soldier; in Remembrance of the Daleks, there are two Dalek factions (Imperial and Renegade) and the creatures inside have a different appearance in each case, one resembling the amorphous creature from Resurrection, the other the crab-like creature from the original Dalek serial. As the creature inside is rarely seen on screen, a common misconception exists that Daleks are wholly mechanical robots. In the new series Daleks are retconned to be mollusc-like in appearance, with small tentacles, one or two eyes, and an exposed brain.|$|E

2500|$|On December 13, about 30 {{soldiers}} {{came to a}} Chinese {{house at}} #5 Hsing Lu Koo in the southeastern part of Nanking, and demanded entrance. The door was open by the landlord, a Mohammedan named Ha. They killed him immediately with a revolver and also Mrs. Ha, who knelt before them after Ha's death, begging them not to kill anyone else. Mrs. Ha asked them why they killed her husband and they shot her. Mrs. Hsia was dragged <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> table in the guest hall where {{she had tried to}} hide with her 1 year old baby. After being stripped and raped by one or more men, she was bayoneted in the chest, and then had a bottle thrust into her vagina. The baby was killed with a bayonet. Some soldiers then went to the next room, where Mrs. Hsia's parents, aged 76 and 74, and her two daughters aged 16 and 14. They were about to rape the girls when the grandmother tried to protect them. The soldiers killed her with a revolver. The grandfather grasped the body of his wife and was killed. The two girls were then stripped, the elder being raped by 2–3 men, and the younger by 3. The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina. The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother. The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 7–8, who was also in the room. The last murders in the house were of Ha's two children, aged 4 and 2 respectively. The older was bayoneted and the younger split down through the head with a sword.|$|E

40|$|This {{reflection}} {{focuses on}} the case of a student who failed my English class when I was concurrently a PhD student and a middle school teacher. The pedagogical insight imbedded in the story of our time together adds to the literature on teacher content knowledge Shulman (1986) called the missing paradigm. The piece takes an unorthodox approach to a case study based on the twofold identity of the author as a researcher intrigued by the complexity of teacher thinking and an educator driven by concern for a particular student. This case reflects back on my experiences teaching this young man, whom I failed to bring <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>an</b> oppressive system (Friere, 1970). The reflection unfolds into a fantasy of an emerging, poetic curriculum I wished I had created for this student, rather than assigning him a failing grade. This approach to curriculum could “allow students their full humanity and allow me to stay alive as a teacher” (Ayers, 1993). Based on Dewey’s conception of a poem as “a universe” that is “self-enclosed and self-limiting,” (1934, p. 250), I construct a metaphorical understanding of my ideal teaching as a poetic creation. Through a careful rebellion against constraints created by policy and school governance, my teaching could be a model for students, whom I hope will become “strong poets” (Bloom, 1978) with the confidence and space to write their own beautiful learning agendas...|$|R

60|$|The gap remains like a gash, {{a sort of}} {{wound in}} the walls; but it only {{strengthens}} by contrast the general sense of their continuity. Save this one angle where the nineteenth century has entered, the vague impression of the thirteenth or fourteenth century rather deepens than dies away. It is supported more than many would suppose even by the figures that appear in the gateways or pass in procession under the walls. The brown Franciscans and the white Dominicans would alone give some colour to a memory of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem; {{and there are other}} examples and effects which are less easily imagined in the West. Thus as I look down the street, I see coming <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>an</b> archway a woman wearing a high white head-dress very like those we have all seen in a hundred pictures of tournaments or hunting parties, or the Canterbury Pilgrimage or the Court of Louis XI. She is as white as a woman of the North; and it is not, I think, entirely fanciful to trace a certain freedom and dignity in her movement, which is quite different at least from the shuffling walk of the shrouded Moslem women. She is a woman of Bethlehem, where a tradition, it is said, still claims as a heroic heritage the blood of the Latin knights of the cross. This is, of course, but one aspect of the city; but it is one which may be early noted, yet one which is generally neglected. As I have said, I had expected many things of Jerusalem, but I had not expected this. I had expected to be disappointed with it as a place utterly profaned and fallen below its mission. I had expected to be awed by it; indeed I had expected to be frightened of it, as a place dedicated and even doomed by its mission. But I had never fancied that {{it would be possible to}} be fond of it; as one might be fond of a little walled town among the orchards of Normandy or the hop-fields of Kent.|$|R
