5000|$|Following {{concerns}} {{about the amount of}} time it took banks to clear cheques, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. They produced a report recommending maximum times for the cheque clearing which were introduced in UK from November 2007. [...] In the report the date the credit appeared on the recipient's account (usually the day of deposit) was designated [...] "T". At [...] "T + 2" [...] (two business days afterwards) the value would count for calculation of credit interest or <b>overdraft</b> <b>interest</b> on the recipient's account. At [...] "T + 4" [...] clients would be able to withdraw funds on current accounts or at [...] "T + 6" [...] on savings accounts (though this will often happen earlier, at the bank's discretion). [...] "T + 6" [...] is the last day that a cheque can bounce without the recipient's permission—this is known as [...] "certainty of fate". Before the introduction of this standard (also known as 2-4-6 for current accounts and 2-6-6 for savings accounts), the only way to know the [...] "fate" [...] of a cheque has been [...] "Special Presentation", which would normally involve a fee, where the drawee bank contacts the payee bank to see if the payee has that money at that time. [...] "Special Presentation" [...] needed to be stated at the time of depositing in the cheque.|$|E

Working with a large Turkish bank to test SMS direct marketing promotions to 108, 000 existing checking account holders, we find that messages promoting a large discount on the <b>overdraft</b> <b>interest</b> rate reduce overdraft usage. In contrast, messages that mention overdraft availability without mentioning price increase usage. Neither change persists long after messages stop, suggesting that induced overdrafting is not habit-forming. Our {{results are consistent with}} a model of limited memory and attention...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{functions}} of a bank is to grant loans. Whatever money the bank receives by way of deposits, it lends {{a major part of}} it to its customers by way of loans, advances, cash credit and <b>overdraft.</b> <b>Interest</b> received on such loans and advances is the major source of its income. The banks have a major contribution to the economic development of the country by granting loans to the industrial and agricultural sectors. The banks make loans and advances out of deposits, received from their customers. Most of these deposits are payable on demand. As such the bank owes a greater responsibility to the depositors. Hence he should be extremely careful while granting loans...|$|E
50|$|Banks in the UK {{normally}} {{offer an}} overdraft facility free of charge, {{subject to a}} pre-arranged limit (formerly known as an authorized <b>overdraft</b> limit). <b>Interest,</b> fees or both would normally be charged if the facility is used but accounts may have an interest-free buffer of a few tens of Pounds or a higher deliberate feature {{of a few hundred}} Pounds interest free.|$|R
50|$|An {{overdraft}} {{occurs when}} withdrawals {{from a bank}} account exceed the available balance. This gives the account a negative balance and in effect means the account provider is providing credit. If there is a prior agreement with the account provider for an overdraft facility, and the amount overdrawn is within this authorised <b>overdraft,</b> then <b>interest</b> is normally charged at the agreed rate. If the balance exceeds the agreed facility then fees may be charged and a higher interest rate might apply.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{capital flow}} to the single item stochastic lot sizing problem. A retailer can leverage business overdraft to deal with unexpected capital shortage, but needs to pay interest if its available balance goes below zero. A stochastic dynamic programming model maximizing expected final capital increment is formulated {{to solve the problem}} to optimality. We then investigate the performance of four controlling policies: (R, Q), (R, S), (s, S) and (s, Q, S); for these policies, we adopt simulation-genetic algorithm to obtain approximate values of the controlling parameters. Finally, a simulation-optimization heuristic is also employed to solve this problem. Computational comparisons among these approaches show that policy (s, S) and policy (s, Q, S) provide performance close to that of optimal solutions obtained by stochastic dynamic programming, while simulation-optimization heuristic offers advantages in terms of computational efficiency. Our numerical tests also show that capital availability as well as business <b>overdraft</b> <b>interest</b> rate can substantially affect the retailer's optimal lot sizing decisions.

40|$|In recent years, {{while the}} cost of funds has fallen, credit card rates have {{remained}} stubbornly high, spurring legislators to consider imposing interest rate ceilings on credit card rates. The fast development of the credit card business depends on its potential high profit. Internationally, the credit card annual interest rate maintains 18 % ~ 24 %. Moreover, it does not change along with the benchmark interest rate. Chinese credit card interest rate formulated in 1996 was "the date interest rate is 5 / 10000 within 15 days, 10 / 10000 within 30 days, 20 / 10000 above 30 days". In 1999 it was adjusted, "date interest rate is 5 / 10000 ", which has lasted to present. At present, China's credit card overdraft annual interest rate is 18. 25 %, which is far higher than bank deposit rates {{over the same period}} and other lending rate. To a certain extent, high <b>overdraft</b> <b>interest</b> rate affects the circular credit function of the credit card. Whether the daily interest rate of 5 / 10000 is reasonable? How should the banks develop more suitable interest rates for the market? How should the consumers choose the rational consumption patterns under the existing interest rates? This paper carries on a further discussion on these questions. The three generations of models determined by the credit card exchange fee will be analysed in the following parts...|$|E
40|$|The {{ruling by}} the Supreme Court of Appeal in Commissioner South African Revenue Service v Brummeria Renaissance (Pty) Ltd on 13 September 2007 added to and amended South African case law {{regarding}} the critical definition of ‘gross income’ in the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. The court diverged from the existing precedent – set in Stander v Commissioner for Inland Revenue – that receipts that “could not be converted into cash {{and could not be}} transferred to anyone else” are not taxable. In Commissioner South African Revenue Service v Brummeria Renaissance (Pty) Ltd the court ruled that what is key is that the benefit has an ascertainable monetary value. Accordingly, the benefits of interest-free loans can be valued – using the weighted prime <b>overdraft</b> <b>interest</b> rate – and can be taxed. This decision {{has been the subject of}} much debate, centring on the aptness of the amended view of ‘gross income’, the quid pro quo principle discussed in the judgement, the valuation method, and the implications of these for taxpayers. The purpose of this study is to present arguments and additional information to this continued debate, looking particularly at the impact of Commissioner South African Revenue Service v Brummeria Renaissance (Pty) Ltd on interest-free shareholders’ loans, without attempting to provide a definitive answer to this debate. This non-empirical study explores the topic through a review of literature, with the sources cited being mainly published public articles, tax text books and conference papers retrieved from the internet.

50|$|A cheque {{guarantee}} card was essentially an abbreviated portable {{letter of credit}} granted by a bank to a qualified depositor {{in the form of}} a plastic card that was used in conjunction with a cheque. This allowed retailers to accept cheques and providing that the retailer wrote the card number on the back of the cheque, it was signed in the retailer's presence, and the retailer verified the signature on the cheque against the signature on the card, then the cheque could not be stopped and payment could not be refused by the bank. This arrangement worked only for cheques drawn on an account provided by the bank that issued the card and could result in an <b>overdraft</b> with penalty <b>interest.</b>|$|R
50|$|When a {{transaction}} would exceed the previously agreed overdraft limit the bank can choose either to decline the transaction or {{to accept it}} as an informal request for an increase, formerly often known as an unauthorized <b>overdraft.</b> Charges and <b>interest</b> rates for informal increases will often exceed those for a formal request. There is also normally a fee per declined transaction, often subject to monthly caps. Usually, the bank sends out a letter informing the customer of the charge and requesting that the account be operated within its limits from that point onwards or informing the customer of their new limit. In a BBC Whistleblower programme on the practice, {{it was noted that}} the actual cost to the bank was less than two pounds.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical examination of political cycles in Israel {{by examining the}} instruments of fiscal and monetary policy {{at the time of}} election campaigns. In common with the findings of similar empirical studies undertaken elsewhere, the economic data for Israel support the theory of politico-economic cyclicality. The results of the study indicate that in the 1980 s and 1990 s (a period that includes six general elections) about two years before an election the government adopted an expansionary policy which intensified as the election drew nearer: public civilian consumption rose significantly in the two years before an election, and especially {{in the last six months}} before an election. Similar findings are evident from an examination of the real wage per employee post in the public sector: this variable also rose significantly in the two years preceding an election, and in the 1980 s it soared in the last six months before an election. In addition, the rate of expansion of public consumption and the real wage per employee post was negative in the six months after an election, although not markedly so. Contrary to economic theory and empirical findings worldwide which endorse it, in Israel we did not find a significant rise in transfer payments to the public (paid by the National Insurance Institute) before an election. With regard to monetary policy (as expressed in <b>overdraft</b> <b>interest),</b> there was an increase in the average nominal interest rate prior to an election, and a decline subsequently. In contrast with nominal interest, an examination of the ex post real interest rate does not indicate any specific trend at election time. 1...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, 2003. Against a {{background}} of declining macro-economic conditions in Zimbabwe, significant challenges confront management in changing the financial performance of debt-ridden parastatals or public corporations. Chronic budget deficits, poor economic policies and mismanagement have ensured that these under capitalised companies post successive losses thus increasing {{the burden on the}} tax payer who must pay for their survival. The research study seeks to establish the strategies which management can implement to raise revenue and improve cash flows in preparation for privatisation. If the companies are to be competitive in a deregulated sector, the chosen strategies must offer quick and sustainable solutions. The shareholder's intention is to place these companies in a profitable position in order to gain maximum value from prospective investors. The recommended strategies are intended to improve financial performance of a telecommunications company confronted by a myriad of problems, which include: - • Critical shortages of foreign currency required to implement network development and maintenance programmes as well as payment of traffic handling obligations. • Competition from new entrants, • Government intention to privatise a company weighed down by a huge local and foreign debt. • An economy experiencing negative growth, high unemployment and chronic inflation. MBA-Strategic Financial Management • A population on the verge of starvation resulting from food shortages created by badly implemented land policy and drought conditions afflicting Zimbabwe and Southern Africa in general. The study focuses on key processes that create improvements in revenue and cash flow generation in the short to medium term. The processes are considered against {{a background}} of declining macro economic conditions and telecommunications sector deregulation. Experiences on deregulation of telecommunications sector in other countries are considered, and in Zimbabwe, the work done by BT consultants during restructuring and commercialization of the Post and Telecommunications Corporation is assessed. The study shall consider and recommend changes necessary to improve revenues and cash flows. In particular, the study shall: - • Critically review service provision for new customers, line transfers, reallocation of recovered lines, the delayed billing of connected customers and meter reading timetable for statement generation. • Consider and develop improvements in international traffic and accounting rates management in order to increase revenues, which contribute half of the company's profits. MBA-Strategic Financial Management • Assess and develop debt management strategies in order to improve cash flow and profitability. • Assess the company's cash handling procedures and recommend process improvements in order to realise the computed servings in <b>overdraft</b> <b>interest</b> or earnings arising from timely investments. • Develop a system of continuous improvement through tracking, feedback and training...|$|E
40|$|The {{competitive}} environment forces the banks to make different marketing mixes for different customer segments. It {{is clear that}} the differentiation and innovation can be the way how to gain new customers or to hold the current customers. Students are a specific marketing segment and banks usually have specific offer for them. The banks realize the students probably finish higher education in the future. Generally it is true that higher education is connected with higher income and therefore this segment of clients can make the VIP group of bank clients in the future. Moreover some of the students are employed and they use not only the free services but also a lot of paid bank services. Above that many students use the <b>overdraft</b> with high <b>interest</b> rate (usually 12 - 22 %).

40|$|A line {{of credit}} or {{overdraft}} is a common contingent lending contract that is an alternative to a fixed or fully drawn loan. The latter has received much attention in empirical and theoretical analyses while the former has received virtually none. In particular, much effort has been put into investigating credit rationing, which {{has been defined as}} occurring when a borrower wants a larger loan than is offered at the ruling interest rate. The meaning of credit rationing in a {{line of credit}} or overdraft regime {{is the subject of this}} paper. An overdraft is the right to overdraw an account, up to a specified maximum and over an agreed period after which time credit limits are reviewed. The borrower pays interest on the credit he uses, which is determined by him up to the maximum allowable. In such a system, the lender faces uncertainty from two sources. First, when the credit limit is established there is uncertainty as to how much credit will actually be used during the life of the credit arrangement. This is significant to the lender because he may have to find cash to cover unexpected fluctuations in realised usage of the credit line. Second, there is uncertainty concerning the borrower’s ability to replay the <b>overdraft</b> loan plus <b>interest</b> when the <b>overdraft</b> contracts terminates. This is the default risk issue that is commonly addressed in the context of fixed loans. There are in effect two distinct demands for credit in an overdraft or line of credit system. First, there is the demand for the credit limit that is available in all contingencies and which is independent of the second demand, which is the actual drawing against the credit limit. This leads quite naturally to two concepts of credit rationing with overdraft, which I shall call ex ante and ex post. Ex ante rationing occurs when a borrower would like a larger credit limit, given his expectations of the interest rate he will be charged, prior to his actual use of the credit limit. That is, the borrower can anticipate the possibility of some situations in which he might face a binding credit constraint. Ex post rationing occurs when the borrower needs more credit than his limit given the interest rate. This paper is concerned with the existence of ex ante credit rationing in a credit market in which there are no interest rate ceilings on borrowers and lenders, and the credit market is assumed to be competitive in that lenders earn zero expected profit. The result is obtained in a simple two period model in which the borrower requires credit to finance a loan project that is subject to diminishing returns (such as a perfect competitor financing production subject to increasing marginal costs) and faces default risk. A further complication is introduced by assuming that the borrower has a random source of revenue during the life of the credit agreement and this random revenue affects his need for credit from the lender. This model is an abstraction from reality that tries to capture three features of real-life line of credit arrangements: (i) such facilities are typically available to borrowers who are financing working capital and whose revenue from the sale of output may be randomly spaced during the time the credit facility exists. (ii) since the borrower’s cash flow is irregular, then to the extent that overdraft credit and retained earnings are the only source of working capital to the borrower any fluctuations in cash flow will have an impact on the demand for borrowed credit. (iii) the credit facility is never established for an indefinite period, but rather is set up subject to review after a finite period. Once established, the limit is not altered until the review date. This abstracts, of course, from any central bank directive concerning limitations on lending rights. In addition to showing the existence of ex ante credit rationing, the paper also considers the impact of an alternative asset for the borrower to invest in in addition to working capital. As expected, the existence of the asset, by increasing the opportunities to the borrower, leads to a demand for a larger credit limit. The effect of a binding ceiling on lending rate is to raise the average rate of credit utilisation and to increase the degree of credit rationing. ...|$|R
