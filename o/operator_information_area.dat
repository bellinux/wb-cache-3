40|$|The {{concept of}} a task is {{fundamental}} to the discipline of ergonomics. Approaches {{to the analysis of}} tasks began in the early 1900 's. These approaches have evolved and developed to the present day, when there is a vast array of methods available. Some of these methods are specific to particular contexts or applications, others more general. However, whilst many of these analyses allow tasks to be examined in detail, they do not act as tools to aid the design process or the designer. The present thesis examines the use of task analysis in a process control context, and in particular the use of task analysis to specify <b>operator</b> <b>information</b> and display requirements in such systems. The first part of the thesis examines the theoretical aspect of task analysis and presents a review of the methods, issues and concepts relating to task analysis. A review of over 80 methods of task analysis was carried out to form a basis {{for the development of a}} task analysis method to specify <b>operator</b> <b>information</b> requirements in industrial process control contexts. Of the methods reviewed Hierarchical Task Analysis was selected to provide such a basis and developed to meet the criteria outlined for such a method of task analysis. The second section outlines the practical application and evolution of the developed task analysis method. Four case studies were used to examine the method in an empirical context. The case studies represent a range of plant contexts and types, both complex and more simple, batch and continuous and high risk and low risk processes. The theoretical and empirical issues are drawn together and a method developed to provide a task analysis technique to specify <b>operator</b> <b>information</b> requirements and to provide the first stages of a tool to aid the design of VDU displays for process control...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the achieved research results within several {{national and international}} C 2 and information management projects to develop concepts for balancing the information push with an <b>operator’s</b> <b>information</b> {{need in order to}} meet the requirement to avoid / suppress information overload situations. The paper starts with an analysis and syntheses of the information overload problem. A model is used to describe the causes and the consequences of information overload on the operator’s behaviour and performance in a command information centre of naval vessels. Research has shown that an increasing amount of time is needed for gathering and discriminating relevant information from the actual information push while less time is left for analysing the relevant information in more details and taking correct and original decisions. Information overload is seen as a serious threat for the quality and performance of mission execution. The blueprint for an adaptive information management support concept is based on merging several information management support approaches: 1. Approaches to estimate and/or measure and control the <b>operator’s</b> <b>information</b> overload. 2. Information exchange concepts. 3. Information handling within several kind of tasks: Skill based, rule-based and knowledge-based tasks. Based on the complexity of the problem, an information management concept is discussed to control and filter the information flows adaptively for skill and rule dominated tasks...|$|R
