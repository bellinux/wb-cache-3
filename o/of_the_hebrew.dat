5|$|In 1840, Britain intervened and {{returned}} {{control of the}} Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its incorporation into the global, and particularly European, economic pattern of growth. The beneficiaries of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a new layer within the Arab elite. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration and the revival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> language and culture.

In 2000, David Persuitte argued that Cowdery's knowledge <b>of</b> View <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> significantly contributed to <b>the</b> final version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> Mormon, a connection first suggested as early as 1902. Fawn Brodie wrote that it [...] "may never be proved that Joseph saw View <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> before writing <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> Mormon, but <b>the</b> striking parallelisms {{between the two books}} hardly leave a case for mere coincidence."

5|$|The Hebrew {{alphabet}} is, {{like the}} Persian alphabet, an abjad. It {{is used for}} the Jewish Bukhori dialect primarily in Samarkand and Bukhara.

2500|$|Some Mormon apologists {{have argued}} that Roberts's {{parallels}} are unimportant both because {{many of them have}} been answered by Mormon apologists in the intervening years and because there are also many [...] "unparallels" [...] between View <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> and <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> Mormon. Critics reply that Joseph Smith was not obligated to use everything he found in <b>the</b> View <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews,</b> that he might well have taken major ideas and discarded others according to his fancy, and that furthermore, the conceptual differences are minor and the similarities major.|$|R

Roberts concluded that View <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> had been published first, that the possibility that Joseph Smith had access to it was [...] "a very close certainty," [...] and that there were many similarities between the works. <b>The</b> bulk <b>of</b> Roberts's manuscript considers the similarities between View <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> and <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> Mormon.|$|R

5|$|The Confession {{starts with}} the {{doctrine}} of revelation, or how people can know about God. The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature {{as well as the}} Bible, but they also believed that the Bible, or Scripture, is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of God. The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time. Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew vowel points, marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation, of the Old Testament were probably not part of the original. This caused significant debate between Reformed polemicists and Roman Catholics. Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative magisterium to interpret the Bible as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of perspicuity, that the essential teachings of the Bible could be interpreted by anyone. English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine. The divines had a strong view of the inspiration of the Bible, and believed that God revealed himself in the propositions found in Scripture. While the issue of biblical inerrancy, the belief that there are no errors in the Bible, did not arise until the eighteenth century, the divines clearly did not believe the Bible to contain any errors. Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration, believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> text were inspired by God. On the other hand, they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles. They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration.|$|E

Book of Mormon witness and scribe Oliver Cowdery, and his family, had attended Ethan Smith's church since November 1821. Prior to his book's publication, Ethan Smith advocated his views regarding <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> Native Americans in sermons to his congregations.
