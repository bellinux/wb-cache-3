5|$|Despite {{concerns}} about vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings, {{the problems of}} compensating the many thousands <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> homes were destroyed during the digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might accidentally break through into Hell, construction began in 1860. The new railway was built beneath the existing New Road, running from the Great Western Railway's terminus at Paddington to Farringdon and the meat market of Smithfield. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its own services and acquiring other local railways in the areas north and west of London.|$|E

25|$|Sergio Burstein was {{the leader}} of a group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> {{relatives}} died in the AMIA bombing. Macri was charged in a 2010 wiretapping case, suspected of spying on Burstein and his brother-in-law Néstor Daniel Leonardo. Macri denied the charges. Judge Norberto Oyarbide indicted him, and Federal Chamber members Eduardo Farah, Eduardo Freiler and Jorge Ballestero confirmed the indictment. It was suspected at the time that Macri had organized a clandestine spy network with the aid of Jorge Alberto Palacios and Ciro James. The case was transferred to judge Sebastián Casanello, who ordered further investigation. It was learned that Macri had little knowledge about Palacios' daily activities and his minister, Mariano Narodowski, appointed James. Francisco Macri admitted hiring private agencies to spy on Daniel Leonardo.|$|E

25|$|In March 2013 the Diocese of Winchester exhumed {{the bones}} from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's {{and placed them}} in secure storage. The diocese made no claim they were the bones of Alfred, but {{intended}} to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of King Richard III. The bones were radiocarbon-dated but {{the results showed that}} they were from the 1300s and therefore unrelated to Alfred. In January 2014, a fragment of pelvis unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, which had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period. It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred or his son Edward, but this remains unproven.|$|E
25|$|Language: 57% of Embrun's {{population}} speaks French at home, while 41% speak English at home. The remaining 2% speak either both languages equally, {{or speak}} a non-official language. However, because there {{a significant number}} of French-Canadians who change their primary language to English later in life, the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> mother tongue is French is higher than those who speak French as their main home language. 63% of Embrun residents list French as their mother tongue, while 33% list English as their mother tongue. 66% of Embrun residents are bilingual in both English and French, 24% speak only English, and 9% speak only French. For language of work, the English language is disproportionately common; while only 41% of Embrun residents speak English at home, 57% of Embrun residents speak primarily or exclusively English at work.|$|E
25|$|Repin {{persistently}} {{searched for}} new techniques and content {{to give his}} work more fullness and depth. Repin had a set of favorite subjects, and a limited circle <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> portraits he painted. But he had {{a deep sense of}} purpose in his aesthetics, and had the great artistic gift to sense the spirit of the age and its reflection in the lives and characters of individuals. Repin's search for truth and for an ideal led him in various directions artistically, influenced by hidden aspects of social and spiritual experiences as well as national culture. Like most Russian realists of his times, Repin often based his works on dramatic conflicts, drawn from contemporary life or history. He also used mythological images with a strong sense of purpose; some of his religious paintings are among his greatest.|$|E

25|$|The Pakistan Movement {{was led by}} a {{large and}} diversified group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> {{struggle}} ultimately resulted in the British Empire announcing the Indian Independence Act 1947, which created the independent dominions of India and Pakistan. The Pakistan Movement {{was the result of}} a series of social, political, and intellectual transformations in Pakistani society, government, and ways of thinking. Efforts and struggles of the Founding Fathers resulted in the creation of the democratic and independent government. In the following years, another nationally–minded subset went on to established a strong government, followed by the military intervention in 1958. Repression and an unbalanced economy caused an upheaval which led East Pakistan to declare independence as the People's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971. After many concessions an agreement was reached in 1973 in which the new Constitution established a relatively strong government, institutions, national courts, a legislature that represented both states in the Senate and population in the National Assembly. Pakistan's phase shift to republicanism, and the gradually increasing democracy, caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Schaper's death squad was {{deployed}} in the newly formed Bezirk Bialystok district soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Himmler himself visited Białystok on 30 June 1941 and pronounced that more forces were needed in the area, because the massive chase after the fleeing Red Army left behind a security vacuum. On 3 July additional formation of Schutzpolizei arrived in the city from the General Government, led by SS-Hauptsturmführer Wolfgang Birkner, veteran of Einsatzgruppe IV from the Polish Campaign. The relief unit, called kommando Bialystok, was sent in by SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Eberhard Schöngarth on orders from the Reich Main Security Office, due to reports of Soviet guerrilla activity in the area with Jews being of course immediately suspected of helping them out. On 10 July 1941 Schaper's Einsatzgruppe was subdivided into dozens of smaller commandos (Einsatzkommandos) numbering from several to several scores <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>whose</b> mission was to kill Jews, alleged communists and the Soviet NKVD collaborators in the captured territories often far behind the advancing German front. The entire Einsatzgruppe employed the same, systematic method of mass killing across many Polish villages and towns {{in the vicinity of}} Białystok. Schaper's murderous rampage south-east of East Prussia is fairly well documented, and included Wizna (end of June), Wąsosz (5 July), Radziłów (7 July), Jedwabne (10 July), Łomża (early August), Tykocin (22–25 August), Rutki (4 September), Piątnica, Zambrów as well as other locations.|$|E

Treatment lasts from six months to a year, depending on medication and genotype. Treatment duration when medication is taken by mouth, however, is more variable and usually longer than one year.|$|E
