Cary, North Carolina's pilot program in 2007 tallied first choices on optical scan equipment at the polls and then used a central hand-count for the IRV tally. Portland, Maine in 2011 used its usual voting machines to tally first choice at the polls, then a central scan with different equipment if an IRV tally was necessary.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Graham Bell died in 1922, {{and until}} {{recently}} no recordings of his voice were known to survive. On April 23, 2013, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, which houses a collection of Volta Laboratory materials, announced {{that one of its}} fragile Volta experimental sound recordings, a deteriorated wax-on-cardboard disc that can now be played safely by an <b>optical</b> <b>scanning</b> technology, had preserved the inventor's Scottish-tinged voice. Museum staff working with scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory had also revived the voice of his father, Alexander Melville Bell, from an 1881 recording in the wax-filled groove of a modified Edison tinfoil cylinder phonograph.|$|E
500|$|She has {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} all Ohio voting machines, including the direct-recording electronic (DRE) touch-screen ones used in more than 50 of Ohio's 88 counties. Brunner supports a move to paper ballots, which would use <b>optical</b> <b>scanning.</b> [...] As {{a result of the}} study, during the March 2008 primaries, paper ballots were supposed to be available at all polling places for voters who preferred them. [...] The paper ballots also served as a backup for machine failures. [...] Brunner mandated a paper ballot election for the November 2008 general election. This was due both to the study and problems faced during the 2007 election with touch screen electronic voting machines. [...] However, the Republican-controlled Ohio General Assembly has not addressed the subject of funding an all-paper ballot. [...] Consequently, Brunner focussed on addressing the procedures instead of the inherent lack of technical security.|$|E

40|$|The {{findings}} {{of this study indicate that}} the architecture of the Diebold Precinct-Based <b>Optical</b> <b>Scan</b> 1. 94 w voting system inherently supports the alteration of its basic functionality, and thus the alteration of the produced results each time an election is prepared. The fundamental design of the Diebold Precinct-Based <b>Optical</b> <b>Scan</b> 1. 94 w system (AV OS) includes the <b>optical</b> <b>scan</b> machine, with an embedded system containing firmware, and the removable media (memory card), which should contain only the ballot box, the ballot design and the race definitions, but also contains a living thing [...] an executable program which acts on the vote data. Changing this executable program on the memory card can change the way <b>optical</b> <b>scan</b> machine functions and the way the votes are reported. Whereas we would expect to see vote data in a passive environment, this system places votes into an active environment. With this architecture, every time an election is conducted it is necessary to reinstall part of the functionality into the <b>Optical</b> <b>Scan</b> system, making it possible to introduce program functions (either authorized or unauthorized), either wholesale or in a targeted manner, and there is no way to verify that the certified or even standard functionality is maintained from one voting machine to the next...|$|R
