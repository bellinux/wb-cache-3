5|$|On the upland farms of Wales, Welsh ponies and cobs would <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do {{everything}} from ploughing a field to carrying a farmer to market or driving a family to services on Sunday. When coal mining became important to the economy of England, many Welsh ponies were harnessed for use in mines, above and below ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level is}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} challenges that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The game also features some elements of action-adventure games. Players <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> speak with NPCs and then {{figure out a way to}} help them. It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie's energy bar by collecting extra honeycombs that are hidden throughout the levels. Banjo and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. Most of these moves are learned by finding Bottles, a friendly mole, inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items so that they can be performed. For instance, red feathers allow Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage. Some items also allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment. For instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time.|$|E

25|$|Because {{school feeding}} {{programs}} are community-specific and require {{a great deal}} of planning, the sustainability of school feeding programs is a main point of concern for many countries.

Sinn Féin stated that its members <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel to London on parliamentary business.|$|E
25|$|Outfielders field furthest {{from the}} bat, {{typically}} {{right on the}} boundary edge. Their main role is to prevent the ball from going over the boundary and scoring four or six runs. They need good footspeed {{to be able to}} get around the field quickly, and a strong arm to be able to make the 50–80-yard throw. Outfielders also <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> catch high hit balls that go over the infield.|$|E

This affects their trust for Ein, their mood, and eventually, the game's outcome.|$|E
25|$|As a {{critical}} component of restoring native riparian communities, restoration practitioners <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remove invasive species and prevent them from reestablishing. This can be accomplished through herbicide application, mechanical removal, etc. When restoration is to be done on long stretches of rivers and streams, it is often useful to begin the project upstream and work downstream so that propagules from exotic species upstream will not hamper restoration attempts. Ensuring the establishment of native species is considered vital in preventing future colonizations of exotic plants.|$|E
25|$|As {{multiple}} coins became common {{within a}} region, they were exchanged by moneychangers, the predecessors of today's foreign exchange market, as famously {{discussed in the}} Biblical story of Jesus and the money changers. In Venice and the Italian city states of the early Middle Ages, money changers would <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> struggle to perform calculations involving six or more currencies. This partly led to Fibonacci writing his Liber Abaci where he popularised the use of Indo-Arabic numerals, which displaced the more difficult Roman numerals then in use by western merchants.|$|E
