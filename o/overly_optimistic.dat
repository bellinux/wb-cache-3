5|$|The {{other major}} {{factors in the}} decline of coal {{were related to the}} massive {{under-investment}} in Rhondda mines over the past decades. Most of the mines in the valleys were sunk between the 1850s and 1880s, which, as a consequence, meant they were far smaller than most modern mines. The Rhondda mines were in comparison antiquated, with methods of ventilation, coal-preparation and power supply all of a poor standard. In 1945 the British coal industry cut 72 per cent of their output mechanically, whereas in South Wales the figure was just 22 per cent. The only way to ensure the financial survival of the mines in the valleys was massive investment from the NCB, but the 'Plan for Coal' paper drawn up in 1950 was <b>overly</b> <b>optimistic</b> in the future demand for coal, which was drastically reduced following an industrial recession in 1956 and an increased availability of oil.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{with the}} project still unfinished, the museum {{published}} a report examining {{the reasons for the}} delay and additional cost. It found that the museum had greatly underestimated the work required due to the poor condition of the locomotive, much of which had been missed by a rushed inspection, which produced an <b>overly</b> <b>optimistic</b> assessment which was not based on engineering realities. It also found that once the project was underway, management lacked the experience, continuity or resources to undertake such a complex task, which was also hampered by illness and recruitment issues. Although the museum had a formal contract system to manage suppliers, managers failed to implement it properly, and it was ill-suited to the cottage industry nature of the heritage railway sector which the suppliers were largely drawn from, many of whom had failed to meet their contractual targets. Problems were also caused by the conflicting objectives of producing a certified main line locomotive while retaining as many original components and assemblies as possible, and between the need to overhaul the locomotive {{and use it as a}} marketing tool for the museum. The report recommended that the NRM consider the scope, size and responsibilities of their project management and engineering functions, and their contracting policy.|$|E

40|$|Performance {{analysis}} of Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures {{has traditionally been}} done by assuming dumb slaves that return responses either immediately or with a fixed delay. Typical System-on-Chip architectures incorporating a NoC have high bandwidth communication to an external DRAM. In effect, the DRAM creates the performance bottleneck of the system. Correspondingly, performance analysis results that are presented without incorporating the DRAM controller and DRAM characteristics {{are likely to be}} <b>overly</b> simplistic and <b>optimistic.</b> Decisions that are made based on dumb slaves may lead to serious implications and system re-architecture late in the design cycle when actual DRAM memories fail to deliver the expected performance. Creating a DRAM model for performance analysis may also not be very practical due to the sheer complexity of the DRAM controllers, and the need to adapt to newer DRAM technologies as they emerge. This paper provides a set of necessary parameters {{that can be used to}} generate a highly abstracted DRAM controller and memory. The objective is to keep the abstraction level high enough to make development easy, and at the same time, capture the critical parameters that significantly influence the performance of the system. The values of the parameters can be obtained from the JEDEC standards for the desired DRAM memory. Based on these values, the memory model can inject transaction specific latencies. This model is expected to help system architects get a more realistic picture of their system and thus help design the NoC as part of the system as opposed to treating the NoC in isolation. 1...|$|R
40|$|In our society, {{families}} turn {{to medical}} science and health practitioners for assistance when {{a family member}} becomes disabled. In the cases of chronic illnesses and developmental disabilities, health professionals may focus interventions on the disease processes, feeling unprepared {{to deal with the}} broader issues families struggle with in managing disability. In addition, collaboration between professionals and parents may be strained when family's discourse is viewed as unrealistic, <b>overly</b> emotional, exceedingly <b>optimistic</b> and confusing by professionals. Using in-depth case studies, this qualitative research examined the daily occupations and subjective well-being of six Mexican-origin mothers parenting children with disabilities. Emergent findings demonstrated that these mothers do express apparently contradictory emotions of grief and joy, hope and fear that influenced their subjective well-being. The meaning of the mothers' contrary statements was illuminated in a life metaphor, the embrace of paradox. The embrace of paradox was the management of the internal tension of opposing forces between loving the child as he or she was and wanting to erase the disability, between dealing with the incurability while pursuing solutions and between maintaining hopefulness for the child's future while being given negative information and battling their own fears. The tensions created by the paradox promoted an internal striving to maintain a tenuous hopefulness despite "crashes" in their maternal work, and promoted an extension of maternal skills working toward a hopeful life trajectory for the mother and her child. In the embrace of paradox mothers created a positive bias and regained a sense of control that fueled their optimism in maternal work. disability occupation parent-professional collaboration...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{appropriate}} indicators to evaluate condition {{is particularly important}} for habitats like seagrass meadows where dramatic changes in distribution and species composition can occur. We used annual long-term monitoring data (2002 - 2014) to develop a report card of seagrass condition for 15 seagrass meadows at Gladstone {{as part of the}} Gladstone Healthy Harbours Partnership. The process used expert opinion to determine the best indicators of seagrass condition (above-ground biomass, meadow area, species composition), trialled four approaches to determine baseline condition of each indicator (a running longterm average, a 10 -year fixed average, and two 5 -year fixed average periods), and defined five threshold levels (very good, good, fair, poor, very poor) to grade each meadow relative to the baseline. Threshold levels for each condition category were adjusted based on the historical stability (variability) in each meadow's biomass and area. The 10 -year fixed average was the most appropriate baseline against which to evaluate changes in seagrass biomass and meadow area because this timeframe incorporated the greatest range of environmental conditions known to affect seagrass. Baselines set at 5 -year fixed average periods were biased by either El Nino or La Nina conditions, resulting in report card grades being either <b>overly</b> conservative or <b>optimistic.</b> The approach developed for Gladstone was successfully implemented in 2014 / 15 for Weipa, Karumba, Cairns, Mourilyan, Townsville and Abbot Point where annual long-term monitoring of seagrass occurs. The report card approach allows for the presentation of a large amount of spatial information for each port, including the location, condition, and the reason for each meadow's grade, to be presented within a single map. This allows for rapid comparison of seagrass condition across the range of meadows within a port, and at a broader regional scale. Planned future modifications to the program include applying statistical approaches to threshold levels and weighting meadows to give a "whole of port" grade...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{remains a}} powerful concept across European and global fields of policy-making. Spurred by the all-encompassing threat of climate change, {{the rhetoric of}} a great transformation successfully occupies current policy and practice. However, {{in contrast to the}} doom and gloom predictions, and {{in stark contrast to the}} sheer magnitude of the challenge of dealing with such complex set of problems, recent policy ideas and recipes seem trivial, and <b>overly</b> rationalised and <b>optimistic.</b> With respect to this, there are two interrelated issues that will be explored in this session. First, much of this new rationality of sustainability moults into popular labels such as ‘green’ or ‘smart’ where the city is the primary setting. This search for practical solutions in the city is further buttressed by the ‘sustainability business’ and associated green-washing practices that have emerged, as well as a variety of tools to assess, monitor, evaluate, and certify sustainability initiatives (indicators, metrics, and planning orthodoxies such as density, integrated, or holistic planning) that have become standard practice. Scholars have been active to identify the pitfalls here: Elgert & Krueger (2012) discussed the epistemology of metrics; Wiig (2015) interrogated the corporate strategy of a multi such as IBM behind ‘smart city’; Angelo & Wachsmuth (2015) criticised ‘methodological cityism’ in political ecology; Purcell (2006) showed the limits to localism; Mössner (2013) exposed socio-political limits of green cities. These criticisms highlight that there is something else to explore beyond current notions of sustainability. In this session, we explore further critiques of existing attempts, as well as conceptions of sustainability that embrace more contemporary imaginaries of urban geographies. These include critical reflections on super-optimist projects such as transition towns, or green cities (e. g. localism, methodological city-ism, green-washing in urban marketing), and thoughts on the disparity between the normative of sustainable development and current policy realities (How has this disparity changed? How is it produced? What lays outside the current lens? How has green urbanism changed over time and across places?). The second issue relates to expectations of knowledge proliferation in academia, as research communities are increasingly embedded in contradictory settings, expected to provide results and not problems, to be frank but constructive, and moreover, to be elite, excellent, income-generating as well as critical. In this respect, there is thus good reason to analyse the research-policy nexus, as Woods & Gardner (2011), Pain (2006), and Beaumont et al. (2005) have explored, examine the construction of knowledge claims as Rydin (2007) has explained, and rework some considerations with regards to rationalist modes in sustainable development and emerging sustainability modernities. We thus also want to interrogate the tensions between the construction of positivist sustainability on the one hand, and the position of the critical researcher on the other hand – the treading of the fine line between Dennis Judd’s (2005) claim that urban scholars tend to assume that “everything is always going to hell” (Judd 2005) and Elbert Hubbard’s classical “positive anything is better than negative nothing” (Hawthorne 1902). Concrete questions addressed here are: Who is producing claims to knowledge in practices of sustainable development urbanism? What are the possibilities and limitations for researchers to balance constructive interventionism with realistic limits of sustainable development and all its complexities, messy politics, wicked problems that are observed in human geography? How is it possible to pursue state-led contract work while maintaining critical integrity? What are relevant reflections the ontology, methodology and ethics of applied SD research practice...|$|R

While complex missions in Cambodia and Mozambique were ongoing, the Security Council dispatched peacekeepers to conflict zones like Somalia, where neither ceasefires nor the consent of all the parties in conflict had been secured. These operations did not have the manpower, nor were they supported by the required political will, to implement their mandates. The failures—most notably the 1994 Rwandan Genocide and the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica and Bosnia and Herzegovina—led to a period of retrenchment and self-examination in UN peacekeeping.|$|E
25|$|Although {{macroscopic}} {{concepts are}} essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics {{has been devoted to}} the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles.

The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be <b>overly</b> <b>optimistic.</b> A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one.

25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} people attempt to {{establish}} and maintain a desired personal image in social situations. People are motivated to present themselves towards others in a good light, and some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias is a representative of self-presentational processes: people want to appear more well-off than others. However, this is not through conscious effort. In a study where participants believed their driving skills would be either tested in either real-life or driving simulations, people who believed they were to be tested had less optimistic bias and were more modest about their skills than individuals who would not be tested. Studies also suggest that individuals who present themselves in a pessimistic and more negative light are generally less accepted by the rest of society. This might contribute to <b>overly</b> <b>optimistic</b> attitudes.|$|E

At the same time, RCA began selling its first television set models in various New York stores. However, the FCC had not approved the start of commercial television operations, because technical standards had not been yet been finalized.
