5|$|After {{the formal}} {{surrender}} on September 2 aboard Missouri, investigations into Japanese war crimes began quickly. At {{a meeting with}} General MacArthur later in September, Emperor Hirohito offered to take blame for the war crimes, but his <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> rejected, and he was never tried. Legal procedures for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East were issued on January 19, 1946.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with growing}} losses {{from the late}} 1990s onwards, the {{government}} offered 40percent of Biman to foreign airlines in 2004, hoping a buyer would take over {{the management of the}} carrier. However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and the <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> ignored by outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6million in consultancy fees with no positive results.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse– now art {{director}} of the Sèvres national porcelain factory– offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.|$|E
5|$|In December 1848 he {{was offered}} a post at the Jagiellonian University in Austrian-ruled Kraków, but the <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> soon {{withdrawn}} after pressure from Austrian authorities. In the winter of 1848–49, Polish composer Frédéric Chopin, in the final months of his own life, visited his ailing compatriot and soothed the poet's nerves with his piano music. Over a dozen years earlier, Chopin had set two of Mickiewicz's poems to music (see Polish songs by Frédéric Chopin).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} selling an asset on the open market. The seller receives a random sequence of price offers, which may arrive either periodically or randomly over time. After each <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> received, the seller must {{decide whether or not}} to sell, weighing the possibility of obtaining a better offer against the cost of waiting. A number of authors have established the properties of optimal selling policies when the distribution of <b>offers</b> <b>is</b> known and <b>offers</b> <b>are</b> received periodically. This paper investigates the conditions under which these same properties hold for an unknown <b>offer</b> distribution which <b>is</b> updated as successive <b>offers</b> <b>are</b> received. selling strategy, Bayesian updating, stopping rules, adaptive search...|$|R

5|$|In September 1999 Swissair, Delta, and Boeing (who had {{acquired}} McDonnell Douglas through a merger in 1997) agreed to share liability for {{the accident and}} offered {{the families of the}} passengers financial compensation.

5|$|In September 2006, Georgia {{became the}} second to be offered the Intensified Dialogue status, {{following}} a rapid change in foreign policy under President Mikheil Saakashvili, and what they perceived as a demonstration of military readiness during the 2006 Kodori crisis. Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia similarly received offers at the April 2008 Bucharest summit. While their neighbors both requested and accepted the dialogue programme, Serbia's <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> presented to guarantee the possibility of future ties with the alliance.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{returned}} to the top flight at its first attempt, and in the following years Trautmann established himself {{as one of the}} best keepers in the league, playing in all but five of his club's next 250league matches. By 1952, his fame had spread to his home country, leading Schalke 04 to offer Manchester City £1,000 for his services. The <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> refused; the club responded that they thought Trautmann to be worth twenty times more.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} search theory, this {{reasoning}} {{means that the}} same job <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> more likely to represent an above-average, high-quality offer for unemployed than for employed individuals. Technically speaking, the <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> more likely to correspond to the right tail {{of the distribution of}} wages related to the job offers that the job seekers expect to receive. Thus, the same <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> more likely to exceed their reservation wage and to be accepted by unemployed job searchers.|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, {{during the}} 1930s, the {{diplomatic}} climate between Finland and the Soviet Union gradually improved. From the 1920s, the Soviet Union had offered different non-aggression pacts with Finland {{but they were}} all rejected. Now the <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> renewed as part of a series of agreements with the countries on the Soviet Union's western border.

5|$|On June 28, the Lakers {{decided that}} they would not make Morris the $1.2 million {{qualifying}} offer prior to the July 1 deadline that would have been necessary to make him a restricted free agent. Although the team expressed interest in re-signing Morris at a lower priced contract and having him represent the team again in the summer league, he would become an unrestricted free agent at the deadline because the qualifying <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> not made.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{contract with}} ESRO lasted until 1 July 1974, when their low-Earth orbit program terminated. NTNF proposed closing Tromsø Telemetry Station as the remaining customers {{did not provide}} sufficient revenue to keep operations viable. Norway also declined to join the European Space Agency (ESA), which resulted in little hope in ESA choosing to cooperate with a Norwegian earth station. NTNF also looked into outright selling the station to ESA, but the <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> turned down. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was closed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} was cancelled {{on economic}} grounds, as the Ministry of Defence {{decided that it}} would be cheaper to use the American Scout rocket, which had a similar payload capacity, for future launches. Prior to the cancellation of Black Arrow, NASA had offered to launch British payloads for free; however, this <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn following the decision to cancel Black Arrow.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{official}} outcome from these hearings, but Congress subsequently passed a Consular Reform Bill {{which included a}} provision that specifically would not allow a diplomat, such as Magoon, to hold a separate administrative position.

Ultimately, this <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> rescinded before it could take effect, and he was instead appointed governor of Cuba.|$|E

5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she {{had probably been}} suffocated, but {{it could not be}} proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E
