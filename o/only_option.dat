5|$|A {{contract}} {{to build the}} ship that would become Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14September 1911. The design called for a staggering fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> left was increasing {{the total number of}} guns.|$|E
5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was {{to record the}} music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{worsening}} military situation {{on the evening of}} March 22, General Ngô Quang Trưởng authorised General Lâm Quang Thi to pull his forces back to Da Nang. However, as the main roads were blocked by the North Vietnamese, General Thi's <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was to use a coastal corridor between Thuan An and Tu Hien, and board transport vessels belonging to the 106th Navy Squadron and head back to Da Nang.|$|E
50|$|For the {{ordinary}} citizen though, especially in rural areas, often the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> are to cycle, walk or go by dugout canoe.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, a 1.8-litre four-cylinder E250 CGI {{model is}} available, {{as well as}} a 2.1-litre four-cylinder diesel model known as the E250 CDI. AIRSCARF and AIRCAP are the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> on the E250 models.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of object {{extraction}} (the trace is a complement of VP), theta-government is the <b>only</b> possible <b>option.</b> In {{the case of}} subject extraction (the trace in Spec-IP), antecedent-government is the <b>only</b> possible <b>option.</b>|$|R
5|$|Newman and Copland led {{the charge}} from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and {{advanced}} into the new town. The Commandos attempted {{to get through the}} narrow streets of the town and into the surrounding countryside, but were eventually surrounded. When their ammunition was expended their <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was to surrender. Not all the Commandos were captured; five men reached neutral Spain, from where they eventually returned to England.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} {{there was no immediate}} prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War but there was an immediate need for new vehicles. In the longer term, the army was expected to need at least 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E
5000|$|Since the [...] and [...] {{characters}} typically {{also serve}} other purposes at the command line, {{they may not}} be available in all scenarios, therefore, they should not be the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> to access the corresponding help information.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{continue}} {{to produce the}} Stumpjumper, which, like mountain bikes in general, has evolved significantly since 1981 and now comes in full (front and rear) suspension and hardtail (front suspension <b>only)</b> <b>options,</b> with the former named the Stumpjumper FSR.|$|R
50|$|The <b>only</b> <b>options</b> were power moonroof, power antenna, {{illuminated}} entry, keyless entry, automatic climate control, {{engine block}} heater, and a Traction-Lok axle with a 3.08 gear ratio. Total Production of 20th anniversary Cougar was 5,002, {{with at least}} 800 destined for Canada.|$|R
5|$|In the subplot, Bart cuts {{school on}} the day {{students}} were choosing their physical education classes. By the time he shows up, the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> left is ballet. Despite being reluctant at first, he soon discovers {{that he has a}} talent for the dance form, and is invited to star in a school ballet performance. After his performance, school bullies attempt to beat him up, and he runs away. Bart attempts to escape by jumping a trench, but fails to make it and takes a nasty fall. The bullies leave, while Lisa tells Bart how proud she is of him, that they are now kindred spirits.|$|E
5|$|Kemper {{was indicted}} on eight counts of {{first degree murder}} on May 7, 1973. He was {{assigned}} the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson—who had defended John Linley Frazier and also been assigned to the Herbert Mullin case—but due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was to plead {{not guilty by reason}} of insanity to the charges. Kemper twice tried to commit suicide in custody, surviving both times. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.|$|E
5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's <b>only</b> <b>option.</b> The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} {{at least}} 15 years, Dahl had to decide {{where he was going}} to study art, though the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> in Sweden at the time were an {{apprenticeship}} in the Painters' Guild or joining the Martin Hannibal and David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl group.|$|R
50|$|Until {{elementary}} schools were {{established by the}} Elementary Education Act 1870, the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> available to parents were for children to pay for tuition at private schools, or to be accepted for free charitable schools such as Ragged schools, which did not charge for attendance.|$|R
5000|$|It is a {{somewhat}} humorous forbidden fruit {{tale of the}} [...] "corruption" [...] of a society so simple that a young woman's <b>only</b> <b>options</b> are the restricted life of a religious fundamentalist or the socially isolated and [...] "cold" [...] life of a sex worker.|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the battle}} at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and a Native American confederacy had collapsed. No parties aided him and his followers. The British Band started to weaken with hunger, and Black Hawk soon {{realized}} that the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was to return across the Mississippi River. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce. They were told to wave a white flag at the militia.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns {{turned their attention to}} the infantry and subjected them to a barrage of canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his <b>only</b> <b>option</b> to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
50|$|At its 1990 redesign, the Lincoln Town Car {{was offered}} with {{relatively}} few options, with nearly all features as standard equipment. On the Signature Series, the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> were leather seat trim, a moonroof, a 10-disc CD changer, JBL sound system, security system, and onboard telephone.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{development}} environments did {{not automatically}} add a version resource in their compiled libraries, so many developers overlooked this aspect. Checking file dates, overwriting existing files or skipping the copy operation if the DLL was already installed were the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> available {{in lieu of}} correct versioning.|$|R
25|$|Tupper {{was present}} at the {{founding}} meeting of the Imperial Federation League in July 1884, where he argued against a resolution which said that the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> open to the British Empire were Imperial Federation or disintegration. Tupper believed that a form of limited federation was possible and desirable.|$|R
5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Like all French draft breeds, the Norman Cob was {{threatened}} by the advent of mechanization in farming. The <b>only</b> <b>option</b> left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman Cob avoided this, {{through the efforts of}} Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a reorientation of the Cob breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman Cob in appearance.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Alan and Joanna {{are still}} on the run, rescued by Martin who calls the AA. Whilst on their journey, they accidentally kill three more people, a mechanic, a shop {{assistant}} and a policeman. Soon, they decide that, with no transport, money or employment, the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> is suicide. They are last seen, naked, walking hand-in-hand towards the sea. Meanwhile, Karen returns to work after her fall, but has changed drastically. She has become more confident and has developed better dress sense. Boyce ends up missing Alan, after his replacement turns out to be even more horrible. With Joanna gone, the office girls start to run riot, as in The Lord of the Flies. They form their own tribe and become hostile to anyone who enters the department.|$|E
50|$|The <b>only</b> dining <b>option</b> {{along the}} entire turnpike is McDonald's.|$|R
50|$|The casino's <b>only</b> gaming <b>options</b> were slot {{and video}} poker machines.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the disks}} posed {{a problem if}} they were damaged or lost, as the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> {{at the time to}} obtain {{replacements}} was via postal mail or IBM's dialup BBS service. Without the disks, any new hardware would be completely useless and the computer would not boot at all until the unconfigured device was removed.|$|R
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue. In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant.

5|$|On 4 September, Mary Kom had {{its world}} premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where {{it became the}} first Hindi film to be {{screened}} on the opening night of the film festival. It was initially released to 1500 screens worldwide. The film was released in overseas markets by Eros International {{as part of a}} four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her own state {{would not be able to}} see her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the <b>only</b> <b>option</b> for native people to watch the film.|$|E
5|$|The French ships {{followed}} Swiftsure by tacking {{into the}} wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining {{the pressure on the}} slow moving British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the prevailing wind to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before tacking at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell could escape the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions and overwhelmed. For six hours Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards him so that by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his <b>only</b> <b>option</b> was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E
50|$|The Chevrolet Epica is {{no longer}} sold in Canada as of September 2006. For the last year, a single version was sold: the LTZ at $26650. This unique trim level being fully loaded, <b>only</b> <b>options</b> were the side airbags and the Pearl White color. Some colors are unique to 2006: silver and {{charcoal}} grey.|$|R
50|$|After Elizabeth {{had endured}} a {{prolonged}} labor, Dr. Humphrey and Bennett determined the <b>only</b> <b>options</b> were a Caesarean section on Elizabeth or a craniotomy on the unborn infant. Dr. Humphrey {{refused to do}} anything, feeling that either operation meant certain death for both the mother and her infant. It appears Dr. Humphrey then left the Bennett home.|$|R
50|$|Many {{attempts}} to mediate {{were made by}} many parties, but all failed when the masters refused to accept any compromise.Eventually the masters realised {{that if they did}} not negotiate, their <b>only</b> <b>options</b> would be to suspend or close their businesses, thus delaying contracts and facing at the best losing the orders and at the worst contractual penalties.|$|R
