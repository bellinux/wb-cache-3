5|$|An example {{he gives}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> obtaining missing data from drug {{companies}} {{is that of}} oseltamivir (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu. Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based {{in large part on}} a meta-analysis that was funded by the industry. Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.|$|E
5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E

5|$|At {{the front}} of the house, on the ground floor, is a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have {{conducted}} his mercantile business. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork. A hallway runs along one side of the hall; hallways were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> lighting them effectively. At the rear of the property is an inner private room, with a decorative ceiling. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick floor is 18th-century in origin, however. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E
5|$|Sugar {{also led}} to some {{industrialization}} of areas where sugar cane was grown. For example, Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal establishment, persuaded the British Government that sugar cane could be cultivated in British India with many advantages and at less expense than in the West Indies; as a result, sugar factories were established in Bihar in eastern India. During the Napoleonic Wars, sugar beet production increased in continental Europe because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> importing sugar when shipping was subject to blockade. By 1880, the sugar beet was {{the main source of}} sugar in Europe. It was cultivated in Lincolnshire and other parts of England, although the United Kingdom continued to import the main part of its sugar from its colonies.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> conserving B.brownii in {{its present}} disease-exposed locations, it is an {{especially}} suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of B.brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that {{would otherwise have been}} lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown {{more than three times the}} rate of those in the wild. A 2007 seedling flowered for the first time at Wakehurst Place in February 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 a jadeitite axehead {{was found}} {{alongside}} the track; {{it is thought}} to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in mint condition) have also been made.|$|E
