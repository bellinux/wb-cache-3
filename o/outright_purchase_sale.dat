25|$|In the U.S., the Federal Reserve most {{commonly}} uses overnight repurchase agreements (repos) to temporarily create money, or reverse repos to temporarily destroy money, which offset temporary {{changes in the}} level of bank reserves. The Federal Reserve also makes <b>outright</b> <b>purchases</b> and <b>sales</b> of securities through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) with its manager over the Trading Desk at the New York Reserve Bank. The trade of securities in the SOMA changes the balance of bank reserves, which also affects short-term interest rates. The SOMA manager is responsible for trades that result in a short-term interest rate near the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or create money by the <b>outright</b> <b>purchase</b> of securities. More rarely will it permanently destroy money by the outright sale of securities. These trades are made with a group of about 22 banks and bond dealers called primary dealers.|$|R

40|$|This article {{compares the}} costs and {{benefits}} for the government of leasing vis-a-vis <b>outright</b> <b>purchase</b> of motor vehicles. It presents two methods through which public managers can estimate and assess the value of procuring motor vehicles either under lease payment or direct purchase. Using data from selected government agencies, the net present values generated suggest that <b>outright</b> <b>purchase</b> of low-end vehicles is preferable to leasing. For high-end models, leasing offers a more practical option. The findings, however, are far from conclusive because assumptions regarding the variables and input data are subject to change. Results can be significantly improved with better and more accurate statistics. To gain sufficient understanding of the issue, factors other than those covered by the study, i. e., economies of scale and entry of commercial banks, must also be explored...|$|R
