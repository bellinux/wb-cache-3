5|$|Early in his career, Rosenthal {{learned the}} Transcendental Meditation {{technique}} while in South Africa, {{but found that}} as a medical student and a medical resident he didn't have time to practice. Then 35 years later, after one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patients</b> had a dramatic improvement {{as a result of}} TM, he began practicing again and then began recommending it to his patients. In 2011, he published , which debuted at number seven on the New York Times' Best Sellers: Hardcover Advice, How-To And Miscellaneous list. Earlier that year, Rosenthal published preliminary research on the potential influence of TM on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.|$|E
5|$|When {{he learned}} of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of Winkler County, who was his friend and one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patients.</b> Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the medical board {{constituted}} harassment. The sheriff investigated and obtained the TMB complaint, which provided enough information about Mitchell and Galle to make them identifiable. Galle and Mitchell were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of official information. Galle's charges were dropped before trial and Mitchell was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a hospital administrator all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against the nurses.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in charge}} of the Constantinople hospital, he {{attempted}} to elope with one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patients,</b> but was captured and tried for breach of conduct, as the female patient was in fact the wife of a Turkish officer. While being deported to Canada, Harrison escaped while his ship was docked in Morocco. Making his way to Ireland, Harrison posed as a Catholic and joined the Free State Army. After he was discovered, he quickly crossed to Wales to treat the coal miners there for silicosis. In 1923 Harrison married his fourth wife, Eva Olwen Bowen in Cardiff, still without divorcing his three previous wives, and set off with her on an adventure in the Caribbean. It is thought that Harrison deserted her sometime in the mid-1920s. During the 1930s Harrison worked in 15 countries and dependencies across Latin America and the Middle East. For one year, he served as the physician for a guerrilla army fighting the Japanese, who were then engaged in the Second Sino-Japanese War with China. After 1938, Harrison traveled to Shanghai using borrowed funds from a medical school classmate in Jamaica and from his own brother in Ontario, and set up a private medical practice, assisting the Chinese Red Cross wherever possible.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Cadbury {{was also}} one of the few doctors known to {{rehabilitate}} both the mind and the body <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patients.</b> Genuinely concerned for the wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patients,</b> he was known to check on them and wear his stethoscope at all times. Those around him observed that he was a very knowledgeable, highly skilled, and effective doctor. Over the years, he became the most well-known internist in Canton. He tried to emulate William Osler, who was a famous internist in the 1800s. In 1913, he was named the principal doctor for the Canton Hospital. Then, in 1914, he joined the specialized medical staff of Canton Hospital.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Adams {{was arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of murdering two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patients.</b> At that time Gwynne was Chairman of the Magistrates in Lewes, East Sussex, and had to step down from the committal hearing owing to a conflict of interest.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the psychoanalytically-oriented therapist's experience of identifying, differentiating and processing the patient's transference-based and reality-oriented reactions. In order to investigate the therapist's lived experience of being receptive to the total communication of the patient in the analytic situation, the researcher adopted the empirical phenomenological method. This descriptive and intuitive method grounded the researcher in the concreteness of the everyday life-world of the therapist, and enabled him to explicate the therapist's immediate, pre-theoretical experiences <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patient.</b> The appropriate central research question, formulated to elicit the experience of this phenomenon, emerged through the process of enquiry during the pilot study. Thirteen experienced, psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapists were interviewed and the five protocols considered most revelatory of the phenomenon under investigation were analyzed in detail. The remaining eight protocols were used to illuminate central themes and to clarify areas of uncertainty during the phase of formal explication. The central findings revealed that the oscillating process of the therapist as he shifts from being immersed in the world <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> to being in a position of observation and self reflection is the fulcrum around which he evaluates the nature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> communications. During this ongoing process of discrimination, living in duality, the therapist comes to experience himself as a <b>patient</b> scrutinized by <b>his</b> own and <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> confrontations. <b>His</b> journey <b>of</b> disentanglement, the endeavour to differentiate his responses from <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> actions, is dependent on his ability to engage in honest selfreflection and to access his pre-theoretical and articulated cognitions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patient.</b> This allows him to acknowledge his own role in what has unfolded interpersonally and to appropriate his previously denied feelings for and attitudes towards <b>his</b> <b>patient,</b> a prerequisite for the accurate and full appraisal of the nature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> communications. Forsaking fixed judgements, the therapist becomes open to the confluence between the reality-oriented responses and transference-based reactions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patient.</b> This salient discovery, when dialogued with the literature, reinforced the theories of Greenson and Langs that not all the interactions between the patient and the analyst/therapist are transference-based and that it is therefore imperative that the analyst/therapist reflect on his participation in the analytic situation. ...|$|R

25|$|Hackett's Booker T. Washington Memorial Hospital {{began to}} suffer {{economically}} when a nearby maternity hospital expanded {{to become a}} full-service facility.

Poirot suspects, however, that there is more to the case than at first appears, and soon events confirm his worst suspicions.|$|E

25|$|Berger's first {{recording}} device was very rudimentary.

Berger connected these sensors to a Lippmann capillary electrometer, with disappointing results. However, more sophisticated measuring devices, such as the Siemens double-coil recording galvanometer, which displayed electric voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt, led to success.|$|E

Dallas attorney Patrick McLain, a former Marine, said that Hasan may have been legally justified in his request, {{but he could not}} comment without knowing what soldiers had said.

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patients</b> {{after the}} Battle of Borodino in 1812 was an {{infantry}} officer whose arm {{had to be}} amputated at the shoulder.

On his arrival {{at his home in}} France the dressing was removed and the wound found to be healed. Larrey concluded that the fact that the wound had been undisturbed had facilitated healing. After the war, Larrey began stiffening bandages using camphorated alcohol, lead acetate and egg whites beaten in water.|$|E
25|$|Brehmer and one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>patients,</b> Peter Dettweiler, became proponents for the {{sanatorium}} movement, and by 1877, sanatoriums {{began to}} spread beyond Germany and throughout Europe.
