Specific tasks performed by the independent verification team (IVT) to satisfy this objective included: 1) performing radiological walkover surveys, and 2) collecting soil samples for independent analyses. The independent verification (IV) efforts were designed to evaluate radioactive contaminants (specifically U- 238) in the exposed surfaces below <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the original site grade, given that the top <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> layer <b>of</b> soil on the site was removed in its entirety...|$|R
40|$|We {{used the}} {{groundwater}} availability model (GAM) {{for the northern}} part of the Trinity aquifer to estimate drawdowns in Lampasas County and surrounding counties resulting from incrementally increased pumping rates. We estimated drawdowns after fifty years of pumping for both average and drought-of-record recharge conditions. We noted the following observations based on the results. • Maintaining 1999 pumpage patterns for a 50 -year simulation leads to zero to twenty <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water-level drawdowns in Lampasas County by 2050. • Increasing pumping in only Lampasas County leads to approximately <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> additional drawdown per 10 percent additional pumping (when the pumping is increased up to 200 percent). • Increasing pumping model-wide leads to approximately <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> additional drawdown per one percent additional pumping (when the pumping is increased up to 50 percent). • About 50 percent of the additional water for increased pumping in (only) Lampasas County is derived from storage, about 35 percent from reduce...|$|R

Anglers may employ spin casting equipment, but more often opt for fly-fishing in their hunt.|$|R
