40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that {{metropolitan}} trial courts have far larger case-loads than other courts. These loads differ in substance from those of nonmetropolitan courts, being disproportionately weighted with special types of cases, such as criminal, mental, alcoholic, traffic, domestic relations cases, and litigation otherwise related to the special behavior of metropolitan populations. Metropolitan court systems usually are complex, overlapping, and not adjusted to the geo graphic area to be served. Because of the special structural patterns of metropolitan courts, and the special conditions under which they <b>operate,</b> <b>delay</b> in disposing of cases is espe cially and predominantly a metropolitan court problem. In these courts, ever increasing pressure {{to speed up the}} tempo of justice is balanced by the need to avoid perfunctory routine disposition, so as to defeat the very purpose of seeking justice. To overcome both aspects of this leering monster—delay and perfunctory routine—is the special problem of metropolitan courts...|$|E

This paper proposes a non-model-based design approach for pneumatic actuating systems. In the proposed control system, a gain scheduled fuzzy-PID controller ensures tracking performance an adaptable wavelet neuro compensator compensates for time-delay of the control valve, and a disturbance rejecter diminishes influence from load changes.

30|$|The {{frequency}} dependent {{phase domain}} models available in PSCAD {{were used to}} simulate the cables and transmission lines. The simulation time step used is 10 μs. The MMCs connected to Buses 1, 2 and 3 were modeled with decoupled controls and converter transformers. It was assumed that basic fault protection is provided using the ROCOV based protection proposed in [9]. In this scheme, each line/cable section is protected using DC circuit breakers, and di/dt limiting inductors (also referred to as terminal inductors) placed at either end [24]. These di/dt limiting terminal inductors (values given in Table  1) relax the DC circuit breaker requirement and considered as vital for DC breaker application [24]. In simulations, the hybrid DC breaker model described in [6] was used with 2  ms <b>operating</b> <b>delay</b> and a maximum breaker current of 8 kA as in [9].

40|$|Abstract—Broadcast {{communication}} is a dominant communication pattern in WSN. As a major security concern, the broadcast source authentication {{is needed to}} mitigate impersonation of a broadcast source, modifications of its broadcasted data, or depletion of the limited energy of sensors caused by an attacker injecting useless broadcast traffic. Several Broadcast Source Authentication Protocols (BSAPs) were proposed in the literature. One class of them is time asymmetry-based BSAPs like µTESLA [1] protocol. These BSAPs <b>operate</b> <b>delayed</b> key-disclosure to secure broadcast communications, but they suffer from a kind of DoS attack, called resource-draining attack, in which an attacker floods the network with fake messages that all sensors of the network buffer and forward, then later verify, thus causing buffer overflow and batteries depletion. In this paper we propose the H 2 BSAP protocol, to overcome this kind of DoS attacks, by achieving a hop-by-hop authentication of broadcasted messages, thus limiting the damage of an attacker to its one-hop neighbors only, instead of the entire network.

40|$|Target is a {{real time}} gross {{settlement}} (RTGS) large value payment network operated by European central banks that eliminates systemic risk. Euro 1 is a privately <b>operated</b> <b>delayed</b> net settlement (DNS) network that reduces substantially systemic risk but does not eliminate it. This difference makes RTGS networks more expensive to users even if both networks had the same unit operating costs. This provides an incentive for users to shift payments to the more risky network in normal times and back to Target in times of financial market disruption. The estimated extra cost to a DNS network from posting collateral sufficient to cover all exposures (and eliminate systemic risk) is from 15 to 42 cents per transaction. If full cost recovery on an RTGS system were reduced by this amount, user collateral costs — but not risks — would be equalized between networks. Full collateralization on DNS networks would equalize both user costs and risks. payments, settlement, public good...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a number of}} generic sleep mechanisms for energy saving at the vehicular roadside units (RSUs). Since random sleep cycles (sleep cycles type-I) were already introduced before, we term the introduced mechanisms sleep cycles (type-II, III, IV, V, VI). Each sleep cycles type arranges the service and sleep sequences distinctively to yield various levels of energy savings and average packet delay. A generic analytic model for the roadside unit (RSU) with such sleep cycles is proposed using G/G/ 1 /K G-vacation queuing, where real vehicular traffic profiles and packet size measurements are utilised. The performance evaluation reveals that {{with one of the}} proposed sleep cycles (type-IV), the RSU achieves 68 % energy savings and 7. 3 ms average packet delay over the day, resulting in respective improvements of 10 % and 28 % compared to the existing random sleep cycles. These improvements have been achieved under a very conservative <b>operating</b> <b>delay</b> bound for audio conferencing applications. However, modern compression and codecs, due to their leniency on Quality of Service (QoS), would potentially enable higher energy savings through the proposed sleep cycles...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of some algorithms, {{running on a}} message passing computer; {{is limited by the}} high latency of global communications. To increase the performance, a simple open collector bus, <b>operated</b> by <b>delay</b> insensitive programs running on each processor can be used. We illustrate this by an example: the constraint algorithm SHAKE as used in Constraint Molecular Dynamics (M. D.) simulation. We present a parallelizable SHAKE algorithm and show how it can be implemented on a ring architecture. On a large ring the use of message passing to synchronize SHAKE iterations may take up to 40 % of the total time. We show how the communication time can be reduced by adding a very simple open collector bus, <b>operated</b> by a <b>delay</b> insensitive algorithm. In this way the time spent on the synchronization of SHAKE iterations will be negligible. We want to emphasize that this kind of open collector bus can be used with many delay insensitive algorithms. To show this we will mention other possible applications. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The work {{presented}} {{is related}} to the domain of the distributed monitoring of discrete event systems and deals with the problem of the distributed detection of a failure symptom in complex processes. The proposed architecture is based on autonomous and co-operative monitoring sites allowing monitoring process evolutions. These evolutions represent either the expected operating (normal) of the system or failure situations. Each evolution is composed of a set of events and a set of time constraints between these events. An evolution is recognised if all the constraints composing it are verified considering durations separating events occurrences associated with it. The distribution of the time model represented by an evolution induces the distribution of the events occurrences and then of the constraints to verify on several monitoring sites (diagnosers). This distribution generates two types of constraints: the local constraints and the global constraints. Communication or <b>operating</b> <b>delays</b> between sites are bounded and are taken into account while verifying a global time constraint. The uncertainty induced by these delays generates an uncertainty on the verification that results in a possibility measure associated with constraint verification. A refinement of the detection results is introduced by co-operation mechanisms between monitoring sites and by the evolution of the recognition process...|$|R

40|$|Improvement in {{efficiency}} of healthcare in the United States is an urgent issue. Information technology {{is seen as}} one of key solutions to improve efficiency. As such, hospitals in the United States are rapidly adopting information technology. However, past studies on information technology development projects in other industries have documented a very high rate of failure, typically attributable {{to the lack of}} treatment of organizational and behavioral factors. These studies placed their focus on the development phase of information technology projects but very few studied the performance of installed information systems and factors affecting their performance. In our study, we developed an analytical framework to measure the performance of an existing information system and to identify determinants of its performance based on the Performance of Routine Information System Management Framework by MEASURE Evaluation Project, United States Agency for International Development. Performance is defined as the quality of data and the use of information an information system generates. Technical, behavioral, and organizational factors are considered as determinants of Performance. (cont.) We evaluated the performance of an information system which records <b>operating</b> room <b>delays</b> and their causes at a large teaching hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The study was carried out between January 2007 and April 2007. The data on <b>operating</b> room <b>delays</b> from fiscal year 2006 were used to assess the data quality. Our study found poor quality of data and a low level of use of information. Data quality was poor in terms of accuracy and relevance and very few people used the information that the system generated for decision-making. The performance of the information system was influenced by 1) technical factors such as the confusing structure of data variables and the application design, 2) organizational factors such as the lack of a defined purpose for the information system in <b>operating</b> room <b>delay</b> management and the lack of supervision and training, and 3) behavioral factors such as diminished motivation for gathering accurate information for the information system. Finally, we proposed a set of recommendations to improve the performance of the information system. by Dairiku Hozumi. Thesis (S. M.)

Mackenzie et al. 10 showed an association between delay to surgery and mortality follow-ing hip fracture in patients who were unfit for surgery but failed to find an association in those patients whose opera-tion was delayed for administrative reasons (8470 patients). Until recently, guidelines from both the Royal College of Physicians 11 and the British Orthopaedic Association 12 rec-ommended that patients be operatively stabilised within 24 h. More recent guidelines require that hospitals dealing with orthopaedic trauma have daily dedicated trauma lists performed that are consultant-led 13 and have extended the operative window to 48 h. 14 A study in 2005 found that orthopaedic trauma list provision does not meet this nation-al standard of dedicated consultant-led trauma lists. 15 No study has examined whether hospitals with large numbers of dedicated orthopaedic trauma lists treat patients with fractured neck of femur more quickly and with fewer complications than those with fewer lists.
