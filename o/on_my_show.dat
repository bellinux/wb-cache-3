5000|$|Many of the comedians {{were also}} close friends, and {{mutually}} {{making fun of}} each other was {{a large part of}} the show. Part of Quinns highly unusual approach was not to edit out jokes which fell flat, often leading to uncomfortable pauses, which were enjoyed by fans of the Cringe comedy style, but which may have appeared awkward to the mainstream television audience. Quinn also reprimanded guests who attempted to gain cheap applause from the audience. [...] For example, if a comedian made a general blanket statement which wasnt particularly funny, but elicited applause nonetheless, Quinn would berate the comedian for being sanctimonious and pandering. One of the shows running jokes, which occurred in numerous episodes, was that at some point, one of the comedians would insult Quinn over what he was wearing. Very often, the comedians would also insult each other over clothing choices, hairstyles or weight issues.
