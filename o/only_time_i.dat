He quickly regretted the move, and despite getting along well with manager Frank Barlow he found himself hating everything at the club, from the supporters to the Old Showground itself.|$|E
500|$|J.D. Shapiro, {{who wrote}} the {{original}} screenplay, was critical of the film as well. In a 2010 letter to The New York Post, he asserted that his draft bore {{little resemblance to the}} final script; the result, he said, was embarrassing: [...] "The <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw the movie was at the premiere, which was one too many times."

This melody stuck though, and it formed the basis of the entire song." ...|$|R
500|$|Holly's {{pregnant}} wife, María Elena, {{learned of}} his death from the reports on television. A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a miscarriage shortly after, reportedly due to [...] "psychological trauma". Holly's mother, on hearing the news on the radio at home in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. María Elena Holly {{did not attend the}} funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour.

500|$|... "Jugband Blues" [...] {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as [...] "Vegetable Man". Both songs contain the same cynical humour, but while on [...] "Vegetable Man" [...] Barrett focuses his humour on himself, on [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] it is {{directed}} towards those around him. [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] was recorded on 19 October 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios. Barrett wanted a Salvation Army band to play on the track. He told them he wanted them to simply [...] "play whatever they want" [...] regardless {{of the rest of the}} group, while Norman Smith insisted on recorded parts. Eventually both versions were recorded and used. About The Salvation Army, band manager Andrew King said that Barrett [...] "wanted a massive Salvation Army freak-out, but that's the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> can remember Norman [...] putting his foot down." [...] The song features a distinctive three-tiered structure: starting off in 3/4 meter, then into 2/4 and finishing off in 4/4.|$|E
500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me.

[...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out {{when it was time to}} review the album.

500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime: Nimoy reprises {{the role}} of the older Spock from the {{original}} Star Trek timeline, credited as [...] "Spock Prime". He was a longtime friend of Abrams' parents, but became better acquainted with Abrams during filming. Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock. Abrams and the writers met Nimoy at his house; writer Roberto Orci recalled that the actor gave a Who are you guys and what are you up to?' vibe" [...] before being told how important he was to them. He was silent, and Nimoy's wife Susan Bay told the creative team he had remained in his chair after their conversation, emotionally overwhelmed by his decision after turning down many opportunities to revisit the role. Had Nimoy disliked the script, production would have been delayed for it to be rewritten. Nimoy later said, [...] "This is the first and <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever had a filmmaker say, 'We cannot make this film without you and we won't make it without you'". He was [...] "genuinely excited" [...] by the script's scope and its detailing of the characters' backstories, saying, [...] "We have dealt with , but never with quite the overview that this script has of the entire history of the character, the growth of the character, the beginnings of the character and the arrival of the character into the Enterprise crew." [...] Abrams commented, [...] "It was surreal to direct him as Spock, because what the hell am I doing there? This guy has been doing it for forty years. It's like 'I think Spock would...|$|E

According to author Jason Bailey, [...] "Quentin {{thought it would be}} funny to have this casual {{observer}} who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over.

60|$|Drink as I would, I couldn't come to like John Barleycorn. I valued him {{extremely}} well for his associations, {{but not for}} the taste of him.

But I would have died before I'd let anybody guess it. I used to indulge in lonely debauches, on nights when I knew my crew was going to sleep ashore. I would go up to the Free Library, exchange my books, buy a quarter's worth of all sorts of candy that chewed and lasted, sneak aboard the Razzle Dazzle, lock myself in the cabin, go to bed, and lie there long hours of bliss, reading and chewing candy. And those were the <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> felt that I got my real money's worth. Dollars and dollars, across the bar, couldn't buy the satisfaction that twenty-five cents did in a candy store.|$|R
2500|$|King {{entered the}} Glasgow School of Art in 1941. She {{spent three years}} there. She said of this time: “I was very happy in Glasgow.

2500|$|Francis {{acknowledged}} that he carried his emphasis on mercy too far when he reduced the penalty of a pedophile priest from imprisonment to a lifetime of prayer and being barred from saying Mass or being near children, along with five years of psychotherapy.

It was the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> really had fun." [...] In moving to Chelsea, Gullit played an important part in the [...] "foreign revolution" [...] as numerous high-profile international stars, such as the Italian superstar Gianfranco Zola who became a Chelsea legend, and the Dutch magician Dennis Bergkamp, joined FA Premier League clubs and helped to increase its worldwide profile.|$|E

He took several photographs and conducted interviews with witnesses. His former wife Bonnie Milslagle later reported that all but one roll of the film were confiscated by military personnel. WHJB office manager Mabel Mazza described one of the pictures: [...] "It was very dark and it was with a lot of trees around and everything. And I don't know how far away from the site he was.

2500|$|This novel caused Adams {{to become}} acquainted with the {{well-known}} scientist Richard Dawkins.

He replied {{that he was a}} fan of my books, and he invited me to his house in London." [...] Adams would later introduce Dawkins to the woman who was to become his third wife, the actress Lalla Ward, best known for playing the character Romana in Doctor Who. One of her early serials on the programme was City of Death, which Adams wrote, and which shares certain plot elements with the novel.|$|E
2500|$|After his retirement, O'Neal {{was hired}} by Turner Sports as an NBA analyst.

I've walked many walks in my 19-year career, so I think any criticism that I give should be fair." [...] During the 2011 NBA lockout, Bryant discussed his problems with O'Neal with a radio station in Italy, saying [...] "I like players who workout. I used to do that 6–7 hours per day.

The AP article also said [...] "Renzi made much of his money while living in Burke, Virginia, about 20 minutes from downtown Washington.

2500|$|Against all expectation, Grace {{produced}} in 1895 a season {{that has been}} called his [...] "Indian Summer". He completed his hundredth century playing for Gloucestershire against Somerset in May. Charles Townsend, his batting partner {{when he reached the}} milestone, said that as he approached his hundred: [...] "This was the one and <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever saw him flustered..." [...] Eventually Sammy Woods bowled a full toss which Grace drove for four to reach his century. He then went on to score 1,000 runs in the month, the first time this had ever been done, with scores of 13, 103, 18, 25, 288, 52, 257, 73 not out, 18 and 169 totalling 1,016 runs between 9 and 30 May. His aggregate for the whole season was 2,346 at an average of 51.00 with nine centuries. He was aged forty-six {{at the start of the}} season. Following his [...] "Indian Summer", Grace was the sole recipient of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year award for 1896, the first of only three times that Wisden has restricted the award to a single player, there being normally five recipients.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1995, Cuomo had {{extensive}} surgery {{to extend his}} left leg, which was 44mm shorter than the right. This involved the surgical breaking of the leg bone, followed by months of wearing a steel brace and painful physiotherapy sessions; the procedure affected his songwriting, as he would spend long periods hospitalized {{under the influence of}} painkillers. At the end of 1995, Cuomo enrolled in Harvard University to study classical composition. His right leg was still in a brace following surgery, and he required a cane to walk; he described it as [...] "like having, I think, about seven arrows lodged into your leg bone, and then having to walk around with them lodged in like that for thirteen months, with only Advil." [...] Between classes, Cuomo took painkillers, rested in bed, and listened to opera. He told The New York Times: [...] "The <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> could write songs was when my frozen dinner was in the microwave. The rest of the time I was doing homework." [...] He auditioned for the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum chorus but was not selected.
