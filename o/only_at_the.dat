5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E

5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of republicanism to the {{political}} mainstream started <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, most of the states in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected head of state.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no matter where it is speculated to be, if Planet Nine exists, then its mass is higher than what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates {{the outer edge of}} the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a planet by current definitions. Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> smallest size and farthest distance was it on the border of being called a dwarf planet. Margot himself says that Planet Nine satisfies the quantitative criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, Planet Nine will qualify as a planet—if and when it is detected.|$|E
5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fringes of jackal territory. Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets, with the jackal being three times bigger than the red fox. The red fox will avoid close {{proximity}} with jackals, and fox populations decrease where jackals are abundant. Striped hyenas prey on golden jackals, and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> elbow.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, theatre {{director}} Peter Sellars {{released his}} only feature film, The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez, an experimental film {{loosely based on}} Caligari. However, the storyline was created as the film was being made, so it has few similarities with the original film. The film was screened <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1992 Sundance Film Festival and never theatrically released.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Congress {{changed the}} name of the Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with the law specifying that no money be spent to {{implement}} the name change. As a result, WMATA did not change {{the name of the}} National Airport Station (which never included the full name of the airport). In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> request of the local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Nova Scotia Legislature {{declared}} the Sable Island Horse {{as one of}} the provincial symbols, making them the official horse of Nova Scotia.

Aside from the island, Sable Island Horses live <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Shubenacadie Wildlife Park in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. It maintains descendants of Sable Island Ponies removed from the island in the 1950s by the Canadian Department of Transport.|$|E

5|$|Medieval: Total War {{features}} a multiplayer game mode {{similar to that}} in Shogun: Total War, where players can engage in real-time battles with up to seven other players. Players create and control armies from the factions available in the game, where players can use them to compete in online tournaments or casual battles. The campaign mode cannot be played multiplayer; this feature was later added to the Total War series in Empire: Total War – but <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beta stage, before being later removed.|$|E
5|$|None of the Peace dollar mintages are {{particularly}} rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for {{little more than}} the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The prices for the 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced and many were saved. In contrast the 1934-S dollar was not saved in great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.|$|E
