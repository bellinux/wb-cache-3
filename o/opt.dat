However, at present this shortage is more acute than ever before. Post mortem kidney procurement policies can be distinguished into 'opting in' and 'opting out' systems. In the five countries cooperating in Eurotransplant, systems of both kind have been implemented. In this paper the relation between these procurement policies and kidney availability in the Eurotransplant region is examined. The <b>opting</b> out system turns out to be more favourable to kidney procurement than the <b>opting</b> in system. The approach of the next of kin with the donation question happens to be an important barrier for kidney procurement in the <b>opting</b> in system, but fails to appear under <b>opting</b> out. In the epilogue some remarks are made on the possibilities of introduction of the <b>opting</b> out system in countries now applying <b>opting</b> in. transplantation kidney procurement policy transplants in Europe...|$|R

5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot <b>opt</b> out of the categorical imperative because we cannot <b>opt</b> out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
