5|$|Increased federal {{spending}} {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> in the 1930s led {{to the construction of}} new government buildings, memorials, and museums in Washington. World War II further increased government activity, adding to the number of federal employees in the capital; by 1950, the District's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, McNary {{supported}} the development of federal hydroelectric power dams, and in 1933, he introduced legislation {{that led to the}} building of the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams on the Columbia, as public works projects. He voted for the US joining the World Court in 1926. He favored buying more National Forest lands, reforestation, fire protection for forests via the Clarke–McNary Act, and farm support. Although vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill was the forerunner of the farm legislation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Charles Linza McNary (June 12, 1874February 25, 1944) was a United States Republican {{politician}} from Oregon. He {{served in}} the Senate from 1917 to 1944 and was Senate Minority Leader from 1933 to 1944. In the Senate, McNary helped to pass legislation {{that led to the}} construction of Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, and worked on agricultural and forestry issues. He also supported many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> programs {{at the beginning of the}} Great Depression. Until Mark O. Hatfield surpassed his mark in 1993, he was Oregon's longest-serving senator.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Eloise Kirkpatrick Dilling (April 19, 1894 – May 26, 1966) was an American {{writer and}} {{political}} activist. In 1934, she published The Red Network—A Who's Who and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots, which catalogs over 1,300 suspected communists and their sympathizers. Her books and lecture tours established {{her as the}} pre-eminent female right-wing activist of the 1930s, {{and one of the}} most outspoken critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the House of Representatives, Voorhis was a loyal {{supporter}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> and {{compiled a}} liberal voting record. His major legislative achievement was the Voorhis Act of 1940 requiring registration of certain organizations controlled by foreign powers. After being re-elected by comfortable margins four times, he faced Nixon in 1946 {{in a bitter}} campaign in which Voorhis' supposed endorsement by groups linked to the Communist Party {{was made into a}} major issue. Nixon won the Republican-leaning district by over 15,000 votes and Voorhis refused to run against Nixon in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Moran, {{the eldest}} of seven children, was born in Buffalo, New York, {{and grew up in}} Natick, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. His parents were Dorothy (née Dwyer) and James Moran Sr., a {{professional}} football player for the Boston Redskins in 1935 and 1936; outside of football he worked as a probation officer. Both his father and mother were Roosevelt Democrats and supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal.</b> Moran attended Marian High School in Framingham, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2010, Dunderdale {{along with}} Ministers Kennedy and Marshall joined the NLMA {{president}} {{to announce that}} a tentative agreement between the provincial government and doctors had been reached. The offer included 100percent Atlantic Canadian parity within {{the first two years}} of the agreement, pay equity for salaried specialists, and retention bonuses for fee-for-service rural physicians. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>deal,</b> the 13 of the 14 doctors who tendered their resignations en masse in November rescinded their resignations.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not. In particular, movies {{were subject to}} a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was Life magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.|$|E

50|$|After {{his narrow}} reelection to the Senate in 1944, {{defeating}} Republican Lieutenant Governor Frederick F.

5|$|When he {{was made}} aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>deal,</b> Waylon was {{not sure if he}} should quit his gig at JD's. He then went to get the advice of his friend, RCA artist Willie Nelson, who had gone to see one of Waylon's shows. When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|On October 9, 1939, {{following}} the death of Senator Logan, Chandler resigned as governor, elevating Lieutenant Governor Keen Johnson to the governorship; the following day, Johnson appointed Chandler to Logan's vacated seat in the Senate. In a subsequent special election to fill the remainder of the unexpired term, Chandler first defeated Charles R. Farnsley in the Democratic primary, then bested Republican Walter B. Smith by a vote of 561,151 to 401,812 in the November 5, 1940, general election. Although he never forgave President Roosevelt for backing Barkley in the 1938 senatorial primary, he generally supported his administration, although he opposed parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold {{starting}} in the 1880s, and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants {{in return for their}} votes. But the Great Depression {{starting in}} 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.|$|E

50|$|His {{work and}} {{practice}} is known {{because of its}} inclusion in Mary Granger's Drums and Shadows (1940), a book of ethnography conducted under <b>the</b> auspices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal's</b> Federal Writers' Project.

5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|The bids {{from private}} {{companies}} were {{heavily influenced by}} the legislation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal.</b> The Vinson-Trammell Act limited profit from a ship's construction to 10percent, while the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act specified a minimum wage and required working conditions for workers. The latter act greatly affected {{the ability of the}} navy to acquire steel, as the text of the law caused friction between executives in the industry, who greatly disliked the forty-hour work week and minimum wage requirements, and their workers—who themselves were embroiled in a separate dispute pitting the union of the skilled workers, the American Federation of Labor, against the union of the unskilled, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Amid the unrest, the navy ran into difficulties trying to acquire 18million pounds of steel to build six destroyers and three submarines; many more pounds than this would be needed for the new battleships.|$|E

50|$|In 1930, {{due to the}} {{interest}} and foresight of John Lovell, a new Chattanooga Airport was established with an unpaved runway at its present location and was named Lovell Field in his honor. In 1936, the landing area was expanded and runways paved as a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal’s</b> Works Progress Administration (WPA). The original terminal building was also built at that time.|$|R

25|$|Co-operating with Conservative Democrats, {{he led the}} Conservative Coalition that {{opposed the}} New Deal.
