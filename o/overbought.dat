60|$|He had {{the touch}} of comedy which makes pathos endurable, but another {{incident}} was wholly pathetic. As {{we came out of}} an antiquity shop near the cathedral one afternoon we found on the elevated footway near the Gate of Pardon a mother and daughter, both of the same second youth, who gently and jointly pronounced to us the magical word encajes. Rather, they questioned us with it, and they only suggested, very forbearingly, that we should come to their house with them to see those laces, which of course were old laces; their house was quite near. But that one of us twain who was singly concerned in encajes had fatigued and perhaps <b>overbought</b> herself at the antiquity shop, and she signified a regret which they divined too well was dissent. They looked rather than expressed a keen little disappointment; the mother began a faint insistence, but the daughter would not suffer it. Here was the pride of poverty, if not poverty itself, and it was with a pang that we parted from these mutely appealing ladies. We could not have borne it if we had not instantly promised ourselves to come the next day and meet them and go home with them and buy all their encajes that we had money for. We kept our promise, and we came the next day and the next and every day we remained in Seville, and lingered so long that we implanted in the cabmen beside the curbing the inextinguishable belief that we were in need of a cab; but we never saw those dear ladies again.|$|E

30|$|This study investigates five popular {{technical}} indicators. The first two, namely RSI and STOCH, {{are based}} on the contrarian idea. Basically, when the stock is <b>overbought</b> (oversold), the price tends to decrease (increase) afterward. The next two, namely MACD and DMI, are trend-following indicators. By riding a trend, technical analysis asserts that investors could make profits. The last indicator, OBV, is a volume-based indicator. It shows whether volume is flowing into or out of a security.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new application of Bollinger bands for defect detection of patterned fabric. A literature review on previous designed methods for patterned fabric defect detection will be depicted. For data analysis, Bollinger bands are calculated based on standard deviation and are originally {{used in the}} financial market as an oversold or <b>overbought</b> indicator for stock. The Bollinger bands method is an efficient, fast and shift-invariant approach, that can segment out the defective regions on the patterned fabric with clear and crystal clean images. The new approach is immune of the alignment problem that often happens in previous methods. In this paper, the upper band and lower band of Bollinger bands, which are sensitive to any subtle change in the input data, {{have been developed for}} use to indicate the defective areas in patterned fabric. The number of standard deviation and length of time of Bollinger bands can be easily determined to obtain excellent detection results. The proposed method has been evaluated on three different patterned fabrics. In total, 165 defect-free and 171 defective images have been used in the evaluation, where 98. 59 % accuracy on inspection has been achieved. © 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|In {{the stock}} market, return {{reversal}} occurs when investors sell <b>overbought</b> stocks and buy oversold stocks, reversing the stocks' price trends. In this paper, we {{develop a new}} method to identify key drivers of return reversal by incorporating a comprehensive set of factors derived from different economic theories into one unified dynamical Bayesian factor graph. We then use the model to depict factor relationships and their dynamics, from which we make some interesting discoveries about the mechanism behind return reversals. Through extensive experiments on the US stock market, we conclude that among the various factors, the liquidity factors consistently emerge as key drivers of return reversal, which is {{in support of the}} theory of liquidity effect. Specifically, we find that stocks with high turnover rates or high Amihud illiquidity measures have a greater probability of experiencing return reversals. Apart from the consistent drivers, we find other drivers of return reversal that generally change from year to year, and they serve as important characteristics for evaluating the trends of stock returns. Besides, we also identify some seldom discussed yet enlightening inter-factor relationships, one of which shows that stocks in Finance and Insurance industry {{are more likely to have}} high Amihud illiquidity measures in comparison with those in other industries. These conclusions are robust for return reversals under different thresholds...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} financial {{time series}} modelling methods {{based on the}} Self-Organising Map (SOM). The principal modelling technique is the local model approach, which aims to fit simple models to localised segments ofthe data. The simple model uses parametric linear regression to describe the variation of the data. The local model approach combines the simplicity of a parametric method with the flexibility of a non-parametric method. Temporal SOM, in addition, integrates temporal context in normal SOM algorithm for a more appropriate analysis of sequential data. The proposed methods are presented in three forms. The first is the temporal SOM with local support vector regressive models. This method uses the recurrent self-organising map to partition the original data space into several disjointed regions and then support vector machines are used to build predictive regressive models. The second approach is the self-organising mixture autoregressive network (SOMAR), the key proposed method in this thesis. It aims to describe and model non-stationary time series by means ofmixture autoregressive local models constructed from topologically clustered time-series segments. The SOMAR network uses the sum (of the absolute value) of autocorrelation coefficients as the similarity measure to identify the winning local autoregressive model. The last approach uses a hybrid system formed by a mixture ofregressive models and economical indicators, which generate either sell or buy signals by monitoring the <b>overbought</b> and oversold status of trading assets. Extensive experiments are presented and the performance ofthe proposed methods are analysed. It is shown that the proposed method, in particular, the SOMAR network, can yield better than global regressive models, econometric time series models, and random walk models.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{research}} report documents {{an example of}} evidence of investor overreaction in the marketplace, with overreaction to short-term information found to be exploitable via price corrections in order to generate market-beating returns. An efficient market should render any consistent abnormal returns unattainable. Hence any technical analysis allowing an investor to obtain such returns would indicate a degree of market inefficiency. Three signal generation strategies are employed to test for momentum and price corrections in the market, namely using a stock's price and moving average, ranking stocks based on prior returns, and allocating stocks as <b>overbought</b> and oversold. The strategies are employed on data comprising the top 60 stocks on the JSE as at August 2012. The period tested runs from January 1998 to August 2012. Signal generation by means of price and moving average encompasses trade signals being generated by a stock's price moving above or below a variable moving average. Returns to this strategy tend to be maximized when employing a short-term (20 -day) moving average, with an annualised above market return of 14, 9 achievable. Using the returns of a stock in an immediately preceding formation period as a ranking criterion to classify stocks into a portfolio {{is found to be}} a superior method to generate trading signals. A portfolio of the best performing stocks in a preceding period ("the winner portfolio") is found to be able to outperform the market. Given a minimum formation period of 50 days, price continuation is achieved after holding the portfolio for at least 30 days, with annualized market excess returns greater than 10 achieved at longer formation and holding periods. A portfolio of the worst performing stocks in the same period ("the loser portfolio") is able to outperform the winner portfolio, and is capable of achieving returns of 20 in excess of the market, given a formation period as low as 10 days, while closing the investment position after no more than 10 days...|$|E
