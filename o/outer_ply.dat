50|$|The wood {{is either}} a light ('white limba') or with dark stripes ('black limba' or 'korina') hardwood. Used for making furniture, table tennis blades (as <b>outer</b> <b>ply),</b> and musical {{instruments}} and prized for its workability and excellent colour and finish. The most well known example of its use in guitars is when Gibson produced their now highly sought-after Flying V and Explorer guitars in 1958. Makers of table tennis blades choose limba, and in particular black limba for its flexibility {{and the idea that}} it enhances top spin play. Limba is used in some blades made by Stiga and OSP. When finished in a clear coat, 'white limba' results in an attractive light golden colour.|$|E

A high density of cracks developed during the plateau of the stress-strain curve and were qualitatively analyzed, showing that the inner plies eventually developed a higher crack concentration than the <b>outer</b> <b>plies.</b> Delamination started {{to occur in the}} outermost ply interface when the slope after the plateau of the stress-strain curve began to increase...|$|R
40|$|Three-ply FeCrAlY/Al 2 O 3 {{composites}} and FeCrAlY matrix-only {{samples were}} cyclically oxidized at 1000 C and 1100 C {{for up to}} 1000 1 -hr cycles. Fiber ends were exposed {{at the ends of}} the composite samples. Following cyclic oxidation, cracks running parallel to and perpendicular to the fibers were observed on the large surface of the composite. In addition, there was evidence of increased scale damage and spallation around the exposed fiber ends, particularly around the middle ply fibers. This damage was more pronounced at the higher temperature. The exposed fiber ends showed cracking between fibers in the <b>outer</b> <b>plies,</b> occasionally with Fe and Cr-rich oxides growing out of the cracks. Large gaps developed at the fiber/matrix interface around many of the fibers, especially those in the <b>outer</b> <b>plies.</b> Oxygen penetrated many of these gaps resulting in significant oxide formation at the fiber/matrix interface far within the composite sample. Around several fibers, the matrix was also internally oxidized showing Al 2 O 3 precipitates in a radial band around the fibers. The results show that these composites have poor cyclic oxidation resistance due to the CTE mismatch and inadequate fiber/matrix bond strength at temperatures of 1000 C and above...|$|R
50|$|Cockpit {{windshields}} on the Airbus A320 must withstand bird strikes up to 350 kt and {{are made}} of chemically strengthened glass. They are usually composed of three layers or plies, of glass or plastic : the inner two are 8 mm (0.3 in.) thick each and are structural, while the <b>outer</b> <b>ply,</b> about 3-mm, is a barrier against foreign object damage and abrasion, with often a hydrophobic coating. It must prevent fogging inside the cabin and de-ice from -50C (-58F), this was previously done with thin wires similar to a rear car window, but now is a transparent, nanometers thick coating of indium tin oxide siting between plies, electrically conductive and thus transmitting heat. Curved glass improves aerodynamics but sight criteria also needs larger panes. A cockpit windshield is composed of 4-6 panels, 35 kg (77 lb.) each on an Airbus A320. In its lifetime, an average aircraft goes through three or four windshields, and the market is shared evenly between OEM and higher margins aftermarket.|$|E
50|$|The {{pattern is}} placed on the plywood so that the wood grain runs across from the tip of one end of the boomerang to the tip of the other end. Try to get the grain of the <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> running at 45 degrees to the length of the arms. If there is any warp in the wood, make sure that this {{produces}} dihedral on the upper side of the boomerang, i.e., if the airfoil is uppermost and the boomerang is on a flat surface, then the wingtips are raised slightly above the surface. (Any anhedral and the boomerang won't fly.) The pattern is traced on to the boomerang with a pencil. The boomerang shape is cut out of the plywood. This basic cut out is called the blank. An outline is drawn {{on the top of the}} blank to show the areas to be shaped for the leading and trailing edges of the wings. The profiles of the wings are shaped. The top of the leading edge of each wing is decreased at a 45° angle, while the rear of the wing is angled down to leave 1-2 mm thick trailing edge. The bottom face of the leading edge is trimmed back slightly. The tips of the wings are shaped down to the same thickness as the trailing edge. The various layers of the plywood serve as an outline that helps the worker achieve equal slopes. A shallow section may also be cut out from the bottom surface of each wing. For example, this might consist of a 5-cm long strip near the wing tip and behind the leading edge. Using progressively finer sandpaper, the surface of the boomerang is smoothed carefully. Check the boomerang for a slight amount of dihedral (2-3 mm) on both wings at this point. If there isn't any, introduce some by heating the boomerang either over a heat source or a brief spell in the microwave oven (about 30 seconds on high) - if the boomerang is just about uncomfortably hot to handle, you've got it just about right. Bend up the tips of the wings and place the boomerang on a flat surface with a coin under each tip and a weight (bag of sugar?) on the elbow of the boomerang. Allow it to cool for twenty minutes or more. After spraying the surface with sanding sealer, the surface is smoothed with fine steel wool. The boomerang is then painted again.|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{structures}} are generally assembled with face sheet plies in their application. It {{is necessary to}} understand the influence of assembled plies on deformation and energy absorption before using textile composite cellular structures in engineering design. In this paper, effects of ply assembly, <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> material, <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> thickness, and loading area on energy absorption and deformation of the applied structure including cellular structure and face sheet plies are investigated. Three-dimensional finite element analyses are carried out employing orthotropic mechanical properties of the applied materials, textile composite, wood, E-glass, aluminium alloy 2024 -T 3 and unidirectional fiber-epoxy composite T- 300. The predicted results show that deformation and distributed strain energy density of both outer and inner surfaces of the applied structure are significantly affected by ply assembly, <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> material, <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> thickness, and loading area...|$|E

40|$|A {{criterion}} for matrix failure of laminated composite plies in transverse tension and in-plane shear is developed {{by examining the}} mechanics of transverse matrix crack growth. Matrix cracks are assumed to initiate from manufacturing defects and can propagate within planes parallel to the fiber direction and normal to the ply mid-plane. Fracture mechanics models of cracks in unidirectional laminates, embedded <b>plies</b> and <b>outer</b> <b>plies</b> are developed to determine the onset and direction of propagation for unstable crack growth. The models for each ply configuration relate ply thickness and ply toughness to the corresponding in-situ ply strength. Calculated results for several materials are shown to correlate well with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Cut plies were {{incorporated}} at {{the centre of}} unidirectional glass fibre laminates to simulate the loading conditions observed around dropped plies in tapered structures. Specimens were tested aggressively in tensile fatigue in order to initiate delamination at the ply cuts and propagate this along the interfaces between the continuous <b>outer</b> <b>plies</b> and discontinuous (cut) inner plies. Narrow strips of thermoplastic film were interleaved at specific locations along the delaminating interfaces to investigate their ability to slow or inhibit the delamination growth. Polyimide and EMAA thermoplastic films were investigated: whilst the polyimide film appeared to have minimal effect, the EMAA film proved highly successful in preventing delamination growth under the fatigue conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Damage {{initiation}} {{and evolution}} in SCS- 6 /Timetal 21 S with quasi-isotropic layup loaded under quasi-static and dynamic bending is investigated. When the axes of the fibers in the <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> are transverse to the bending stress ([90 / 45 / 0]s layup), the bending strength is significantly lower and {{damage in the}} form of fiber-matrix separation initiates sooner than when the fibers in the <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> are parallel to the bending stress ([0 / 45 / 90]s). The damage process and plasticity for dynamic bending is similar to quasi-static bending with the asymptotic damage level being the same for both. However, the rate of increase of damage with strain is smaller for dynamic bending compared to quasi-static bending. The energy dissipated in this titanium matrix composite under dynamic loading is smaller than either a graphite-fiber polymide-matrix composite or a glass-fiber bismaleimide-matrix composite...|$|E
40|$|The local {{deformation}} and failure sequences of five thermoplastic matrix composites were microscopically observed while bending the samples {{in a small}} fixture attached to a microscope stage. The themoplastics are polycarbonate, polysulfone, polyphenylsulfide, polyethersulfone, and polyetheretherketone. Comparison was made to an epoxy matrix composite, 5208 /T- 300. Laminates tested are (0 / 90) sub 2 S, with <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> fibers parallel to the beam axis. Four point bending was used at a typical span-to-thickness ratio of 39 : 1. It was found {{that all of the}} thermoplastic composites failed by abrupt longitudinal compression buckling of the <b>outer</b> <b>ply.</b> Very little precursory damage was observed. Micrographs reveal typical fiber kinking associated with longitudinal compression failure. Curved fracture surfaces on the fibers suggest they failed in bending rather than direct compression. Delamination was suppressed in the thermoplastic composites, and the delamination that did occur was found {{to be the result of}} compression buckling, rather than visa-versa. Microbuckling also caused other subsequent damage such as ply splitting, transverse ply shear failure, fiber tensile failure, and transverse ply cracking...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{laminate}} thickness on the interlaminar stresses in rectangular quasi-isotropic laminates under unifor. r. axial strain was studied. Laminates from 8 -ply to infinitely thick wer, analyzed. Thick laminates were synthesized by stacking (45 / 0 /- 45 / 90) ply groups, rather than grouping like plies. Laminates {{with and without}} delaminations were studied. in laminates without delaminations, the free-edge interlaminar normal stress distribution in the <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> groups was insensitive to total laminate thickness. The interlaminar normal stress distribution for the interior ply groups was nearly {{the same as for}} an infinitely thick laminate. In contrast, the free-edge interlaminar shear stress distri-bution was nearly the same for inner and <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> groups and was insensitive to laminate thickness [...] In laminates with delaminations, those delaminations near the top and bottom surfaces of a thick laminate have much larger total strain-energy-release rates and mode I-to-total (G /GT) ratios than delaminations deep in the interior. Therefore, delaminations can be expected to grow more easily near the surfaces of a laminate than in the interior. This is consistent with experimental results reported in the literature. Also, near surface delaminations in thin laminates tend to have larger strain-energy release rates than corresponding near surface delaminations in thick laminates...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this report, the dynamic-response, in particular, the interlaminar shear stress, in three-layer {{symmetrical}} hybrid composites is studied {{using the}} shear lag model. Theoretical solutions for four {{different types of}} loading are obtained. Numerical examples are given for the step loading case and the results obtained show good agreement with those determined using the finite element method. The interlaminar shear stress is com-posed of static and dynamic parts and the peak interlaminar shear stress, which occurs at the loading end under the step uniform pressure loading, {{is dominated by the}} static stress and is dependent on the stiffness ratio between the centre and the <b>outer</b> <b>plies.</b> This agrees with the solution for the infinite length case, see Reference [1]. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{bio-based}} thermoset resin {{was reinforced}} with flax fabrics and Lyocell fiber. The effect of different weave architectureswas studied with four flax fabrics with different architectures: plain, twill (two different types), and dobby. The effect ofthe <b>outer</b> <b>ply</b> thickness was studied and characterized with flexural and impact testing. Composites manufactured withplain weave reinforcement {{had the best}} mechanical properties. The tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength,flexural modulus, and impact strength were 280 MPa, 32 GPa, 250 MPa, 25 GPa, and 75 kJ/m 2, respectively. Reinforcements with twill-weave architecture did not impart appreciable flexural strength or flexural modulus evenwhen the outer thickness was increased. Plain- and dobby (basket woven style) -weave architectures gave better reinforcingeffects and the flexural properties increased {{with an increase in}} outer thickness.

40|$|AbstractFinite element {{analysis}} of ink-tack delamination of paperboard were presented. The paperboard was modeled as a multilayered structure with a softening interface model connecting the paperboard plies. The paperboard plies were modeled as orthotropic linear elastic. The ink-tack loading {{was applied to}} the board {{in the form of a}} moving displacement boundary condition. The purpose of the analysis was to assess the influence from the elastic moduli of the individual layers on the ink-tack delamination event. The results indicated that in most cases of practical interest the board delaminated between the <b>outer</b> <b>plies</b> of the board, although the interface strength was lower in the middle of the board. This observation helped to explain why traditional tests for out-of-plane testing of paper by standardized methods could not uniquely predict the propensity for ink-tack delamination...|$|R
40|$|Model {{sandwich}} laminates were {{manufactured by}} orienting the knitted cloth {{at a range}} of angles to the loading direction using a single Milano weft knitted layer sandwiched between <b>outer</b> <b>plies</b> of unidirectional glass reinforced epoxy resin {{in order to be}} able to observe progressive damage accumulation along the sample. By this way, the relationship between fibre architecture and damage accumulation under tensile loading, as well as the sequence of damage accumulation has been investigated. Damage has been found to initiate at the loop cross-over points of the knitted fabric structure for all orientations, although the further development of the damage depends on the orientation of the fabric to the applied load. The resultant transparent laminates provide a novel method of monitoring the damage development in a knitted-fabric composite as a function of increasing strain by allowing direct observation of the sequence of damage...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{simulation method}} {{is presented to}} assure life in composite systems by using dynamic buckling of smart composite shells as an example. The combined use of composite mechanics, finite element computer codes, and probabilistic analysis enable the effective assessment of the dynamic buckling load of smart composite shells. A universal plot is generated to estimate the dynamic buckling load of composite shells at various load rates and probabilities. The shell structure is also evaluated with smart fibers embedded in the plies right below the <b>outer</b> <b>plies.</b> The results show that, on the average, the use of smart fibers improved the shell buckling resistance by about 9 % at different probabilities and delayed the buckling occurrence time. The probabilistic sensitivities results indicate that uncertainties in the fiber volume ratio and ply thickness have major effects on the buckling load. The uncertainties in the electric field strength and smart material volume fraction have moderate effects and thereby in the assured life of the shell...|$|R
30|$|In view of {{the fact}} that the variational {{analysis}} provides the lower bound for stiffness reduction and crack density relation, the analytical and experimental results for the studied laminates are in good agreement, as most of the experimental data points stay on or slightly above the analytical curves. However, there are several ocasions where experimental data are lower than the analytical prediction. Possible reasons for this could be variation in the secimen properties and formation of uncounted cracks close to, but outside the observation zone, and could effect the results. Some dispersion in the experimental data could also be caused by randomness in the mechanical properties of the material, effects of the notches at the edges of the specimen on the 0 ° <b>outer</b> <b>ply.</b> In addition, the CFRP [1] laminates showed multiple small cracks occurred at the free edges which did not penetrate along the specimen, which could affect the stiffness reduction measurements as well.|$|E
40|$|For any {{structure}} {{composed of}} laminated composite materials, impact damage {{is one of the}} greatest risks and therefore most widely tested responses. Typically, impact damage testing and analysis assumes that a solid object comes into contact with the bare surface of the laminate (the <b>outer</b> <b>ply).</b> However, most launch vehicle structures will have a thermal protection system (TPS) covering the structure for the majority of its life. Thus, the impact response of the material with the TPS covering is the impact scenario of interest. In this study, laminates representative of the composite interstage structure for the Ares I launch vehicle were impact tested with and without the planned TPS covering, which consists of polyurethane foam. Response variables examined include maximum load of impact, damage size as detected by nondestructive evaluation techniques, and damage morphology and compression after impact strength. Results show that there is little difference between TPS covered and bare specimens, except the residual strength data is higher for TPS covered specimens...|$|E

40|$|Journal articleA unique {{insight into}} damage {{formation}} in CF/PEEK laminates before, {{during and after}} cryogenic cycling, using optical microscopy and 3 D X-ray computed tomography (CT), is presented. Thicker laminates were found to exhibit significantly greater microcrack density and delamination when compared to thinner laminates, with lay-up and material type also being important contributing factors. Thermal residual stress induced microcracking was also found in thicker laminates post-processing. 3 D rendering software was used to prove the presence of through thickness crack networks within the laminates, {{as well as the}} extent of cracking through the specimen width. Crack opening in inner and off-axis ply groups was found to be significantly less than <b>outer</b> <b>plies,</b> implying the importance of these plies in limiting laminate permeability.

40|$|The {{drilling}} of {{composite material}} laminates {{is a widely}} used process and is critical from a structural point of view. It requires particular attention, due to {{the various types of}} damage that can be caused if the process is incorrect. The delamination of the <b>outer</b> <b>plies</b> of the laminate at the exit edge of the hole is a typical defect detected after drilling composite materials. This is related to the thrust force required for drilling, which is connected, other cutting parameters being equal, to the feed rate. High feed rates are associated with high thrust force and, accordingly, the probability that delamination will occur, increases with feed rate and force. In this work a study for developing a new step multifacet drill bit, named SEE, Step Elliptical Elliptical, is presented. Experimental tests showed that the new tool allows a decrease of about 50 % in the maximum thrust force, compared with the one shot drill bit, which is still widely used in the aeronautical field...|$|R
