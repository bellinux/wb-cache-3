This article presents a population pharmacokinetic analysis of these four compounds in Western cancer patients. The second objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of S- 1 in Western and Japanese patients. METHODS: A single dose (25 - 45 mg/m 2) of S- 1 was administered to 60 patients. In each patient, 6 concentrations of FT, 5 -FU, <b>oteracil</b> and CDHP were measured over 24 hr. Using NONMEM, <b>oteracil</b> and CDHP were analyzed separately, and the individual estimates of CDHP parameters {{were included in the}} joint analysis of FT and 5 -FU. We used validation techniques to assess differences between the two populations, and finally we compared the exposures in Western and Japanese patients using simulations. RESULTS: A compartmental model describing the PK of the 4 compounds was developed. The influence of CDHP on the elimination of 5 -FU was well described by an enzymatic inhibition model. The model provided a good fit for all compounds. The pharmacokinetics for 5 -FU and <b>oteracil</b> were similar between Western and Japanese patients, but apparent differences in exposure to 5 -FU resulted from different total doses due to different body sizes...|$|E

40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} the effect {{and analyze the}} possible mechanism of celecoxib combined with tegafur, gimeracil and <b>oteracil</b> potassium on growth and lymphangiogenesis of subcutaneously transplanted human gastric cancer in nude mice. Methods　Human gastric cancer was transplanted subcutaneously successfully in nude mice. When the largest diameter of tumor reached about 5 mm, the nude mice were randomly divided into four groups (6 each) : control group, celecoxib group, tegafur+gimeracil+oteracil potassium group, and celecoxib combination group. The drugs were administered respectively for 21 days. Then the tumor tissues were collected, tumor weight was measured, and tumor inhibition rate was calculated. The changes in body weight of the nude mice before and after treatment were recorded, and the side effect of drug therapy was assessed. The expression levels of COX- 2 and VEGF-C protein were determined by immunohistochemistry, and the density of lymphatic vessel was calculated. Results　No obvious side effect was found, and the body weight increased after the treatment (P 0. 05). Conclusion　When given alone, both celecoxib and tegafur+gimeracil+oteracil potassium show obvious antitumor effect, and combination of these two drugs will give rise a synergistical antitumor effect. Celecoxib and celecoxib combined with tegafur gimeracil <b>oteracil</b> potassium may reduce the expression of COX- 2, in turn downregulate the expression of VEGF-C, and then inhibit the tumor lymphangiogenesis.

30|$|The {{combination}} of chemotherapeutic regimens {{and the development}} of molecular targeted agents lead to improved survival in metastatic CRC. In order to develop new chemotherapeutic regimens, {{it is important to consider}} not only the survival benefit but also the maintenance of the quality of life of patients. S- 1 is an effective derivative that combines tegafur with two modulators of 5 -FU metabolism, gimeracil, a reversible inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, and <b>oteracil</b> in a molar ratio of 1 : 0.4 : 1. Gimeracil maintains a high fluorouracil concentration in the blood for a long time, and <b>oteracil</b> inhibits the conversion of 5 -FU to active metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in a reduction in gastrointestinal toxicity (Kato et al. 2001; Shirasaka 2009). S- 1 was originally approved for the treatment of gastric cancer in Japan in 1999, and subsequently gained Japanese approval for CRC in 2003. More recently, there has been a shifting paradigm in cancer care towards oral chemotherapeutics. In the view of the convenience oral dosing offers to both patients and physicians, S- 1 was gradually accepted as an alternative therapy to infused FU, similar to capecitabine (Muro et al. 2010; Yoshida et al. 2014). S- 1 has the potential to improve accessibility to chemotherapy and decrease serious patient toxicities such as HFS. Placement of an ambulatory infusion pump is not absolutely necessary for patients treated with SOX plus bevacizumab. In our study, 33.3  % of the patients (n =  18) did not need an implanted port placement. Additionally, patients who received SOX plus bevacizumab returned to the hospital only once every 3  weeks. Thus, this new regimen is a promising treatment option to replace FOLFOX 6 plus bevacizumab regimen, particularly for maintaining the quality of life of the patients.|$|E

The present study describes a rare case of primary intraosseous {{squamous cell carcinoma}} of the mandible arising from an odontogenic cyst. A 59 -year-old female was referred to Asahi University Murakami Memorial Hospital (Gifu, Japan), with acute pain in the right molars. An initial examination revealed buccal swelling and paresthesia of the mental nerve. Following an intraoral examination, the oral mucosa was confirmed to be normal, however, percussion pain was experienced between the lower right first premolar and second molar. Panoramic radiography revealed a retained lower right wisdom tooth and an irregular radiolucent area between the lower right molar and a mandibular angle with unclear margins. Computed tomography revealed diffuse bone resorption and an extensive loss of cortical bone on the buccal and lingual sides. A biopsy was performed and the pathological diagnosis was of a squamous cell carcinoma arising from the epithelial lining of the odontogenic cyst. Radical dissection was subsequently performed, however, histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed neither invasion into the surrounding tissues penetrating the periosteum nor lymph node metastasis at the right submandibular lesion.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 75 patients who received first-line chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer between April 2006 and September 2011. Patients were treated with gemcitabine (GEM) alone, S- 1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and <b>oteracil</b> potassium) alone, or GEM plus S- 1. Patients were divided into the clinical trial eligible group (arm eligible) or the ineligible group (arm ineligible). We evaluated the efficacy and the safety of the chemotherapy. Results: A total of 23 patients out of 75 (31 %) belonged to the ineligible group, for the following reasons: 20 patients had poor performance status, eight had massive ascites, one had synchronous malignancy, and one had icterus. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3. 5 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 6. 7 months in all patients.

40|$|IntroductionS- 1 is a rationally {{designed}} oral {{agent that}} combines the 5 -fluorouracil prodrug tegafur with gimeracil and <b>oteracil,</b> which inhibit 5 -fluorouracil degradation by dihydropyrimidine dehydronase and phosphorylation within the gastrointestinal tract, respectively, to increase antineoplastic activity while reducing gastrointestinal toxicity. We investigated the activity and toxicity of S- 1 {{in combination with}} cisplatin in patients with unresectable {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). MethodsCisplatin, 75 mg/m 2, was administered intravenously on day 1, with S- 1, 25 mg/m 2 PO two times a day, days 1 to 14, every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles. Primary end point was overall response. ResultsA total of 58 patients received at least one cycle of protocol-specified therapy. The best overall response rate was 23. 2 % (95 % confidence interval: 13. 0 – 36. 4), and the disease control rate was 67. 9 %. The median progression-free survival was 4. 0 months (95 % confidence interval: 3. 3 – 5. 5). There {{did not appear to be}} any relationship between response to therapy and tumor histology. The most frequently reported adverse events of G 3 or more (≥ 10 %) were neutropenia (28 %), hyponatremia (19 %), diarrhea (17 %), hypokalemia (12 %), fatigue (10 %), dehydration (10 %), and deep vein thrombosis (10 %). ConclusionsAlthough the S- 1 + cisplatin regimen used in this study appeared to have a similar level of antitumor activity and toxicity to that of established cisplatin-based doublets in NSCLC, the protocol-specified criteria of sufficient efficacy to warrant further study with an objective response rate ≥ 30 % was not achieved. Therefore, while S- 1 appears to be a promising agent in NSCLC, further evaluation should be conducted to determine the optimal S- 1 -based regimen to take forward for additional study...|$|E
40|$|S- 1 {{is a new}} oral {{fluorinated}} pyrimidine derivate, {{in which}} the oral 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) prodrug, tegafur, was combined with two 5 -FU-modulating substances, 5 -chloro- 2, 4 -dihydroxypyridine (gimeracil), and potassium oxonate (<b>oteracil),</b> at a molar ratio of 1 : 0. 4 : 1. The final mechanism of action is exerted by 5 -FU. The present study is the first European phase 11 trial of S-I in gastric cancer. The primary study objectives were the safety, toxicity and activity of S-I in non-pretreated patients with gastric cancer. The secondary objective was the duration of response. Patients had to have histologically- or cytologically-verified metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable gastric cancer; S-I was administered orally twice daily at 40, then 35 mg/m(2) for 28 days every 5 weeks. The starting dose of, 40 mg/m(2) {{was found to be}} intolerable due to significant non-haematological toxicity, and this dose was rapidly reduced to 35 mg/m(2) twice daily. Of the 7 patients enrolled at the 40 mg/m(2) level, only 3 were evaluable. At 35 mg/m(2), a response rate of 26. 1 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 12. 0 - 45. 1 %) in 23 enrolled patients, and 31. 6 % (C. I. 14. 7 - 53. 0 %) in 19 evaluable patients according to an independent radiology review, was found. The median duration of response at 35 mg/m(2) (6 patients) was 223 days (range, 108 - 828 days), and of stable disease was I I I days (range 68 - 411 days). S-I can be administered with an acceptable safety and toxicity in European patients at a dose of 35 mg/m(2) days 1 - 28 every 5 weeks and is associated with a moderate response rate similar to the results achieved with other fluoropyrimidines.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the clinical effect {{and safety of}} albumin-bound paclitaxel (Nab-P) as the first-line treatment for advanced primary liver cancer. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 23 patients with advanced primary liver cancer who were admitted to the Department of Medical Oncology in Chinese PLA General Hospital from May 2014 to December 2015. According to the treatment regimen, these patients were divided into observation group and control group. The 12 patients in the observation group were treated with Nab-P, among whom 5 were treated with Nab-P combined with tegafur, gimeracil and <b>oteracil,</b> 5 were treated with Nab-P combined with capecitabine, and 2 were treated with Nab-P alone; the 11 patients {{in the control group}} were treated with gemcitabine combined with oxaliplatin. One cycle of the treatment was 21 days for each treatment regimen; therapeutic effect was evaluated every 2 cycles, and adverse events were evaluated every cycle. The chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze progression-free survival, and the log-rank test was used to compare survival rates between groups. Results All the patients were eligible for evaluation of clinical outcome and adverse events. In the observation group, 2 patients achieved partial remission, 7 had a stable disease, and 3 had a progressive disease; in the control group, 2 achieved partial remission, 5 had a stable disease, and 4 had a progressive disease. There {{was no significant difference in}} disease control rate between the two groups (75 % vs 64 %, χ 2 = 0. 350, P＞ 0. 05). There was also no significant difference in the median progression-free survival between the two groups ［ 5. 1 (2. 7 - 6. 7) months vs 4. 3 (2. 5 - 5. 4) months, χ 2 = 0. 647, P＞ 0. 05 ］. As for adverse events, no patient experienced serious adverse events, and there were significant differences in the incidence rates of platelet toxicity and increased aspartate aminotransferase between the two groups (χ 2 = 5. 490 and 6. 135, P= 0. 036 and 0. 027). Conclusion In the treatment of advanced primary liver cancer, the medication based on Nab-P shows a good clinical effect and tolerable toxic and side effects; however, due to the small sample size in this study, the clinical studies with a large sample size are needed...|$|E
40|$|Objective 　To {{evaluate}} the effcacy {{and safety of}} trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy {{for the treatment of}} human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER 2) -positive chemo-refractory gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in China. Methods 　The clinical data of seventy-five cases of HER 2 -positive and chemo-refractory gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma were collected in Peking University Cancer Hospital from May 2006 to Nov. 2013. Patients with historically confirmed adenocarcinoma were eligible if their tumors showed overexpression of HER 2 protein by immunohistochemistry  or ISH positive, and if they were treated with trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy. Response and toxicity were evaluated with RECIST 1. 0 and CTC AE 3. 0 criteria. Results 　All the 75 patients received trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. In 52 patients of first line therapy, combination regimens consisted of 44 cisplatin or oxaliplatin with fluorouracil (as adjuvant therapy in 3 patients with prolonged follow up), 5 with paclitaxel with fluorouracil, and 3 with gimeracil and <b>oteracil</b> potassium monotherapy. Evaluation of curative effects was performed in 49 cases, in whom 32 with PR (61. 5 %), 13 with SD, and 4 with PD. The disease control rate (DCR) was 86. 5 %. Median PFS and median OS were 10. 9 months (95 %CI 6. 8 - 15. 0) and 18. 7 months (95 %CI 6. 3 - 31. 1) respectively. Three patients received radical operation followed by oxaliplatin + capecitabine. In 20 cases with second-line or delayed therapy, combination cisplatin or oxaliplatin with fluorouracil were given in 9 patients, paclitaxel with fluorouracil in 5, fluorouracil monotherapy in 3, irinotecan monotherapy in 2, and docetaxel monotherapy in 1 patient. In 20 cases, PR (35. 0 %) was achieved in 7, SD was achieved in 6, and PD was achieved in 7. The DCR was 65 %. Median PFS and median OS were 6. 2 months (95 %CI 5. 1 - 7. 3) and 12. 3 months (95 %CI 9. 0 - 15. 6) respectively. The median time of Trastuzumab administration was 7. Adverse events (3 / 4 grade) were neutropenia (14. 7 %) and thrombocytopenia (10. 7 %). Allergy and fever was reported in one each patient respcetively. Conclusion 　Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy have been proved to be effective in real clinical practice in China, and it is well tolerated and effective in patients with HER 2 -positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarninoma. Prospective studies are warranted to further confirm its effcacy and safety as a maintenance therapy or second line therapy. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2014. 03. 0...|$|E
