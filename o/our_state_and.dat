After the conclusion of the Second World War, university president Harry C.

[...] The school was experiencing a large influx in students as discharged veterans pursued their education under the G.I. Bill, and it strained the university's logistics. The enrollment of many wounded veterans increased the need for handicapped access, and the sheer number of students meant dining facilities required waits of up to an hour. Also, the disproportionate number of male students to females created disciplinary problems. In 1947, Eppley wrote to the assistant dean of women in the defense of some fraternity brothers who had broken into a sorority, but conceded that [...] "the drinking problem on the university campus is a little worse than usual due to the aftermath of the war." ...|$|E

Later in the day Bakiyev was reported to have flown into exile to the Kazakhstani city of Taraz. it was said that he would continue negotiations on a settlement to the crisis from exile. The interim government responded to this by calling his departure a [...] "deportation," [...] saying he had allegedly submitted a request to resign amid reports indicating that Baktybek Kaliyev, a former defence minister, had been arrested. The interim government also said it would seek Bakiyev's transfer to a Kyrgyz or international court for trial at a later date. Kazakhstan, as the chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, confirmed Bakiyev's departure saying it was an important step towards preventing civil war. It added that joint efforts between themselves and Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama had fostered such an agreement. Bakiyev submitted a hand-written resignation letter saying [...] "I tender my resignation in these tragic days as I understand the full scale of my responsibility for the future of the Kyrgyz people." [...] The interim president allegedly said [...] "he had become a source of instability ... they could no longer tolerate that." [...] She added that most of his entourage was still in the country and that she would press ahead with bringing Bakyiev to trial. On 20 April, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko said his country had afforded Bakiyev and three members of his family [...] "the protection of <b>our</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> personally of the president." [...] On 21 April, in a statement from Minsk, Bakiyev said he still considers himself the country's president and pledged to do all he can to return the country to its [...] "constitutional field." [...] He then upped the ante by saying, [...] "I do not recognise my resignation. Nine months ago the people of Kyrgyzstan elected me their president and there is no power that can stop me. Only death can stop me." [...] He then called on the international community not to support the interim government. [...] "Everyone must know the bandits who are trying to take power are the executors of an external force and have no legitimacy. I call on leaders of the international community: do not set a precedent and do not recognise this gang as the legitimate authorities." [...] Russia consequently rejected this assertion on the grounds that he had already tendered his resignation saying [...] "this document cannot be rejected by a verbal [...] statement." [...] He also accused the Russians of being annoyed with his allowing the Manas air base to continue operating for the Americans and NATO to supply their forces in the Afghan war. [...] On 23 April, Bakiyev backtracked on his vow to return to power, but claimed his resignation is invalid because the new government is failing to protect his family as was promised.|$|E
