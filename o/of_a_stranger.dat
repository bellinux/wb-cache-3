5000|$|Never Go with Strangers: Narrated by Gary Watson, this 1971 film {{opens with}} brief {{animated}} sequences depicting the classic stories of Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, and Aladdin, warning children {{not to be}} like the title characters and to avoid putting themselves in danger. Children are encouraged to [...] "think <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger's</b> car as danger", and as a recurring theme, <b>a</b> <b>stranger's</b> car flashes red whenever a child is approached, accompanied by a dramatic synthesiser chord.

5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped his card on the floor and when he bent under the table to {{retrieve}} it noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins when}} the player assumes the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> who arrives at Tantegel Castle. A castle guard {{tells him that}} a dragon has {{captured}} the princess and is holding her captive in a distant cave. Determined to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord, he discovers an ancient tablet hidden inside a desert cave; carved on the tablet is a message from Erdrick that outlines what the hero needs to do to follow in Erdrick's footsteps and defeat the Dragonlord. The hero eventually rescues Princess Gwaelin, but realizes {{that in order to}} restore light to Alefgard, he must defeat the Dragonlord at Charlock Castle. After the hero collects a series of relics, he creates a bridge to reach Charlock and fights his way through the castle before finally confronting the Dragonlord. At this point the hero is given a dialogue choice – to side with the Dragonlord or to challenge him. If players choose the former, the game ends, the hero is put to sleep, and the game freezes; however, in the GBC remake, the hero instead wakes up from a bad dream. If players choose to fight, a final battle between the hero and the Dragonlord commences.|$|E

Though everyone tries to draw the sword, Volsung's son Sigmund is the only man who can do it. The disappointed Siggeir takes his new wife home, inviting Volsung to visit him. When Volsung does so he is killed by Siggeir, and his sons are taken prisoner. While in captivity they are all killed by a wolf, apart from Sigmund who escapes into the forest. Signy sends Sigmund her two sons to help him in avenging their family, but Sigmund only accepts Sinfjotli, the hardier of the two. Sigmund and Sinfjotli kill Siggeir and burn down his hall, then return to their ancestral home, the hall of the Volsungs.

500|$|Barbados has {{produced}} few internationally popular musicians, with worldwide pop superstar Rihanna {{being the most}} famous. It has however created a well-developed local scene playing imported styles like American jazz and calypso, {{as well as the}} indigenous spouge style. Calypso was the first popular music in Barbados, and dates back to the 1930s. Barbadian calypso is a comedic song form, accompanied by guitar and banjo. More recent styles of calypso have also kept a local scene alive, and produced a number of famous calypsonians. Spouge is a mixture of calypso and other styles, especially ska, and became very popular in the 1960s, around {{the same time as the}} Barbadian jazz scene grew in stature and became home to a number of famous performers. Modern Barbadian popular music is largely based around reggae, ragga and soca, and includes some elements of indigenous styles. Artists like Terencia Coward have used modern popular music with instrumentation borrowed from folk tuk bands. Two of the more popular bands of Barbadian popular music are Krosfyah and Square One the new wave of singers, largely soca, include Rupee, Lil' Rick and Jabae with lead vocalist Bruce and Barry Chandler, all recent winners at crop over. A more experimental artist such as poet and fiction writer Anthony Kellman writes thoughtful poetic lyrics delivered in a musical style deeply rooted in Barbadian indigenous folk music with strong elements of African and Latin influences. His albums Wings <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Stranger,</b> Limestone, and Blood Mates have been described as groundbreaking due to his highly original style.|$|E
