40|$|Paramyotoniacongenita is an autosomal-dominant muscle disease {{caused by}} {{missense}} mutations in SCN 4 A, the gene enconding the alpha subunit of skeletal muscle sodium channel. It is clinically characterized by paradoxical myotonia, {{an attack of}} muscle stiffness that is aggravated by repeated activity, as well by cold-induced muscle stiffness. We describe the clinical and genetic features of a Japanese family with Paramyotoniacongenita. Five members of this family (four generations) were affected. Treatment with mexiletine, an antiarrhythmic drug that inhibits inward sodium current, relieved their symptoms. We identified a novel SCN 4 A mutation (c. 3470 T>A, p.

Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita, AMC, is a {{heterogeneous}} condition defined as multiple congenital joint contractures {{in two or}} more body areas. The pathogenesis is impaired fetal movements. Amyoplasia, the most fre- quent form, is a sporadically occurring condition with hypoplastic muscles and joint contractures. Distal arthrogryposis (DA) syndromes are often hereditary, and joint involvement is predominantly in hands and feet. Arhrogryposis with CNS involvement includes chromosomal and other syndromes. Aims. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate patients with arthrogrypo- sis, to classify the different occurring forms, and to investigate causes, muscle and joint involvement, motor function, treatment and outcome. Methods. Patients were identified via pediatric rehabilitation centers. Family and case history including perinatal findings were recorded. Physical investiga- tion included joint range of motion, muscle strength and motor function. In patients with DA molecular genetic and, in selected cases, muscle morphologic investigations were carried out. Results. 131 patients with arthrogryposis were investigated. The most frequent diagnoses were amyoplasia and DA. In amyoplasia, community ambulators had the best muscle strength, household ambulators had severe contractures in legs but good muscle strength in arms, and non-ambulators had the most severe contractures and muscle weakness. Muscle strength was found to be more im- portant than joint range of motion for motor function. In DA, muscle weakness was present in 44 % of investigated patients. Mutations in sarcomeric muscle protein genes were found in seven families with autosomal dominant and in one child with sporadic DA. In one family with a mutation in TNNI 2 there were mild myopathic findings, in one family with mutation in TPM 2 no obvious myopathy, and in patients from three families with MYH 3 mutations mild myopathic findings. Clinical findings were found to be highly variable between families and also within families with DA. Conclusions. Different forms of arthrogryposis were identified. In amyopla- sia, attention should be directed at development of muscle strength with early stimulation of active movements. Immobilisation should be minimized. DA syndromes are clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions. Fetal my- <b>opathy</b> due to sarcomeric protein dysfunction can cause DA. An early multi- disciplinary team evaluation for specific diagnosis and planning of treatment is recommended. Key words.

40|$|Abstract The {{vascular}} endothelial {{basement membrane}} and extra cellular matrix is {{a compilation of}} different macromolecules organized by physical entanglements, opposing ionic charges, chemical covalent bonding, and cross-linking into a biomechanically active polymer. These matrices provide a gel-like form and scaffolding structure with regional tensile strength provided by collagens, elasticity by elastins, adhesiveness by structural glycoproteins, compressibility by proteoglycans – hyaluronans, and communicability by a family of integrins, which exchanges information between cells and between cells and the extracellular matrix of vascular tissues. Each component of the extracellular matrix and specifically the capillary basement membrane possesses unique structural properties and interactions with one another, which determine the separate and combined roles in the multiple diabetic complications or diabetic <b>opathies.</b> Metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and their parallel companion (atheroscleropathy) are associated with multiple metabolic toxicities and chronic injurious stimuli. The adaptable quality of a matrix or form genetically preloaded with the necessary information to communicate and respond to an ever-changing environment, which supports the interstitium, capillary and arterial vessel wall is individually examined. </p...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Redox stress, {{reactive}} oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, {{and oxygen}} free radicals ("toxic oxygen") {{are increasingly being}} reported as important cellular signaling mechanisms. It {{has been known for}} over a hundred years that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a manifold disease, not only in its etiology, but also in its associated manifold toxicities and multiple complications of the diabetic <b>opathies.</b> The presence of islet amyloid has also been described in association with type 2 diabetes mellitus for a century. OBJECTIVE: This review will attempt to remain focused on the relationship between redox stress, the reactive oxygen species and the reactive nitrogen species in the islet, and how these interact with the multiplicative effect of the toxicities of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, amylin (hyperamylinemia), amylin derived islet amyloid and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Redox sensitive cellular signaling systems {{play an important role in}} the development, progressive nature (remodeling) and damaging effects on the beta cell within the islet of the pancreas. Furthermore, redox stress may play an important role in the remodeling and development of islet amyloid creating a space-occupying lesion with a resultant secretory and absorptive defect within the islet. The presence of manifold toxicities necessitates an approach of global risk reduction in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. An improved understanding of the dynamic relationship between these toxicities and redox stress within the islet will aid both the researcher and the clinician...|$|R
40|$|Chronic mental {{diseases}} (CMD) {{like the}} schizophrenias are progressive diseases of heterogenous but poorly understood biological origin. An imbalance in proteostasis is {{a hallmark of}} dysfunctional neurons, leading to impaired clearance and abnormal deposition of protein aggregates. Thus, it can be hypothesized that unbalanced proteostasis in such neurons may also lead to protein aggregates in schizophrenia. These protein aggregates, however, would be more subtle then in the classical neurodegenerative diseases and as such {{have not yet been}} detected. The DISC 1 (Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1) gene is considered among the most promising candidate genes for CMD having been identified as linked to CMD in a Scottish pedigree and having since been found to associate to various phenotypes of CMD. We have recently demonstrated increased insoluble DISC 1 protein in the cingular cortex in approximately 20 % of cases of CMD within the widely used Stanley Medical Research Institute Consortium Collection. Surprisingly, in vitro, DISC 1 aggregates were cell-invasive, i. e., purified aggresomes or recombinant DISC 1 fragments where internalized at an efficiency comparable to that of α-synuclein. Intracellular DISC 1 aggresomes acquired gain-of-function properties in recruiting otherwise soluble proteins such as the candidate schizophrenia protein dysbindin. Disease-associated DISC 1 polymorphism S 704 C led to a higher oligomerization tendency of DISC 1. These findings justify classification of DISC 1 -dependent brain disorders as protein conformational disorders which we have tentatively termed DISC 1 <b>opathies.</b> The notion of disturbed proteostasis and protein aggregation as a mechanism of mental diseases is thus emerging. The yet unidentified form of neuronal impairment in CMD is more subtle than in the classical neurodegenerative diseases without leading to massive cell death and as such present a different kind of neuronal dysfunctionality, eventually confined to highly selective CNS subpopulations...|$|R

While the heads of their respective families occasionally met, therefore, at the bed-side of their patients, the families themselves had no direct communications. It is true, that Mrs. Woolston and Mrs. Yardley were occasionally to be seen seated at the same tea-table, taking their hyson in company, for the recent trade with China had expelled the bohea {{from most of the}} better parlours of the country; nevertheless, these good ladies could not get to be cordial with each other. They themselves had a difference on religious points, that was almost as bitter as the differences of opinions between their husbands on the subject of alternatives. In that distant day, homoeopathy, and allopathy, and hydropathy, and all the <b>opathies,</b> were nearly unknown; but men could wrangle and abuse each other on medical points, just as well and as bitterly then, as they do now. Religion, too, quite as often failed to bear its proper fruits, in 1793, as it proves barren in these, our own times. On this subject of religion, we have one word to say, and that is, simply, that it never was a meet matter for self-gratulation and boasting. Here we have the Americo-Anglican church, just as it has finished a blast of trumpets, through the medium of numberless periodicals and a thousand letters from its confiding if not confident clergy, in honour of its quiet, and harmony, and superior polity, suspended on the very brink of the precipice of separation, if not of schism, and all because it has pleased certain ultra-sublimated divines in the other hemisphere, to write a parcel of tracts that nobody understands, themselves included.
