However, real GDP growth slowed to below 2 percent in 1997 / 98 (fiscal year ending July 15) and, after remaining in single digits over the last several years, the 12 -month inflation rate accelerated, as food prices jumped owing to temporary agricultural supply factors.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the asset {{structure}} and the coverage of <b>gross</b> technical <b>reserves</b> of the Insurance – Reinsurance Company Astra SA, for the period 2003 – 2014. Insurance companies are required to constitute technical reserves, in order to cope with the payment obligations to policyholders. These reserves may only be covered on account of certain assets, admitted by law. In Romania, Orders No. 8 and 9 / 2011, issued by the Insurance Supervisory Commission, contain Rules regarding the assets admitted to cover <b>gross</b> technical <b>reserves,</b> the dispersion of assets admitted to cover <b>gross</b> technical <b>reserves</b> and the liquidity coefficient. Order No. 9 / 2011, relating to general insurance, has been amended by Rule No. 22 / 2014. In this paper, we have analyzed the main elements of Astra’s assets, their share in total assets and we have calculated the coverage of <b>gross</b> technical <b>reserves</b> by total assets and liquid assets. In 2013 and 2014, the value of total assets was below the value of <b>gross</b> tehnical <b>reserves,</b> which demonstrated Astra’s financial instability, through negative capital and the inability to meet the obligations to policyholders. Failure to comply with the prudential indicators has been one of the main causes of Astra`s bankruptcy. ...|$|R

We present a simple model to explain how and why multiple equilibria can occur for some levels of reserves or debt, but not for others. Lastly, we argue that the imperfect credibility of Mexican exchange rate policy made it advisable to follow more contractionary fiscal and monetary policies in 1994. Our model formalizes the reasons why this is so. ...|$|R

Additionally, the administration is also generally transferred to the reinsurer.

Furthermore, the ceding company generally does not have the data or systems to determine the reserves and must rely on the assuming company.
