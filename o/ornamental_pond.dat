To the south-west, near the Home Farm, there is a meadow and to the {{south-east}} there is parkland known as Church Park. The Park is enclosed by woodland, sloped along the valley towards Dawlish, and is used for grazing. Church Park includes exotic trees from the 19th century, {{as well as an}} <b>ornamental</b> <b>pond</b> and waterfall from the same period. In the 20th century, some of the nearby woodland was felled to make glades.|$|E
5|$|Trafford has two medieval castles. Dunham Castle is {{an early}} medieval castle in Dunham Massey. It belonged to Hamon de Massey, and was {{probably}} still standing in the early 14th century. The bailey was landscaped into the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall and its moat turned into an <b>ornamental</b> <b>pond.</b> Watch Hill Castle {{is an early}} medieval motte-and-bailey castle {{on the border of}} Dunham Massey and Bowdon. It is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The motte and surrounding ditch still survives, although it had fallen out of use by the 13th century.|$|E

The recently demolished Bijou Theatre (in Bourke Street) proved a rich resource which provided the beautiful cast iron circular staircase, architrave mouldings {{and some of the}} doors and windows. Helen Lempriere's family donated materials and money to build the <b>ornamental</b> <b>pond.</b> The many doors that open onto the pond area are from the cubicles that were the students' bedrooms, which have now been combined into one long studio. (The original inhabitants' initials can be seen on the front doorstep of each room). The small bluestone tower, limestone studio and Long Gallery were added later to form the closed courtyard.|$|E
500|$|The castle {{originally}} had an outer ward, reached over a bridge, and stables, although {{these have been}} both been lost. Protective rectangular earthworks were constructed to protect the castle on the landward side, probably in 1623, with two bastions {{in the north and}} west corners, and some form of stone structure along the earthworks. In the 18th century these earthworks were described as forming a [...] "deep trench" [...] and mid-19th century accounts suggested that they were around [...] deep. Now only [...] of the bank and ditch survives, with the earthworks approximately [...] wide overall and [...] deep between the top of the bank and the base of the ditch. The north bastion still survives largely intact, although the west has been mostly destroyed. Outside the entrance to the earthworks are the Sandsfoot Gardens, civic gardens dating from 1951, designed in a Tudor style with an <b>ornamental</b> <b>pond.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Aston Lower Grounds, later renamed Villa Park, was not {{the first}} home of Aston Villa F.C. Their {{previous}} venue, Wellington Road, faced increasing problems including an uneven pitch, poor spectator facilities, a lack of access and exorbitant rents. As a result, in 1894 Villa's committee began negotiations with the owners of the Aston Lower Grounds, [...] "the finest sports ground in the district." [...] Situated in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home, the Lower Grounds had seen varied uses over the years. Originally the kitchen garden of Aston Hall's owner Sir Thomas Holte, after whom the Holte End stand was named, it later became a Victorian amusement park with an aquarium and a great hall. The current pitch stands {{on the site of the}} Dovehouse Pool, an <b>ornamental</b> <b>pond</b> that was drained in 1889. In place of the pool, the owners of the Lower Grounds built a cycle track and sports ground that opened on 10 June 1889 for a combined cycling and athletics event before a crowd of 15,000. Negotiations continued for two years before the Villa committee reached agreement with the site's owner, Edgar Flower, to rent the Lower Grounds for £300 per annum on a 21-year lease with an option to buy the site at any point during the term. The committee immediately engaged an architect who began preparing plans for the site, which included construction of a new [...] cement cycle track to replace the existing cinder one. The main stand was to be built to the east on the Witton Lane side, with the track and pitch fully enclosed by banking. Construction of the final phase of the stadium began in late 1896 after negotiations with contractors over the price. Several months behind schedule, the almost-complete stadium opened with a friendly against Blackburn Rovers on 17 April 1897, one week after Aston Villa had completed the League and FA Cup 'Double'. The process of fixing issues with the building work continued for several months. As built, the stadium could house 40,000 spectators, most of whom stood in the open on the banking.|$|E

2500|$|Ibrahim Rauza (‘Rauza’ means “tomb”) {{also known}} as Ali Rauza, built in 1627, {{contains}} the tomb of Ibrahim Adil Shah II and his queen Taj Sultana. It was originally intended to be the tomb for the queen. It is a fine square structure with twin buildings with delicate carvings. It was designed by the Persian architect, Malik Sandal (his grave also lies in the courtyard). The tomb (of Ibrahim Adil Shah II, his two sons and his mother) {{on the left and}} a mosque on the right within it are set in a walled garden (about [...] square) facing each other over an <b>ornamental</b> <b>pond.</b> The tomb as such is in a central chamber of [...] square and has a ceiling that is divided into nine squares with curved sides. Graceful minarets mark the corners of each symmetrical building, surmounted by a dome rising from a lotus petal base. Steps are provided to approach the raised platform on which the two structures have been built. It is said that this tomb provided the inspiration for building the Taj Mahal at Agra. The structure has been erected on a single rock slab and has a basement, which was used to store ammunitions and food. In the prayer hall in the mosque, there are two chains carved out of a single rock. It has impressive gateways. The doors are made of teak wood braced with metal strips and decorated. The inner perimeter of the Mausoleum has well crafted arches. The outer walls of the tomb have panels displaying geometric and calligraphic designs in the form of perforated screens and shallow relief. The windows and doors also have similar motifs, which allow light to penetrate into the tomb chamber. A special acoustic feature of the mosque mentioned is that standing next to grave of the Sultan inside the tomb at one end, prayers can be distinctly heard at the other end. Impressed by its architectural splendour, Henry Cousens, an expert in Art and Architecture called it the [...] "Taj Mahal of the South".|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{ecological}} {{survey was}} carried out to determine the water body concentrations of nutrients and its factors in Xixi National Wetland Park, China. According to the intensities of human activities, water body was classified into natural <b>ponds,</b> <b>ornamental</b> <b>ponds,</b> natural creeks and sight-seeing creeks. Based on calculated Trophic State Index (TSI), we can get conclusion that the trophic status of different water body types all exceeded the eutrophic level in the Xixi National Wetland Park. The natural creeks showed the highest TSI, followed by <b>ornamental</b> <b>ponds,</b> sight-seeing creeks and natural ponds, suggesting that natural creeks {{should be considered as}} priority sites for the implementation of water quality improvement. The main factors for trophic status in Xixi Wetland Park were discussed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and multiple linear regression analysis (MLR). As a result, the trophic states in ponds were mainly controlled by hydrophyte cover. The trophic states in creeks made great relation to creek width and water quality of inflows. So we can find that human management can improve water quality by planting macrophytes of wetlands and controlling sewage water inflows from surrounding areas...|$|R
