25|$|Because the Festival Express tour {{turned out}} to be a {{complete}} financial disaster, the film project was shelved soon afterwards, as the promoters sued the filmmakers, and the footage mysteriously disappeared. Some of the film's reels turned up in the garage of the original producer Willem Poolman, where they had been stored for decades and used at various times as goal posts for ball hockey games played by his son Gavin. The plan to resurrect the film was started in 1999 by executive producer Garth Douglas and story consultant James Cullingham, who found many more reels in the Canadian National Film Archives vault, where it had been kept in pristine condition and unknown to the world. Garth got in touch with Gavin, who had grown up to become a London-based film producer. Gavin produced the film together with his <b>old</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> friend John Trapman (who had played in some of those ball hockey games), and Bob Smeaton, double Grammy Award-winning director of The Beatles Anthology was brought on board. The music tracks were mixed at Toronto's MetalWorks Studios, and produced by Eddie Kramer, Jimi Hendrix's producer, and engineer for Led Zeppelin, Woodstock, and Derek & The Dominos Live In Concert.|$|E
