When Louis II of Hungary {{was killed in}} the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Hungary was divided between pro-Habsburg Royal Hungary and pro-Zápolya Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. The parties were engaged in the Little War in Hungary. Zápolya had {{sustained}} his claim only by gaining support from and becoming vassal of the Ottoman Empire. Bona Sforza, ardent opponent of the Habsburgs, supported Zápolya and tried to convince her husband Sigismund to provide military support and Isabella's hand. Sigismund, whose first wife was Zápolya's sister Barbara, refused not wanting to upset the Habsburgs and doubting Zápolya's ability to hold onto his throne. Eventually, Sigismund relented <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> a peace treaty is concluded between Zápolya and the Habsburgs. The Treaty of Nagyvárad was signed in February 1538 in part due to Sigismund's requirement. Archduke Ferdinand of Austria and Zápolya agreed to divide Hungary between themselves and that Ferdinand was to inherit Zápolya's territory since at that time he was childless.|$|E

Our approach relies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rank <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> must be satisfied when the scene exhibits “specular + diffuse ” reflectance characteristics. This constraint is used to define a cost functional for the discrepancy between the measured images and those generated by the estimate of the scene, rather than attempting to match image-to-image directly. Minimizing such a functional yields the optimal estimate of the shape of the scene, represented by a dense surface, as well as its radiance, represented by four functions defined <b>on</b> such <b>a</b> surface.

For linear spaces of functions, such as the family of n-variate degree-d polynomials, this eliminates the dependence on the condition number.
