5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene {{towards the end of}} the novel.|$|E
5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, the English {{began to}} {{consider}} themselves {{superior to the}} Welsh, Scots and Bretons. The English perceived themselves as civilised, economically prosperous and properly Christian, while the Celtic fringe was considered lazy, barbarous and backward. Following the invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, similar feelings were expressed about the Irish, with the distinctions clarified and reinforced in 14th-century English legislation. The English also felt strongly about the foreign traders {{who lived in the}} special enclaves in London in the Late Middle Ages; the position of the Jews is described below, but Italian and Baltic traders were also regarded as aliens and were frequently the targets of violence during economic downturns. Even within England, different identities abounded, each with their <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> status and importance. Regional identities could be important - men and women from Yorkshire, for example, had a clear identity within English society, and professional groups with a distinct identity, such as lawyers, engaged in open fighting with others in cities such as London.|$|E

25|$|Legalization of {{the organ}} trade {{carries with it}} its <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> justice as well.

Legalization of the international organ trade could lead to increased supply, lowering prices so that persons outside the wealthiest segments could afford such organs as well.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done to}} its reputation by devaluation, Wilson's Government suffered from the perception that its response to industrial relations problems was inadequate. A six-week strike of members of the National Union of Seamen, which began shortly after Wilson' re-election in 1966, did much to reinforce this perception, along with Wilson's <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> insecurity in office.|$|E

25|$|Bullying: A bully may project his/her own {{feelings}} of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite {{the fact that}} a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal insecurity and/or vulnerability. Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.|$|E
25|$|Shaffer was {{inspired}} to write Equus when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses {{in a small town}} near Suffolk. He set out to construct a fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime. The play's action is something of a detective story, involving the attempts of the child psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart to understand the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> purpose.|$|E

50|$|From the {{perspective}} of the stigmatizer, stigmatization involves dehumanization, threat, aversion and sometimes the depersonalization of others into stereotypic caricatures. Stigmatizing others can serve several functions for an individual, including self-esteem enhancement, control enhancement, and anxiety buffering, through downward-comparison—comparing oneself to less fortunate others can increase one's <b>own</b> subjective <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> well-being and therefore boost one's self-esteem.|$|R

Wade surprises Evans and nearly strangles him, but relents when Evans reveals that delivering Wade to the train {{is not only to}} provide for his family, but to restore his <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> honor, and give his sons something good to remember him for. Wade then admits he has already been to Yuma Prison and escaped twice, and agrees to board the train, allowing Evans' contract to be fulfilled.|$|E
25|$|Turkey {{does not}} appear to be the scene of {{large-scale}} or overt expressions of racism against individuals in the strictest sense of term. However, one of the main challenges facing Turkey in the field of ECRI's (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) concerns would appear to be the need to reconcile the strong sense of national identity and the wish to preserve the unity and integrity of the State with the right of different minority groups within Turkey to express their <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ethnic identity, for example through the maintenance and development of linguistic and cultural aspects of that identity.|$|E
25|$|She {{should have}} been a man – a great navigator. Her {{powerful}} reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> right, was concerned.|$|E

40|$|Everyday life in {{contemporary}} rural China {{is characterized by}} an increased <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> moral challenge and uncertainty. Ordinary people often find themselves caught between the moral frameworks of capitalism, Maoism, and the Chinese tradition. This ethnographic study of the village of Zhongba (in Hubei Province, central China) {{is an attempt to}} grasp the ethical reflexivity of everyday life in rural China. Drawing on descriptions of village life, interspersed with targeted theoretical analyses, the author examines how ordinary people construct their <b>own</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> their lives and their futures in everyday activities: building houses, working, celebrating marriages and funerals, gambling, and dealing with local government. The villagers confront moral uncertainty; they creatively harmonize public discourse and local practice; and sometimes they resolve incoherence and unease through the use of irony. In so doing, they perform everyday ethics and re-create transient moral communities at a time of massive social dislocation...|$|R

If people cannot form these intimate relationships—perhaps because <b>of</b> their <b>own</b> needs—a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> isolation may result; arousing feelings of darkness and angst.|$|R
