40|$|Location is {{the basis}} for the {{realization}} <b>of</b> <b>location</b> services, the integrity <b>of</b> the <b>location</b> information and its way of representation in indoor space model directly restricts the quality <b>of</b> <b>location</b> services. The construction of the existing indoor space model is mostly for specific applications and lack of uniform representation <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information. Several geospatial standards have been developed to meet the requirement of the indoor spatial information system, among which CityGML LOD 4 and IndoorGML are the most relevant ones for indoor spatial information. However, from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>Location</b> Based Service (LBS), the CityGML LOD 4 is more inclined to visualize the indoor space. Although IndoorGML is mainly used for indoor space navigation and has description (such as geometry, topology, and semantics) benefiting for indoor LBS, this standard model lack explicit representation <b>of</b> indoor <b>location</b> information. In this paper, from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>Location</b> Based Service (LBS), based on the IndoorGML standard, an indoor space location model (ISLM) conforming to human cognition is proposed through integration of the geometric and topological and semantic features of the indoor spatial entity. This model has the explicit description <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information which the standard indoor space model of IndoorGML and CityGML LOD 4 does not have, which can lay the theoretical foundation for indoor location service such as indoor navigation, indoor routing and location query...|$|R

Issues discussed include the types <b>of</b> <b>location</b> sensors (which are categorised as physical, virtual or logical); the processing <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information; and an architecture for a location management system.

At a national level, Cluj-Napoca is located on three different main national roads: DN1, DN1C and DN1F. The Romanian Motorway A3, also known as Transylvania Motorway (Autostrada Transilvania), currently under construction, will link the city with Bucharest and Romania's western border. The 2B section between Câmpia Turzii and Cluj Vest (Gilău) opened in late 2010.

In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy.

40|$|<b>Location</b> {{information}} is <b>of</b> increasing {{importance for the}} execution of governmental tasks. Most {{of the information that}} is used by government has a spatial component. Like other types of governmental information, location-based information can be collected, managed, used, and exchanged with support of new information and communication technologies (ICT). In past years, governments have implemented many initiatives to promote and facilitate the use and exchange <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information. In many cases these initiatives are situated outside the e-government area. However, many authors and practitioners have stressed the need for the integration <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information activities within e-government. In order {{to bridge the gap between}} location information activities and e-government, several governments have developed and implemented a location information strategy. The objective of this chapter is to explore how the development <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information strategies contributes to a better integration <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information in e-government. An analysis <b>of</b> four European <b>location</b> information strategies shows that these strategies have two elements in common: they all highlight the significance <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information for realizing the objectives of e-government and define requirements and actions for a better understanding and wider use <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information. A better integration <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information in e-government provides benefits to governments, citizens, and businesses. Key actions for realizing these benefits are improving the access to location information, establishing core reference data, and providing society with the skills and knowledge necessary for handling location information. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Location {{management}} {{is an essential}} component of many of the current communication net-work technologies that provide services to mobile users, e. g., Mobile Internet Protocol (MobileIP) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). The basic operations <b>of</b> <b>location</b> manage-ment are the pushing <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information (i. e., updating) and the pulling <b>of</b> <b>location</b> informa-tion (i. e., searching) around the network. Current trends in population rise, size of coverage and decrease in size of the registration/location areas greatly impact the overhead <b>of</b> <b>location</b> manage-ment. Performance improvements on location management schemes have been based on the up-date/search trade-off. However, saturation of trade-off optimizations pushes research toward finding new ways to improve performance <b>of</b> <b>location</b> management. Location area overlapping is one such performance improvement with benefits widely known in the research community. However, the limits of the improvements which location area overlapping offers are generally unexplored. In this thesis, new ways <b>of</b> optimizing <b>location</b> management are devised through the study of optimization problems that arise from the application of overlapping registration areas in mobil...|$|R
