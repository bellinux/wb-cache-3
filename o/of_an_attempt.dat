Despite being tortured, he refuses to reveal the identities of his co-conspirators. Dorothea goes to Süß to beg for her husband's release but Süß demands that she have sex with him as the price for her husband's freedom. Süß rapes Dorothea, who then escapes and drowns herself.

5|$|If {{someone is}} found guilty <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt,</b> they are sentenced under section 4(1) of the 1981 Act. This {{provides}} {{that anyone who}} attempts to commit an offence will be punished with {{the same period in}} prison as if they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced to a maximum of seven years.|$|E
5|$|Mathews and {{his troops}} {{also played a}} key role in the ending of the Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 which erupted out <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to bypass the {{requirement}} that new Sultans must be vetted by the British consul. During his time as first minister Mathews continued to be involved with the military and was part of two large campaigns, one to Witu and another to Mwele.|$|E
5|$|Opened as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to {{encourage}} holiday {{traffic on the}} line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club. The station facilities were very basic, consisting {{of no more than}} a single wooden platform, which cost £170 to build, two wooden benches and running in board together with the obligatory oil lamps. No shelter was provided for passengers and the platform was constructed of sleepers and supported by wooden trestles.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} occurred {{following a}} failed landing by Australian forces at Porton Plantation in early June, which was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to outflank {{a series of}} strong points that the Japanese had built across {{the base of the}} Bonis Peninsula. After this, the fighting in the northern sector around Ratsua essentially became a containment action for the Australians as they concentrated their efforts and resources upon driving south towards Buin, which was the main centre of Japanese resistance on the island at the time. As a result, the situation around Ratsua remained largely static until the end of hostilities in mid-August 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included {{a number of significant}} figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to facilitate a Celtic Revival, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The power station's use {{of biomass}} since 2004 {{has been part}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO2) output. In 2002 and 2004 the station met its targets for {{reduction}} in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, in 2006 the power station was revealed as having the fourth highest CO2 emissions {{in the north of}} England, for producing 2,685,512 tonnes of CO2 per year. However, generally the station reduced it CO2 emissions by 65% between 1990 and 2010, and the local air quality meets UK and European standards.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, Nicolls {{was posted}} to Spanish Florida as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to recruit the Seminoles as allies against the United States. He was to operate from a {{position}} established in April 1814 at Prospect Bluff (sometimes called the British Post, later the Negro Fort, replaced still later by Fort Gadsden). Sailing from Bermuda {{in the summer of}} 1814, the expedition Nicolls commanded stopped in Spanish Havana, where it was told not to land in Florida without prior request by the Captain General, Juan Ruiz de Apodaca. When Nicolls arrived at Prospect Bluff, Florida in August, the Spanish Governor of Pensacola, Don Mateo González Manrique, aware of the threat the Americans posed to Florida, requested the redeployment of British forces to Pensacola.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a revolt}} in 1028, Harald's brother Olaf {{was forced into}} exile until he {{returned}} to Norway in early 1030. On hearing news of Olaf's planned return, Harald gathered 600 men from the Uplands to meet Olaf and his men upon their arrival in the east of Norway. After a friendly welcome, Olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030, in which Harald took part on his brother's side. The battle was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to restore Olaf to the Norwegian throne, which had been captured by the Danish king Cnut the Great. The battle resulted in defeat for the brothers {{at the hands of}} those Norwegians who were loyal to Cnut, and Olaf was killed while Harald was badly wounded. Harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the main block. The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal within five years.|$|E
5|$|In May 1916 the Australian Government {{offered the}} British Army Council a sixth {{division}} of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the Australian Army's main expeditionary force during World War I. This offer was an element <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to establish an Australian and New Zealand Army, though the Australian Government acknowledged that forming a sixth division could cause difficulties in providing sufficient reinforcements to replace the AIF's casualties from December 1916. In such an event, the government proposed breaking up the division to reinforce the five others. The Army Council declined this offer as it preferred Australia to raise only as many units as it could reinforce.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Mills-Roberts {{arrived from}} the United Kingdom {{to take over the}} unit, and he was in command when on 26 February 1943 they were {{involved}} in bitter fighting against two battalions of German parachute infantry with armoured support which attacked their position as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to encircle the 1st Army by cutting the Medjez road. In a fight that lasted over five hours, against an enemy that outnumbered them and had the advantage of heavy armoured support, the commandos, along with elements from the Reconnaissance Regiment, were able to stop the advance long enough for reinforcements to be brought up. In this action, No. 6 Commando incurred 11 killed, 34 wounded and 55 missing in action. This represented over 40 per cent of the unit's strength at the time, although later a number of those that were captured were recovered after the Germans withdrew.|$|E

5|$|In the arts, Romanticism {{manifested}} itself in literature and drama in {{the adoption of the}} mythical bard Ossian, the exploration of national poetry in the work of Robert Burns and in the historical novels of Walter Scott. Scott also had a major impact on the development of a national Scottish drama. Art was heavily influenced by Ossian and a new view of the Highlands as the location of a wild and dramatic landscape. Scott profoundly affected architecture through his re-building of Abbotsford House in the early nineteenth century, which set off the boom in the Scots Baronial revival. In music, Burns was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> to produce a canon of Scottish song, which resulted in a cross fertilisation of Scottish and continental classical music, with romantic music becoming dominant in Scotland into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E

Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were Anna Traquair (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding.|$|E
