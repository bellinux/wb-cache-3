40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} predictors <b>of</b> <b>grandparent</b> caregiver health status. Additional purposes were to describe the physical and emotional health <b>of</b> <b>grandparent</b> caregivers and the perceived benefits of support group attendance. A convenience sample <b>of</b> 42 <b>grandparents</b> was recruited from support groups. Data were collected through telephone interviews. Grandparents who had higher parenting stress reported lower levels of physical, social, and mental health. Inverse correlations were present between life stress and mental health. Positive correlations were found between social support and physical health. No pattern emerged in a comparison of the health <b>of</b> care-giving <b>grandparents</b> and a normative sample. Emotional support was the primary benefit derived from support group attendance.

Raised by an assortment <b>of</b> <b>grandparents,</b> aunts and uncles, he rarely saw his mother while growing up and never knew his father, who died in the United States while Lamb was young. Lamb spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandmother and her new husband Christopher Collins at their home on York Street in the South Central neighbourhood of Windsor, where his presence was resented by the step-grandfather Collins. According to interviews with relatives, friends and neighbours conducted by Lamb's legal counsel Saul Nosanchuk in the mid-1960s, Collins subjected the boy to sustained emotional and physical abuse, beating him and frequently calling him a [...] "little [...] ". The direction of this violence was not limited to Lamb himself, however; he often witnessed his step-grandfather and grandmother fighting while he was still a small boy.|$|E

Although custodial grandparenting cuts across gender, class, and ethnic lines, single women, African Americans, and low income persons are disproportionately represented. Multivariate logistic analysis indicates that three groups — women, recently bereaved parents, and African Americans — have approximately twice the odds <b>of</b> becoming caregiving <b>grandparents.</b> Implications for further research, policy, and practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Grandparent caregiving {{responsibilities}} influence {{feelings of}} burden in many older adults. Though grandparenting is traditionally {{seen as a}} rewarding experience for Chinese older adults, some research has pointed to the possibility <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting</b> burden in Chinese older adults in the U. S. However, there is a paucity of research concerning prevalence <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting</b> burden in Chinese older adults. This study aims to provide an overall estimate on grandparenting burden and examine its correlations with socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported health data, and time spent caring for grandchildren. Data was collected through the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE) study. This community-based participatory research study surveyed a total of 3, 159 Chinese older adults aged 60 and above, 2, 146 of whom have grandchildren. We used four questions on a Likert-scale to determine levels <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting</b> burden. Our study found 22 % of our participants who are grandparents experience grandparenting burden. Younger age (r = 0. 12), living with four or more people (r = 0. 09), lower overall health status (r = 0. 09), lower quality of life (r = 0. 09), and more time spent caring for grandchildren (r = 0. 37) were correlated with grandparenting burden. Our findings show that grandparenting is not a necessarily rewarding experience for Chinese older adults, and that certain subsets of the population {{are more likely to}} experience grandparenting burden. Future longitudinal research should be conducted to determine causality as well the psychological, physical, and social effects <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting</b> burden...|$|R

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has been done}} to investigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting</b> on grandparents' health. However, most of these studies were conducted in Western societies and have found mixed results. In addition, previous studies were often hampered by small-scale convenience samples, cross-sectional design, or lack of theoretical frameworks. To fill these gaps, this study draws data from the Department of Health in Taiwan to extend the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting</b> to a cultural context that differs from the United States, where the majority of the research in this area has been conducted. The main purposes of this study are to explore the social and cultural context <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting</b> in Taiwan, and to examine the implications <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting</b> on grandparents' health. 	To examine the profile of grandparental care and its health implications in Taiwan, this study uses the Study of Health and Living Status of the Elderly (SHLSE) data. It first uses the 1996 wave of data to examine how individual characteristics and attitudes toward grandparenting are related to the practice <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting.</b> Then it conducts longitudinal analysis using data from the 1996, 1999, and 2003 waves to evaluate the impacts <b>of</b> <b>grandparenting</b> on grandparents' physical health. Last, based on a conceptual framework and its assumptions, structural equation modeling is utilized to investigate the relationships among grandparenting, stress, and social support, and their implications for grandparents' mental health. The findings reveal that grandparental care is a common phenomenon in Taiwan, and it exists across genders and social classes. Both grandfathers and grandmothers embrace supportive attitudes toward providing care for grandchildren. One-fourth of grandfathers and more than one-third of grandmothers were providing certain levels of care for their grandchildren in 1996. It also finds that providing care on a regular basis for grandchildren has protective effects on grandparents' health, regardless of grandparents' gender, age, or living arrangement. Moreover, while it remains highly prevalent and normative for Taiwanese families to adopt a multi-generational living arrangement, such arrangement does facilitate interactions and exchanges between generations, and grandparents can benefit from providing childcare through the elevated social support they receive. This study demonstrates that while older adults are usually profiled as care recipients, actually a significant portion of them are assuming substantial responsibility in childcare for their families as well as for our society. Although most of the literature on grandparenting is from the United States, this study suggests caution in assuming that findings in America may be valid across societies, or that interventions based on these findings can be applicable in other countries...|$|R
