40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} is to re-examine how Calvin {{understood}} <b>the</b> threefold <b>office,</b> with {{particular attention to}} <b>the</b> prophetic <b>office,</b> In his Christology. The author suggests that <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> are best understood In light of Calvin's fresh Interpretations of Chalcedonlan Christology and <b>the</b> Insights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformation. <b>The</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> is their Interrelation. Calvin understood <b>the</b> unity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> in their relational character. Relational In <b>the</b> person <b>of</b> Christ as divine and human, and relational In <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trinity. These two elements, <b>the</b> relationality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediator, premised upon <b>the</b> relation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trinity, gave <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> <b>the</b> necessary ontological structure from which Calvin could postulate a theory of redemption with a single point of view, rather than previous theories of redemption which are simply juxtaposed. This unifying centre Is <b>the</b> person <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediator in <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offices.</b> It Is from this centre that Calvin interpreted the various biblical metaphors which are extremely difficult to bring together Into a unity. The argument Is carried further as <b>the</b> prophetic <b>office</b> In Calvin Is shown to contain the required ontological structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>offices</b> <b>of</b> king and priest. Calvin's Insistence on <b>the</b> unity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> God in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> explains why there is a unity within the Church, which transcend temporal distinctions. <b>The</b> distinctions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> in history allows Calvin to underscore <b>the</b> centrality <b>of</b> Christ's incarnation into a particular time In history, further grounding <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> God In history and creation...|$|R
