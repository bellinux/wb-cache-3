Zhukov was then slammed to the mat back-first and headbutted from the top rope, which allowed The Barbarian to pin him.|$|E

50|$|Tyndale then {{asks what}} to do with the Pope’s false authority. He accuses the Pope (then Clement VII) of {{inverting}} God’s law: making what is a sin not, and that which is not a sin, sin. The Pope has unrightfully taken the authority to damn people to purgatory. “How hath he authority above God’s laws and to command the angels, the saints and God himself?” (124). Tyndale asks the church, “Who gave the Pope the authority to command God to damn people?” Tyndale states that God commanded the clergy to bless the people, and the church asks God to damn them. “Paul also in many things which God had made free, gave pure and faithful counsel without tangling of any man’s conscience and without all manner commanding under <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> cursing, <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> excommunication, <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> heresy, <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> burning, <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> deadly sin, <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> hell and <b>pain</b> <b>of</b> damnation” (77).|$|R

The search on the treatment <b>of</b> burn <b>pain</b> yielded a total of 213 publications, 14 of which fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria, highlighting the limited amount of evidence available on the treatment <b>of</b> burn-induced <b>pain.</b> The pathophysiology <b>of</b> burn <b>pain</b> is poorly understood, with limited clinical trials available to assess the effectiveness of analgesics in burn patients.

5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{reduction}} {{can reduce}} the unpleasantness <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> but is least effective for moderate and severe pain.
