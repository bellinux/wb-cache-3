25|$|A {{period of}} fragmentation, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, {{followed}} {{the fall of}} the Tang dynasty until China was unified under the Song dynasty. During the Song dynasty, footbinding began to spread among the elite in China, and the practice may have started during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period among female dancers. One story concerns the favorite concubine of the Southern Tang emperor Li Yu who bound her feet into the shape of the crescent moon and performed a lotus dance on the point <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> ballet-fashion. While originating from dancing, footbinding which became more prevalent during the Song dynasty would also contribute to the decline of dance as an art form. After the Song dynasty, less and less was heard about beauties and courtesans who were also great dancers. More severe binding in the subsequent eras also restricted female movement which, together increasing social restrictions placed on women, would eventually led to the virtual elimination of female dancers in later eras. Nevertheless there were still female dance troupes with bound feet formed in the 20th century as novelty acts.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} interpretations of the pose held by Dakshinakaali, {{including those of the}} 18th and 19th century bhakti poet-devotees such as Ramprasad Sen. Most have to do with battle imagery and tantric metaphysics. The most popular however is a devotional view. According to Rachel Fell McDermott, the poets portrayed Siva as [...] "the devotee who falls at [...] feet in devotion, or in surrender of his ego, or in hopes of gaining moksha by her touch. In fact, Siva is said to have become so enchanted by Kaali that he performed austerities to win her, and having received the treasure <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> held them against his heart in reverence.|$|E
500|$|Following his flight, a {{military}} dictatorship took power. The new authorities removed Evita's body from display, and its whereabouts were a mystery for 16 years. From 1955 until 1971, the military dictatorship of Argentina issued {{a ban on}} Peronism. It became illegal not only to possess pictures of Juan and Eva Perón in one's home, but to speak their names. In 1971, the military revealed that Evita's body was buried in a crypt in Milan, Italy, under the name [...] "María Maggi." [...] It appeared that her body had been damaged during its transport and storage, such as compressions to her face and disfigurement of one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> due to the body having been left in an upright position.|$|E
2500|$|While in Europe, {{she also}} {{influenced}} hat styles {{on the continent}} as well as spring fashion collections, featuring the Dunham line and Caribbean Rhapsody, and the Chiroteque Française made a bronze cast <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> for a museum of important personalities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Just {{prior to}} the attack, Knoller was taking the dogs up to the roof; Bane [...] and {{possibly}} Hera [...] attacked Whipple in the hallway. (Hera's role in the mauling has never been firmly established.) Whipple suffered a total of 77 wounds to every part of her body except her scalp and bottoms <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> Another neighbor called 911 after hearing Whipple's screams. Whipple died hours later at San Francisco General Hospital from [...] "loss of blood from multiple traumatic injuries (dog bite wounds)".|$|E
2500|$|By {{this time}} the rash had spread and covered all Parker's body, {{including}} the palms of her hands and soles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> and it was confluent on her face. [...] At 10pm {{she was on her}} way to Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital near Solihull. By 11pm all her close contacts, including her parents, were placed in quarantine. Her parents were later also transferred to Catherine-de-Barnes. The next day, poxvirus infection was confirmed by electron microscopy of vesicle fluid. Parker died of smallpox at Catherine-de-Barnes on 11 September 1978.|$|E
2500|$|During {{pre-season}} {{training for}} the 2012–13 season, Sutherland was diagnosed with Plantar fasciitis, or [...] "jogger's heel", initially in one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> but later in both. [...] The jogger's heel put her at a disadvantage against most of her team mates, but eventually she fought back to resume {{her place in the}} Breakers squad. [...] In 2013–14, Sutherland played in all the Breakers' WNCL games apart from the first one, which she missed due to a broken thumb, and took a bag full of wickets in the Twenty20 competition. [...] At the end of that season, she was once again selected for a Shooting Stars tour, to Sri Lanka.|$|E

2500|$|The {{general view}} is that the {{practice}} is likely to have originated from the time of Emperor Li Yu (Southern Tang of the Ten Kingdoms, just before the Song dynasty). Emperor Li Yu created a six-foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine [...] to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and performed a ballet-like dance on the points <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> on the lotus. Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her. The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.|$|E
2500|$|As well {{as being}} blatant in his observations, Gillray could be {{incredibly}} subtle, and puncture vanity with a remarkably deft approach. The outstanding {{example of this is}} his print Fashionable Contrasts;—or—The Duchess's little Shoe yeilding [...] to the Magnitude of the Duke's Foot. This was a devastating image aimed at the ridiculous sycophancy directed by the press towards Frederica Charlotte Ulrica, Duchess of York, and the supposed daintiness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> The print showed only the feet and ankles of the Duke and Duchess of York, in an obviously copulatory position, with the Duke's feet enlarged and the Duchess's feet drawn very small. This print silenced forever the sycophancy of the press regarding the union of the Duke and Duchess.|$|E
2500|$|... 28th May, 1719. I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in her toes and the soles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> until the tears came into her eyes. I went away because I saw that she refrained from crying out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E
