40|$|This {{article is}} about the {{criminal}} law provisions relating to crimes involving computers, and the risks these provisions may pose to people dealing with <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> {{in the nature of}} a trade secret, as illustrated by recent cases. There is a growing international trend toward use of the criminal law to protect <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> and trade secrets. A growing number of jurisdictions have criminal provisions applying in some form to the taking of trade secrets. United States law has included such criminal provisions for some years. New Zealand law has also had provisions since 2003, and requirements for such provisions are being included in trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partner-ship Agreement (TPPA). The primary justification for criminalisation is generally concern about foreign hackers, but inevitably employees and ex-employees are among the likely defendants. There has not yet been a lot of case law involving the taking of <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> under the New Zealand provisions, but there have been two significant recent cases. This article reviews the recent New Zealand cases and considers the implications for employees and <b>others</b> dealing with <b>confidential</b> <b>information.</b> It is arguable that the availability of the criminal law in these cases creates excessive risks for individual employees and more broadly for employee mobility and the sharing of information, perhaps most troublingly in knowledge-based industries...|$|R
30|$|Building {{trust between}} Asian {{immigrants}} and hosts and host services {{emerged as an}} area needing attention.

Furthermore, seeking help for gambling related problems is not the norm for most Asians; hence, {{it is important to}} normalise talking about these problems and help-seeking behaviour. This can be done by reducing the stigma associated with problem gambling, changing perceptions of help-seeking and providing culturally appropriate services. Asian immigrant communities also appear to have limited knowledge about the dangers of gambling and need to be educated about these. There is a need to dispel misconceptions about gambling behaviours and to provide information on services.|$|R

In commercial environment the whole thing depends on the other resource to transmit the data securely and retain the data as well in the regular medium.

Most of the challenging issues in this scenario are the enforcement of authorization policies and the policies update for secure data retrieval.

Additionally, DCA believed that the extremely short window for evaluating the bids and selecting the winning registry operator provided for in the RFP demonstrates that the outcome was predetermined. The RFP gave the evaluators only seven days (five business days) to review the proposals and notify the winner, which is simply not enough time for any meaningful evaluation, particularly considering that the RFP asked for much of the same information as required in the ICANN gTLD application, which is evaluated over a period of six months or more. Moreover, the people who were invited to join the AUC DotAfrica Task Force had numerous conflicts of interest that should have precluded them from being involved in the AUC’s process of choosing the potential registry operator.|$|E

The use of electronic tools and processes such as data sampling and web harvesting are acceptable practices. Parties are encouraged to agree early in the litigation process on production format required for the exchange of relevant documents as part of the discovery process (native files, pdf, tiff, metadata requirements etc). Agreements or direction should be sought, if necessary, with respect to [...] or <b>other</b> <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> related to production of electronic documents and data.

40|$|Abstract Having {{observed}} carefully {{the dynamics}} of e- activity and technology in business, finance and other realms of human endeavour, the issue of data and information security with computer networks becomes more relevant {{in order to keep}} up with the growing trend, hence the need to carefully address some important issues concerning data and information security. Information and data security, computer security are often incorrectly used interchangeably. These fields are interrelated often and share the common goals of protecting confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Computer security can focus on ensuring the availability and correct operation of a computer system without concern for the information stored or processed by the computer. Governments and other realms of human endeavour amass a great deal of <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> about their employees, customers, products, research and financial status. Most of this information is now collected, processed and stored on electronics computers and transmitted across networks to <b>other</b> computer. Protecting <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> is a business requirement and in various cases also an ethical and legal requirement.
