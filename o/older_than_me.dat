25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

[...] He said that much of the record was [...] "an attempt to go back to what's important at a musical core and build it outward."

5000|$|A {{particular}} {{case of this}} type occurs when a pronoun stands alone following the word than. Here the objective form is again predominant in informal usage (they are <b>older</b> <b>than</b> us), {{as would be expected}} if than were analyzed as a preposition. However traditionally than is considered a conjunction, and so in formal and grammatically careful English the pronoun often takes the form that would appear if than were followed by a clause: they are <b>older</b> <b>than</b> we (by analogy with ...than we are), but she likes him better <b>than</b> <b>me</b> (if the intended meaning is [...] "...than she likes me").|$|R

2500|$|Marc Alexander Hunter {{was born}} in Taumarunui on 7 September 1953. In the late 1950s his family {{performed}} publicly where his father, Stuart, played saxophone, his mother, Voi, on piano and his older brother, Todd Hunter (born 1951), on guitar with Marc providing drums. He also grew up with two younger brothers, Ross and Brett. Hunter remembered, [...] "We got guitars for Christmas one year, I broke mine but Todd played his. He was two years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>me</b> and always more interested in music. I only {{saw it as a}} way of wagging school." [...] He described his home town, [...] " [...] was a great place to grow up in, and a great place to run away from, because you always knew you could go back to it and nothing much would have changed. It was the place where our parents always told us to 'Do what you want to do, just try and be happy doing it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Silverstein and Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show {{became a}} great combination. [...] Haffkine having {{a knack for}} picking great songs, quickly became Dr. Hook’s #1 A man, {{as well as their}} {{producer}} and manager. [...] Silverstein wrote all the songs for their self-titled debut album, released in 1971, Doctor Hook featured lead vocals, guitar, bass and harmonica by Locorriere, guitarist Cummings, singer Sawyer, drummer David, singer/guitarist, and keyboard player Billy Francis. The album included their first hit, [...] "Sylvia's Mother". [...] "Sylvia's Mother," [...] a subtle parody of teen-heartbreak weepers, flopped on first release, but with some more promotional muscle became the band's first million-seller and hit the Top Five in the summer of 1972. Other titles on the album included Marie Lavaux, Sing Me A Rainbow, Hey Lady Godiva, Four Years <b>Older</b> <b>Than</b> <b>Me,</b> Kiss It Away, Makin' It Natural, I Call That True Love, When She Cries, Judy, Mama, I'll Sing One Song For You. It has been released 20 times in the US, UK, Netherlands, Italy, Yugoslavia, Canada, Europe, Spain and Greece.|$|E

Five cow-punchers, friends they was, had been visitin' town. One feller, playful-like, takes another feller's quirt--that's a whip. An' the other feller, playful-like, says, 'Give it back.' Then they tussles for it, an' rolls on the ground. I was laughin', as was everybody, when, suddenly, {{the owner of the}} quirt thumps his friend. Both cowboys got up, slow, an' watchin' of each other. Then the first feller, who had started the play, pulls his gun. He'd hardly flashed it when they all pulls guns, an' it was some noisy an' smoky. In about five seconds there was five dead cowpunchers. Killed themselves, as you might say, just for fun. That's what life was worth in old Dodge." [...] After this story I felt more kindly {{disposed}} ward my travelling companion, and would have asked for more romances but the conductor came along and engaged him in conversation. Then my neighbor across the aisle, a young fellow not much <b>older</b> <b>than</b> myself, asked <b>me</b> to talk to him.|$|R

5000|$|Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me</b> {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on nine reviews. Damiem Morris of The Observer said, [...] "The more modish tracks are somehow less inventive than their titles, but there's much southern-stewed, offbeat beauty elsewhere to compensate." [...] Preezy of XXL said, [...] "Nine albums removed from anonymity, Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me</b> secures Rick Ross' slot within the list Top 5 of rap soloists {{to emerge from}} the South over the last 20 years, and is among his more cohesive bodies of work to date." [...] Jesse Fairfax of HipHopDX said, [...] "Neither timeless nor immediately disposable, Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me</b> is an above average outing that displays why he's steadily remained within the public eye without having a long line of record-breaking hits." [...] Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon of RapReviews.com said, [...] "Rick Ross' Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me</b> is fun to listen to." [...] Paul A. Thompson of Pitchfork said, [...] "Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me</b> is a smooth, enjoyable attempt to wrestle the spotlight back onto his solo work." [...] Kellan Miller of Drowned in Sound said, [...] "Overall, Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me</b> is another example of Ross' gift at making albums, even though he litters the radio with corny one liners." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
