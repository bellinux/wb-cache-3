25|$|Al-Mas'udi {{was also}} very well {{informed}} about Byzantine affairs, even internal political events and the unfolding of palace coups. He recorded {{the effect of the}} westward migration of various tribes upon the Byzantines, especially the invading Bulgars. He spoke of Byzantine relations with western Europe. And, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attentively interested in Byzantine-Islamic relations.|$|E
25|$|It further {{indicates}} that Braham was {{very conscious of}} his market, more so than he was for the purity of his art. In this <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no different from his many Gentile colleagues, and Mount Edgcumbe deplores him for his betrayal of art, not for his origins. However similar arguments against other musicians of Jewish origin were however also later to be given specific anti-Jewish spins in continental Europe.|$|E
25|$|Military {{training}} and strategy are two important matters {{on which the}} sources are more than usually silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, {{and so it is}} necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance. Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the Impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. If this is not solely due to the deficiencies of the sources, it would make England a special case. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. But if you were in a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Unless, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Bede's Oswald and trusted in God. Anyway, battle put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles successful Charlemagne and Richard I chose to fight.|$|E

500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E
2500|$|Charles Mingus {{had known}} Eric from {{growing up in}} Los Angeles, and Dolphy joined his band shortly after {{arriving}} in New York. He took part in Mingus' big band recording Pre-Bird, and is featured on [...] "Bemoanable Lady". Later he joined Mingus' working band which also included Dannie Richmond and Ted Curson. They worked at the Showplace during 1960 and recorded two early albums together, Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus and Mingus at Antibes (the latter adding Booker Ervin on all tracks except [...] "What Love?" [...] and Bud Powell for [...] "I'll Remember April"). Dolphy, Mingus said, [...] "was a complete musician. He could fit anywhere. He was a fine lead alto in a big band. He could make it in a classical group. And, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> entirely his own man when he soloed.... He had mastered jazz. And he had mastered all the instruments he played. In fact, he knew more than {{was supposed to be}} possible to do on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antonio {{inherited}} the studio against {{the claims of}} Annibale’s surviving brother Giovanni Antonio, who contested the inheritance by throwing doubt on his nephew’s paternity. [...] Despite gaining commissions, those from the Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, the main patron after the Farnese, declined once the cardinal's uncle Clement VIII died in 1605. This also coincides {{with the onset of}} Annibale’s incapacitating illness. The ascent of the Borghese Pope, Paul V, continued the decline of the studio. By report, Annibale could not receive Cardinal Scipione Borghese, slipping out of a back door {{when he came to the}} studio; but Antonio was introduced to the pope's Prodatario, Cardinal Tonti, also an avid collector. Tonti employed Antonio to paint four chapels in his church; other public commissions included a chapel in Santa Maria in Monticelli, work in Sant' Girolamo dei Schiavoni, Santa Maria in Trastevere, and Sant' Sebastiano fuori le Mura, and in Palazzo Mattei. Antonio and Guido Reni collaborated in the decoration of the Cappella dell’ Annunciata in the Palazzo Quirinal, painting a frieze of the Stanza del Diluvio. He contributed, around 1616, to the Alexander frescoes done for Cardinal Peretti Montalto; other works were done for Marchese Giustiniani, Cardinal Orsino, the Ludovisi, Cavalier Sachetti, Dionigio Buonavia in Bologna; and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under the protection of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, who recognized him as his ‘pittor di casa’ and paid him a monthly stipend.|$|E

60|$|On this {{occasion}} he travelled down alone, {{and as he}} approached the house he, who was not by nature timid, felt himself to be somewhat cowed. That the Duke should not be cold to him was almost impossible. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> there in opposition to the Duke's wishes. Even Silverbridge had never quite liked the match. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to have all that he desired. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the most fortunate of men. Of course no man had ever stronger reason to be contented with the girl he loved. But still his heart was a little low as he was driven up to the door.|$|E

60|$|Either the King became {{afraid of}} the power of the Duke of Norfolk, and his son the Earl of Surrey, or they gave him some offence, but he {{resolved}} to pull them down, to follow all the rest who were gone.
