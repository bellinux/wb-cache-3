25|$|Charles Cortimiglia was an {{immigrant}} {{who lived with}} his wife and baby on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in Gretna, Louisiana, a New Orleans suburb, across the Mississippi River. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia Residence. Grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. Upon his arrival, Jordano noticed that Charles Cortimiglia, his wife Rosie, and their infant daughter, Mary, had all been attacked by the unknown intruder. Rosie stood in the doorway with a serious head wound, clutching her deceased daughter. Charles laid on the floor, bleeding profusely. The couple was rushed to Charity Hospital, where it was discovered that both had suffered skull fractures. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. A bloody axe was found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> of the home. Charles was released two days later, while his wife remained in the care of doctors. Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Iorlando Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have committed the crimes. Frank Jordano, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the back door. Charles Cortimiglia vehemently denied his wife's claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the two, and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles Cortimiglia divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie announced that she had falsely accused the two out of jealousy and spite. Her statement was the only evidence against the Jordanos, and they were released from jail shortly thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>porch.</b> She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

25|$|Manon {{had never}} {{let go of}} her desire to act.

With her dark long hair and beauty, she so impressed the theater director Max Reinhardt, that he offered the part of First Angel in a revival of his and Hugo von Hofmannsthal's adaptation of Calderón's The Great Theater of the World for the Salzburg Festival of 1934. Werfel, however, did not think Manon had the training for such an important role, having only performed in a few theater productions that he had directed himself to entertain her mother and their friends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> of Haus Mahler in Breitenstein, a porch designed by her father in 1916.

There, Manon contracted polio, which left her totally paralyzed. She returned to Vienna, where she recovered some use of her arms and hands. Still determined to act, teachers from the famous Reinhardt-Seminar made house calls. Alma also encouraged visitors, including a younger Austrofascist, a bureaucrat named Erich Cyhlar, to court Manon in the hopes that pending nuptials would compel her to walk again.|$|R
5000|$|The Horace Anthony House is a 2½-story brick {{dwelling}} {{built on}} a limestone foundation. The brick was locally produced.

60|$|I {{could not}} conceal from myself {{the fact that}} my father's work was almost done. That he was failing was sorrowfully evident. He weeded the garden no more.

60|$|I peeled my turnips <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>porch,</b> {{put them}} in their pot, and set them on the stove. Then I was at liberty to watch the others, who had longer jobs.

60|$|I {{was about}} to go into my bedroom, when I heard a woman scream, and of course I hurried to the front. There <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>porch</b> of her house stood Mrs. Carson. She was a woman of middle age, and, as I glanced at her, I saw where her {{daughter}} got her good looks. But the placidity and cheerfulness of the younger face were entirely wanting in the mother.

5000|$|Sparks {{intended}} <b>The</b> <b>Back</b> <b>Porch</b> Majority to be a performing group similar to, but {{a little}} smaller than The New Christy Minstrels, and a group that The New Christy Minstrels could draw new members from. <b>The</b> <b>Back</b> <b>Porch</b> Majority would be a [...] "training ground", or a [...] "minor league farm team" [...] for The New Christy Minstrels. But <b>The</b> <b>Back</b> <b>Porch</b> Majority did better than Sparks expected, and appeared on Hullabaloo and other musical variety shows. In August 1965 it was selected, along with The Brothers Four, The Bitter End Singers and others, by Life magazine to entertain US President Lyndon B. Johnson and his guests at the White House. The group's success secured it a record deal with Columbia Records's Epic Records, which resulted in five albums being released between 1965 and 1967, including a live album recorded at Ledbetters.|$|R
