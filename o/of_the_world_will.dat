500|$|Vonnegut's works have, {{at various}} times, been labeled science fiction, satire and postmodern. He also {{resisted}} such labels, but his works do contain common tropes {{that are often}} associated with those genres. In several of his books, Vonnegut imagines alien societies and civilizations, as is common in works of science fiction. Vonnegut does this to emphasize or exaggerate absurdities and idiosyncrasies in our own world. Furthermore, Vonnegut often humorizes the problems that plague societies, as is done in satirical works. However, literary theorist Robert Scholes noted in Fabulation and Metafiction that Vonnegut [...] "reject the traditional satirist's faith in the efficacy of satire as a reforming instrument. [...] a more subtle faith in the humanizing value of laughter." [...] Examples of postmodernism may {{also be found in}} Vonnegut's works. Postmodernism often entails a response to the theory that the truths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>will</b> be discovered through science. Postmodernists contend that truth is subjective, rather than objective, as it is biased towards each individual's beliefs and outlook on the world. They often use unreliable, first-person narration, and narrative fragmentation. One critic has argued that Vonnegut’s most famous novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, features a metafictional Janus-headed outlook because the novel seeks to represent actual historical events while, at the same time, problematizes the very notion of doing exactly that. While Vonnegut does use elements as fragmentation and metafictional elements, in some of his works, he more distinctly focuses on the peril posed by individuals who find subjective truths, mistake them for objective truths, then proceed to impose these truths on others.|$|E
