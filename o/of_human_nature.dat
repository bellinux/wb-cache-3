5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature,</b> Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|Max Beesley as Tom Price. Tom Price {{was serving}} a long prison {{sentence}} at Wandsworth prison when the virus struck. He escapes after killing the sole remaining guard {{and makes his}} way home, {{only to discover that}} his mother had also died during the pandemic. Price's remorselessness and violent streak provide an element of friction within the group, though he is often proven right about the darker side <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature.</b> Largely through his relationship with Anya, Tom becomes quite loyal to the group. At the close of the second series (and the programme), Tom has secreted himself aboard a consortium aeroplane bound for parts unknown.|$|E
5|$|Prior to restoration, {{of all the}} {{paintings}} in the Sistine Chapel, the lunettes and spandrels were the dirtiest. Added to this, {{there has always been}} a problem of poor daytime visibility of the panels nearest the windows because of halination. Consequently, they were the least well known of all Michelangelo's publicly accessible works. The recent restoration has made these masterly studies <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> and inventive depiction of the human form known once more.|$|E

5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E
5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{influenced}} novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is {{a classic}} tragic hero, inspired by King Lear. Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares {{with that of the}} source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{theory about}} human desire is one {{important}} component in early Confucian theory of humanity.

Only in terms of reducing the conflicts between human desire and the limited resources they advocate a moderate abstinence.
