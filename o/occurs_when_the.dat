5|$|An annular eclipse <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Sun and Moon {{are exactly}} {{in line with}} the Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} contact angle is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> liquid–solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
50|$|Under {{excess load}} conditions, {{the system can}} be {{designed}} to fail gracefully rather than all at once. Brownouts <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> supply power drops below <b>the</b> demand. Blackouts <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> supply fails completely.|$|R

An annular eclipse can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Sun has a larger apparent size than the Moon, whereas a total eclipse can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Moon has a larger apparent size.|$|R
5|$|Dropped-ball: <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> referee {{has stopped}} play {{for any other}} reason, such as a serious injury to a player, {{interference}} by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.|$|E
5|$|Equilibrium <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{resultant}} force {{acting on a}} point particle is zero (that is, the vector sum of all forces is zero). When dealing with an extended body, it is also necessary that the net torque be zero.|$|E
5|$|Release <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> new viruses escape or are {{released}} from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called lysis. Other viruses such as HIV {{are released}} more gently by a process called budding.|$|E
30|$|Accidents {{frequently}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{weather is}} clear.|$|R
50|$|In Slavic, Baltic, and Hungarian folklore, it is {{said that}} hiccups <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> person {{experiencing}} them is being talked about by someone not present. In Indian, Nepalese, and Arabic folklore, they are similarly said to <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> person experiencing them is being thought of by somebody close.|$|R
30|$|Complete {{failures}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{developers are}} unable to identify any design problem with Organic and do not try again. Partial failures <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> developer gives up from using Organic’s functionalities before identifying any design problem and tries to achieve this in another way. Finally, temporary failures <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> developer temporarily interrupts the identification of design problems with Organic due to some communicability issue. According to the CEM, there are three types of temporary failures: (1) trying to communicate, (2) trying to fix an error, and (3) {{trying to understand the}} rules.|$|R
5|$|Uncompetitive {{inhibition}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> inhibitor binds {{only to the}} enzyme–substrate complex, not to {{the free}} enzyme; the EIS complex is catalytically inactive. This mode of inhibition is rare and causes a decrease in both Vmax and the Km value.|$|E
5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch. A rollback <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> train fails {{to make it}} {{over the top of}} the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes retractable magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into the loading station.|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} asexual means of reproduction. Budding can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> new {{individuals}} are formed from pieces that divide {{off from the}} pedal disc. Fragmentation can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> individual moves slowly over the substrate and leaves small pieces of itself behind which eventually grow into new individuals. Division or fission can also <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> corallimorph divides down the centre to form two new individuals.|$|R
5|$|Pain {{typically}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{stomach is}} empty, between meals {{and in the}} early morning hours, but it can also occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> bacilli {{overcome the}} immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive mimicry <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{actions of}} the dupe {{directly}} aid in the mimic's reproduction. This is common in plants with deceptive flowers that do not provide the reward they seem to offer. Other forms of mimicry have a reproductive component, such as Vavilovian mimicry involving seeds, and brood parasitism, which can also involve aggressive mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to {{a second}} more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time–dependent. The true value of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition below for more information.|$|E
5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> brain is not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{opening that}} allows air {{to enter the}} pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E

5|$|The IFC {{has created}} a mass-market {{certification}} system for fast growing emerging markets called EDGE ("Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies"). IFC and the World Green Building Council have partnered to accelerate green building growth in developing counties. The target is to scale up green buildings over a seven-year period until 20% of the property market is saturated. Certification <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> EDGE standard is met, which requires 20% less energy, water, and materials than conventional homes.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E
