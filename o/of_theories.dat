40|$|The {{barriers}} to the use <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> in health education practice are addressed by exposing common misperceptions {{of the nature and}} usefulness <b>of</b> <b>theory.</b> First, the mystique <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> is addressed through a discussion <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> development and the roots <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> in everyday experience. Two characteristics <b>of</b> <b>theory,</b> generalizability across settings or situations and testability, are described and linked to benefits for practice. Second, a guide for practitioners in applying theory to each stage of the intervention process is provided. A case example illustrates how theory can guide practice as well as the benefits to be gained by applying theory to program development. Finally, the bases for common negative misperceptions <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> are identified and clarified, and the beneficial nature <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> reviewed...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} essay {{is to examine the}} structural nature <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> in information systems. Despite the importance <b>of</b> <b>theory,</b> questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction and generalization that underlie an understanding <b>of</b> <b>theory.</b> A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction and prescription. Five interrelated types <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> are distinguished: (i) theory for analysing; (ii) theory for explaining, (iii) theory for predicting; (iv) theory for explaining and predicting; and (v) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature <b>of</b> each <b>theory</b> type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value <b>of</b> each <b>theory</b> type. The building of integrated bodies <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> that encompass all theory types is advocated...|$|R

5|$|In Norse mythology, Ask and Embla (from Old Norse Askr ok Embla)—male {{and female}} respectively—were {{the first two}} humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, three gods, {{one of whom is}} Odin, find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number <b>of</b> <b>theories</b> have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set <b>of</b> <b>theories</b> of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E

40|$|Theory {{choice in}} science {{is a central}} and {{fascinating}} issue {{in the literature of}} philosophy of science that has been argued from different perspectives.

This study attempts to discuss and analyze the implications of the thesis <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> choice in scientific realism and relativism, which is a lacuna awaited to be filled. This study is by no means an exhaustive investigation on the problem <b>of</b> <b>theory</b> choice.

5|$|The {{scientific}} study of heredity grew rapidly {{in the wake of}} Darwin's Origin of Species with the work of Francis Galton and the biometricians. The origin of genetics is usually traced to the 1866 work of the monk Gregor Mendel, who would later be credited with the laws of inheritance. However, his work was not recognized as significant until 35 years afterward. In the meantime, a variety <b>of</b> <b>theories</b> of inheritance (based on pangenesis, orthogenesis, or other mechanisms) were debated and investigated vigorously. Embryology and ecology also became central biological fields, especially as linked to evolution and popularized in the work of Ernst Haeckel. Most of the 19th century work on heredity, however, was not in the realm of natural history, but that of experimental physiology.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>theories</b> about why the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard {{represented}} a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response {{to one of the}} many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{has been}} a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in {{popularity}} in 19th century Canada. There are a number <b>of</b> <b>theories</b> behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. The implementation of some features, such as the blue lines in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.|$|E
