5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

Advance knowledge <b>of</b> behavioral <b>objectives</b> led to improved posttest performance in five of ten studies and to improved retention in two of three instances. Only two of seven studies found an interaction between knowledge <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> and type <b>of</b> learning: in one case knowledge acquisition but not comprehension was facilitated, while in the other knowledge <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> interfered on a problem-solving task, but not on a discrimination task. A third group of studies reported interactions between availability <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> and reasoning ability, personality characteristics, and state anxiety.

5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The {{first is the}} Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned with feeling than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, The Social Contract, influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E
5|$|Philosophical Transactions is {{the oldest}} and longest-running {{scientific}} journal in the world, having first been published in March 1665 by the first secretary of the society, Henry Oldenburg. It now publishes themed issues on specific topics and, since 1886, has been divided into two parts; A, which deals with mathematics and the physical sciences, and B, which deals with the biological sciences. Proceedings of the Royal Society consists of freely submitted research articles and is similarly divided into two parts. Biology Letters publishes short research articles and opinion pieces on all areas of biology and was launched in 2005. Journal of the Royal Society Interface publishes cross-disciplinary research at {{the boundary between the}} physical and life sciences, while Interface Focus, publishes themed issue in the same areas. Notes and Records is the Society's journal on the history of science. Biographical Memoirs is published annually and contains extended obituaries of deceased Fellows. Open Biology is an open access journal covering biology at the molecular and cellular level. Royal Society Open Science is an open access journal publishing high-quality original research across the entire range of science on the basis <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> peer-review.

40|$|Many Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} in recent years. However, almost all MOEAs have been evaluated on problems with two to four objectives only. It is unclear how well these MOEAs will perform on problems {{with a large number}} <b>of</b> <b>objectives.</b> Our preliminary study [1] showed that performance of some MOEAs deteriorates significantly as the number <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> increases. This paper proposes a new MOEA that performs well on problems with a large number <b>of</b> <b>objectives.</b> The new algorithm separates non-dominated solutions into two archives, and is thus called the Two-Archive algorithm. The two archives focused on convergence and diversity, respectively, in optimisation. Computational studies have been carried out to evaluate and compare our new algorithm against the best MOEA for problems with a large number <b>of</b> <b>objectives.</b> Our experimental results have shown that the Two-Archive algorithm outperforms existing MOEAs on problems with a large number <b>of</b> <b>objectives.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Real {{decision}} makers exhibit significant shortcomings {{in the generation}} <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> for decisions that they face. Prior research has illustrated {{the magnitude of this}} shortcoming but not its causes. In this paper, we identify two distinct impediments to the generation of decision objectives: not thinking broadly enough about the range <b>of</b> relevant <b>objectives,</b> and not thinking deeply enough to articulate every objective within the range that is considered. To test these explanations and explore ways of stimulating a more comprehensive set <b>of</b> <b>objectives,</b> we present three experiments involving a variety of interventions: the provision <b>of</b> sample <b>objectives,</b> organization <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> by category, and direct challenges to do better, with or without a warning that important objectives are missing. The use of category names and direct challenges with a warning both led to improvements in the quantity <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> generated without impacting their quality; other interventions yielded less improvement. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our findings to decision analysis and offering prescriptive implications for the elicitation <b>of</b> decision <b>objectives.</b> © 2010 INFORMS...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} two new algorithms {{to reduce}} the number <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> in a multiobjective problem by identifying the most conflicting objectives. The proposed algorithms are based on a feature selection technique proposed by Mitra et. al. [11]. One algorithm is intended to determine the minimum subset <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> that yields the minimum error possible, while the other finds a subset <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> a given size that yields the minimum error. To validate these algorithms we compare their results against those obtained by two similar algorithms recently proposed. The comparative study shows that our algorithms are very competitive with respect to the reference algorithms. Additionally, our approaches require a lower computational time. Also, in this study we propose to use the inverted generational distance to evaluate the quality of a subset <b>of</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|R
