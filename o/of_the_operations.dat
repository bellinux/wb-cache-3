5|$|All four ships {{served in}} the 1st Division of the Italian fleet during the Italo-Turkish War, and were the workhorses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> off North Africa and in the eastern Mediterranean. During World War I, the ships were {{primarily}} based in Brindisi, Taranto, and Valona; they saw no action during the war due to the cautious fleet policies adopted by both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. The ships remained in the Italian fleet {{for a few years}} after the war, but all were discarded and broken up for scrap by 1927.|$|E

However, the 5th Division had been unsuccessful in its attacks which left the ridge running from Loupart Wood to Grévillers and then onto Biefvillers still in the hands of the Germans. Although over 2,000 prisoners of war had been taken during this period along with 25 field guns, the 5th Division had suffered 1,600 casualties by this stage of the battle.|$|E

He then returned to headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance.|$|E
5|$|Financed, {{trained and}} {{equipped}} by the Germans, the saboteurs sank the armed trawler , and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper , {{which resulted in}} the deaths of six British seamen on 18 January 1942. Plazas was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of Puente Mayorga, Manuel Romero Hume, who allowed him to beach a rowboat there. The British intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations. In March 1942, a Gibraltarian, José Key, {{one of the most prominent}} agents working for the Germans, responsible for the collection of information on military movements for the Abwehr was arrested and executed in Wandsworth Prison in late 1942. By September 1942, Plazas, whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time, resigned and left Carlos Calvo, his second in command, in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operations.</b> In late 1942, the German headquarters in Berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded. In early 1943, the arrival of an experienced head of Abwehr operations in Spain improved the outreach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

In 1945 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), the citation recognised his work with Ops (B) and in France. He retired from the army in 1963, having attained the rank of brigadier.|$|E

5|$|The {{night before}} the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operations,</b> the Soviet night bombers {{attacked}} the German divisional headquarters and artillery positions to disrupt the German command and control. The bombers also attacked German airfields and communication centres to disrupt the flow of reinforcements. Operation Iskra began at 9:30 on January 12, when the two Soviet fronts began their artillery preparation, which lasted for 2 hours 20 minutes {{on the western side}} and 1 hour 45 minutes on {{the eastern side of the}} bottleneck. The Soviet attack started five minutes before the artillery preparation finished with a Katyusha barrage, to fully exploit its effects.|$|E
