5|$|After Extreme Rules, Orton began pairing with Daniel Bryan {{despite their}} poor {{relationship}} {{to face a}} common enemy in the Shield. On the June 14 SmackDown, Orton teamed with Bryan and Kane to end the Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in televised six-man tag matches. Three days later at Payback, Orton and Bryan's poor teamwork resulted in an unsuccessful challenge for Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins' WWE Tag Team Championships. The following night on Raw, Orton and Bryan faced off in a no disqualification match, which Orton won via referee stoppage after Bryan suffered a legitimate nerve injury. Four days later on SmackDown, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a singles match via countout. Orton and Bryan faced each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> third time on the next Raw, but their match ended in a no-contest after both men were counted out. Later that night, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a Street Fight Match after {{he was forced to}} submit to the Yes! Lock with a kindo stick applied to the move.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} Final Fantasy III in 1990, Square {{planned to}} develop two Final Fantasy games—one for the Nintendo Entertainment System and the <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> forthcoming Super NES, {{to be known}} as Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V respectively. Due to financial and scheduling constraints, Square dropped plans for the NES game and continued development of the SNES version, retitled Final Fantasy IV. A mock-up screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little other information exists about it. Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that the NES version was approximately 80% complete and certain ideas were reused for the SNES version.|$|E

5|$|As a {{freshman}} at Michigan, he scored 21 points, including 12 goals, in 33 games. That season he missed eight games due to a leg injury. As a sophomore during the 2008–09 season, Caporusso was one of ten finalists for the Hobey Baker Award. During the season, he scored 49 points in 41 games. He was also named to the All-Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) first-team and AHCA/Reebok Division I Ice Hockey All-American first-team along with team mate Aaron Palushaj. In addition, he was selected to the CCHA All-Conference tournament team. One {{of the highlights of}} the season occurred when he scored the first three goals of the game in the first period (the first two within 24 seconds of each <b>other)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> natural hat trick against Michigan Tech on December 27, 2008. During {{the first half of the}} season, he led the nation in goals scored. He played a different scoring role during the final nine regular season games, as the team went 8–1 and he scored two goals and posted 14 assists. Caporusso was named the team MVP at the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E
5|$|Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley {{went back}} to {{competing}} in the tag team division as The Motor City Machine Guns before both transitioned into the X Division, challenging each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> vacant X Division Championship at TNA's Genesis PPV event on January11, 2009. However, they also continued as a tag team, with the two winning the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship on January4, 2009 by defeating No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro) at New Japan Pro Wrestling's (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom III in Tokyo Dome event. They then defended the NJPW championship in TNA against No Limit on the April 9, 2009 episode of Impact! successfully. The team defended it a second time in TNA, this time in a Three Way Six Sides of Steel Cage match with No Limit and The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide) at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April19, 2009; they retained the championship at the show.|$|E

The Austrians still had the numerical superiority, but this time it was closer to two-to-one, instead of almost three-to-one. Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line, and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command. Charles, likewise, had shortened his line; although Hotze had not yet caught up with the archduke, he and his 10,000men were approaching from the Austrians' left rear.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray and Arsenal met each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time}} in a European {{football}} competition, though the Turkish outfit had faced English clubs formerly on eight occasions. Their first was against Manchester United, in the 1993–94 Champions League second round, which they won 3–3 on away goals in a two-legged match. Both teams were reunited in the following season of the group stage, which concluded in a goalless tie and a Galatasaray blow. Other meetings include against West Bromwich Albion in the commencing round of the 1978–79 UEFA Cup, and Chelsea in this year's Champions League campaign. Arsenal by contrast ran into Turkish opposition twice, both of them against Fenerbahçe in the 1979–80 European Cup Winners' Cup first round; the home game was won by the English side 2–0, while the away leg ended in a 0–0 draw.|$|E

This was also the season that future Hall of Famer Clint Benedict became the Senators' top goaltender, taking over from Percy LeSueur. Former Wanderer Art Ross joined the Senators and helped Ottawa win in a two-game playoff, 4–1. The Senators then played in the first inter-league Stanley Cup final playoff series with the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast (PCHA) league. Cyclone Taylor, now of the Millionaires, haunted his old team, scoring six goals in three games as Ottawa lost three {{straight}} in Vancouver. Future Senator centreman Frank Nighbor played in this series for Vancouver and scored five goals.|$|E

The Yankees were the {{defending}} World Series champions {{and in the midst of}} a run of three consecutive World Championships, while Boston had not appeared in the ALCS since 1990. The Yankees won the first game of the ALCS against the Red Sox on a 10th-inning walk-off home run by Bernie Williams off Boston reliever Rod Beck. The game was the first actual postseason meeting between the rivals because the one-game playoff in 1978 technically counted as a regular season game. Intensity built up due to this historic, first-ever postseason meeting between the two longtime rivals. The Yankees would win the first two games at home with 7th-inning comebacks.|$|E

The judges unanimously chose a set of two mascots, one for the Olympic Games and the <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Paralympic Games, created by Birdo, a São Paulo-based animation company. Birdo and the organizers then began to create content featuring the mascots, working in secrecy.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the rain-affected practice and qualifying sessions, the track was dry {{for the duration of}} the race. All of the drivers except Jenson Button, Jarno Trulli and the two Red Bull drivers started on the softer option tyre. The first lap was eventful: Alonso started better than polesitter Massa and was able to take the inside line into turn one and gain the lead. Hamilton passed Räikkönen for third into the first corner, then drove round the outside of Massa into turn two to take second place. Meanwhile, the suspension on Adrian Sutil's Spyker failed at turn four, causing it to collide with Button's Honda and retire from the race. Button continued after making an early pitstop to repair the damage. Liuzzi and Sato also collided at turn four, causing Liuzzi to pit for a new front wing. After the race the drivers blamed each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> incident.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 2011–12 season, Salo {{suffered}} a minor groin injury that sidelined him on two separate occasions, costing him three games and one game, respectively. In January 2012, the Canucks and Bruins played against each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time since the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. During the contest, Salo sustained a concussion after a clipping hit from opposing forward Brad Marchand. Salo left the game immediately, while Marchand received a five-minute major and game misconduct; he was later additionally suspended for five games following a hearing with the league.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of the Gold Glove Award, there have been eleven double-play combinations, or pairs of middle infielders, that have won awards in the same year. Shortstops and second basemen depend upon each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of double plays. The most common type of double play occurs with a runner on first base and a ground ball hit towards the middle of the infield. The player fielding the ball (generally the shortstop or second baseman) throws to the fielder covering second base, who steps on the base before the runner from first arrives to force that runner out, and then throws the ball to the first baseman to force out the batter for the second out. Mark Belanger won four Gold Gloves with the Baltimore Orioles alongside winning partner Bobby Grich, and Joe Morgan paired with Dave Concepción for four combination wins with the Cincinnati Reds. The most recent teammates to accomplish the feat are Brandon Crawford and Joe Panik, who won with the San Francisco Giants in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Just days later, Yankee {{right fielder}} Gary Sheffield's cap was knocked {{off by a}} Red Sox fan while {{trying to pick up}} a fair ball in right field during the 8th inning at Fenway Park. In response, Sheffield pushed the fan. The {{conflict}} was quickly stopped by security guards. The fan was not ejected from the game, although left the park voluntarily. Fan interference was not called and Sheffield's reaction resulted in a run scoring Triple for the Red Sox' Jason Varitek. It was the game-winning RBI. Contrary to most media reports, the fan is still a season ticket holder today. The season ended with both teams, already with guaranteed playoff berths, playing each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> division crown {{on the last day of}} the season in a game that had the Yankees come out on top. Both teams wound up losing in the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Red Sox to the eventual World Series champion that year, the Chicago White Sox.|$|E
