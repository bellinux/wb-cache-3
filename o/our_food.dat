500|$|Reducing {{the amount}} of food waste has been deemed {{critical}} if the UK is to meet international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill. Equally great emphasis has been placed on the reduction of food waste, across all developed countries, as a means of ending the global food crisis that leaves millions worldwide starving and impoverished. In the context of the 2007–2008 world food price crisis, food waste was discussed at the 34th G8 summit in Hokkaidō, Japan. UK prime minister Gordon Brown said of the issue [...] "We must do more to deal with unnecessary demand, such as by all of us doing more to cut <b>our</b> <b>food</b> waste".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} months of his {{undergraduate}} education, Borlaug attended a Sigma Xi lecture by Elvin Charles Stakman, a professor and soon-to-be head of the plant pathology group at the University of Minnesota. The event was a pivot for Borlaug's future. Stakman, in his speech entitled [...] "These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy <b>our</b> <b>Food</b> Crops", discussed the manifestation of the plant disease rust, a parasitic fungus that feeds on phytonutrients in wheat, oats, and barley crops. He had discovered that special plant breeding methods produced plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug's job at the Forest Service was eliminated because of budget cuts, he asked Stakman if he should go into forest pathology. Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead. He subsequently enrolled at the University to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug earned a master of science degree in 1940, and a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics in 1942.|$|E

2500|$|After {{explaining}} the domestic policies the US should pursue, he discusses foreign policy. He advocates {{a system of}} [...] "triage," [...] such as that suggested by William and Paul Paddock in Famine 1975!. Under this system countries would be divided into categories based on their abilities to feed themselves going forward. Countries with sufficient programmes in place to limit population growth, {{and the ability to}} become self-sufficient in the future would continue to receive food aid. Countries, for example India, which were [...] "so far behind in the population-food game that there is no hope that <b>our</b> <b>food</b> aid will see them through to self-sufficiency" [...] would have their food aid eliminated. Ehrlich argued that this was the only realistic strategy in the long-term. Ehrlich applauds the Paddocks' [...] "courage and foresight" [...] in proposing such a solution. Ehrlich further discusses the need to set up public education programs and agricultural development schemes in developing countries. He argues that the scheme would likely have to be implemented outside the framework of the United Nations due to the necessity of being selective regarding the targeted regions and countries, and suggests that within countries certain regions should be prioritized to the extent that cooperative separatist movements should be encouraged if they are an improvement over the existing authority. He mentions his support for government mandated sterilization of Indian males with three or more children.|$|E
2500|$|Physiologically, teeth {{provide for}} greater chewing ability. [...] They {{allow us to}} {{masticate}} food thoroughly, increasing the surface area necessary {{to allow for the}} enzymes present in the saliva, {{as well as in the}} stomach and intestines, to digest <b>our</b> <b>food.</b> [...] Chewing also allows food to be prepared into small boli that are more readily swallowed than haphazard chunks of considerable size. [...] For those who are even partially endentulous, it may become extremely difficult to chew food efficiently enough to swallow comfortably, although this is entirely dependent upon which teeth are lost. [...] When an individual loses enough posterior teeth to make it difficult to chew, he or she may need to cut their food into very small pieces and learn how to make use of their anterior teeth to chew. [...] If enough posterior teeth are missing, this will not only affect their chewing abilities, but also their occlusion; posterior teeth, in a mutually protected occlusion, help to protect the anterior teeth and the vertical dimension of occlusion and, when missing, the anterior teeth begin to bear a greater amount of force for which they are structurally prepared. [...] Thus, loss of posterior teeth will cause the anterior teeth to splay. [...] This can be prevented by obtaining dental prostheses, such as removable partial dentures, bridges or implant-supported crowns. [...] In addition to reestablishing a protected occlusion, these prostheses can greatly improve one's chewing abilities.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to <b>our</b> <b>food</b> supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food.
