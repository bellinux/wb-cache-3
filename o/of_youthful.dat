There was no one of his dear ones who could console him.|$|E

25|$|Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates (full title: Hans Brinker; or, the Silver Skates: A Story of Life in Holland) is a {{novel by}} American author Mary Mapes Dodge, first {{published}} in 1865.

25|$|From {{the innocence}} of childhood, to the flush <b>of</b> <b>youthful</b> overconfidence, through the trials and tribulations of middle age, to the hero's triumphant salvation, The Voyage of Life seems {{intrinsically}} linked to the Christian doctrine of death and resurrection. Cole's intrepid voyager also may {{be read as a}} personification of America, itself at an adolescent stage of development. The artist may have been issuing a dire warning to those caught up in the feverish quest for Manifest Destiny: that unbridled westward expansion and industrialization would have tragic consequences for both man and nature.|$|E

25|$|Figure-work {{seems to}} have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be not only more {{difficult}} but also less satisfactory than sculpting with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type <b>of</b> <b>youthful</b> face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the grain of the wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.|$|E
25|$|Ken Barlow (William Roache) {{entered the}} storyline {{as a young}} radical, {{reflecting}} the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the model Twiggy were to reshape the concept <b>of</b> <b>youthful</b> rebellion. Though {{the rest of the}} original Barlow family were killed off {{before the end of the}} 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie), another character from the first episode, returned to Coronation Street after a 43-year absence. Since 1984, Ken Barlow had been the show's only remaining original character, although Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) has remained in the series since first appearing in late January 1961, when the show was just weeks old, and is the show's longest-serving female character.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with the}} ACLU National Prison Project, the SPLC filed a class-action suit in November 2010 against the owner/operators {{of the private}} Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility in Leake County, Mississippi, and the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDC). They charged that conditions, {{including}} under-staffing and neglect of medical care, produced numerous and repeated abuses <b>of</b> <b>youthful</b> prisoners, high rates of violence and injury, and that one prisoner suffered brain damage because of inmate-on-inmate attacks. A federal civil rights investigation was undertaken by the United States Department of Justice. In settling the suit, Mississippi ended its contract with GEO Group in 2012. Additionally, under the court decree, the MDC moved the youthful offenders to state-run units. In 2012, Mississippi opened a new youthful offender unit at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County. The state also agreed to not subject youthful offenders to solitary confinement and a court monitor conducted regular reviews of conditions at the facility.|$|E

25|$|The new {{technique}} had the primary advantage of permitting {{a far better}} execution of internal detail. In black-figure vase painting such details had to be scratched into the painted surfaces, which was always less accurate than the direct application of detail with a brush. Red-figure depictions were generally more lively and realistic than the black-figure silhouettes. They were also more clearly contrasted against the black backgrounds. It was now possible to depict humans not only in profile, but also in frontal, rear, or three-quarter perspectives. The red-figure technique also permitted the indication of a third dimension on the figures. However, it also had disadvantages. For example, the distinction of sex by using black slip for male skin and white paint for female skin was now impossible. The ongoing trend to depict heroes and deities naked and <b>of</b> <b>youthful</b> age also made it harder to distinguish the sexes through garments or hairstyles. In the initial phases, there were also miscalculations regarding the thickness of human figures.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Damien Halpin's {{unemployment}} {{reflects the}} Irish financial crisis. In addition the many scenes of domestic abuse towards Damien {{by his wife}} Suzanne have brought into the open the taboo subject of spousal abuse towards males. The series has been praised for this edgy and at times controversial storyline. It proved to be so popular that British soap opera Coronation Street later did their own version. Organ donor awareness was raised in 2011 when Lucy Mallon received a cornea transplant. Wearing pyjamas during the day was covered with Sash Bishop. Aside from this, soap opera staples <b>of</b> <b>youthful</b> romance, jealousy, rivalry, gossip and extramarital affairs are regularly featured. Late 2011/early 2012 saw Orla Kirwan and Caoimhe Dillon engage in numerous shoplifting sprees around Dublin. In April 2012, life in prison was covered, with prisoner Decco Bishop fearing for his life behind bars. Domestic violence has been a recurring theme in Fair City, most recently in 2013 {{with the introduction of}} the character Paddy Bishop, who is captured on screen flaking his wife Vivienne with a belt.|$|E
25|$|Peterman {{became the}} third Democrat to be {{appointed}} by Governor Christ to lead a state agency when he was appointed on February 8, 2008 to head the Department of Juvenile Justice. Due to term limits, {{he would have been}} ineligible to run again for the House. He replaced Walter A. McNeil, who had been appointed Secretary of the Department of Corrections. Peterman said it was important to seek rehabilitation <b>of</b> <b>youthful</b> offenders and to avoid their incarceration. His prior experience with Juvenile Services Program Inc served him in preparing for the position, as did his service on the House Juvenile Justice Committee. In 2005, he sponsored a bill to create the Council on the Social Status of African-American Men and Boys. He said he would accomplish his goals by such measures as authorizing local review boards and councils to redirect first-time offenders to community-based punishments. He also pledged to staff all detention centers with registered nurses and make sure public defenders were provided to children at their first hearings. In accepting the position, he was required to resign from JSP. In August 2008, he fired twelve juvenile detention officers accused of using a state computer to watch pornography, while asserting that no children had seen the pornography.|$|E
