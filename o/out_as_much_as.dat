5|$|On 3 August 1941, Berryman became Brigadier, General Staff (chief of staff) of I Corps under Lieutenant General John Lavarack, {{again in}} {{succession}} to Rowell, who became Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS). Berryman arrived in Jakarta by air with the advanced party of the I Corps headquarters staff on 26 January 1942 to plan its defence. Berryman reconnoitred Java and prepared {{an appreciation of the}} situation. Berryman also attempted to find <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible about Japanese tactics through interviewing Colonel Ian MacAlister Stewart. This information found its way into papers circulated throughout the Army in Australia. It soon became apparent that the situation was hopeless and any troops committed to the defence of Java would be lost.|$|E
5|$|The Mauna Ulu {{eruption}} of Kīlauea began on May 24, 1969, and ended on July 22, 1974. At the time, Mauna Ulu {{was the longest}} flank {{eruption of}} any Hawaiian volcano in recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered a large area of land with lava, and added new land to the island. The eruption started as a fissure between two pit craters, Āloi and Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield would eventually form. Both pāhoehoe and aā lava erupted from the volcano. Early on, fountains of lava burst <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 540meters (1772ft) high. In early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused Kīlauea to briefly stop erupting near the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and Hiiaka.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the Earth's true gravity field, {{the equilibrium}} figure of sea water, or the geoid, {{will also be}} of irregular form. In some places, like west of Ireland, the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to Ceylon, it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between these two surfaces is called the undulation of the geoid, symbol , and {{is closely related to}} the disturbing potential.|$|E

25|$|As a writer, {{poetry is}} {{basically}} Changmarín's fundamental tool of expression. Once {{established as a}} consecrated poet, he reached an outstanding moment in his creation with the book of poetry entitled Poemas Corporales (Corporeal Poems), which was awarded the Ricardo Miró National Award in 1955. With this work, Changmarín showed himself as a developed poet who has achieved great control over this literary form. Changmarín leaves <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible, which mirrors the trends of the time. This clarity serves as a method to deliver {{the social and political}} messages, as most of his works are fundamental. His mastery of the decasyllable writing imprints Poemas Corporales with a classical accent comparable to the Quevedo Verses.|$|E
25|$|An archaeological {{investigation}} {{usually involves}} several distinct phases, {{each of which}} employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective {{as to what the}} archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is surveyed to find <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.|$|E
500|$|Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online, in {{his review}} of the album, reacted {{positively}} to the score, calling it a [...] "colourful, diverse, and rich experience overall". He called the tracks by Iwata and Aikara the [...] "core" [...] of the album, saying that the tracks by Ito felt [...] "banal" [...] and [...] "formulaic" [...] which he attributed to Ito being too overworked {{to focus on the}} album. RPGamer, in their review of the game, called the music [...] "pretty nice". They noted that the music did not stand <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the visuals of the game, though they still [...] "conveyed the theme", and that the [...] "town" [...] tracks were in their opinion weaker {{than the rest of the}} soundtrack.|$|E

[...] In our game with Michigan, we had two men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> we passed to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. [...] He broke up innumerable plays. [...] He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of our men injured him {{to such an extent that}} he had to retire. [...] The rest was easy". [...] Coach Yost said of Schulz's performance: [...] "He gave the greatest one-man exhibition of courage I ever saw on a football field".|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Daniel Roberts of PopMatters said none of {{the songs}} were better than [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and believed Drake was suffering from an [...] "identity crisis", finding the record [...] "good at parts, but never great". Josuha Errett of Now felt Drake [...] "complains about fame way too much" [...] while calling him [...] "humorless". In MSN Music, Robert Christgau deemed Drake [...] "neither thug nor thug wannabe ... plenty talented, but pretty shallow and without much focus as a mack". He wrote of the record: [...] "Pleasing and hookful though it be, [...] consistently bemoans the confusing emoluments and accoutrements of fame". Pete Cashmore from NME believed [...] "it's those constant and predictable superstar interjections that prevent the album from standing <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> it had potential to do." [...] Slant Magazines Jesse Cataldo viewed Drake's [...] "insistent navel-gazing" [...] as a flimsy [...] "concept", but commended the album for [...] "nail confused introspection in a genre famous for willful misrepresentation of self." ...|$|E

Armed guards were stationed around the palace, ostensibly for [...] "the group's own danger from British secret agents", and armed guides escorted them on their journeys. For nearly three weeks, Emir Habibullah, reportedly in his summer palace at Paghman, responded with only polite noncommittal replies to requests for an audience. An astute politician, he was in no hurry to receive his guests; he used the time to find <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he could about the expedition members and liaised with British authorities at New Delhi. It was only after Niedermayer and von Hentig threatened to launch a hunger strike that meetings began. In the meantime, von Hentig learnt {{as much as he could}} about his eccentric host. Emir Habibullah was, by all measures, the lord of Afghanistan. He considered it his divine right to rule and the land his property. He owned the only newspaper, the only drug store, and all the automobiles in the country (all Rolls Royces).|$|E

500|$|Their {{grandmother}} {{preferred to}} raise them simply, and they made their own clothes. A new governess from Switzerland, Madame Gelieux, was appointed, giving the children lessons in French; as was common for royal and aristocratic children of the time, Louise became fluent and literate in the language, while neglecting her own native German. She received religious instruction from a clergyman of the Lutheran Church. Complementary to her lessons was an emphasis on charitable acts, and Louise would often accompany her governess when visiting the houses {{of the poor and}} needy. Louise was encouraged to give <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> was in her means, although she often got into trouble with her grandmother for donating too much for charity. From the age of ten until her marriage at 17, Louise spent most of her time in the presence of her grandmother and governess, both well-educated and refined. When only nine years old, Louise was present when the poet Friedrich Schiller read from the first act of [...] "Don Carlos" [...] for the entertainment of the assembled court, thus sparking her love for German as a literary language, especially works of Schiller. Louise loved history and poetry, and not only enjoyed reading Schiller, but also came to like the works of Goethe, Paul, Herder and Shakespeare, as well as ancient Greek tragedies.|$|E

[...] Armstrong noted {{that with the}} album, Green Day went down [...] "different avenues," [...] adding: [...] "Each song has its own character and identity {{so we wanted to}} be able to bring that <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible." [...] "Nice Guys Finish Last" [...] has been considered a song that [...] "eases the transition" [...] from Insomniac to Nimrod. Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times likened [...] "Worry Rock" [...] to the music of Elvis Costello. [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] has been referred to as a [...] "pop-punk campfire singalong ballad". After opening with Haden's violin solo, [...] "Hitchin' a Ride" [...] evolves into a bass-driven rock song with a [...] "Stray Cats vibe". Cool referred to [...] "Take Back" [...] (which features a more upfront hardcore-style, both musically and vocally) and [...] "Platypus (I Hate You)" [...] as [...] "some of the most punk songs we've ever done". [...] "Last Ride In" [...] is a surf rock-influenced instrumental, and [...] "King for a Day" [...] is a ska punk song featuring a horn section. [...] Armstrong compared the song to the Oi! genre, and noted [...] "It would be funny for a bunch of macho fraternity guys to be singing along and, little do they know, the song's about being in drag." [...] The [...] "chiming" [...] guitar riffs of [...] "Redundant" [...] have been compared to those of The Byrds.|$|E
500|$|A {{seasonal}} review {{column on}} the Anime News Network called The Stream generally made light remarks of the first four episodes. Written by Bamboo Dong, the editor called the series mindlessly fun; jokingly citing how the cell phones are always pointed directly at the demons as {{if they would be}} incapable of fighting if it were otherwise. Dong also likened the series as watching someone else play the video game. The designs of the various demons and Septentriones were described as the most interesting part of the series. On the other hand, the editor described the immense amount of [...] plot packed into the next batch of four episodes as messy. Dong also referred to the central premise as being pretty dark since it involved the main characters constantly receiving videos showing exactly how their friends would die. The editor gave the series props for not dabbling in the destruction porn taking place since all of the widespread death around Japan is implied, but added that showing some of it would have aided the realism of the story. After reviewing twelve episodes Dong was not able to develop any interest in the characters. This continued into the series finale and Dong still felt that the characters were not fleshed <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> they could have been. Dong explained that since there was basically no time to explore how the characters reacted to a disappearing world, it was essentially dehumanizing {{to such an extent that}} their deaths carried no emotional weight. Dong presented a full series review in their Shelf Life column and expressed that viewers who like brawn, action and some emotion will enjoy the series as long as they can come to terms with the fact that they'll pretty much just be watching someone play a video game for several hours.|$|E

2500|$|Bartholomew died on 15 December 1184. He {{was buried}} in Exeter Cathedral. A relief in Exeter has been {{identified}} as possibly Bartholomew's effigy for his tomb. A contemporary writer, Gerald of Wales, said that Bartholomew was better educated in Roman law than in canon law. The historian Austin Lane Poole said of him that he [...] "kept <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible out of secular politics, and used [...] learning and practical abilities whole-heartedly for the welfare of the church." [...] During his bishopric, he advanced the career of Baldwin of Forde, as it was Bartholomew who made Baldwin archdeacon.

2500|$|The {{starting}} point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members. If {{a large number of}} data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years [...] "exposed to risk" [...] in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to iron <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible, the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.|$|E
