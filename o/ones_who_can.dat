5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and I knew that I was, but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{years later}} in 1963, Srintil (Prisia Nasution) and Rasus (Nyoman Oka Antara) are fast friends. Rasus also has romantic {{feelings}} for her. With the hamlet starved and in a depression since the loss of its ronggeng, Sakarya receives a vision that Srintil will become a great ronggeng, capable of saving the hamlet from starvation. He then convinces Srintil to become a ronggeng. She then tries to proves herself to Kartareja (Slamet Rahardjo), the hamlet's ronggeng caretaker and his wife (Dewi Irawan) by dancing at the grave of Ki Secamenggala, the hamlet's founder. Her attempt is only successful after Rasus gave her the ronggeng amulet belonged to the late ronggeng of Dukuh Paruk. Seeing this amulet, Kartareja then announces that Srintil has been chosen by the founder's spirit. Meanwhile, Indonesian Communist Party member Bakar (Lukman Sardi) arrived in the hamlet and convincing local farmers to join the party, saying that the Communist party are the only <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> help save the wong cilik (underclass) of Dukuh Paruk and their starved hamlet.|$|E

There is no choice for Finley & Figg but to give up their motion to withdraw the tort case and prepare to go through the motions of a [...] jury trial which they have absolutely no chance of winning. Moreover, going through the motions is quite expensive: in order to present any kind of case they must bring experts to testify against Krayoxx and even disreputable experts, the only <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> be found charge fees {{in the tens of thousands}} of dollars.|$|E

500|$|The most {{prominent}} example of globalization {{in the first}} world is the European Union (EU). The European Union is an agreement in which countries voluntarily decide to build common governmental institutions to which they delegate some individual national sovereignty so that decisions can be made democratically on a higher level of common interest for Europe as a whole. The result is a union of 28 Member States covering [...] with roughly half a billion people. In total, the European Union produces almost a third of the world’s gross national product and the member states speak more than 23 languages. All of the European Union countries are joined together by a hope to promote and extend peace, democracy, cooperativeness, stability, prosperity, and the rule of law. In a 2007 speech, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commissioner for External Relations, said herself: [...] "The future of the EU is linked to globalization...the EU has a crucial role to play in making globalization work properly...". In a 2014 speech at the European Parliament, the Italian PM Matteo Renzi said: [...] "we are the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> bring civilization to globalization".|$|E

2500|$|On December 7, UN {{officials}} {{claimed that}} the $7.1 billion budget (USD) for peacekeeping troops was insufficient even before planned reinforcements of MONUC could be fulfilled; even the troop and equipment requirements may not be met, as Western countries declined support, citing the conflict not as [...] "strategically vital" [...] as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. International Crisis Group vice-president Fabienne Hara stated that, [...] "Contributions of U.N. members states will probably not grow at the very least, if not diminish... may not be funded properly due to a crisis in terms of resources." [...] An anonymous UN official {{claimed that the}} Security Council could [...] "drop the ball, {{move on to another}} issue and we're the ones at fault. We've seen before that is a recipe for failure." [...] Reuters reported that a senior Western Security Council diplomat claimed that, while criticism was not invalid, other countries with reserves of troops should aid failing peacekeeping missions. The official stated that [...] "We're not the only <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> do this. Where are the Russians, the Ukrainians? Where are the developing countries who want to have seats on the Security Council? Where is Brazil? It doesn't always have to be us." [...] The lack of peacekeeping resources was cited as counterproductive by political analyst Max Bergmann of the National Security Network. [...] "UN forces ... do fail, but this is often the result of either too few troops or too little money. Our reliance on the United Nations to address trouble spots and to prevent them from worsening has only increased. Shorting the U.N. on peacekeeping funding is therefore akin to shooting ourselves in the foot." [...] European Union nations declined to intervene.|$|E

60|$|Here is a {{digression}} {{suggested by}} the sight of a man I had known in other scenes, despatch-riding round a fleet in a petrol-launch. There are many of his type, yachtsmen of sorts accustomed to take chances, who do not hold masters' certificates and cannot be given sea-going commands. Like my friend, they do general utility work--often in their own boats. This is a waste of good material. Nobody wants amateur navigators--the traffic lanes are none too wide as it is. But these gentlemen ought to be distributed among the Trawler Fleet as strictly combatant officers. A trawler skipper may be an excellent seaman, but slow with a submarine shelling and diving, or in cutting out enemy trawlers. The young <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> master Q.F. gun work {{in a very short time}} would--though there might be friction, a court-martial or two, and probably losses at first--pay for their keep. Even a hundred or so of amateurs, more or less controlled by their squadron commanders, would make a happy beginning, and I am sure they would all be extremely grateful.|$|E
60|$|Again I {{hear the}} voices indignantly muttering old phrases {{about the high}} {{character}} of a noble profession and the honor and conscience of its members. I must reply that the medical profession has not a high character: it has an infamous character. I do not know a single thoughtful and well-informed person who does not feel that the tragedy of illness at present is that it delivers you helplessly {{into the hands of}} a profession which you deeply mistrust, because it not only advocates and practises the most revolting cruelties in the pursuit of knowledge, and justifies them on grounds which would equally justify practising the same cruelties on yourself or your children, or burning down London to test a patent fire extinguisher, but, when it has shocked the public, tries to reassure it with lies of breath-bereaving brazenness. That is the character the medical profession has got just now. It may be deserved or it may not: there it is at all events, and the doctors who have not realized this are living in a fool's paradise. As to the humor and conscience of doctors, they have as much as any other class of men, no more and no less. And what other men dare pretend to be impartial where they have a strong pecuniary interest on one side? Nobody supposes that doctors are less virtuous than judges; but a judge whose salary and reputation depended on whether the verdict was for plaintiff or defendant, prosecutor or prisoner, would be as little trusted as a general in the pay of the enemy. To offer me a doctor as my judge, and then weight his decision with a bribe of a large sum of money and a virtual guarantee that if he makes a mistake it can never be proved against him, is to go wildly beyond the ascertained strain which human nature will bear. It is simply unscientific to allege or believe that doctors do not under existing circumstances perform unnecessary operations and manufacture and prolong lucrative illnesses. The only <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> claim to be above suspicion are those who are so much sought after that their cured patients are immediately replaced by fresh ones. And there is this curious psychological fact to be remembered: a serious illness or a death advertizes the doctor exactly as a hanging advertizes the barrister who defended the person hanged. Suppose, for example, a royal personage gets something wrong with his throat, or has a pain in his inside. If a doctor effects some trumpery cure with a wet compress or a peppermint lozenge nobody takes the least notice of him. But if he operates on the throat and kills the patient, or extirpates an internal organ and keeps the whole nation palpitating for days whilst the patient hovers in pain and fever between life and death, his fortune is made: every rich man who omits to call him in when the same symptoms appear in his household is held not to have done his utmost duty to the patient. The wonder {{is that there is a}} king or queen left alive in Europe.|$|E
