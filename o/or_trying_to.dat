5|$|Willis has {{appeared}} on the Late Show with David Letterman several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when {{he was supposed to}} be a guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, having one side of his face made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> break a record (parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.|$|E
5|$|The Natchez killed {{almost all}} of the 150 Frenchmen at Fort Rosalie, and only about 20 managed to escape. Most of the dead were unarmed. Women, children, and African slaves were mostly spared; many were locked inside a house on the bluff, guarded by several warriors, from where they could see the events. According to Dumont de Montigny's account of the attack, women seen {{defending}} their husbands from the violence, <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> avenge them, were taken captive or killed. One woman's unborn baby was reportedly torn from her before she herself was killed. A year after the event, the tally of dead was put at 138 men, 35 women and 56 children, or approximately 230 overall. Some scholars argue that the Natchez spared the African slaves due to a general sense of affinity between the Natchez and the Africans; some slaves even joined the Natchez against their masters, while others took the chance to escape to freedom. A group of Yazoo people who were accompanying Commandant du Codère remained neutral during the conflict but were inspired by the Natchez revolt. When they returned to Fort St. Pierre, they destroyed the fort, killing the Jesuit priest and 17 French soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the current}} systems have three {{different}} formations in each third, defending, middle, and attacking. The goal is to outnumber the other team {{in all parts of}} the field but to not completely wear out all the players on the team using it before the full ninety minutes are up. So the one single number is confusing as it may not actually look like a 4–2–1–3 when a team is defending <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> gain possession. In a positive attack it may look exactly like a 4–2–1–3.|$|E
25|$|Although {{raised in}} his uncle's Catholic court in Spain, Rudolf was {{tolerant}} of Protestantism and other religions including Judaism. He largely withdrew from Catholic observances, even in death denying last sacramental rites. He had little attachment to Protestants either, except as counter-weight to repressive Papal policies. He put his primary support behind conciliarists, irenicists, and humanists. When the papacy instigated the Counter-Reformation, using agents sent to his court, Rudolf backed those who he thought {{were the most}} neutral in the debate, not taking a side <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> effect restraint, thus leading to political chaos and threatening to provoke civil war.|$|E
25|$|The {{anxiety of}} {{heterosexual}} individuals (particularly adolescents whose construction of heterosexual masculinity {{is based in}} part on not being seen as gay) that others may identify them as gay has also been identified by Michael Kimmel as an example of homophobia. The taunting of boys seen as eccentric (and who are not usually gay) is said to be endemic in rural and suburban American schools, and has been associated with risk-taking behavior and outbursts of violence (such as a spate of school shootings) by boys seeking revenge <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> assert their masculinity. Homophobic bullying is also very common in schools in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|This was {{a deadly}} affair {{in which men}} were kidnapped for the army, rounded up indiscriminately by press-gangs or army units among those on the roads or in the towns and villages, or {{otherwise}} gathered together. Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps like Buchenwald.3 Probably 3,081,000 died during the Sino-Japanese War; likely another 1,131,000 during the Civil War--4,212,000 dead in total. Just during conscription.|$|E
25|$|Filipescu still {{exercised}} intellectual {{influence over}} the political class with his stance on debt and, in 1933, sparked a national debate over the need to restore the country risk to more manageable levels—in effect, for austerity. The PC formed a cartel with the PP during the December 1933 election, but registered dismal results. The race was won by the PNL, with Duca being confirmed as Prime Minister. By then, the PC was losing its support base on the right, with Cantacuzino and other cadres migrating toward the Iron Guard, an openly fascist movement, <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> persuade General Ion Antonescu into reviving the Vlad Țepeș League. Filipescu also ran, unsuccessfully, for a deputy seat in Ilfov during the by-elections of 1934.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of {{cerebellar}} abiotrophy include ataxia {{or lack of}} balance, {{an awkward}} wide-legged stance, a head tremor (intention tremor) (in dogs, body tremors also occur), hyperreactivity, lack of menace reflex, stiff or high-stepping gait, coarse or jerky head bob when in motion (or in very young animals, when attempting to nurse), apparent lack of awareness of where the feet are (sometimes standing <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> walk with a foot knuckled over), poor depth perception, and a general inability to determine space and distance. The symptoms, when taken as a group, are distinctive and not easily mimicked by other illnesses, though certain types of neurological injury and infection need to be ruled out.

25|$|When teams start a leg, {{arrive at}} Route Markers, or {{complete}} certain tasks, they normally receive a letter-sized tear-away envelope that contains their next clue inside a vertical-fold folder. The clues themselves are typically printed on a vertical strip of paper, although additional information is often provided inside the clue folder. After retrieving the clue, teams open {{the envelope and}} read aloud the instructions given on the clue sheet and then follow those instructions. Teams are generally required to collect each clue during each leg and keep that information with them until they reach the next Pit Stop, surrendering them once they have checked in. Teams may not take an additional clue from the clue box should they lose their first one, otherwise they are assessed a penalty. Teams are not directly penalized for misplacing their clue but will lose time either searching for it <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> learn from other teams of where to go next.|$|E
25|$|As the British market waned, Portuguese wine {{producers}} {{turned their}} attention the Portuguese colonies of West Africa and South America. Wanting {{to protect their own}} interest, the Portuguese developed monopolistic policies that practically forbade their colonies from importing wines from other countries <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> produce wine of their own. In Brazil, the wealthy market of Rio de Janeiro was given exclusively to the Douro producers {{at the expense of other}} Portuguese wine regions. The monopoly of control allowed Portuguese wine merchants to set excessively high prices on their wines, often five times the price that the wines would fetch in Britain or Portugal. Dissatisfaction over restrictions such as these contributed to the growing movement for Brazilian Declaration of Independence which was eventually achieved on 7 September 1822. With the loss of the Brazilian market and the limited markets in West Africa, Portuguese wine producers retreated further into their relative isolationism when it came to the wine market. While Britain still remained a strong market, the Portuguese wine industry entered a period of stagnation that was further punctuated by the devastation of the phylloxera louse.|$|E
25|$|Alec Smart (Ricky Diamond) - The sly and untrustworthy tenant {{who moves}} into the flat above Bodger's in Series 7.

A year later when Bodger and Badger move to Puddleford at the beginning of Series 8 to run a hotel, they are horrified to discover that Mr Smart is their next door neighbour once again. He is also running a hotel, but never seems to have any guests and is always trying to steal Bodger's <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> outshine his rival in every despicable way possible. He was last seen in the episode 'Doggone' when he kidnapped China the dog in order to obtain a reward for finding him. As he is not seen or mentioned again in the series, it is assumed that he moved away from Puddleford or still lives next door but never mentioned.|$|E

500|$|Another poorly {{understood}} element of cat hunting behavior is {{the presentation of}} prey to human guardians.

Anthropologist and zoologist Desmond Morris, in his 1986 book Catwatching, suggests, when cats bring home mice or birds, they are attempting to teach their human to hunt, <b>or</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> help their human as if feeding [...] "an elderly cat, or an inept kitten".
