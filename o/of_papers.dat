5|$|The Mendelian and biometrician {{models were}} {{eventually}} reconciled {{with the development}} of population genetics. A key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. In a series <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change gene frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J. B. S. Haldane, applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths, and showed that natural selection worked at an even faster rate than Fisher assumed.|$|E

50|$|In January 2002, while {{a junior}} in high school, Gallivan {{demonstrated}} that a single piece <b>of</b> toilet <b>paper</b> 4000 ft (1200 m) in length can be folded in half twelve times.

5|$|Also around 1995, Kontsevich {{analyzed}} {{the results of}} Candelas, which gave a general formula for the problem of counting rational curves on a quintic threefold, and he reformulated these results as a precise mathematical conjecture. In 1996, Alexander Givental posted a paper that claimed to prove this conjecture of Kontsevich. Initially, many mathematicians found this paper hard to understand, so there were doubts about its correctness. Subsequently, Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Shing-Tung Yau published an independent proof in a series <b>of</b> <b>papers.</b> Despite controversy over who had published the first proof, these papers are now collectively seen as providing a mathematical proof of the results originally obtained by physicists using mirror symmetry. In 2000, Kentaro Hori and Cumrun Vafa gave another physical proof of mirror symmetry based on T-duality.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In paper industry, {{dryer section}} <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> machine consumes {{large amount of}} energy. It also leads in terms of capital {{investment}} as compared with other sections and most <b>of</b> the <b>paper</b> properties are influenced by dryer section, so any improvement in dryer section <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> machine can significantly reduce cost as well as improve paper quality. This paper deals with study of the pocket ventilation in the dryer section <b>of</b> the <b>paper</b> machine. Also it shows the various factors which influence the paper drying process. In the conventional paper machine, {{the reason for the}} uneven drying <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> was the uneven pocket air humidity distribution along the cross direction <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> web. This problem can be overcome by improving the pocket ventilation system in the dryer section <b>of</b> the <b>paper</b> machine. This improvement in the pocket ventilation would increase the drying rate <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> web which ultimately reduce the operating cost and energy consumption. Improved pocket ventilation also helps to maintain the uniform humidity profile...|$|R
