5|$|Nielsen {{was legally}} deaf and wore hearing aids {{for most of}} his life. Because of this impairment, he {{supported}} the Better Hearing Institute. Later in life, Nielsen had knee <b>osteoarthritis.</b> He participated in an educational video from The Arthritis Research Centre of Canada (ARC), demonstrating the physical examination of a patient with knee <b>osteoarthritis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{apparently}} false {{claims are}} that fins prevent cancer and treat <b>osteoarthritis.</b> No scientific proof supports these claims; {{at least one}} study has shown shark cartilage of no value in cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of a {{fractured}} hip bone {{was found in}} a specimen of Iguanodon, which had an injury to its ischium. Two other individuals were observed with signs of <b>osteoarthritis</b> as evidenced by bone overgrowths in their anklebones which are called osteophytes.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{body weight}} is {{associated}} with various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, <b>osteoarthritis</b> and asthma. As a result, obesity {{has been found to}} reduce life expectancy.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when {{he pointed out}} that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods were found {{in some of the}} graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, {{there was a lack of}} weapons. He also talked of the apparent presence of female skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with <b>osteoarthritis,</b> who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east-west orientation.|$|E
5|$|He {{then went}} {{through a series of}} jobs, {{including}} employment as a caretaker, a cook for a departmental survey party and as a leading hand at the Canberra incinerator. By 1951 he was almost crippled with <b>osteoarthritis,</b> and soon after was admitted to the Queanbeyan Private Nursing Home, where he died on 25 August 1972; he was buried with full military honours in the Ex-Servicemen's section of Woden Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Realising the {{potential}} public relations coup {{in having a}} star sportsman enlist, officers recommended that Nash be seconded to the Army School of Physical Training (where Don Bradman {{had been given a}} commission), which offered greater pay and rank and ensured that Nash would not be posted overseas, away from family. Additionally, a medical examination detected <b>osteoarthritis</b> in both his knees, derived from the number of injuries he sustained throughout his footballing career. Nash refused, stating that he did not wish to be treated differently from ordinary recruits, and enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, gaining the rank of Trooper.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, <b>osteoarthritis,</b> spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including <b>osteoarthritis,</b> bursitis, and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.|$|E
5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth of the allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe <b>osteoarthritis,</b> which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E
5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. <b>Osteoarthritis</b> is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease but rather a complaint that {{may be caused by}} a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause but {{is believed to be the}} result of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include <b>osteoarthritis,</b> degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include <b>osteoarthritis,</b> ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October 1999, Makeba {{was named}} a Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In January 2000, her album, Homeland, {{produced}} by the New York City based record label Putumayo World Music, {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in the Best World Music Album category. She worked closely with Graça Machel-Mandela, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from HIV/AIDS, child soldiers, and the physically handicapped. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary , which examined the struggles of black South Africans against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba's second autobiography, Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story, was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having <b>osteoarthritis,</b> continued to perform until her death. During this period, her grandchildren Nelson Lumumba Lee and Zenzi Lee, and her great-grandchild Lindelani, occasionally joined her performances.|$|E
25|$|Both primary {{generalized}} nodal <b>osteoarthritis</b> and erosive <b>osteoarthritis</b> (EOA, {{also called}} inflammatory <b>osteoarthritis)</b> are sub-sets of primary <b>osteoarthritis.</b> EOA {{is a much}} less common, and more aggressive inflammatory form of <b>osteoarthritis</b> which often affects the distal interphalangeal joints of the hand and has characteristic articular erosive changes on x-ray.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines {{outlining}} {{requirements for}} inclusion of soluble biomarkers in <b>osteoarthritis</b> clinical trials {{were published in}} 2015, but as yet, there are no validated biomarkers for <b>osteoarthritis.</b> A 2015 systematic review of biomarkers for <b>osteoarthritis</b> looking for molecules {{that could be used}} for risk assessments found 37 different biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover in 25 publications. The strongest evidence was for urinary C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II (uCTX-II) as a prognostic marker for knee <b>osteoarthritis</b> progression and serum cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP) levels as a prognostic marker for incidence of both knee and hip <b>osteoarthritis.</b> A review of biomarkers in hip <b>osteoarthritis</b> also found associations with uCTXII.|$|E
25|$|In the 60–64 age cohort, the {{incidence}} of <b>osteoarthritis</b> rises to 53%. Only 20% however report disabling <b>osteoarthritis</b> at this age.|$|E
25|$|<b>Osteoarthritis</b> {{commonly}} {{affects the}} hands, feet, spine, {{and the large}} weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees, although in theory, any joint in the body can be affected. As <b>osteoarthritis</b> progresses, movement patterns (such as gait), are typically affected. <b>Osteoarthritis</b> {{is the most common}} cause of a joint effusion of the knee.|$|E
25|$|Globally as of 2010, {{approximately}} 250 {{million people}} had <b>osteoarthritis</b> {{of the knee}} (3.6% of the population). Hip <b>osteoarthritis</b> affects about 0.85% of the population.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, <b>osteoarthritis</b> {{affected}} 52.5 {{million people}} in the United States, approximately 50% of whom were 65 years and older. It is estimated that 80% of the population have radiographic evidence of <b>osteoarthritis</b> by age 65, although only 60% of those will have symptoms. The rate of <b>osteoarthritis</b> in the United States is forecast to be 78 million (26%) adults by 2040.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{attempting}} to find disease-modifying agents for <b>osteoarthritis,</b> there is emerging {{evidence that a}} system-based approach is necessary to find the causes of <b>osteoarthritis.</b> Changes may occur before clinical disease is evident due to abnormalities in biomechanics, biology or structure of joints that predispose them to develop clinical disease. Research is thus focusing on defining these early pre-osteoarthritis changes using biological, mechanical, and imaging markers of <b>osteoarthritis</b> risk, emphasising multi-disciplinary approaches, and looking into personalized interventions that can reverse <b>osteoarthritis</b> risk in healthy joints before the disease becomes evident.|$|E
25|$|<b>Osteoarthritis</b> of the carpometacarpal joints {{is a type}} {{of joint}} disease that results from {{breakdown}} of joint cartilage and underlying bone. When it affects the thumb it is termed trapeziometacarpal <b>osteoarthritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evidence for <b>osteoarthritis</b> {{found in}} the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. <b>Osteoarthritis</b> has been {{reported}} in fossils of the large carnivorous dinosaur Allosaurus fragilis.|$|E
25|$|Osteotomy may {{be useful}} in people with knee <b>osteoarthritis,</b> but has not been well studied. Arthroscopic surgery is largely not recommended, as it does not improve {{outcomes}} in knee <b>osteoarthritis,</b> and may result in harm.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of glucosamine is controversial. Reviews {{have found it}} to be equal to or slightly better than placebo. A difference may exist between glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride, with glucosamine sulfate showing a benefit and glucosamine hydrochloride not. The evidence for glucosamine sulfate having an effect on <b>osteoarthritis</b> progression is somewhat unclear and if present likely modest. The <b>Osteoarthritis</b> Research Society International recommends that glucosamine be discontinued if no effect is observed after six months and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence no longer recommends its use. Despite the difficulty in determining the efficacy of glucosamine, it remains a viable treatment option. The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and <b>Osteoarthritis</b> (ESCEO) recommends glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate for knee <b>osteoarthritis.</b> Its use as a therapy for <b>osteoarthritis</b> is usually safe.|$|E
25|$|There {{are ongoing}} efforts to {{determine}} if there are agents that modify outcomes in <b>osteoarthritis.</b> Sprifermin is one candidate drug. There is also tentative evidence that strontium ranelate may decrease degeneration in <b>osteoarthritis</b> and improve outcomes.|$|E
25|$|After rehabilitation, {{preventing}} <b>osteoarthritis</b> involves {{slowing the}} progression and {{spread of the}} disease. Maintaining aerobic cardiovascular fitness has been an effective method for preventing the progression of <b>osteoarthritis.</b> Light, daily exercise is much better for an arthritic knee than occasional, heavy exercise.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be useful}} for chronic pain from <b>osteoarthritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} shown {{efficacy}} of glucosamine supplementation for dogs with <b>osteoarthritis</b> pain, particularly {{in combination with other}} nutraceuticals like chondroitin while others have not. A trial of oral combination capsules (glucosamine/chondroitin/manganese ascorbate) in dogs with <b>osteoarthritis</b> found no benefit on either gait analysis or subjective assessments by the veterinarian or owner.|$|E
25|$|Lateral wedge insoles {{and neutral}} insoles {{do not appear}} to be useful in <b>osteoarthritis</b> of the knee. Knee braces may help but their {{usefulness}} has also been disputed. For pain management heat can be used to relieve stiffness, and cold can relieve muscle spasms and pain. Among people with hip and knee <b>osteoarthritis,</b> exercise in water may reduce pain and disability, and increase quality of life in the short term. Also therapeutic exercise programs such as aerobics and walking reduce pain and improve physical functioning for up to 6 months after the end of the program for people with knee <b>osteoarthritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{carpometacarpal joint}} is a {{frequent}} site of <b>osteoarthritis</b> in postmenopausal women.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology, {{using data}} from a multi-center study, {{developed}} a set of criteria for the diagnosis of hand <b>osteoarthritis</b> based on hard tissue enlargement and swelling of certain joints.
