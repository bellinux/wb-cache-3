40|$|Interactions between multipolar nuclear {{transitions}} and {{gravitational waves}} (GWs) are theoretically investigated and two nonclassical scenarios of GW detection are suggested. We shall demonstrate {{in this report}} that the long-lived Mossbauer nuclides of multipolar transitions are suitable transducers to detect impinging GWs. Shape deformation and spin flip of nucleus are derived from the Hamiltonian with graviton in interaction. GWs generate nuclear quadrupole deformation in analogy with the Stark effect, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>electric</b> field generates the dipole deformation of electron orbits. Likewise in analogy with the NMR that the rotating rf field flips the nuclear spin, GWs flip the nuclear spin by the resonant helicity-rotation-gravity coupling. The high energy states of the quadrupole deformation in heavy nuclides can dramatically speed up the multipolar transitions, which may be important for GW detections particularly in the low frequency band...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHigh speed wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM-HS) has been an extremely important and irreplaceable means of processing precision parts in aerospace, mold and other fields owing to its unique advantages. The pulse power is the key component of the WEDM, which directly restricts the improvement of WEDM overall performance. At present, the pulse power used in commercial WEDM-HS equipment, whose processing surface roughness and machining accuracy are low, is generally applied to rough machining. This paper develops a multi-mode precision pulse power based on micro controller unit (MCU) and double complex programmable logic devices (CPLD), <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>electric</b> parameters can be widely adjusted. Effects of capacitance on achievable processing thickness and surface roughness are analyzed under controllable resistance and capacitance precision pulse power mode. By properly selecting capacitance to make triple of charging time equal to pulse duration, the best surface roughness and minimum single pulse energy are obtained when pulse duration, pulse interval and current-limiting resistance remain constant. The paper also analyzes and optimizes the parameters affecting surface roughness and processing speed through orthogonal experiment. Then five-cutting experiments are conducted using the optimized machining parameters, obtaining that the best surface roughness reaches 0. 96 m when workpiece thickness is 40 mm...|$|E
40|$|Squirrel monkeys {{were trained}} to respond under a {{multiple}} fixed-interval, fixed-interval schedule in which the first response after 5 min terminated a visual stimulus in the presence <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>electric</b> shocks could occur. During one component of the schedule, correlated with one color of stimulus lights, every 30 th response also produced electric shock; responding was suppressed during this component to approximately 10 to 12 % of that occurring in the alternate component in which responding was not punished. In contrast to previous research, morphine (0. 03 to 1. 0 mg/kg) increased punished responding. Unpunished responding, however, was either not affected or decreased at doses of morphine that increased punished responding. Increases in rate of punished responding also occurred when the single-schedule punishment condition was studied alone in these animals. Subsequent experimentation, which systematically analyzed {{the development of the}} rate-enhancing effects of morphine on punished responding, involved the study of drug effects in additional monkeys trained initially under a single-schedule punishment condition. The effects of morphine on punished responding were studied before, after, and then during exposure to the multiple schedule that included a component in which responding was not punished. Increases in response rate with morphine did not occur until it was administered during exposure to the multiple schedule that included a component in which responding was not punished. As with the other monkeys, once the rate increases in punished responding occurred under the multiple schedule, these effects of morphine persisted, even when the multiple schedule was removed.

40|$|According {{to current}} ideas only left-handed fermion {{currents}} {{participate in the}} weak interaction. However there exist left-right symmetric variants of electroweak theory with right-handed currents which couple with equal intrinsic strength, whose contribution is suppressed by the presumed relatively greater mass of the mediating vector bosons. One route to detecting the presence of right-handed currents is to measure the velocity-dependence of the polarization of electrons from mixed Fermi/Gamow-Teller #beta#-transitions. This thesis describes the theory, construction and operation of a Wien filter which is a system of crossed uniform electric and magnetic fields which transmits electrons of velocity v = E/B, and is therefore an ideal instrument for precise velocity measurements. The filter {{is based on a}} 2. 5 meter long uniform field electromagnet purpose built at Oak Ridge some thirty years ago to study the electric and magnetic dipole moments of the neutron. The thesis comes in two parts: the first part presents the exact theory of relativistic electron motion in an ideal crossed field system, together with numerical programs for examining the effects of imperfections <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>electric</b> field non-uniformity and remnant magnetism {{turn out to be the}} most important. This is followed by the constructional details of the velocity filter including electric and magnetic field measurements, vacuum performance and the method for detecting and processing electron signals. This part concludes with an account of the successful testing of the filter using 62. 5 keV and 84. 5 keV internal conversion electrons from an electron-capture source of 453 day " 1 " 0 " 9 Cd. The second part of the thesis deals with the dynamics of electron spin motion in crossed fields; in particular with spin rotation from longitudinal to transverse orientation which is necessary for applying the method of Mott scattering from heavy nuclei for electron polarization determination. This part also describes the Mott-scattering chamber arid the electron detection system used to measure the left-right counting asymmetry which is characteristic of electron polarization. An initial attempt to detect a scattering asymmetry using electrons from the pure Gamow-Teller of 24 -day " 3 " 3 P was largely unsuccessful, mainly because of the short-lived nature of the source combined with misalignment and background problems.
