5|$|Male sovereigns {{up to and}} {{including}} George VI have traditionally worn a crimson cap of maintenance for the opening procession and when seated in the Chair of Estate during the first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> Female sovereigns wear the George IV State Diadem, also worn by its namesake, George IV. For the Anointing, the sovereign is bareheaded, and remains so until the Crowning. Monarchs are usually crowned with St Edward's Crown but some have chosen to use other crowns because it weighs 2.23kg (4.9lb).

5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E
