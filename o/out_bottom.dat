50|$|In 1964 Greenough {{traveled}} to Australia {{and ended up}} impressing the locals by showing them his new school wave riding style blending speed, power, and grace; drawing sharp turns and deep barrel rides. He influenced the likes of Nat Young into using Greenough’s style of surfing fin which he used to win the 1966 world surfing championships in San Diego California ushering {{in a new era}} in surfing in which the Australians were seen to emerge as a dominant surfing country. “The greatest surfer in the world today,” is what Young described Greenough back then. After the visit to Australia, Greenough shaped a board which he explained as {{the next step in the}} progression of surfing, “a fish moves when he swims… so why not make a whole board that moves when it’s on a wave?” what he created was a board that had multiple layers of fiberglass shaped just like the old balsa kneeboards he rode, a glued on ridge of polyurethane foam on top of the deck near the rails and nose with the back end of the board entirely made of fiberglass; and the final piece to the board was his signature flex-fin to top off the board. the board was so small and light that it was not very good in small surf; only in big surf did the board show it’s true excellence and allowed Greenough to maneuver on the wave with a new school style, more power and speed than previous designs, “Greenough was riding like a visitor from ten years in surfing’s future. He cranked <b>out</b> <b>bottom</b> turns where his board tilted up almost 90 degrees…” In 1966 Greenough made his second board which he nicknamed ‘velo’ for velocity.|$|E
5000|$|Josh Holliday (born September 14, 1976) is an American college {{baseball}} coach and former professional player in Minor League Baseball. Currently {{the head coach}} of the Oklahoma State Cowboys baseball team, he was hired to this position prior to the 2013 season. [...] In 2014, Holliday was the Big 12 Conference Baseball Coach of the Year as OSU claimed the conference regular season championship. Hollidays' Cowboys pulled OSU a little Cowboy baseball tradition out of the fire and faced Oklahoma on the final weekend of 2017. The team was in danger of missing out of the postseason for the 1st time in Hollidays tenure at Oklahoma State. The Cowboys swept the instate rival Oklahoma Sooners (#2 seed going into region play) to claim the last and final spot as the 8th seed in the BigXII Championship. The Cowboys went back to their traditionion and won just the 2nd Big 12 tournament in schools rich baseball history. The Cowboys won 16 straight Big 8 tournaments before the formation of the Big12. The Cowboys became the 1st eight seed (last seed) to win the conference championship and by doing so Holliday got his team in the NCAA postseason for the 5th time in his 5 years at the school. The season was full of injuries from top to bottom Holliday and is associated Head Coach and current (2016) assistant coach of the year Rob Walton put together a pitching staff that was nothing short of magical. The Cowboys luck would run out as the were sent to the Arkansas Regional and went 0-2 losing game one to Regional champions Missouri State Bears on a two <b>out</b> <b>bottom</b> of the 9th walk off HR. Garrett Benge hit for the cycle for Hollidays Cowboys but it wasn't enough.

Representation of such geometries has tended to rely upon sub-grid scale treatments involving roughness parameterization within numerical schemes. This paper develops, verifies and validates a technique for dealing with the representation of complex bed geometries within a basic numerical scheme.

40|$|The impact {{properties}} of six foam materials used for energy absorption as the liner of children’s helmets, reported by Gimbel and Hoshizaki are considered further. In high-energy impacts, almost complete compression {{of the energy}} absorbing material (<b>bottoming</b> <b>out)</b> may occur, and {{the severity of the}} impact increases greatly. Too soft a material means <b>bottoming</b> <b>out</b> occurs at low speeds, but if it is too stiff, the material itself is injurious. The fitting of equations to results in‘no bottoming out’ and ‘bottoming out’ conditions may help assessment of what compromise is appropriate. The equations in this article correspond to peak acceleration being proportional to power functions of impactor speed and mass. 1. When there was no <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> peak acceleration was found to be proportional to mˆ(c- 1). vˆ(2 c), with c being approximately 0. 25. 2.

40|$|Recent {{disintegration}} {{of a number}} of Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves has given us a unique opportunity to investigate sub-ice-shelf sediments. We characterize three sediment facies associations of two Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves (Larsen-A and Larsen Inlet). Subglacial facies consist mainly of basal till (diamicton) with high shear strengths deposited under a grounded ice sheet. Progressive upward decrease in shear strength reflects a gradual decrease in the confining vertical effective pressure of grounded ice during till deposition. Proximal ice-shell glacimarine facies (diamicton, gravel-rich and sand-rich facies, gravelly mud, dropstone Mud and sands muds) ere deposited by sub-ice-shelf rain <b>out,</b> <b>bottom</b> current activity and sediment gravity flows following decoupling of grounded ice from the sea-floor, Distal, he-shell glacimarine and/or open marine facies comprise terrigenous and diatom-bearing bioturbated muds and gravelly muds that contain limited ice-rafted debris these accumulated after recession of the grounding line to the coast, with coarse-grained surface sediments possible documenting most recent ice-shelf break-up. Antarctic Peninsula ice-shelf sediments are more heterogeneous than ice-shelf facies deposited else's here in Antarctica. Cold. polar Antarctic ice shelves can be differentiated from temperate and sub-polar marine-terminated glacial sedimentary systems by the dominance of coarse-grained proximal. ice-shelf glacimarine facies and an absence of subaqueous outwash/meltwater sediment facies...|$|E
