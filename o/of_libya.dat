5|$|These {{military}} actions left Habré {{in control of}} Chad and {{in a position to}} threaten the expulsion <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> from the Aouzou Strip, affected the international perception <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> as a significant regional military power, and cast renewed doubt on the competence and determination of Libyan soldiers, especially in engagements beyond the country's borders to which they evidently felt no personal commitment.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the {{academic}} journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public. Two years later, the Papers from the Institute of Archaeology issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler's activities {{in studying the}} archaeology <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> during World War II.|$|E

5|$|In April 1986 she {{permitted}} US F-111s to use Royal Air Force {{bases for}} the bombing <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> {{in retaliation for the}} alleged Libyan bombing of a Berlin discothèque, citing the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of her decision.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} {{the signing of the}} 1972 treaty, Libyan troops moved into the Strip and {{established}} an airbase just north of Aouzou, protected by surface-to-air missiles. A civil administration was set up, attached to Kufra, and Libyan citizenship was extended to the few thousand inhabitants of the area. From that moment, Libyan maps represented the area as part <b>of</b> <b>Libya.</b>|$|E
5|$|That year, {{relations}} with Israel soured. Although Israel had previously supplied Uganda with arms, in 1972 Amin expelled Israeli military advisers {{and turned to}} Muammar Gaddafi <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> and the Soviet Union for support. Amin became {{an outspoken critic of}} Israel. In return, Gaddafi gave financial aid to Amin. In the 1974 French-produced documentary film , Amin discussed his plans for war against Israel, using paratroops, bombers, and suicide squadrons.|$|E

5|$|All {{this changed}} with the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces.|$|E
5|$|Exact {{details of}} her death {{eventually}} came to light; she boarded a packed boat with 70 other people {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach Italy. The boat soon ran out of petrol and was adrift off the coast <b>of</b> <b>Libya.</b> When an Italian Navy vessel arrived to offer assistance, it threw ropes over the side to the refugees. In the chaos that ensued as people attempting to grab the ropes, Omar was knocked into the sea, where witnesses saw her treading water for a while, but eventually drowned.|$|E
5|$|Following Italy's September 1911 {{invasion}} <b>of</b> <b>Libya,</b> al-Qassam {{began collecting}} funds in Jableh {{for the joint}} Ottoman-Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem. Jableh's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to have him jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty and the governor was consequently dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Following the Games, she hid {{away from}} {{athletics}} following threats by militant group Al-Shabaab. She {{ended up in}} a Hizbul-Islam displacement camp, and in pursuit of competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics, she crossed the border to Ethiopia looking for a safe place to train. She was trafficked north into Libya, where she was imprisoned. During the 2012 Games, it was revealed that Omar had drowned off the coast <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Italy.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} war on the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940. Bordering on the Italian colony <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> was the Kingdom of Egypt. Although a neutral country, Egypt was occupied by the British {{under the terms of}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt if the Suez Canal was threatened. A series of cross-border raids and skirmishes began on the frontier between Libya and Egypt. On 13 September 1940, an Italian force advanced across the frontier into Egypt, reaching Sidi Barrani on 16 September, where the advance was halted until logistical difficulties could be overcome.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 1986, in {{response}} to acts of terrorism sponsored by Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi—in particular, the Berlin disco bombing of April 6—and {{against the backdrop of}} heightened tension and clashes between the Libyan and U.S. Navies over Libya's disputed territorial water claims in the Gulf of Sidra, the United States launched a surprise attack on key facilities in Tripoli and other parts <b>of</b> <b>Libya.</b> The attack was code-named Operation El Dorado Canyon.|$|E

5|$|The {{rapprochement}} {{was not to}} last long, as on 13 April 1975 a coup d'état removed Tombalbaye {{and replaced}} him with General Félix Malloum. As the coup was partly motivated by opposition to Tombalbaye's appeasement <b>of</b> <b>Libya,</b> Gaddafi considered it a menace to his influence and resumed supplying the FROLINAT. In April 1976, there was a Gaddafi-backed attempted assassination of Malloum, {{and in the same}} year Libyan troops started making forays into central Chad in company of FROLINAT forces.|$|E
5|$|Following the Games, she {{received}} death threats upon returning to Somalia, and after being confronted by Al-Shabaab, {{she began to}} deny {{that she was an}} athlete. The organisation banned woman from participating in sports, and Omar eventually made her way to Ethiopia in order to pursue the hope of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics. She attempted to make her way to Europe, travelling to Libya in September 2011. Alongside other refugees, she attempted to cross the Mediterranean by sea in 2012; she drowned while attempting to board an Italian naval vessel when the boat she was on was intercepted off the coast <b>of</b> <b>Libya.</b> Omar's life story was later dramatised as the graphic novel An Olympic Dream: The story of Samia Yusuf Omar by German artist Reinhard Kleist.|$|E
5|$|From childhood, Gaddafi {{was aware}} of the {{involvement}} of European colonialists in Libya; his nation was occupied by Italy, and during the North African Campaign of World War II it witnessed conflict between Italian and British troops. According to later claims, Gaddafi's paternal grandfather, Abdessalam Bouminyar, was killed by the Italian Army during the Italian invasion of 1911. At World War II's end in 1945, Libya was occupied by British and French forces. Although Britain and France intended on dividing the nation between their empires, the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) declared that the country be granted political independence. In 1951, the UN created the United Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Libya,</b> a federal state under the leadership of a pro-Western monarch, Idris, who banned political parties and centralized power in his monarchy.|$|E

5|$|Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> in Benghazi, before {{dropping}} out {{to join the}} military. Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata. The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change. Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion {{that he was involved}} in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963. Such reports were ignored and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{setbacks}} in Egypt {{and their}} colony <b>of</b> <b>Libya</b> caused Hitler to dispatch aircraft to Sicily, and a blocking force to North Africa. This blocking force was put {{under the command}} of Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel and included the motorized 5th Light Division and the 15th Panzer Division. This force landed at Tripoli on 12February 1941. Upon arrival, Rommel had around 150 tanks, about half PanzerIII and IV. The rest were PanzerI's and IIs, although the Panzer I was soon replaced. On 6April 1941, Germany attacked both Yugoslavia and Greece, with fourteen divisions invading Greece from neighboring Bulgaria, which by then had joined the Tripartite Pact. The invasion of Yugoslavia included no less than six panzer divisions, which still fielded the PanzerI. Yugoslavia surrendered 17April 1941, and Greece fell on 30April 1941.|$|E
5|$|The defeats {{suffered}} in February and March accelerated {{the disintegration of}} the GUNT. When in March, at a new round of OAU-sponsored talks held in the People's Republic of Congo, Goukouni failed to appear, many suspected the hand <b>of</b> <b>Libya.</b> These suspicions caused the defection from the GUNT of its vice president, Kamougué, followed by the First Army and the piecemeal FROLINAT Originel. In August, it was the CDR's turn to leave the coalition, seizing the town of Fada. When in October Goukouni's FAP attempted to retake Fada, the Libyan garrison attacked Goukouni's troops, giving way to a pitched battle that effectively ended the GUNT. In the same month, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, while his troops rebelled against Gaddafi, dislodging the Libyans from all their positions in the Tibesti, and on 24 October went over to Habré.|$|E

5|$|Malloum's {{reaction}} to the Goukouni–Gaddafi offensive was to sever diplomatic relations with Libya on 6 February and bring before the UN Security Council the issue of Libyan involvement. He raised again the question <b>of</b> <b>Libya's</b> occupation <b>of</b> the Aouzou Strip; on 19 February, however, {{after the fall of}} Faya-Largeau, Malloum was forced to accept a ceasefire and withdraw the protest.
