40|$|The {{phytochemical}} {{investigation and}} evaluation of the phytotoxic effect of the extract and fractions obtained from the leaves of Annona nutans (R. E. Fr.) R. E. Fr. were performed. Phytotoxic activity was assessed on radicle and hypocotyl of Allium cepa and Lactuca sativa, where chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions proved active. Phytochemical investigation of the chloroform fraction was allowed identification of polyketides derivatives: triacontanal, 16 -hentriacontane, <b>octacosanol</b> and triacontanol, using the 1 H NMR technique associated with data from GC/MS. Using ethyl acetate fraction, with low activity, flavonoids 3 -O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-isorhamnetin, 3 -O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-quercetin and 3 -O-β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1 → 2) -galactopyranosyl-quercetin were identified, determined by spectrometric techniques one and two-dimensional NMR, combined with mass spectral data. All substances are being reported {{for the first time}} in Annona nutans. The phytotoxic activity of chloroform fraction may be related to the presence of triacontanol and similar substances. Triacontanol stimulates growth at very low concentrations, but can have an inhibitory effect at higher concentrations, such as those reported for auxin analogs. The toxicity assay using Artemia salina (BST) was also performed, with the chloroform fraction showing a negligible lethal dose, LD 50 = 500 mg mL- 1, while the other fractions and extracts showed no activity. Thus, the presence of acetogenins was ruled out...|$|E
40|$|Background: Worm {{infection}} and associated complications are severe problems that afflict {{a large population}} worldwide. Failure of synthetic drugs in worm infections because of drug resistance has made alternative drug therapy desirable. Cordia dichotoma (Forst.) is an ethnomedicinal plant which is rich in several secondary metabolites. Traditionally, the plant has been claimed to have high medicinal properties including antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity. Materials and Methods: The study begun with an aim to explore plant-based natural anthelmintic agents against Pheretima posthuma, an Indian earthworm. Methanol extract of the drug was obtained by successive soxhlet extraction. The extract was tested for different phytochemicals. Worms were exposed to 10 mg/ml, 25 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, and 75 mg/ml concentrations of extract and standard drug, albendazole. A software-based tool, prediction of activity spectra for substances was used to estimate anthelmintic efficacy of plant metabolites. Result: The phytochemical analysis revealed presence of alkaloids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, flavonoids, and phenols. The extract showed dose-dependent effects, affecting worm motility, viability, and mortality. It was {{also found that the}} biological activity spectrum of the plant phytoconstituents such as <b>octacosanol,</b> lupeol, caffeic acid, and hentricontanol were > 0. 5 (probable activity > 0. 5). Conclusion: The findings of the present work suggest that the extract of C. dichotoma significantly interferes with motility pattern of P. posthuma. The paralysis and mortality of P. posthuma might be due to the combined effects different phytoconstituents. The extract of C. dichotoma promises natural sources to control worm infection...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells, cultured at 5 % CO 2, with 1 to 1000 micrograms triacontanol (TRIA) {{per liter}} {{resulted}} in 21 to 35 % increases in cell density, 7 to 31 % increases in total chlorophyll, and 20 to 100 % increases in photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation. The increase in CO 2 fixation with TRIA treatment occurred before, and was independent of, increases in total chlorophyll or cell number. Chlamydomonas cells {{responded to a}} broad range of TRIA concentrations that were at least one order of magnitude above the optimum concentration established for higher plants. The necessity for larger concentrations of TRIA may be due to destabilizing effects of Ca 2 + and K+ present in the Chlamydomonas growth medium. These ions caused flocculation of the colloidally dispersed TRIA in apparent competition with binding of [14 C]TRIA to Chlamydomonas cells. <b>Octacosanol</b> inhibited the effect of TRIA on photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation. TRIA treatment did not alter the distribution of 14 C-label among photosynthetic products. The effect of TRIA on photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation increased with time after treatment up to 3 days. Chlamydomonas cells that had been grown at low-CO 2 (air) did not respond to TRIA, and transfer of high-CO 2 (5 %) grown cells that had responded to TRIA to a low-CO 2 atmosphere resulted in a loss of the effect of TRIA. The effect of pH on photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation indicated that CO 2 is probably the species of inorganic carbon utilized by control and TRIA-treated Chlamydomonas cells...|$|E
40|$|Pomace {{olive oil}} is a {{by-product}} of olive oil extraction that is traditionally produced and consumed in Spain. The nonglyceride matter of this oil is {{a good source of}} interesting minor compounds, like long-chain fatty alcohols, which are present free or as part of waxes. In the present study, long-chain fatty alcohols were isolated from the nonglyceride fraction of pomace olive oil, and the composition was identified and quantified. The major components of long-chain fatty alcohols were tetracosanol, hexacosanol and <b>octacosanol.</b> We investigated the ability of long-chain fatty alcohols from pomace olive oil to inhibit the release of different proinflammatory mediators in vitro by cells involved in inflammatory processes. Long-chain fatty alcohols significantly and dose-dependently decreased nitric oxide production by RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Western blot analysis showed that nitric oxide reduction was a consequence of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression. Long-chain fatty alcohols also reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E 2 production, although the potency of inhibition for the latter was lower. On the other hand, long-chain fatty alcohols significantly reduced thromboxane A 2 production in rat peritoneal neutrophils stimulated with the calcium ionophore A- 23187. The reduction of eicosanoid release was related to the inhibition of phospholipase A 2 enzyme activity by long-chain fatty alcohols, reaching an inhibitory concentration 50 % value of 6. 2 μg/ml. These results showed that long-chain fatty alcohols may have a protective effect on some mediators involved in the inflammatory damage development, suggesting its potential value as a putative functional component of pomace olive oil.

40|$|Abstract Background Psorospermun aurantiacum and Hypericum lanceolatum are plants locally used in Cameroon {{and other}} parts of Africa for the {{treatment}} of gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections, skin infections, venereal diseases, gastrointestinal disorder, infertility, epilepsy as well as microbial infections. The present study was designed in order to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial and radical scavenging activities of the extracts and isolated compounds from the leaves of these plants. Methods The plant extract was prepared by maceration in ethyl acetate and methanol and fractionated by column chromatography. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses in conjunction with literature data. The broth microdilution method was used to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity against bacteria, yeasts and dermatophytes. The antioxidant potentials of the extracts and their isolated compounds were evaluated using the DPPH radical scavenging method. Results Five known compounds: physcion (1), 1, 8 -dihydroxy- 3 -geranyloxy- 6 -methylanthraquinone (2), kenganthranol B (3), vismiaquinone (4), and <b>octacosanol</b> (5) were isolated from the leaves of P. aurantiacum while six compounds including friedelin (6), betulinic acid (7), 2, 2 ’, 5, 6 ’-tetrahydroxybenzophenone (8), allanxanthone A (9), 1, 3, 6 - trihydroxyxanthone (10) and isogarcinol (11) were isolated from H. lanceolatum. Compound 8 and 4 exhibited the highest antibacterial and antifungal activities with MIC ranges of 2 – 8 [*]μg/ml and 4 – 32 [*]μg/ml respectively. P. aurantiacum crude extract (Rsa 50 [*]=[*] 6. 359 [*]±[*] 0. 101) showed greater radical scavenging activity compared with H. lanceolatum extract (Rsa 50 [*]=[*] 30. 996 [*]±[*] 0. 879). Compound 11 showed the highest radical scavenging activity (RSa 50 [*]=[*] 1. 012 [*]±[*] 0. 247) among the isolated compounds, comparable to that of L-arscobic acid (RSa 50 [*]=[*] 0. 0809 [*]±[*] 0. 045). Conclusions The experimental findings show that the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts and isolated compounds from P. aurantiacum and H. lanceolatum stem bark possess significant antimicrobial and antioxidant activities justifying the use of these plants in traditional medicine, which may be developed as phytomedicines. </p...|$|E
