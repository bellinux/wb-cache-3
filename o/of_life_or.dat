5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, {{the remnants of the}} depression brought moderate rainfall to parts of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. High winds accompanied the rainfall and left about 50,000 residences without power. Several trees were downed and some structures sustained damage from fresh water flooding. Landslides occurred along major highways and significant structural damage was reported around Mazatlán. However, there was no loss <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>or</b> reports of injuries.|$|E

5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at the way <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>or</b> sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student stage of life), then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student stage <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>or</b> after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts that those who have married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless of which stage of life he is in, and whether he has completed that stage.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>or</b> as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E

5|$|On September23, Typhoon Yagi passed {{directly}} over the resort island of Chichijima which {{has a population of}} about 2,000. The cyclone brought winds up to 210km/h (130mph), making it the strongest typhoon in 20 years to hit the island. About 1,000 of the 1,270 homes were without power {{during the height of the}} storm. About 150 residents evacuated to local shelters during the storm to escape the high winds and heavy rains. At least one structure was destroyed and numerous others sustained damage. The storm reportedly produced torrential rains, but there are no known measurements. Several homes had their roofs blown off and windows broken. Street lamps were knocked down by the strong winds produced by Yagi. Ferry service for several ports was cancelled for 29 days following the typhoon. Fallen trees knocked down power lines and cut communications. Some homes were reported to have lost water pressure also. The storm passed close to Iwo Jima on September22, with the island being within the range of 95km/h (60mph) winds. No loss <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>or</b> injuries were related to Typhoon Yagi.|$|E
5|$|Ophelia devastated much of Ulithi {{during its}} passage, {{damaging}} or destroying most structures and killing two people. Agriculture across {{the area was}} decimated and geographic changes to coastlines were noted. In Ophelia's wake, dramatic societal changes in the Ulithian culture arose. Traditional values were abandoned {{in favor of more}} western ones, with younger individuals attaining a notable increase in power. The local King was disposed of shortly after the storm and a total change in authority took place. In addition to the severe impact in Ulithi, the typhoon was blamed for the deaths of five fishermen when their vessel collided with a coral reef. The name Ophelia was later retired, though unusually its removal was due to its meteorological significance due to its long track and prolonged time as a significant typhoon rather than for loss <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>or</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxants {{and these are}} enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{to be no more}} effective than placebo at improving pain, quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>or</b> function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} no threat to any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>or</b> structural damage was reported. Beaches in both states {{increased the number of}} lifeguards on duty since the threat of rip currents would remain high for several days. On June22, the Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil (National System of Civil Protection) in the Mexican state of Jalisco raised the alert level to stage two for coastal areas. People were urged to be cautious about venturing out into coastal waters as the storm produced rough seas near the coast. The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought unsettled weather to France's Clipperton Island. Since this island is unpopulated, the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E
5|$|Within the Australian {{region in}} the Southern Hemisphere between 90°E– 160°E, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis indicate that a system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Indonesian Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 90°E and 141°E, while Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 141°E and 160°E. Outside of these areas, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology names systems that develop into tropical cyclones. If a name is assigned to a tropical cyclone that causes loss <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>or</b> significant damage and disruption to {{the way of life}} of a community, then the name assigned to that storm is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting.|$|E
5|$|Within the Southern Pacific basin in the Southern Hemisphere between 160°E– 120°W, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis {{indicate that a}} system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) names systems that are located between the Equator and 25°S, while the New Zealand MetService names systems (in conjunction with the FMS) that develop {{to the south of}} 25°S. If {{a tropical}} cyclone causes loss <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>or</b> significant damage and disruption to the way of life of a community, then the name assigned to that cyclone is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting. The name of a tropical cyclone is determined by using Lists A— D in order, without regard to year before restarting with List A. List E contains names that will replace names on A-D when needed.|$|E
