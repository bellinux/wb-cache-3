5|$|In 1896, Savage sued his {{publisher}} for $12,000 in unpaid royalties.

In 1899, Abraham Lewis <b>of</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> sued Savage for $10,000 in damages, for stealing away the affections of his wife. Savage's own wife and a friend defended him in court, saying Lewis, an informal supplier of food to soldiers under Savage's command, was retaliating for being stopped from the lucrative but illegal act of selling liquor to the troops at Montauk Point.|$|E
