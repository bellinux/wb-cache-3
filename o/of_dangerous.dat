40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of emergent response <b>of</b> major <b>dangerous</b> chemical accident on the highway, the emergency response system <b>of</b> major <b>dangerous</b> chemical accident on highway based on the GIS is researched and developed. Due to the characteristic of the emergent response <b>of</b> major <b>dangerous</b> chemical accident on the highway, the system develops and designs four subsystems and six basic databases. By combing Gaussian model, GIS new technology and modern safety management method, the system realizes three major functions urgently needed by emergent response, which are quick function for dangerous substance and hazard installations, predictive function for disaster and accident consequence, accessibility for emergency response decision. The system would provide technical support for the emergent response <b>of</b> major <b>dangerous</b> chemical accident on the highway...|$|R

Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free <b>of</b> <b>dangerous</b> bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E

5|$|The text of a Book of the Dead {{was written}} in both black and red ink, {{regardless}} of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script.

The black ink used was based on carbon, and the red ink on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.|$|E
