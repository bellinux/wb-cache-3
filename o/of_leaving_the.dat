5|$|Black-shouldered kites form monogamous pairs, {{breeding}} between August and January. The birds {{engage in}} aerial courtship displays which involve high circling flight and ritualised feeding mid-air. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days. Chicks are fully fledged within {{five weeks of}} hatching and can hunt for mice within a week <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the home territory.|$|E

First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.|$|E

5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> wall surfaces blank.

5|$|In his ensuing adventures, Cyan grows {{close to}} the Free Collars, yet still longs for Kokoro. He becomes {{frustrated}} by Siam's continued advances on East Ikebukuro and his teammates' unwillingness to mount an offensive attack. Convinced that Siam must be destroyed, Cyan confronts her and learns she was once a Free Collar until her brother, Puriam, was chased onto a road by humans and killed by a bus. Cyan is able to defeat her, and, reminded of Puriam, Siam silently wishes him farewell. Soon after, Cyan learns that Kokoro had recovered but is moving away. Saddened by the thought <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> Free Collars, he meets Kokoro {{at the train station}} and gives him his torn collar as a memento. Kokoro promises to visit Cyan, and Cyan returns to his new friends.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E

5|$|Ted Kennedy was 30 {{years old}} when he first entered the Senate {{following}} a November 1962 special election to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother, John, who was now the President. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was later re-elected seven more times. The Chappaquiddick incident in 1969 resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> scene of an accident and later received a two-month suspended sentence. The incident and its aftermath hindered his chances of ever becoming President. His only attempt, in the 1980 election, resulted in a Democratic primary campaign loss to incumbent President Jimmy Carter, who later lost the general election to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria {{became a}} member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most {{recently}} from 2002 to 2003. Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. Polls carried out seven years after the country's accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from membership, with almost 40% of the population saying they would not bother to vote in the 2014 EU elections. Euro-Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism, although the Communist leadership also had aspirations <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987.|$|E

40|$|A {{ground-based}} X-band radar {{was directed}} almost horizontally {{into the top}} of a mature ash during 5 months.

(2) The backscatter decreased the first days after a shower. This decrease is attributed to depletion of internal water-storage tissues. (3) The backscatter increases {{towards the end of the}} season. This trend is related to a decreased transpiration rate and increased water content <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|During {{the many}} {{changes in the}} {{operational}} plans for Fall Gelb the idea <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> Fortress Holland alone, just as the Dutch hoped for, was at times considered. The first version of 19 October 1939 suggested {{the possibility of a}} full occupation if conditions were favourable. In the version of 29 October it was proposed to limit the transgression to a line south of Venlo. In the Holland-Weisung (Holland Directive) of 15 November it was decided to conquer the entire south, but in the north to advance no further than the Grebbe Line, and to occupy the Frisian Isles. Hermann Göring insisted on a full conquest as he needed the Dutch airfields against Britain; also he was afraid the Entente might reinforce Fortress Holland after a partial defeat and use the airfields to bomb German cities and troops. Another rationale for complete conquest was that as the fall of France itself could hardly be taken for granted, it was for political reasons seen as desirable to obtain a Dutch capitulation, because a defeat might well bring less hostile governments to power in Britain and France. A swift defeat would also free troops for other front sectors.|$|E
5|$|In January 1980, {{the members}} of TalkingHeads {{returned}} to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, Fear of Music, and decided {{to take time off}} to pursue personal interests. Byrne worked with Eno, the record's producer, on an experimental collaboration named My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Jerry Harrison produced an album for soul singer Nona Hendryx at the Sigma Sound Studios branch in New York City; the singer and the location were later used during the recording of Remain in Light on Harrison's advice. Husband and wife Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth discussed the possibility <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> band after the latter suggested that Byrne's level of control was excessive. Frantz was not open to the idea of ending TalkingHeads, and the two decided to take a long vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. During the trip, the couple became involved in Haitian Vodou religious ceremonies and practised with several types of native percussion instruments. While in Jamaica they socialised with the famous reggae rhythm section of Sly and Robbie.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E
