5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, {{real-time}} strategy games began outselling turn-based games. As they surged in popularity, major 4X developers fell into difficulties. Sid Meier's Firaxis Games released Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in 1999 to critical acclaim, {{but the game}} fell short of commercial expectations. Civilization III encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001. Despite the excitement over Master of Orion III, its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack <b>of</b> <b>player</b> control, poor interface, and weak AI. Game publishers eventually became risk-averse to financing the development of 4X games.|$|E

Steelers president Dan Rooney had initially considered wearing a throwback uniform for the game, but decided against it because the merged team wore the Eagles uniforms, and the Steelers didn't want to wear the Eagles' colors. Instead, the team had the south end zone painted in plain diagonal white lines, which were common in NFL endzones until the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} study of game theory - games - serves as {{mathematical}} models for real-life problems. In every game {{there are two}} or more players who aim to maximize their own profit by choosing their actions. A situation where no player can benefit from changing his own action alone has got particular importance {{in the study of}} games - it is called Nash equilibrium. Games with a finite number <b>of</b> <b>players</b> have certain advantages over those with an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>players.</b> For one, problems whose model is a game with a finite number <b>of</b> <b>players</b> are quite common. Moreover, one of the classical results of game theory is that (with certain additional assumptions) in every game with a finite number <b>of</b> <b>players</b> there exists a Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, when trying to describe the properties of a game with an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>players</b> {{we might be able to}} use calculus instead of going trough all possibilities (as is common for games with a finite number <b>of</b> <b>players),</b> which tends to be computationally demanding. However, if we want to use these advantages of games with an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>players,</b> it is important first to know whether there is any relationship between games with a finite and infinite number <b>of</b> <b>players</b> at all. The goal of this thesis is to define terms and to introduce tools which would allow [...] ...|$|R
