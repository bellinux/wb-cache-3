Billions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> stolen when employers pay less than minimum wage; refuse overtime pay; force workers to work off the clock; hold back final paychecks; misclassify employees as independent contractors; steal tips; and fail to pay workers at all.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a number}} of achievements, Russia is {{significantly}} behind the world leaders in medical technology and pharmaceutical production. The country produces only 20% of the drugs used domestically, while 80% is imported. President Medvedev has said he is confident that Russia can overcome the problem, and {{has called for a}} restoration of Russia's pharmaceutical industry, through the principles of mixed financing, both government and private. He has stressed the need for serious investment, saying that hundreds millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> needed, as well as investment into personnel.|$|E

25|$|Shatner has {{appeared}} in advertisements for many companies and products. In the early 1980s he appeared in print and television ads endorsing the Commodore VIC-20 home computer. Since the late 1990s he has done a series of commercials for the travel web site priceline.com, in which Shatner plays a pompous, fictionalized version of himself. Although he received stock options for the commercials, Shatner says that reports {{that they are now}} worth hundreds of millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> exaggerated. Shatner was also the CEO of the Toronto, Ontario-based C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures, a special effects studio that operated from 1994 to 2010.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{lethality}} and virulence of HPAI A(H5N1), its endemic presence, its increasingly large host reservoir, and its significant ongoing mutations, the H5N1 virus has recently been regarded to be the world's largest current pandemic threat, and billions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> being spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic. At least 12 companies and 17 governments are developing prepandemic influenza vaccines in 28 different clinical trials that, if successful, could turn a deadly pandemic infection into a nondeadly one. Full-scale production of a vaccine that could prevent any illness at all from the strain would require at least {{three months after the}} virus's emergence to begin, but it is hoped that vaccine production could increase until one billion doses were produced by one year after the initial identification of the virus.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} issues under the Proposition 218 election requirement for property-related fees and charges is whether stormwater drainage fees and charges are exempt from the election requirement as either a fee for “water” or “sewer” service. [...] Many billions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> literally at stake in the resolution of this legal issue. [...] In order to comply with very expensive California and federal clean water environmental mandates, local agencies must reduce or eliminate stormwater pollutants, and that requires significant funding. [...] However, politicians from the state and federal governments provide little funding to local agencies to comply with their costly clean water mandates.|$|E

50|$|Following Kathy Hochul's {{departure}} as County Clerk, a back log of mail {{was discovered}} by newly elected County Clerk, Chris Jacobs. Millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>were</b> stored in boxes in unopened envelopes. As County Clerk, Kathy Hochul {{was in the process}} of implementing a new system, when she left to run in the special election and then to assume office. Thousands <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>were</b> spent in overtime to deposit checks and file unopened documents. However none of the un-cashed checks dated to Hochul's term as clerk.|$|R

2500|$|Towards {{his later}} life, {{particularly}} following {{the global financial}} crisis of 2007-08, Buffett became an increasingly vocal critic of active management, i.e., mutual funds and hedge funds. Buffett is skeptical that active management and stock-picking can outperform {{the market in the}} long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that [...] "when trillions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients." [...] In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple S 500 index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees. By 2017, the index fund was outperforming every hedge fund that had made the bet against Buffett by a significant margin.|$|E

60|$|The War Department {{building}} {{is an old}} structure, not fireproof, and entirely inadequate in dimensions to our present wants. Many thousands <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> now paid annually for rent of private buildings to accommodate the various bureaus of the Department. I recommend an appropriation for a new War Department building, suited to the present and growing wants of the nation.|$|E

50|$|The base {{elevation}} <b>of</b> <b>Dollar</b> Mountain <b>is</b> 6010 ft {{above sea}} level; its vertical drop is 628 ft, less than one-fifth of Baldy's 3400 ft. A new day lodge {{at the base}} <b>of</b> <b>Dollar</b> <b>was</b> built and completed {{in the fall of}} 2004 and is comparable in spaciousness and style (massive timber, river rock, & glass) to the day lodges at Bald Mountain. It was named for Carol Holding, wife of resort owner Earl Holding.|$|R

60|$|Unlike English and American towns, Paris has {{scarcely}} any suburbs. Those parts {{which are}} called its Faubourgs are, in truth, integral {{parts of the}} city; and, {{with the exception of}} a few clusters of winehouses and guinguettes, which have collected near its gates to escape the city duties, the continuity of houses ceases suddenly with the barrières, and, at the distance of half a mile from the latter, one is as effectually in the country, so far as the eye is concerned, as if a hundred leagues in the provinces. The unfenced meadows, vineyards, lucerne, oats, wheat, and vegetables, in many places, literally reach the walls. These walls are not intended for defence, but are merely a financial enceinte, created for offensive operations against the pockets of the inhabitants. Every town in France that has two thousand inhabitants is entitled to set up an octroi on its articles of consumption, and something like four millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> taken annually at the gates of Paris, in duties on this internal trade. It is merely the old expedient to tax the poor, by laying impositions on food and necessaries.|$|E
60|$|The {{middle of}} April had come, and Fisker {{was still in}} London. When {{millions}} <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> at stake,--belonging perhaps to widows and orphans, as Fisker remarked,--a man was forced to set his own convenience on one side. But this devotion was not left without reward, for Mr Fisker had 'a good time' in London. He also was made free of the Beargarden, as an honorary member, and he also {{spent a good deal}} of money. But there is this comfort in great affairs, that whatever you spend on yourself can be no more than a trifle. Champagne and ginger-beer are all the same when you stand to win or lose thousands,--with this only difference, that champagne may have deteriorating results which the more innocent beverage will not produce. The feeling that the greatness of these operations relieved them from the necessity of looking to small expenses operated in the champagne direction, both on Fisker and Montague, and the result was deleterious. The Beargarden, no doubt, was a more lively place than Carbury Manor, but Montague found that he could not wake up on these London mornings with thoughts as satisfactory as those which attended his pillow at the old Manor House.|$|E
60|$|Speaking of New York as a traveler, I {{have two}} faults to find with it. In the first place, {{there is nothing}} to see; and, in the second place, there is no mode of getting about to see anything. Nevertheless, New York is a most {{interesting}} city. It is the third biggest city in the known world, for those Chinese congregations of unwinged ants are not cities in the known world. In no other city is there a population so mixed and cosmopolitan in their modes of life. And yet in no other city that I have seen are there such strong and ever visible characteristics of the social and political bearings of the nation to which it belongs. New York appears to me as infinitely more American than Boston, Chicago, or Washington. It has no peculiar attribute of its own, as have those three cities--Boston in its literature and accomplished intelligence, Chicago in its internal trade, and Washington in its Congressional and State politics. New York has its literary aspirations, its commercial grandeur, and, Heaven knows, it has its politics also. But these do not strike the visitor as being specially characteristic of the city. That it is pre-eminently American is its glory or its disgrace, as men of different ways of thinking may decide upon it. Free institutions, general education, and the ascendency <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> the words written on every paving-stone along Fifth Avenue, down Broadway, and up Wall Street. Every man can vote, and values the privilege. Every man can read, and uses the privilege. Every man worships the dollar, and is down before his shrine from morning to night.|$|E

50|$|Briggs is—or was—serious about art; he deplores popular escapism as {{an abuse}} of it. He knows exactly how many tens <b>of</b> {{millions}} <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>were</b> raked in by Amanda, a vapid musical love story, three winters previously—during the Ardennes Offensive.|$|R
50|$|Bryant B.
