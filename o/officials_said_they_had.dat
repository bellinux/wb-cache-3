5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E

25|$|However, {{whatever}} goodwill that he'd {{managed to}} restore quickly evaporated a season later; quarterback Nic Costa said that despite {{a very talented}} roster, many players had lost their love for the game due to Mackovic's brusque manner. Five games into the 2003 season, Mackovic was fired and replaced on an interim basis by defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz. School <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to act because it was obvious the Wildcats would not win with Mackovic at the helm.|$|E

25|$|Rioting in Hough largely ended around midnight. By dawn on July 21, a {{total of}} 24 people had been injured in the Hough Riots. Police made a few more arrests during the night, {{primarily}} for looting, bringing {{the total number of}} arrestees to 150. Cleveland fire <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> responded to between 45 and 50 blazes during the two nights of rioting, which spread into the adjacent Glenville neighborhood, and {{a total of}} 10 buildings had been lost.|$|E
25|$|Sebastopol meadowfoam {{habitat is}} {{threatened}} {{by a number of}} human activities, particularly urbanization spreading out from nearby cities Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park and Cotati. In spring 2005, a controversy erupted when the plant was reported at the site of a proposed commercial/residential development project within the boundary of the City of Sebastopol known as Laguna Vista. State wildlife officials concluded that the meadowfoam had been deliberately transplanted from elsewhere, presumably to block the development project, and ordered the plants to be dug up. Opponents of the project disagreed and have presented testimony from experts who argue that the state used incomplete analysis to arrive at its finding. In spring 2006, the plants reappeared, although <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> likely sprouted from seeds scattered the previous year. Sebastopol's city council has yet to make a final decision regarding the Laguna Vista project.|$|E
25|$|Officials in {{neighbouring}} countries accused Indonesian {{officials of}} doing {{nothing to stop}} the fires, though forestry ministry <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> firefighters working to douse the blazes on state-controlled land. However, they conceded, most of the fires were on private land. Indonesia planned to deploy its military to aid fire fighting effort. To recruit more people to man the fire line, the government offered two days off for civil servants who volunteered for fire duty. But the country lacked equipment for fighting forest fires, having aeroplanes that were too small to carry enough water to douse the fires. In a bid to obtain bigger aircraft, the government leased two Beriev Be-200 aircraft from Russia, which are capable of skimming over water and taking on loads for sustained firefighting efforts. The planes, which will be flown by Russians and maintained by Russian technicians, were due to begin operations on 1 November.|$|E

25|$|On December 5, 2012, Toronto {{officials}} charged Uber with 25 municipal licensing infractions, including {{operation of}} an unlicensed taxi brokerage and unlicensed limousine service. Municipal <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> advised {{the company to}} comply with local regulations and that rival taxi dispatch apps had obtained licenses. Despite support from some quarters including mayor John Tory Toronto Police Service launched a crackdown on Uber drivers, and a court hearing is deciding if an injunction to prohibit the service is warranted. In July 2015, a $400M class-action lawsuit was filed against UberX and UberXL in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on behalf of Ontario taxi and limo drivers, brokers, and owners. The statement of claim alleged that UberX and UberXL violated section 39.1 of the province's Highway Traffic Act by having unlicensed drivers picking up passengers and transporting them for compensation. In March 2016, Sukhvir Tehethi, a local taxi driver, filed an injunction against Uber. Toronto's city council amended a bylaw in October 2015 and, according to Tehethi's lawyer, Uber drivers are in violation of it. Tehethi decided to take action saying {{that it could be}} months, or even years, if he waits for City Hall to act. A Toronto city councillor warned that passengers using UberX may be fined up to $20,000. On March 3, 2016, after hours of heated debate, the City Council of Toronto passed a bylaw allowing UberX to operate legally in the city with conditions, while also cutting regulations for taxis.|$|E

[...] "The invitation was an inducement {{to get them back}} into the international fold," [...] said a senior US official, speaking anonymously because of the sensitive issues. [...] "But the Pakistanis couldn't get their own act together" [...] in time for the summit. [...] "The main issue, it seems, is money." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2013, United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) {{rated the}} Whitney Young Memorial Bridge both [...] "fracture critical" [...] and [...] "structurally deficient".

[...] The [...] "structurally deficient" [...] rating meant {{that at least one}} major component of the bridge was in [...] "poor" [...] condition.

The BBC reported that the Libyan authorities had expected the freed medics to serve their life terms in Bulgarian jails, Prime Minister Baghdadi Mahmudi said, adding that the deal to free the medics had involved money put up by the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Qatar, while France had promised to provide equipment for the Benghazi hospital, where the infections had taken place [...] and training for Libyan medical staff over five years.|$|E
2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} said the British informed them Friday {{that they would be}} withdrawing the monitoring team but did not provide a date. U.S. {{officials said}} the Israelis and the Palestinians were notified as the three British guards on duty at the time departed. Stuart Tuttle, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said that [...] "The withdrawal decision was made on the ground and not in coordination with the Israelis". Senior U.S. <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no choice but to abandon the facility, even though they realized it might undermine the Palestinian Authority, and that they did not make public their concerns because they believed publicity would have made the U.S. and British personnel the targets of attacks. A senior administration official said: [...] "That is the price we pay. Our first responsibility is the safety of American and British monitors". State Department spokesman J. Adam Ereli denied any coordination with Israel and said: [...] "Such accusations are baseless and ignore the facts, quite frankly".|$|E

2500|$|The Associated Press, however, {{took issue}} with Ellerbe's assessment. The news agency {{reported}} that 40 paramedics left the department during Ellerbe's tenure, but just two had been hired in the same period. It also reported that [...] "the new hires and equipment still leave the District of Columbia well short of the staffing levels in similar-sized cities". Whereas most similarly-situated EMS departments deployed more than 70 paramedics per shift, DCFEMS had just 35—and 21 of those were not riding ambulances (with their life-saving equipment) but riding on fire engines. DCFEMS <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no plan {{to increase the number}} of paramedics per shift. The firefighters' union said the short staffing meant that roughly five of the 14 advanced life support ambulances available each day were downgraded to basic life support because they were staffed only with EMTs. They also said incidents of mandatory overtime were increasing because there were so few paramedics.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{government}} crackdown, Polanco-Rodriguez escaped arrest in New York by fleeing to the Dominican Republic with a fake passport. However, {{he was unable}} to stay out of trouble. He was shot in the leg during a gunfight over a woman in a Santiago nightclub. United States officials insisted that the Dominican government either extradite or imprison him. He was arrested in 1988 and sent to La Victoria prison without a trial. After fighting with other prisoners, Polanco-Rodriguez was transferred to the Monte Plata jail in 1990, where he bribed guards to allow him certain luxuries. But once again Polanco-Rodriguez became involved in an intense struggle with inmates when he stopped the attempted rape of a female prisoner. Fellow prisoners attempted to burn him alive by setting his cell cot on fire. Finally, in 1992, prison authorities released him. He is married to a woman named Johani Candelario, daughter of Renato Candelario, and is the father of five children. In an interview with The New York Times in 1996, Polanco-Rodriguez said he had retired from his life of crime, and DEA and Dominican drug <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no evidence to the contrary.|$|R
