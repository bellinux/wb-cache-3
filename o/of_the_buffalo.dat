5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, media {{coverage}} focused on the achievements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Bulls. Buffalo had been one of the least-successful programs in college football from their transition to Division I-A in 1999 to 2006, during which they had a cumulative record of 12–79. In 2008, the Bulls had their first winning season since 1996, won five games in a row for the first time since 1986, beat a ranked team for the first time in program history with their upset victory over Ball State in the MAC Championship Game, and would be making the first bowl appearance in school history. The turnaround <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Buffalo</b> program brought acclaim to Bulls head coach Turner Gill, who had taken over the team in 2007.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey to}} {{determine}} <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis and certain other infectious diseases {{was conducted on}} 42 free-ranging African buffaloes, (Syncerus caffer) from May to June 1997 in the Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. Using the gamma interferon test, exposure to M. bovis was detected in 21. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> One dead buffalo and an emaciated warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) that was euthanased, were necropsied; both had miliary granulomas from which M. bovis was isolated. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buffaloes</b> sampled in Sector A <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park, which has no cattle interface, tested positive for bovine tuberculosis (BTB) exposure. The prevalence and distribution of BTB {{does not appear to}} have changed significantly since the 1960 s, but this may be due to fluxes in <b>the</b> <b>buffalo</b> population. Serological testing for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) demonstrated positive exposure of 57. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buffaloes</b> sampled, with types A, O and SAT 1 - 3, which is the first known report of FMD antibodies to A and O types in free ranging African buffaloes. Foot-and-mouth disease virus types SAT 1 and SAT 3 were isolated from buffalo probang samples. Two percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buffaloes</b> had been exposed to brucellosis. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buffaloes</b> tested had antibodies to rinderpest, leptospirosis or Q fever. </span...|$|R

Having experienced excellent health for most of his life, Matthews died of pneumonia at the age of 111 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Buffalo</b> All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting but sent letters to Hay asking {{to be included in}} the league. Team representatives changed the league's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers, installing Jim Thorpe as president. Under the new league structure, teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed, so there were no minimum or maximum number of games needed to be played. Also, representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy.|$|E

5|$|East of NY198, {{the road}} becomes more open {{as it passes}} through neighborhoods with a more {{suburban}} residential feel to them. Along this stretch, NY33 connects to several streets, including Bailey Avenue (U.S. Route62 or US62) and Harlem Road (NY240). Past Harlem Road, the expressway makes a slight curve to the south as it prepares to meet a toll-free section of the New York State Thruway (I-90) at a cloverleaf interchange. Beyond I-90, the expressway veers to the south again, traversing an S-curve before connecting to Union Road (NY277) {{by way of a}} partial interchange.

5|$|Until {{the middle}} {{or the end}} of the 1700s, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Creek {{watershed}} was on the frontier. During this time, there were many forts, such as Fort Titzell in the watershed. In 1769, the northern side of Buffalo Creek was surveyed. In the same year, the area {{in the vicinity of the}} creek was opened to settlers. John Sierer was among the first to arrive, settling on the creek in 1769. The prominent Revolutionary War veteran Colonel John Kelly built an estate on the northern bank of Buffalo Creek. In 1780, there was an Indian attack near the mouth of the creek.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} past the city line, NY5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on {{a span of}} the elevated road known as the Father Baker Bridge.

Here, the frontage roads end while NY5 turns to the northeast, crossing the Buffalo River and entering downtown. On the north bank, the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes KeyBank Center, located directly to the east, and Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, situated to the west, and meets I-190 at exit7. Past the interchange, the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation, becoming an at-grade roadway once more at Church Street {{in the shadow of}} Buffalo City Hall. NY384 begins here, following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown, while NY5 turns east onto Church.|$|E
