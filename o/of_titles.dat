5000|$|A chain <b>of</b> <b>title</b> is the {{sequence}} of historical transfers <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to a property. The [...] "chain" [...] runs from the present owner {{back to the original}} owner of the property. In situations where documentation of ownership is important, it is often necessary to reconstruct the chain <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> To facilitate this, a record <b>of</b> <b>title</b> documents may be maintained by a registry office or civil law notary.|$|R
50|$|An {{abstract}} <b>of</b> <b>title</b> {{should be}} distinguished from an opinion <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> While an abstract states {{that all of the}} public record documents concerning the property in question are contained therein, an opinion states the professional judgment of the person giving the opinion as to the vesting <b>of</b> the <b>title</b> and other matters concerning the chain <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> Many jurisdictions define the giving of an opinion <b>of</b> <b>title</b> as the practice of law, thus making it unlawful for a non-attorney to provide such an opinion.|$|R

5000|$|Real {{estate is}} one field where the chain <b>of</b> <b>title</b> has {{considerable}} significance. Various registration systems, {{such as the}} Torrens title system, {{have been developed to}} track the ownership of individual pieces of real property. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue title insurance based upon the chain <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records. In other cases, the chain <b>of</b> <b>title</b> is established by an abstract <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney. In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish chain <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> despite the fact that clear chain <b>of</b> <b>title</b> can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed. Widespread lack of clarity in chain <b>of</b> <b>title</b> results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments. [...] US states have objected and even sued over this practice.|$|R

5|$|According to Tibetologist John Powers, Tibetan sources counter this {{narrative}} <b>of</b> <b>titles</b> {{granted by the}} Chinese to Tibetans with various titles which the Tibetans gave to the Chinese emperors and their officials. Tribute missions from Tibetan monasteries to the Chinese court brought back not only titles, but large, commercially valuable gifts which could subsequently be sold. The Ming emperors sent invitations to ruling lamas, but the lamas sent subordinates rather than coming themselves, and no Tibetan ruler ever explicitly accepted the role of being a vassal of the Ming.|$|E

5|$|Saint-Étienne and Marseille {{have the}} most titles in French {{football}} having won ten each. The majority of Saint-Étienne's titles came during the 1960s and 1970s when the club was led by managers Jean Snella, Albert Batteux, and Robert Herbin. Marseille has nine professional league titles and one amateur title which they won in the 1928–29 season. The club initially equaled Saint-Étienne's number <b>of</b> <b>titles</b> won during the 1992–93 season, but the title was stripped after it was discovered by the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) that the club's president Bernard Tapie had bribed the opposition's players. Tapie was later found guilty of bribery and sentenced {{to two years in}} prison. In the 2009–10 season, Marseille equaled Saint-Étienne's number <b>of</b> <b>titles,</b> amateur or professional. Currently, Nantes are third with eight titles and they are followed by AS Monaco and Lyon each with seven.|$|E
5|$|Square {{was best}} known for its {{role-playing}} video game franchises, which include the Final Fantasy series.

On April 1, 2003, Square merged with video game publisher Enix to form Square Enix. This list includes retail games developed or published by Square during its existence.|$|E
5|$|The best {{interests}} of society require that causes of action should not be deferred an unreasonable time. This remark is peculiarly applicable to land titles.

5|$|The {{reign of}} Nyuserre Ini {{witnessed}} the unabated {{growth of the}} priesthood and state bureaucracy, a phenomenon which had started in the early Fifth Dynasty in particular under Neferirkare Kakai.
