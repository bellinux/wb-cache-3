5|$|At {{the urging}} of friends in the anti-slavery movement, Coffin moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1847 to operate a {{warehouse}} that sold only free-labor goods.

When slavery was abolished after the American Civil War, Coffin traveled around the Midwest and <b>overseas</b> <b>to</b> France and Great Britain, where he was instrumental in forming aid societies that provided food, clothing, funds, and education to former slaves. Coffin retired from public life in the 1870s and wrote an autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, published in 1876, a year before his death.|$|E
