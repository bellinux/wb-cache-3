5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> of the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend remembered that the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, {{but as soon as}} the lights came on he would rush home to see if he could duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
5|$|In May 1992, {{intensive}} shelling and infantry {{attacks on}} Bosniak {{areas in the}} municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> of the prison camps that the Serb authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, about {{three weeks after the}} Serbs took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, Serb forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, the Serbs continued to round up Bosniaks and Croats from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and send them to the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed.|$|E

25|$|While the Karma, Drugpa and Jonangpa Kagyu orders, (beside the Gelug {{group from}} Drepung monastery) had all {{independently}} sought to claim Künga Migyur as a reincarnation of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> {{of their own}} lamas who'd also died in 1616, young Künga Migyur's parents reportedly resisted their demands.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th and 21st centuries, the {{saxophone}} found increased popularity in symphony orchestras. In <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> size, the instrument {{has also been}} found as a useful accompaniment to genres such as opera and choral music. Many musical theatre scores include parts for a saxophone, sometimes doubling another woodwind or brass instrument. In this way, {{the saxophone}} serves as a middle point between other woodwinds and the brass section, helping to blend them.|$|E

25|$|In the Second World War Avoceta {{continued}} Yeoward Brothers' {{service to}} neutral Portugal, Spain and the Canary Islands. She made nine trips to Las Palmas, six of which {{also included a}} call at Tenerife. Others were to <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> mainland port: one to Almeria, two to Valencia and 11 to Lisbon. Her final visit to the Canaries was in March 1941; thereafter she served only Lisbon and Gibraltar.|$|E
25|$|Alternations between plain velars and palatals {{are common}} {{in a number of}} roots across {{different}} satem languages, but the same root appears with a palatal in some languages but a plain velar in others (most commonly Baltic or Slavic, occasionally Armenian but rarely or never the Indo-Iranian languages). That is consistent with the analogical generalisation of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> consonant in an originally-alternating paradigm but difficult to explain otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Most other {{orders were}} either smaller or less well {{organized}} than the Khatmiyyah. Moreover, {{unlike many other}} African Muslims, Sudanese Muslims did not all seem to {{feel the need to}} identify with <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> tariqa, even if the affiliation were nominal. Many Sudanese Muslims preferred more political movements that sought to change Islamic society and governance to conform to their own visions of the true nature of Islam.|$|E

25|$|Second, {{neighboring}} rebellions by Basques and Galicians failed, aborted by Asturian kings. The rebellions, in turn, {{took advantage}} of the internal rebellions of the central and Eastern part of Asturias, and, on occasions, provided help to <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> contender of the Asturian aristocracy: refuge to Alphonse II in lands of Alava, after his flight; the support to Nepociano's rebellion in some Asturian areas or the adherence of Galicians to the cause of Ramiro I.|$|E
25|$|An {{increased}} {{effort to}} combat piracy with naval forces, effectively stamped out piracy. This combination {{of laws and}} naval efforts was responsible for thousands of deaths of pirates and alleged pirates. In a time when royal mercy and pardons in England routinely commuted death penalties to lesser sentences, especially <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> form of bound labor (after the Transportation Act of 1718), pirates rarely had their sentences lessened and instead were hanged in huge numbers and high percentages.|$|E

25|$|Modern Metropolitan France lies {{to a large}} extent, within clear {{limits of}} {{physical}} geography. Roughly half of its margin lies on sea coasts. In the south-west, its border lies among the peaks of the Pyrenees mountain range. Similarly, in the south-east it lies in part of the Alps. In the East it follows <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> of the Jura ranges until it reaches the River Rhine, which it follows downstream. The remaining section, in the north-east, between the Rhine and the North Sea, is provided with the least clear natural definition.|$|E
25|$|The {{commitment}} made selecting <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> ontology {{can produce}} a sharply different view of the task at hand. Consider the difference that arises in selecting the lumped element view of a circuit rather than the electrodynamic view of the same device. As a second example, medical diagnosis viewed in terms of rules (e.g., MYCIN) looks substantially different from the same task viewed in terms of frames (e.g., INTERNIST). Where MYCIN sees the medical world as made up of empirical associations connecting symptom to disease, INTERNIST sees a set of prototypes, in particular prototypical diseases, to be matched against the case at hand.|$|E
25|$|It is by {{no means}} simple to sort out fact and fiction within this story. The picture is further {{complicated}} by the fact that other authors (both in print and on the web) have chosen to join Borges in his game and write about <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> fictional aspect of this story either as if it were non-fiction or in a manner that could potentially confuse the unwary reader. Two online examples are the Italian-language website La Biblioteca di Uqbar, which treats Tlön itself as duly fictional, but writes as if the fictional Silas Haslam's entirely imaginary History of the Land Called Uqbar was a real work.|$|E
