40|$|The {{calculation}} of the <b>spreading</b> <b>width</b> of a compound nuclear reaction caused by a symmetry breaking $K$-body force acting in an $A$-body system ($K << A$, usually $K= 2 $) involves {{the determination of the}} local average square matrix element in $A$-body space.

40|$|The escape widths {{for direct}} proton decay from {{isobaric}} analog states in Sb and 1 nuclei {{have been obtained}} by combining calculated single-particle widths with experimental spectroscopic information for neutron pickup reactions on the respective Sn and Te target nuclei. They display a pronounced odd-A/even-A staggering effect with very small widths for the even-A isotopes due to the lower proton decay energies. Only data for odd-A nuclei are available, and there is good agreement. Combining the calculated escape widths with the known experimental total widths yields values for the <b>spreading</b> <b>widths.</b> As expected, and in agreement with theoretical predictions, the <b>spreading</b> <b>widths</b> are essentially constant and dependent only weakly on neutron excess. interestingly, the <b>spreading</b> <b>widths</b> are independent of whether statistical isospin-violating neutron decay is energetically possible or not, {{as is the case}} for the isobaric analog states of the light Sn isotopes with A < 116. The branching ratios for the isospin-forbidden neutron decays from the isobaric analog states average about 95 % for the heavier even-A Sb isotopes, and about 60 % for the odd-A isotopes. Gamma-ray deexcitation and direct and statistical proton decay compete in the decays of the IAS of the light Sn isotopes, and a branching ratio of about 90 % for gamma-ray deexcitation is expected for the IAS in 112 Sb...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{models of}} the decay out of superdeformed (SD) bands can broadly {{be divided into two}} categories. One {{approach}} is based on the similarity between the tunneling process involved in the decay and that involved in the fusion of heavy ions, and it builds on the formalism of nuclear reaction theory. The other arises from an analogy between the superdeformed decay and transport between coupled quantum dots. These models suggest conflicting values for the <b>spreading</b> <b>width</b> of the decaying superdeformed states. In this paper, the decay of superdeformed bands in the five even-even nuclei in which the SD excitation energies have been determined experimentally is considered in the framework of both approaches, and the significance of the difference in the resulting <b>spreading</b> <b>widths</b> is considered.

40|$|A global {{study of}} the {{electric}} dipole strength in and below the isovector giant dipole resonance (GDR) is presented for mass numbers A> 80. It relies on the recently established remarkably good match between data for the nuclear photo effect to novel photon scattering data covering the region below the neutron emission threshold {{as well as by}} average resonance neutron capture (ARC). From the wide energy coverage of these data the correlation of the GDR <b>spreading</b> <b>width</b> with energy can be studied with remarkable accuracy. A clear sensitivity to details of the nuclear shape, i. e. the beta- and gamma-deformations, is demonstrated. Based hereon a new parameterization of the energy dependence of the nuclear electric-dipole strength is proposed which - with only two new parameters - allows to describe the dipole strength in all heavy nuclei with A> 80. Although it differs significantly from previous parameterizations it holds for spherical, transitional, triaxial and well deformed nuclei.

40|$|Returns {{computed}} from closing prices differ from true returns due to bid-ask bounce {{and due to}} non-trading, which arises endogenously when transaction costs exceed the po-tential gains to trade. If each security trades every period, then those with relatively wide bid-ask spreads will have more ”bid-ask bounce ” in their observed return series, leading to upward bias in both average returns and beta estimates. Since {{the magnitude of the}} bias depends on <b>spread</b> <b>widths,</b> these microstructure effects can lead to spurious findings of positive relations between average returns and both betas and illiquidity measures. Allowing for endogenous no-trade decisions, the effect of bid-ask spreads is more com-plex. Wider spreads lead to greater bid-ask bounce when trades occur, but also discourage trading, ceteris paribus. More non-trading days implies more cases where the bid-ask mid-point is reported in lieu of a trade price, which reduces the amount of bid-ask bounce in the observed time series of returns. In this case the relation beween <b>spread</b> <b>widths</b> and biases in mean returns and beta estimates can be reversed. In addition to causing bias in beta estimates, bid-ask bounce increases the noise in bet...|$|R

40|$|A global {{analysis}} of the experimental <b>spreading</b> <b>widths</b> [Gamma][downwards arrow] of 65 isobaric analog states (IAS) in the range A = 110 to 238 has been performed assuming isospin mixing via the Coulomb force with T = T 0 - 1 doorway states mediated by coupling to the (T 0 - 1) -component of the giant isovector monopole resonance (IVM). Excellent agreement has been achieved over the entire range, thus establishing general smooth trends for the parameters describing the resonance. The excitation energy of the resonance, E(IVM) [approximate]V 0 /A 1 / 3 -(T 0 + 1) V 1 /A was found to reproduce the IAS data with V 0 in the range 155 to 170 MeV and V 1 [approximate] 55 MeV. These values are taken from recent theoretical estimates of Auerbach and the extreme hydrodynamical estimate of Bohr, Damgaard and Mottelson. The charge-dependent matrix elements were found factors of two to three stronger than hydrodynamic or microscopic estimates, but in almost perfect agreement with an expression based on sum rules derived by Lane and Mekjian. A strength-function approach developed by MacDonald and Birse for the damping widths of isovector monopole resonances was successfully employed. However, it became necessary to introduce an explicit dependence on nuclear deformation to describe a splitting of the IVM strength due to coupling to the [beta]-vibration component of the isovector quadrupole resonance (IVQ). The postulated [beta]-dependence describes the strong increase with neutron excess of the <b>spreading</b> <b>widths</b> for several rare-earth nuclei, and an essentially one-parameter fit to all experimental <b>spreading</b> <b>widths</b> gives [chi] 2 /[finite part integral] [approximate] 1. 2.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{formulate}} the reaction theory of parity violation in compound nuclear states using Feshbach's projection operator formalism. We derive in this framework {{a complete set}} of terms that contribute to the longitudinal asymmetry measured in experiments with polarized epithermal neutrons. We also discuss the parity violating <b>spreading</b> <b>width</b> resulting from this formalism. We then use the above formalism to derive expressions which hold in the case when the doorway state approximation is introduced. In applying the theory we limit ourselves in this work to the case when the parity violating potential and the strong interaction are one-body. In this approximation, using as the doorway the giant spin-dipole resonance and employing well known optical potentials and a time-reversal even, parity odd one-body interaction we calculate or estimate the terms we derived. In our calculations we explicitly orthogonalize the continuum and bound wave functions. We find the effects of orthogonalization to be very important. Our conclusion is that the present one-body theory cannot explain the average longitudinal asymmetry found in the recent polarized neutron experiments. We also confirm the discrepancy, first pointed out by Auerbach and Bowman, that emerges, between the calculated average asymmetry and the parity violating <b>spreading</b> <b>width,</b> when distant doorways are used in the theory.
