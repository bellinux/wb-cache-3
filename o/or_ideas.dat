5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much {{of what has been}} documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends <b>or</b> <b>ideas</b> on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{it being}} {{recently}} invented, {{there is no}} scholarly consensus over what a religion is. Today, religion is broadly conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines, and sacred places even though the ancient and medieval cultures that wrote holy scriptures (e.g. Bible, Quran, etc.) did not have such conceptions <b>or</b> <b>ideas</b> in their languages, cultures, or histories.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholic inquisitor Nicholas Eymerich {{condemned}} 100 theories <b>or</b> <b>ideas</b> of Llull as {{errors in}} 1376. Pope Gregory XI also formally condemned 20 {{of his books}} in 1376 and the condemnation was renewed by Pope Paul IV, although Pope Martin V reversed the condemnation of Pope Gregory XI in 1416. Despite these condemnations, Llull himself remained in good standing with the Church.|$|E
25|$|Haiku are a short, 3-line verse form, {{which have}} {{achieved}} significant global popularity, and the haiku form has been adapted from Japanese into other languages. Typical of the haiku form is the metrical pattern of 3 lines with a distribution of 5, 7, and 5 on (also known as morae) within those lines. Other features include {{the juxtaposition of}} two images <b>or</b> <b>ideas</b> with a kireji ("cutting word") between them, and a kigo, or seasonal reference, usually drawn from a saijiki, or traditional list of such words.|$|E
25|$|The {{period when}} the two men lived in Naples would later become controversial. Wilde claimed that Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds <b>or</b> <b>ideas.</b> When Douglas {{eventually}} did gain funds from his late father's estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he did give him occasional handouts. When Wilde died in 1900, he was still bankrupt. Douglas served as chief mourner, although there reportedly was an altercation at the grave between him and Robbie Ross. This struggle would preview the later litigations between the two former lovers of Wilde.|$|E

In addition to the title of the invention <b>or</b> <b>idea</b> and the name of the developer, the technical approach and the need which the invention <b>or</b> <b>idea</b> addresses are often included. Decision makers often look to operational needs first, though including the cost and projected schedule are also often required elements.|$|R
25|$|The {{necessity}} and inerrancy were well-established ideas, garnering little criticism, though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment. The most contentious {{idea at the}} time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation. Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how the church as a body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, <b>or</b> <b>ideas</b> that were old enough, had a special status in giving understanding of the text.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} titles {{given to}} each chapter are mostly an initial {{two or three}} incipits. In some cases a title may indicate a central theme of a chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard a title as a description or generalization {{of the content of}} a chapter. Chapters in the Analects are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in a way as to carry a continuous stream of thoughts <b>or</b> <b>ideas.</b> The themes of adjacent chapters are completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.|$|E
25|$|Darden {{would use}} a number of terms that he himself devised to {{describe}} how a quote, image, sketch, et cetera might influence a project. He would use the term pre-texts to describe passages that in-form the initial portion of the design process, but simultaneously cloaks and conceals the real intention. Con-texts are the writings by Darden or the inspirational elements that condition the design {{and give it a}} sense of believability. Sub-text was the underlining story behind the project—in a sense, Darden's own personal life found in the project (e.g. Darden's letter to The Southern Quarterly on how he related Oxygen House with his leukemia). Finally, there are archi-texts, which are writings, thoughts, <b>or</b> <b>ideas</b> by Darden himself that color the project and give it sustenance.|$|E

25|$|Sorensen {{was one of}} the {{consultants}} who brought American know-how to the USSR during this era, before the Cold War made such exchanges unthinkable. As the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both sides, the Soviets and the Americans, chose to ignore or deny the contribution that American ideas and expertise had made: the Soviets because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to a rival, and the Americans because they did not wish to acknowledge their part in creating a powerful communist rival. Anti-communism had always enjoyed widespread popularity in America, and anti-capitalism in Russia, but after World War II, they precluded any admission by either side that technologies <b>or</b> <b>ideas</b> might be either freely shared or clandestinely stolen.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{mathematical}} notation {{in use today}} was not invented until the 16th century. Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery. Euler (1707–1783) was responsible {{for many of the}} notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to Barbara Oakley, this {{can be attributed to the}} fact that mathematical ideas are both more abstract and more encrypted than those of natural language. Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as cow) with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog. Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations <b>or</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scholarly {{peer review}} (also known as refereeing) {{is the process}} of {{subjecting}} an author's scholarly work, research, <b>or</b> <b>ideas</b> to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book. The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but it does by no means prevent publication of all invalid research. Traditionally, peer reviewers have been anonymous, but there is currently a significant amount of open peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well.|$|E
