5|$|Ethnic {{groups within}} the American diocese began to re-align {{themselves}} with other national churches. In 1918, a group of Ukrainians in Canada formed the Ukrainian Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Church in Canada, and in 1922, the Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Archdiocese of America was established. In 1926, the Serbs aligned with the Serbian <b>Orthodox</b> Church.|$|E
5|$|In 1631 Wiśniowiecki {{returned}} to the Commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father's huge estate, which included {{a large part of}} what is now Ukraine. In 1632 he converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism, an action that caused much concern in Ukraine. His decision has been analyzed by historians, and often criticized, particularly in Ukrainian historiography. The <b>Orthodox</b> Church feared to lose a powerful protector, and Isaiah Kopinsky, metropolitan bishop of Kiev and a friend of his mother, unsuccessfully pleaded with him to change his mind. Jeremi would not budge although he remained on decent terms with the <b>Orthodox</b> Church, avoiding provocative actions, and supported his uncle and <b>Orthodox</b> bishop Peter Mogila and his <b>Orthodox</b> Church collegium.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Olga and {{her family}} were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Church. The family had {{previously}} been canonized in 1981 by the Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Church Abroad as holy martyrs.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Atlas of American <b>Orthodox</b> Christian Churches, {{published}} by Holy Cross <b>Orthodox</b> Press {{and based on}} research by Alexei Krindatch, was released. It has extensive data on various <b>Orthodox</b> Churches in the United States, including both Eastern <b>Orthodox</b> and Oriental <b>Orthodox</b> groups (as well as groups considered uncanonical by those two groups). The publication is endorsed by the Assembly of Canonical <b>Orthodox</b> Bishops and is being used by various Assembly committees {{as part of their}} research and planning. The Atlas lists the United States membership of the OCA as 84,900, 33,800 of which it says are regular church attendees. It lists the OCA as having 551 parishes and 19 monasteries in the United States. It also indicates the states with the heaviest concentration of OCA parishes are, in order: Alaska (with 86), Pennsylvania (with 83), California (with 43) and New York (with 41).|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Orthodox</b> Church, St Edward {{is ranked}} as a Passion-bearer, {{a type of}} saint who accepts death out of love for Christ. Edward was widely venerated before the canonization process was formalized, and he is also {{regarded}} as a saint in the Eastern <b>Orthodox</b> Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion. His feast day is celebrated on 18 March, {{the day of his}} murder. The <b>Orthodox</b> Church commemorates him a second time each year on 3 September and commemorates the translation of his relics into <b>Orthodox</b> possession on 13 February.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Greek <b>Orthodox</b> churches {{beginning}} in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed quincunx plans. Examples include Annunciation Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Church, completed in 1961 but designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957, Ascension Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Cathedral of Oakland (1960), and Annunciation Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek <b>Orthodox</b> churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.|$|E
5|$|In time, the Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Church Outside Russia was victorious {{and placed}} the relics in a church in Brookwood Cemetery in Woking, with the enshrinement {{ceremony}} occurring in September 1984. The St Edward Brotherhood of monks was organized there as well. The church is now named St Edward the Martyr <b>Orthodox</b> Church, and it is {{under the jurisdiction of}} a traditionalist Greek <b>Orthodox</b> community. However, while the bones are of approximately the right date, they are of a man in his late twenties or early thirties rather than a youth in his mid teens.|$|E
5|$|Lysacek is of Italian and Czech descent; his {{great-grandfather}} František Lysáček, emigrated from Czechoslovakia to Chicago in 1925. He is a Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Christian, having stated {{that one of}} his most prized possessions is his <b>Orthodox</b> cross. He wears Graf figure skating boots.|$|E
5|$|Mykola Leontovych {{grew up in}} {{a highly}} {{religious}} environment. He {{was a member of the}} <b>Orthodox</b> Church, descended from a line of village priests. He was also a graduate of the Podollia Theological Seminary in Kamianets-Podilskyi, which for the most part trained <b>Orthodox</b> Christian clergy.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations with Pelagius {{about the}} status of the Church in the Kingdom of Cyprus {{concluded}} with an agreement in October 1220. One of Alice's demands was for Greek <b>Orthodox</b> priests to be exempt from taxation. She also persuaded the pope, who had ordered the abolition of the <b>Orthodox</b> hierarchy on the island, to permit the appointment of <b>Orthodox</b> suffragan bishops in the four Roman Catholic dioceses. In time, the agreement was revised, as the Cypriot noblemen opposed the payment of a tithe (as prescribed by the agreement). The Holy See had also demanded that the estates the nobles had seized from the <b>Orthodox</b> Church be restored to the Catholic clerics. However, this new agreement, reached in 1222, neither freed the noblemen from the tithe nor prescribed the restoration of Church property.|$|E
5|$|On the Church Road/ Westow Street {{corner is}} an ornate Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Church which serves the Greek Cypriot and <b>Orthodox</b> {{community}} of the surrounding area. Formally an Anglican church, the walls are now dressed in ornate Byzantine-style art.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{affiliation}} is diverse: Macedonians, Serbs and Vlachs {{are mainly}} <b>Orthodox,</b> while Albanians, Turks and Roma (Gypsies) are usually Muslim, although there exists an almost {{equal number of}} <b>Orthodox</b> Romani. Skopje also has a Catholic Albanian minority, to which belonged Mother Teresa.|$|E
5|$|Shlomo Ashkenazy is a gay {{psychotherapist}} {{who has run}} {{a confidential}} support group for <b>Orthodox</b> gay men for nearly 20 years. He is interviewed {{about the effects of}} <b>Orthodox</b> attitudes to homosexuality and the reactions of rabbis to gay Jews.|$|E
5|$|Today {{there are}} more than 120,000 people of {{different}} Christian denominations, representing less than 0.2 percent of Turkey's population, including an estimated 80,000 Oriental <b>Orthodox,</b> 35,000 Roman Catholics, 18,000 Antiochian Greeks, 5,000 Greek <b>Orthodox,</b> and smaller numbers of Protestants. Currently there are 236 churches open for worship in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the past}} twenty years, the OCA has {{established}} more than 220 new parishes. It {{was a member of}} the Standing Conference of <b>Orthodox</b> Bishops in America (SCOBA), together with the Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Archdiocese of America, the Antiochian <b>Orthodox</b> Christian Archdiocese of North America (AOCA) and the other member jurisdictions. In 2010, SCOBA was dissolved with the creation of the new Assembly of Canonical <b>Orthodox</b> Bishops of North and Central America, which was mandated by <b>Orthodox</b> Patriarchates in 2009 at a meeting in Switzerland. Serious consideration has been given recently to a possible merger between the OCA and the AOCA. Both groups share a significant common history, in that a Syrian priest, Raphael Hawaweeny, was sent by the Moscow Patriarchate in the late 19th century as a missionary to Arabic-speaking <b>Orthodox</b> Christians living in North America. Raphael was ordained a bishop in 1904, and his flock eventually became the AOCA. Bishop Raphael was canonized in March 2000 by the OCA as St. Raphael of Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Gaza {{is home to}} a small Palestinian Christian {{minority}} of about 3,500 people. The majority live in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City and belong to the Greek <b>Orthodox,</b> Roman Catholic, and Baptist denominations. In 1906 there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were <b>Orthodox</b> and 50 were Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the church is the equestrian statue of Matthias Corvinus, erected in honour of the locally born King of Hungary. The <b>Orthodox</b> Church's {{equivalent}} to St. Michael's Church is the <b>Orthodox</b> Cathedral on Avram Iancu Square, built in the interwar era. The Romanian Greek-Catholic Church also has a cathedral in Cluj-Napoca, Transfiguration Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|It {{is officially}} {{recognized}} as autocephalous by several <b>Orthodox</b> churches, mostly those based in Slavic countries. The remaining churches {{do not recognize}} the OCA as autocephalous, although they do recognize the self-governing nature of the church. While the subject of political and ecclesiastical dispute, this controversy does not impair the communion between the OCA and the wider Eastern <b>Orthodox</b> Church.|$|E
5|$|One {{effect of}} Jagiello's {{measures}} {{was to be}} the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of <b>Orthodox</b> elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the <b>Orthodox</b> boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian identity in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Tememe Derech built {{a synagogue}} in the 500 block of Carondelet Street in the Central City section of New Orleans in 1867. It {{was the sole}} <b>Orthodox</b> {{congregation}} to construct its own building; {{only a minority of}} New Orleans' Jews were <b>Orthodox,</b> and other congregations rented space or met in members' homes. Tememe Derech's membership, however, never exceeded 50, and in 1903 or 1904 the synagogue disbanded, and merged with a number of other small <b>Orthodox</b> congregations and a burial society to form Beth Israel. Services were initially held in rented quarters in the same 500 block of Carondelet Street.|$|E
5|$|The last Ottoman census, {{conducted}} in 1908, counted 128,000 <b>Orthodox</b> Christians and 95,000 Muslims in the region. Of the <b>Orthodox</b> population, an estimated 30,000 to 47,000 spoke Greek exclusively. The {{rest of the}} <b>Orthodox</b> community spoke an Albanian patois at home, but was literate only in Greek, which was used in cultural, trading and economic activities. Moreover, they expressed a strong pro-Greek feeling, and {{were the first to}} support the following breakaway autonomist movement. Considering these conditions, loyalty in Northern Epirus to an Albanian government competing in an anarchy, whose leaders were mostly Muslim, could not be guaranteed.|$|E
5|$|There is a Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Church of St Andrew the Apostle in Grove Road, Milton.|$|E
5|$|Trembling Before G-d is an 2001 American {{documentary}} film about {{gay and lesbian}} <b>Orthodox</b> Jews trying to reconcile their sexuality with their faith. It was directed by Sandi Simcha DuBowski, an American who wanted to compare <b>Orthodox</b> Jewish attitudes to homosexuality with his own upbringing as a gay Conservative Jew.|$|E
5|$|With a seed {{grant from}} Steven Spielberg, {{the creators of}} the film have set up the Trembling Before G-d <b>Orthodox</b> Education Project, to teach <b>Orthodox</b> {{educators}} and rabbis about homosexuality, as well as convening the first <b>Orthodox</b> Mental Health Conference on Homosexuality and training facilitators to show the film to community leaders. Over 2000 principals, educators and school counselors have attended screenings within Israel's religious school system. The film has now been seen by an estimated 8 million people worldwide. Following the success of Trembling before G-d, DuBowski produced a documentary about gay devout Muslims entitled A Jihad for Love.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{communities}} {{belonging to the}} Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Old-Rite Church and other Old Believers, to the Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Church Outside Russia, to the Ruthenian <b>Orthodox</b> Church, to various branches of the True <b>Orthodox</b> Church-Catacombism (including the Ruthenian True <b>Orthodox</b> Church, the Ukrainian True <b>Orthodox</b> Church and the Church of the Goths), to the Romanian <b>Orthodox</b> Church (Metropolis of Bessarabia), to the Ukrainian Autocephalous <b>Orthodox</b> Church Canonical, to the Armenian Apostolic <b>Orthodox</b> Church (Oriental <b>Orthodox</b> miaphysites), and {{to a variety of}} other minor Christian <b>Orthodox</b> churches.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>Orthodox</b> churches, {{such as the}} Bulgarian <b>Orthodox</b> Church, Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Church, Serbian <b>Orthodox</b> Church, Ukrainian <b>Orthodox</b> Church and Macedonian <b>Orthodox</b> Church – Ohrid Archbishopric, as well {{as several}} Eastern Catholic Churches, still use Church Slavonic in their {{services}} and chants today.|$|E
25|$|The Coptic <b>Orthodox,</b> Syriac <b>Orthodox,</b> Malankara <b>Orthodox</b> {{and other}} Oriental <b>Orthodox</b> Churches {{also use the}} formula 'crucified for us', with minor {{seasonal}} variations from the Armenian use.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish <b>Orthodox</b> Feminist Alliance (JOFA): a {{forum for}} {{enhancing}} the roles of <b>Orthodox</b> Jewish women within the <b>Orthodox</b> community, and reducing <b>Orthodox</b> religious disabilities against women.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orthodox</b> Patriarchate of Jerusalem is an autocephalous <b>Orthodox</b> Church {{within the}} wider communion of <b>Orthodox</b> Christianity. The Arab <b>Orthodox</b> Society exists in Jerusalem {{and is one}} of the oldest and largest is the Arab <b>Orthodox</b> Benevolent Society in Beit Jala, Palestine.|$|E
25|$|Most present-day {{inhabitants}} of the region are Eastern <b>Orthodox</b> Christians, principally of the Greek <b>Orthodox,</b> Bulgarian <b>Orthodox,</b> Serbian <b>Orthodox</b> and Macedonian <b>Orthodox</b> Churches. Notable Muslim minorities are present among the Albanian, Bulgarian (Pomaks), Macedonian (Torbeš), Bosniak, and Turkish populations.|$|E
25|$|According to Yushchenko, a good {{future for}} the country is {{impossible}} without national unity. Yushchenko also advocates {{the formation of a}} single <b>Orthodox</b> Church in Ukraine, thus unifying the current three branches of the <b>Orthodox</b> church in Ukraine (the Ukrainian <b>Orthodox</b> Church of Moscow Patriarchate, the only one recognized by the world <b>orthodox</b> community, the Ukrainian <b>Orthodox</b> Church of Kyiv Patriarchate and the Ukrainian Autocephalous <b>Orthodox</b> Church).|$|E
25|$|Given {{his strong}} {{connections}} with the Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Church, Beidas became a leading member of Palestine's <b>Orthodox</b> church, representing the <b>Orthodox</b> Christians of Northern Palestine at the Combined Council of Arab <b>Orthodox</b> and Greek Clergy which was charged to administer <b>Orthodox</b> affairs in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orthodox</b> Christians {{constituted}} {{a majority of}} believers in the Soviet Union. In the late 1980s, three <b>Orthodox</b> churches claimed substantial memberships there: the Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Church, the Georgian <b>Orthodox</b> Church, and the Ukrainian Autocephalous <b>Orthodox</b> Church (AOC). They {{were members of the}} major confederation of <b>Orthodox</b> churches in the world, generally referred to as the Eastern <b>Orthodox</b> Church. The first two functioned openly and were tolerated by the regime, but the Ukrainian AOC was not permitted to function openly. Parishes of the Belarusian Autocephalous <b>Orthodox</b> Church reappeared in Belarus only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but they did not receive recognition from the Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Church, which controls Belarusian eparchies.|$|E
25|$|The {{future of}} the Serbian <b>Orthodox</b> Church in Montenegro has been {{threatened}} by the newly formed Montenegrin <b>Orthodox</b> Church which has claimed Serbian <b>Orthodox</b> churches in Montenegro, and is backed by {{a small percentage of}} the <b>Orthodox</b> Christians in Montenegro. The government has recognized the church, however none of the Eastern <b>Orthodox</b> churches have. The leader is the controversial Miraš Dedeić, a former Serbian <b>Orthodox</b> clergyman with Serbian nationalist views that after being suspended from the Serbian Church, went to Rome and became a Greek <b>Orthodox</b> clergyman.|$|E
25|$|In the Levant, Christian <b>Orthodox</b> {{services}} and identity often combine both the Byzantine Greek and indigenous (Arabic and Aramaic) traditions. Other <b>Orthodox</b> communities {{can identify with}} two Eastern <b>Orthodox</b> churches simultaneously, for example Caucasus Greeks and Pontic Greeks in Russia often identify with both the Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Church and Russian <b>Orthodox</b> Church, {{as a result of}} centuries of assimilation and intermarriage with ethnic Russians and other Christian <b>Orthodox</b> communities in mainly southern Russia.|$|E
