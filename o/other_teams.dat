3000|$|Given that we {{have argued}} that LMX {{positively}} influences workplace ostracism via the emotion of envy from <b>other</b> <b>team</b> members (i.e., Hypothesis 2), and that agreeableness moderates the relationship between being envied by <b>other</b> <b>team</b> members and workplace ostracism (i.e., Hypothesis 3), we expect that the indirect effect of LMX on workplace ostracism varies {{as a function of}} agreeableness. Specifically, this indirect effect via being envied by <b>other</b> <b>team</b> members is stronger for employees low in agreeableness. Thus, we propose the following moderated mediation hypothesis: [...]...|$|R
