25|$|During {{the initial}} phase of <b>operation,</b> <b>services</b> {{are to be}} {{operated}} by MTR under the TfL Rail brand. Following the practice adopted during the transfer of former Silverlink services to London Overground in 2007, TfL will carry out a deep clean of stations and trains on the future Elizabeth line route, install new ticket machines and barriers, introduce Oyster card and contactless payment, and ensure all stations are staffed. Existing rolling stock has been rebranded with the TfL Rail identity.|$|E
25|$|As railway {{lines have}} been {{transferred}} to London Overground <b>operation,</b> <b>services</b> are sometimes operated using rolling stock inherited from the previous train operating company, and for a temporary period these trains have been branded with transitional livery until they are replaced with newer rolling stock. When the first London Overground services began, they were operated using Silverlink rolling stock which retained Silverlink's purple and lime green livery with yellow doors. The Silverlink logos were removed and Overground banners were added. This rolling stock was eventually completely replaced with new, Overground-branded trains.|$|E
25|$|DNL {{was granted}} a ten-year {{monopoly}} on all domestic flights on 5 April 1935. This initially consisted of a sea plane route from Oslo along the coast to Troms√∏ and an international route from Oslo via Kristiansand to Amsterdam. DNL received NOK200,000 in state grants, plus NOK100,000 from Norway Post, {{for the first year}} of <b>operation.</b> <b>Services</b> commenced on 7 June with a wet leased Ju 52 from Luft Hansa on the international route. The domestic routes were flown using Junkers W 34. It bought a new ferry, MB Teist. DNL's travel time from Oslo to Bergen was four and a half hours, with intermediate stops in Moss, Arendal, Kristiansand, Stavanger and Haugesund.|$|E

25|$|On January 13, 2003, the Corporation for General Trade {{was sold}} for $20 million to New Vision Television. The station changed its call {{letters to the}} current WISE-TV on May 26 to {{celebrate}} its 50th anniversary. A new transmitter with a stronger signal and new high definition options was installed on the tower. The station was sold again in March 2005 to Granite Broadcasting Corporation for $44.2 million. Granite sold ABC affiliate WPTA to Malara Broadcast Group for $45.3 million. A local marketing agreement was established that called for Granite to provide <b>operation</b> <b>services</b> to WPTA {{as well as for}} Malara's other new station, KDLH in Duluth, Minnesota. Malara files its Securities and Exchange Commission reports jointly with Granite which led to allegations that Granite uses Malara as a shell corporation to evade the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) rules on duopolies. The FCC does not allow common ownership of two of the four largest stations in a single market. Fort Wayne has only six full-power stations which is too few to allow duopolies in any case. After emerging from bankruptcy in the Summer of 2007, Granite stock was taken over by Silver Point Capital of Greenwich, Connecticut which is a privately owned hedge fund. Silver Point Capital now controls Granite broadcasting according to a Buffalo, New York news article printed on September 16, 2007. According to the same article, Granite will be sold to other parties and many of its stations have been laying off employees or cutting salaries up to 20%. Back on January 24, 2006, The WB and UPN announced that they would end broadcasting and merge.|$|E
