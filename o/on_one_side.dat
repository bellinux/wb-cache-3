5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor.

These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E

5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served as proof of concept.

The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E

Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E

Columbus was featured at the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago in 193233.|$|E
