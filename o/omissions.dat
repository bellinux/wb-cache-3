While prior research has explored various attitudinal {{consequences of such}} <b>omission,</b> our research investigates the memorial consequences of element <b>omission.</b> We focus specifically on the recall effects resulting from a previously unstudied form of element <b>omission</b> - leaving out an entire visual element from the ad. Research on self- generation {{as well as on}} message elaboration indicates that such element <b>omission</b> may actually lead to an improvement along specific dimensions such as category recall and brand recall. We find strong support for this perspective in a series of three experiments which explore the effects of feature <b>omission</b> both in the context of perception-based <b>omission</b> (wherein the <b>omission</b> is noticed purely {{on the basis of a}} perceptual process) and knowledge-based <b>omission</b> (wherein the <b>omission</b> is noticed due to prior expectations for that ad type).

In Study 2, individuals with self-reported OCD evinced less <b>omission</b> bias about washing and checking scenarios than did individuals without OCD. Again, general <b>omission</b> bias {{was not related to}} OCD. These results support the idea that individuals with elevated OCD symptoms distinguish less than others between acts of <b>omission</b> and commission for harm relevant to general OCD concerns...|$|R

40|$|A process fails by <b>omission</b> if it “forgets ” to send {{or receive}} messages. Considering <b>omission</b> {{failures}} {{is crucial for}} distributed systems, as such failures model both crash failures and incorrect behavior of process input/output buffers (such as buffer overflow). So, designing protocols that cope not only with crash failures but also with <b>omission</b> failures is a real challenge {{as soon as one}} is interested in obtaining real-time dependable distributed systems. While the consensus problem has received a lot of attention in the crash failure model and in the Byzantine failure model, it has received less attention in the <b>omission</b> failure model. This paper presents a simple uniform consensus protocol for synchronous systems made up of processes where up to can commit crash or <b>omission</b> failures. This protocol requires communication steps. Interestingly, as this bound is tight for crash failures and those are included in <b>omission</b> failures, this shows that is a tight lower bound for protocols solving uniform consensus in synchronous systems prone to process <b>omission</b> failures. The protocol assumes that is a necessary requirement on the maximum number of faulty processes that can be tolerated by any uniform consensus protocol in presence of <b>omission</b> failures. The proposed protocol is then extended, at no additional cost, to solve the Interactive Consistency problem...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{investigate}} the memorial consequences of deliberately omitting crucial elements from an advertisement. Research on the self-generation effect in cognitive psychology indicates that such element <b>omission</b> may actually {{lead to an}} improvement in recall. Support for this perspective is obtained {{in a series of}} experiments that explores the effects of feature <b>omission</b> in the context of both overt <b>omission</b> (in which the <b>omission</b> is highlighted by the advertiser) and implicit <b>omission</b> (in which the <b>omission,</b> though not highlighted in the advertisement, is noticed because of prior expectations for that ad type). Even under highly constrained processing conditions (e. g., exposure times as short as four seconds), an advertisement that omits a key element is shown to produce better recall than an equivalent advertisement that contains the element. The authors find that this recall improvement occurs along dimensions that are specifically related to the omitted element; therefore, leaving out an element related only to the product category (but not the brand) produces an improvement only in category recall, whereas brand recall is improved by the <b>omission</b> of an element related to the brand name. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications of these findings. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Some of the {{problems}} that have affected the F-FDTL throughout its existence were caused by the process used to establish the force. A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL without external oversight. As a result, the selection was conducted, to a large degree, on the basis of applicants' political allegiance. This led to many FALINTIL veterans feeling that they had been unfairly excluded from the military and reduced the force's public standing. Furthermore, UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the East Timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents, administrative support arrangements and mechanisms for the democratic control of the military.

40|$|Evidence from appetitive Pavlovian and {{instrumental}} conditioning {{studies suggest that}} the amygdala is involved in modulation of responses correlated with motivational states, and therefore, to the modulation of processes probably underlying reinforcement <b>omission</b> effects. The present study aimed to clarify whether or not the mechanisms related to reinforcement <b>omission</b> effects of different magnitudes depend on basolateral complex and central nucleus of amygdala. Rats were trained on a fixed-interval 12 s with limited hold 6 s signaled schedule in which correct responses were always followed by one of two reinforcement magnitudes. Bilateral lesions of the basolateral complex and central nucleus were made after acquisition of stable performance. After postoperative recovery, the training was changed from 100 % to 50 % reinforcement schedules. The results showed that lesions of the basolateral complex and central nucleus did not eliminate or reduce, but interfere with reinforcement <b>omission</b> effects. The response from rats of both the basolateral complex and central nucleus lesioned group was higher relative to that of the rats of their respective sham-lesioned groups after reinforcement <b>omission.</b> Thus, the lesioned rats were more sensitive to the <b>omission</b> effect. Moreover, the basolateral complex lesions prevented the magnitude effect on reinforcement <b>omission</b> effects. Basolateral complex lesioned rats showed no differential performance following <b>omission</b> of larger and smaller reinforcement magnitude. Thus, the basolateral complex is involved in incentive processes relative to <b>omission</b> of different reinforcement magnitudes. Therefore, it is possible that reinforcement <b>omission</b> effects are modulated by brain circuitry which involves amygdala. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Previous research supports medical providers and patients lack of comfort in discussing insulin <b>omission.</b> This study was designed to answer two questions. Why do young adult college students with type I diabetes omit insulin? and what factors facilitate and act as barriers to open communication regarding insulin <b>omission</b> in the patient-provider interaction. A total 13 (10 females, 3 males) college students completed a qualitative interview focused on insulin <b>omission</b> and communication of this behavior to medical providers, and 11 of the 13 completed a modified EAT- 26. Using consensual qualitative research methods CQR (Hill, Thompson, & Williams, 1997), domains that emerged were reasons for insulin, predominant reason for insulin <b>omission,</b> motivators to give insulin as prescribed (i. e., adhere), overall communication of insulin <b>omission</b> to medical providers, and factors facilitating and barriers inhibiting communication regarding insulin <b>omission</b> to medical providers. Typical reasons for insulin <b>omission</b> included forgetting or delaying and forgetting, worrying about hypoglycemia and its social implications, being in situations where limited access to food/medical supplies, planning to be physically active, or being unsure of carbohydrate count in food.

Since the acquisition of language is ongoing during the students 2 ̆ 7 primary schooling, this study also considers how null subjects in Indonesian may have an impact on learning and teaching at school. The <b>omission</b> of subjects occurs independent or matrix and in main clauses, and in coordinating and subordinating clauses in four types of sentences of basic, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences. Developmental stages in subject <b>omission,</b> the setting or with whom the students are speaking, age and gender have a statistically significant impact on <b>omission</b> of subjects especially in independent, matrix and in the main clauses. Age and gender have no impact on the <b>omission</b> of subjects in the coordinating clauses of the compound sentences, in the subordinating clauses of complex sentences, and in the coordinating and subordinating clauses of the compound-complex sentences. Clauses where subject <b>omission</b> occurs here include indeendent basic sentences, the first or matrix clause in a compound sentence, the main clause in a complex sentence, and in the first clause of coordinate or subordinate clause in a compound-complex sentence. The similarities in the <b>omission</b> of subjects are that students omit subjects more when they speak with the researcher than with their peers, except for coordinating clause subjects in the compound-complex sentences. Overall subject <b>omission</b> decreased in independent basic clauses, in the first or matrix clauses of compound sentences, and in the main clauses of complex sentences as the students become older.
