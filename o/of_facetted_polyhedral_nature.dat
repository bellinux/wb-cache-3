40|$|We {{investigate}} the iterative behaviour of continuous order preserving subhomogeneous maps that map a polyhedral cone into itself. For these maps {{we show that}} every bounded orbit converges to a periodic orbit and, moreover, that there exists an a priori upper bound for the periods of periodic points that only depends on the number <b>of</b> <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> the <b>polyhedral</b> cone. By constructing examples on the standard positive cone, we show that the upper bound is asymptotically sharp.

40|$|Bacterial microcompartments are {{primitive}} organelles composed {{entirely of}} protein subunits. Genomic sequence databases reveal the widespread occur-rence of microcompartments across diverse microbes. The prototypical bacterial microcompartment is the carboxysome, a protein shell for sequestering carbon fixation reactions. We report three-dimensional crystal structures of multiple carboxysome shell proteins, revealing a hexameric unit {{as the basic}} micro-compartment building block and showing how these hexamers assemble to form flat <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> the <b>polyhedral</b> shell. The structures suggest how molecular transport across the shell may be controlled and how structural variations might govern the assembly and architecture of these subcellular compartments. Intracellular polyhedral bodies (Fig. 1, A and B) were first observed in bacteria by electron microscopy more than 40 years ago (1 – 3).

40|$|Abstract — We {{establish}} {{a model of}} a system with hystereses, which allows for standard stability analysis of fixed points and closed orbits. To this end, we represent a system with hystereses as a piecewise-affine switched system that consists of a family of dynamical systems defined on disjoint polyhedral sets. The discrete transitions are realized by reset maps defined on the <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> these <b>polyhedral</b> sets. We have shown that the state space of a resulting switched system is a smooth manifold, the Cartesian product of a torus with an Euclidean space. Additionally, we construct the charts explicitly. Thereby, the analysis of a system with hystereses {{can be seen as the}} analysis of a dynamical system on a manifold. This dynamical system in a chart corresponds to a differential equation with discontinuous right hand side, which solution is shown to exist and to be unique. I...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we focus}} on the study of the base rings {{associated}} to some transversal polymatroids. A transversal polymatroid is a special kind of discrete polymatroid. Discrete polymatroids were introduced by Herzog and Hibi [16] in 2002. The thesis is structured in four chapters. Chapter 1 starts with a short excursion into convex geometry. Next, we look at some properties of affine semigroup rings. We recall some basic definitions and known facts about semigroup rings. Next we give a brief introduction to matroids and discrete polymatroids. Finally, we remind some properties of the base rings associated to discrete polymatroids. These properties will be needed in the next chapters of the thesis. Chapter two is devoted {{to the study of the}} canonical module of the base ring associated to a transversal polymatroid. We determine the <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> the <b>polyhedral</b> cone generated by the exponent set of monomials defining the base ring. This allows us to describe the canonical module in terms of the relative interior of the cone. Also, this would allow one to compute the a − invariant of the base ring.

Acetylene decomposition on Ni tips at 873 K is observed to induce additional step formation on an initially <b>facetted</b> (<b>polyhedral)</b> crystal. Carbon-enriched steps are then observed to act as preferential nucleation centers of graphene sheets formation. Atom-probe experiments reveal C 2 and C 3 species and frequency dependent studies demonstrate that the origin of these species is different from C 1.

40|$|Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are {{polyhedral}} organelles {{found in}} an increasingly wide variety of bacterial species. These structures, typified by carboxysomes of cyanobacteria and many chemoautotrophs, function to compartmentalize important reaction sequences of metabolic pathways. Unlike their eukaryotic counterparts, which are surrounded by lipid bilayer membranes, these microbial organelles are bounded by a thin protein shell that is assembled from multiple copies of a few different polypeptides. The main shell proteins form hexamers whose edges interact to create the thin sheets that form the <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> the <b>polyhedral</b> BMCs. Each hexamer contains a central pore hypothesized to mediate flux of metabolites {{into and out of}} the organelle. Because several distinctly different metabolic processes are found in the various BMCs studied to date, it has been proposed that a common advantage to packaging these pathways within shell-bound compartments is to optimize the concentration of volatile metabolites in the BMC by maintaining an interior pH that is lower than that of the cytoplasm. We have tested this idea by recombinantly fusing a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP) to ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), the major enzyme component inside the carboxysome. Our results suggest that the carboxysomal pH is similar to that of its external environment and that the protein shell does not constitute a proton barrier. The explanation for the sundry BMC functions must therefore be sought in the characteristics of the pores that traverse their shells...|$|R
