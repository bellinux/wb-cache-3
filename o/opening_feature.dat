50|$|Purdey guns moved briskly from flintlock to {{percussion}} cap to hammer centre-fire guns {{and then to}} the self-opening hammerless gun of 1880. This hammerless self opening mechanism was designed by Frederick Beesley, a Purdey worker of the time, and used one limb of a V spring to operate the internal hammers and the other to operate the self <b>opening</b> <b>feature.</b> Beesley sold the patent to Purdey in 1880 for £55. This was followed ten years later by the incorporation of ejectors. Apart from continual refinement and the optional single trigger mechanism, very little change has subsequently been made to the design of the side by side gun.|$|E
50|$|The Corgi {{design team}} {{came up with}} the first model with an <b>opening</b> <b>feature</b> in February 1960, the Aston Martin DB4 (218) which had an opening bonnet. Steerable front wheels, jewelled {{headlights}} and rear lights and an opening boot complete with spare wheel were added on the Bentley Continental Sports Saloon (224) in April 1961, and by October 1963 with the release of the Ghia L6.4 (241) new levels of authenticity were reached. This model featured a number of 'firsts' with not only an opening bonnet, but also opening doors and boot, and a detailed interior with a rear view mirror, folding front seats, and even a model corgi dog sitting on the rear parcel shelf.

50|$|In 1993 Frilot and Karim Ainouz {{were the}} co-directors, and {{introduced}} many changes, including the name MIX, {{the production of}} a catalog (instead of handing our program notes), a new venue (The Kitchen instead of Anthology Film Archives) and a commitment to multicultural presentations and installation work. A stunning program that year was called The 1000 Dreams of Desire, curated by Jim Lyons. It was a special show featuring Teri Rice's The Kindling Point and Les Affaires, at the Ann Street Bookstore in Lower Manhattan, where the peep booths were reprogrammed with experimental video, and 16mm film was projected in a separate room. MIX returned to Anthology in 1994, and combined with DCTV's Lookout Lesbian & Gay Video Festival because DCTV's building was under renovation. Ainouz scaled back his involvement, and Frilot became the definitive voice of MIX, making the organization a home for emerging filmmakers and makers of color. This was signaled by 1994's <b>opening</b> <b>feature,</b> Brincando El Charco, and even more powerfully when 1995's opening and closing events were films by makers of color These films, Vintage: Families of Value by Thomas Allen Harris, and Frilot's own documentary Black Nations/Queer Nations, brought new audiences to MIX. They started satellite festivals such as MIX Brasil (1993) and MIX Mexico (1996).|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, Mebetoys {{was bought}} by Mattel, which carried on Mebetoys models and began to market new 1/43 scale cars (Force 1992, pp. 146-147).

5000|$|The Christmas <b>opening</b> <b>featured</b> a {{performance}} of [...] "A Wonderful Sign of a Magical Time".

50|$|The SmartKey's {{electronics}} {{are embedded}} in a hollow, triangular piece of plastic, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, squared-off at the tip with a half-inch-long insert piece. The side of the SmartKey also hides a traditional Mercedes-Benz key that can be pulled out from a release at top. The metal key is used for valet purposes such as locking the glovebox and/or trunk before the SmartKey is turned over to a parking attendant. Once locked manually, the trunk cannot be opened with the SmartKey or interior buttons. The key fob utilizes a radio-frequency transponder {{to communicate with the}} door locks, but it uses infrared to communicate with the engine immobilizer system. Original SmartKeys had a limited frequency and could have only been used in line-of-sight for safety purposes. The driver can also point the smart key at the front driver side door while pushing and holding the unlock button on the SmartKey and the windows and the sunroof will open in order to ventilate the cabin. Similarly, if the same procedure is completed while holding the lock button, the windows and sunroof will close. In cars equipped with the Active Ventilated Seats, the summer <b>opening</b> <b>feature</b> will activate the seat ventilation in addition to opening the windows and sunroof.|$|E
50|$|A photo {{exhibition}} called Winterreise {{was unveiled}} in Tokyo in May 2011, {{accompanied by a}} Playbutton release. Atom™ performances at the Lincoln Center in New York City, Communikey Festival in Boulder, the Raster-Noton/Mute festival at the Roundhouse in London, Labyrinth Festival in Japan plus many others. Exclusive contributions to Ryuichi Sakamoto's Kizunaworld project and Tōwa Tei's Mach online platform.A second Winterreise exhibition was held in Frankfurt (Germany) in October 2011 {{as well as the}} Winterreise soundtrack was released in May 2012 through Raster-Noton. atom-tm.com was launched in July 2012 and serves as Atom™'s official news platform and archive. As a result of the Winterreise release, Atom™ received an invitation from Richie Hawtin to play an ambient set at his club in Ibiza. The invitation was accepted and the then entitled Alpha txt ambient set created, which was then again performed, opening the Labyrinth festival in September the same year. An initially abandoned album, which in 2005 carried the working title Hard Disc Rock (as a self-reference to the 1997 Atom™ title with the same name), resurfaced as HD, after some of the unfinished tracks raised interest at the Raster-Noton label. The album was finished {{during the second half of}} 2012, and mixed down during January 2013. The release of HD was then scheduled for March 2013. In the middle of the HD production, the terrible news of Pete Namlook's sudden death reach Schmidt. Months later, as a practical consequence of Namlook's passing away, the Rather Interesting label, which both Pete and Atom ran together since 1994, was shut down forever. Early 2013 sees Atom™ playing various live shows, such as the double <b>opening</b> <b>feature</b> at Berlin's CTM.13, where he first performs Bauteile with colleague Marc Behrens, and later on, together with Material Object, plays a three-hour Alpha txt set. Extensive promotional activities for HD, which, amongst other results, bring Atom™ on the front page of Germany's De:bug magazine and the preparation for the HD and Ground Loop live sets keep Atom™ busy during the first couple of months of 2013.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted load control valve with load velocity control ability and fast <b>opening</b> <b>feature</b> based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional load control valves {{do not have}} the load velocity control ability and its <b>opening</b> <b>feature</b> is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a load control valve to achieve load velocity control ability while the <b>opening</b> <b>feature</b> was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the load control valve achieve load velocity control ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time. Static modeling method based on force balance and Bernoulli orifice pressure-flow equation is used to design the load velocity control ability of the valve. Dynamic modeling method based on Newton’s second law and fluid continuity equation is used to optimize the parameters to give the proposed load control valve a fast <b>opening</b> <b>feature.</b> An actual load control valve was developed according to the above methods and the test results show both good load velocity control ability and fast <b>opening</b> <b>feature</b> of the design, which validates the potentiality of the proposed design in many applications...|$|E
