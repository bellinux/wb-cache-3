5|$|The Emancipation Proclamation, {{issued on}} September 22, 1862, {{and put into}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing {{the army and the}} nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 <b>off-year</b> <b>elections</b> by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Maryland Senate {{are elected}} every four years, in <b>off-year</b> <b>elections</b> {{in the middle}} of terms for Presidents of the United States. Party {{nominations}} are determined by primary elections. The general election for Senate seats and all other state and federal elections in the normal cycle is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Should a Senate seat become vacant {{in the middle of}} a term, because of death, illness, incapacitation, disqualification, resignation, or expulsion of a member of the Senate, that seat is filled by appointment. The Central Committee of the previous Senator's party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint to the seat. Within fifteen days of the Central Committee's recommendation being selected, the Governor must appoint that person to the vacant seat.|$|E
5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the <b>off-year</b> <b>elections</b> of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E

50|$|In the Senate <b>off-year</b> <b>election</b> in 2008, Republican Jeff Sessions {{did better}} than John McCain. Sessions won 57 {{percent of the vote}} and 102,043 votes. His challenger, Democrat Vivian D. Figures, won 43 percent of the vote and 77,292 votes.|$|R
5|$|Kentucky {{is one of}} {{only five}} U.S. states to hold gubernatorial {{elections}} in odd-numbered years—commonly called an <b>off-year</b> <b>election.</b> Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey also hold <b>off-year</b> gubernatorial <b>elections.</b> The general election for governor and lieutenant governor is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The governor and lieutenant governor are inaugurated on the fifth Tuesday after their election. This was changed from the fourth Tuesday after the election by the 1850 constitution.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, by 1890 the Republicans {{had agreed}} to the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission in {{response}} to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high McKinley Tariff of 1890 hurt {{the party and the}} Democrats swept to a landslide in the <b>off-year</b> <b>elections,</b> even defeating McKinley himself.|$|E
25|$|As the Northern post-war economy boomed with industry, railroads, {{mines and}} fast-growing cities {{as well as}} prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took credit and {{promoted}} policies to keep the fast growth going. The Democratic Party was largely controlled by pro-business Bourbon Democrats until 1896. The GOP supported big business generally, the gold standard, high tariffs and generous pensions for Union veterans. However, by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high McKinley Tariff of 1890 hurt {{the party and the}} Democrats swept to a landslide in the <b>off-year</b> <b>elections,</b> even defeating McKinley himself.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt's {{attacks on}} Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the <b>off-year</b> <b>elections</b> of 1918. He {{declined}} {{a request from}} New York Republican to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson's Fourteen Points, calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany. He was cautiously optimistic about the proposed League of Nations, but had reservations about its impact on United States sovereignty. Roosevelt was popular enough to contest the 1920 Republican nomination, but his health was broken by 1918 due to the lingering effects of malaria. His family and supporters threw their support behind Roosevelt's old military companion, General Leonard Wood, but Taft supporter Warren G. Harding defeated Wood on the tenth ballot of the 1920 Republican National Convention.|$|E
50|$|The Denver Post {{newspaper}} {{stated that}} candidates who promised reform won {{the majority of}} local school board elections across Colorado in the November 2013 <b>off-year</b> <b>election,</b> and that O'Brien, {{as well as her}} fellow winners for Denver School Board positions, were reform candidates.|$|R
50|$|The State of Louisiana usually {{holds its}} general {{elections}} for state offices in post-midterm <b>off-years.</b> <b>Elections</b> {{for state and}} local offices, unlike federal elections, are conducted under the jungle primary (also known as nonpartisan blanket primary) format and are usually held in mid-October.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the passage}} of Senate Legislative Initiative 16-11, this will be the last year in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in which a gubernatorial {{election}} will occur on a pre-midterm <b>off-year</b> <b>election</b> year. The next CNMI gubernatorial election will be in 2014.|$|R
25|$|In the November 2005 <b>off-year</b> <b>elections,</b> New York City, Republican mayoral {{candidate}} Michael Bloomberg won {{a landslide}} re-election, the fourth straight Republican victory {{in what is}} otherwise a Democratic stronghold. In California, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger failed {{in his effort to}} use the ballot initiative to enact laws the Democrats blocked in the state legislature. Scandals prompted the resignations of Congressional Republicans House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Duke Cunningham, Mark Foley and Bob Ney. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Republicans lost control of both the House of Representatives and Senate to the Democrats in what was widely interpreted as a repudiation of the administration's war policies. Exit polling suggested that corruption was a key issue for many voters. Soon after the elections, Donald Rumsfeld resigned as secretary of defense to be replaced by Bob Gates.|$|E
2500|$|Following his defeat, Stevenson in 1953 made a well-publicized {{world tour}} through Asia, the Middle East and Europe, writing about his travels for Look magazine. His {{political}} stature {{as head of}} the Democratic Party gave him access to many foreign leaders and dignitaries. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953. In the 1954 <b>off-year</b> <b>elections</b> Stevenson took a leading role in campaigning for Democratic congressional and gubernatorial candidates around the nation. When the Democrats won control of both houses of Congress and picked up nine gubernatorial seats it [...] "put Democrats around the country in Stevenson's debt and greatly strengthened his position as his party's leader." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nixon's {{involvement}} in Watergate brought disgrace and a forced resignation in 1974 and any long-term movement toward the GOP {{was interrupted by}} the scandal. Gerald Ford succeeded Nixon {{and gave him a}} full pardon—thereby giving the Democrats a powerful issue they used to sweep the 1974 <b>off-year</b> <b>elections.</b> Ford never fully recovered and in 1976 he barely defeated Ronald Reagan for the nomination. The one positive to come from Ford's brief presidency was the outspoken personality of First Lady Betty Ford. Ford took several liberal positions on social issues regarding breast cancer awareness following her Mastectomy in 1974. To add to her outspoken persona, she was a staunch supporter of and activist for the Equal Rights Amendment, (ERA). Pro-choice on abortion and a leader in the women's movement, she gained fame {{as one of the most}} candid first ladies in history, commenting on every hot button issue of the time, including feminism, equal pay, the ERA, sex, drugs, abortion, civil rights, and gun control. Her liberal positions and her outspoken personality garnered her high approval ratings throughout her husband's term in office [...] despite opposition from the conservative wing of the GOP who objected to her liberal stances and even a few members of Ford's cabinet like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld advised Ford to ask her to tone down her outspoken views to avoid losing voters, but Ford declined to do so. Despite the candid nature of the First Lady and the end of the Vietnam War, Democrats ended up with major gains in Congress and the taint of Watergate and the nation's economic difficulties contributed to the election of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, running as a Washington outsider.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>off-year</b> <b>{{election}}</b> is {{a general}} election in the United States which is held in odd-numbered years when neither a presidential election nor a midterm election takes place.

50|$|Because such <b>off-year</b> <b>elections</b> feature {{far fewer}} races than either presidential or midterm elections, they {{generate}} far lower voter turnout than even-numbered election years.|$|E
50|$|Although {{successful}} {{in his bid}} for renomination, President Harrison's performance was underwhelming for an incumbent {{due in part to}} the crushing defeat that the party's Congressional candidates had met in the 1890 <b>off-year</b> <b>elections.</b> He lost the fall 1892 election to former president Grover Cleveland.|$|E
50|$|The 2013 United States {{elections}} were held on Tuesday, November 5, 2013.

50|$|The 2015 United States {{elections}} were held (for the most part) on Tuesday, November 3. The <b>off-year</b> <b>election</b> included {{a special election}} for Speaker of the House.

50|$|As <b>off-year</b> <b>elections</b> {{generally}} have much lower turnout, {{they can be}} a means by which politicians can get policies approved that otherwise would not.

50|$|The 2003 United States elections, most {{of which}} were held on Tuesday, November 4, were <b>off-year</b> <b>elections</b> in which no members of the Congress were {{standing}} for election.

50|$|Since that time, the 1st Congressional District {{has had a}} majority-white population.

5000|$|In total, three congressional {{seats and}} three governorships were contested, but neither party had a net change. The Republicans however picked up other various statewide offices.

They may also feature a number of special elections to fill vacancies in various federal, state and local offices.|$|E
