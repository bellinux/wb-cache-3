5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of <b>our</b> <b>political</b> and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E

25|$|Hertzog {{decided to}} retire {{as leader of}} the HNP in 1977, and gave his {{farewell}} address on 27 May of that year. He officially retired on 28 May 1977, and was followed by Jaap Marais as party leader. During his retirement, Hertzog could devote more time to his numerous business endeavors and his hobby of gardening. In a press interview in 1979 he opined as follows: “In my view <b>our</b> <b>political</b> landscape is developing {{in the direction of a}} large, new conservative party which will consist of different people who are still currently trying to tread their own path. It can be a party consisting of the Treurnicht people in the NP, the Connie Mulder people, the HNP and definitely also conservative English speakers.” This proved to be prophetic, as in 1982 a massive split occurred within the ruling National Party, and the Conservative Party came into being, with Andries Treurnicht as leader.|$|E

500|$|Flanders {{argues that}} nonhuman animals could be [...] "below" [...] politics, {{in that they}} do not have {{politically}} considerable interests, or [...] "above" [...] politics, in that they have rights which trump political decision-making processes. Flanders argues that if animals are excluded from basic justice, as John Rawls held, they can be defended on metaphysical grounds (what Rawls refers to as on the basis of comprehensive doctrines, as opposed to the public reasons which must be used for arguments in the political realm). This is potentially liberating for animal advocates. Nonetheless, Flanders argues, animal issues may be matters of basic justice insofar as they affect humans or the animals themselves have rights. Alternatively, the wrongness of animal cruelty may be a [...] "fixed point" [...] in <b>our</b> <b>political</b> reasoning. Flanders concludes that Rawlsianism provides a good starting point for the inclusion of animals in political decision-making.|$|E
