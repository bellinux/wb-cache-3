The application of the transformation from a velocity spectrum to a displacement spectrum in conjunction with the directional wave spectral theory are the core concepts in this study. Laboratory experiments were conducted to verify the accuracy of the inversed displacement of the surface of the sea. A GPS device was installed on a moored accelerometer buoy to verify the GPS-derived wave parameters. It was determined that loss or drifting of the GPS signal, as well as energy spikes occurring in the low frequency band led to erroneous measurements. Through the application of moving average skill and a process of frequency cut-off to the GPS <b>output</b> <b>velocity,</b> correlations between GPS-derived, and accelerometer buoy-measured significant wave heights and periods were both improved to 0. 95. The GPS-derived one-dimensional and directional wave spectra were in agreement with the measurements.
