40|$|Subacute {{combined}} degeneration (SCD) {{is a rare}} neurological {{complication of}} vitamin B 12 deficiency, characterized by demyelination of the dorsal and lateral spinal cord. Herein, we describe three cases, who presented with SCD, one related to reduced intake of vitamin B 12 because of a vegetarian diet and two related to nitrous oxide exposure during surgery. MR images of our patients revealed symmetrical hyperintense signals in dorsal and lateral columns in T 2 weighted series. After treatment with intramuscular B 12 injections (1 [*]mg daily for 2 weeks, <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>thereafter</b> for three months) all patients showed improvement of their symptoms. Abnormalities of the spinal cord on MRI resolved in three months. In conclusion, SCD either due to nitrous oxide exposure or due to reduced intake of vitamin B 12 is a reversible condition, when detected and treated early...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} Reciprocal Teaching during social studies instruction in fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade inclusive classrooms (N. 128) in a rural school system in New Mexico. Reciprocal teaching is a method of scaffolded instruction that has been demonstrated to improve reading comprehension in students of various ability levels. Experimental and control classrooms at each grade level contained approximately {{the same number of}} students with learning disabilities. Comprehension assessments were administered at baseline and <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>thereafter</b> for a total of four measures. Results indicated that students in the experimental groups improved their performance on comprehension measures more than students in the control group. This improvement continued to be displayed after 30 days in both the sixth and fourth grades. The data also suggest that students with learning disabilities improved their ability to compose summaries as compared to the control students.

40|$|In view of {{the fact}} that {{increased}} resistance to drugs by malaria parasites in some parts of the world may lead to increasing use of a combination of primaquine with chloroquine for chemotherapy, studies were made on the severity of the haemolytic anaemia induced by 45 mg primaquine in American Negroes with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. It was found that twice-weekly administration of primaquine induced more haemolysis than once-weekly administration, and that administration <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> for 4 weeks and twice <b>weekly</b> <b>thereafter</b> resulted in a degree of anaemia falling between those produced by the other regimens. Anaemia was not induced in controls with no G 6 PD deficiency.

40|$|Aim: This study {{compared}} the acute toxicities reported during radiotherapy treatment using either intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) {{to deliver a}} moderate hypo-fractionated treatment for early-stage prostate cancer. Material and methods: Acute toxicities are routinely reported at the clinical site for all patients using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Toxicity assessment is performed on day 1 of treatment, then <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>thereafter.</b> The recorded toxicities of 40 cases treated with five-field IMRT, and 32 cases treated using VMAT were retrospectively compared. All cases were prescribed 73. 68 Gy in 28 fractions. Eight symptoms were assessed; diarrhoea, proctitis, fatigue, pain, dermatitis, urinary frequency, urinary retention and urinary tract pain. Results: In terms of the overall toxicity recorded, VMAT was shown to reduce the toxicities of dermatitis, fatigue, pain and urinary frequency (p< 0. 05). Using IMRT, grade 2 toxicities were reported for proctitis, pain, urinary frequency, urinary retention and urinary tract pain. Using VMAT, grade 2 toxicities were reported for urinary frequency and urinary retention. Findings: The research reported {{here is one of}} the first publications to demonstrate that VMAT is associated with decreased toxicities compared with IMRT for the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|The {{immune system}} is {{characterized}} by the preferential migration of lymphocytes through specific tissues (i. e., tissue tropism). Tissue tropism is mediated, in part, by the alpha(4) integrins expressed by T lymphocytes. The alpha(4) beta(1) integrin mediates migration of memory T lymphocytes into the CNS, whereas the alpha(4) beta(7) integrin mediates migration preferentially into gastrointestinal tissue. This paradigm was established primarily from investigations in rodents; thus, the objective of this investigation was to determine if blocking the alpha(4) beta(7) integrin exclusively would affect migration of T lymphocytes into the CNS of primates. The effects of the dual alpha(4) beta(1) and alpha(4) beta(7) antagonist natalizumab were compared with those of the alpha(4) beta(7) antagonist vedolizumab on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the rhesus monkey. Animals received an initial i. v. bolus of placebo, natalizumab (30 mg/kg), or vedolizumab (30 mg/kg) before intracutaneous immunization with recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and then Ab <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>thereafter.</b> Natalizumab prevented CNS inflammation and demyelination significantly (p < 0. 05), compared with time-matched placebo control animals, whereas vedolizumab did not inhibit these effects, despite saturating the alpha(4) beta(7) integrin in each animal {{for the duration of the}} investigation. These results demonstrate that blocking alpha(4) beta(7) exclusively does not inhibit immune surveillance of the CNS in primates. The Journal of Immunology, 2013, 190 : 1961 - 1973...|$|E
40|$|Healthcare-associated infections due to cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) {{have become}} a major public health threat, {{especially}} in intensive care units (ICUs). Often acquired nosocomially, CRE can be introduced initially by patients at admission. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and genetic characteristics of CRE-intestinal carriage in ICU patients, to evaluate the rate of acquisition of these organisms during hospitalization, and to explore some of the associated risk factors for both carriage and acquisition. Between December 2014 and February 2015, the 63 patients admitted in the ICU of Charles Nicolle hospital were screened for rectal CRE colonization at admission and <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>thereafter</b> to identify acquisition. CRE fecal carriage rate was 20. 63 % (13 / 63) at admission and the acquisition rate was 42. 85 % (15 / 35). Overall, 35 CRE isolates were collected from 28 patients (25 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Escherichia coli and 3 Enterobacter cloacae strains). Seven patients were simultaneously colonized with 2 CRE isolates. CTX-M- 15 was detected {{in most of the}} CRE isolates (30 / 35, 88. 23 %). Three strains co-produced CMY- 4 and 22 strains were carbapenem-resistant and co-produced a carbapenemase OXA- 48 (n= 13) or NDM- 1 (n= 6). All isolates were multidrug resistant. Molecular typing of K. pneumoniae strains, revealed 8 Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns and 4 sequence types (ST) ST 101, ST 147, ST 429 and ST 336. However, E. coli isolates were genetically unrelated and belonged to A (n= 2), B 1 (n= 2) and B 2 (n= 3) phylogenetic groups and to ST 131 (2 strains), ST 572 (2 strains), ST 615 (one strain) and ST 617 (one strain). Five colonized patients were infected by CRE (4 with the same strain identified from their rectal swab and 1 with a different strain). Whether imported or acquired during the stay in the ICU, colonization by CRE is a major risk factor for the occurrence of serious nosocomial infections. Their systematic screening in fecal carriage is mandatory {{to prevent the spread of}} these multidrug resistant bacteria...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To assess {{change in}} patient-reported {{outcomes}} {{in subjects with}} type 2 diabetes treated with exenatide <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> compared with those treated with sitagliptin or pioglitazone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—In this 26 -week randomized, multicenter, double-dummy study, 491 subjects received 2 mg of exenatide <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> or maximum daily doses of sitagliptin (100 mg) or pioglitazone (45 mg) on a background of metformin. Weightrelated quality of life, health utility, psychological well-being, and diabetes treatment satisfaction were assessed at baseline and week 26. Mean group changes from baseline to week 26 were estimated by ANCOVA. RESULTS—Weight-related quality of life total scores improved significantly in the exenatide <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> and sitagliptin arms only; the exenatide <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> group experienced significantly greater improvement than the pioglitazone group in weight-related quality of life total scores and in several domain scores. Health utility scores improved significantly for exenatide <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> and sitagliptin groups (P, 0. 05) with {{no significant difference between}} the exenatide <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> group and either comparison group. All groups experienced significant improvements on the psychological well-being global scale and all six domain scores, with {{no significant difference between the}} exenatide <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> group and either comparator. All groups experienced significant improvements in total diabetes treatment satisfaction scores. The exenatide <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> group experienced greater improvement than the sitagliptin group in treatment satisfaction total scores. CONCLUSIONS—In combination with clinical outcomes from this study, these results indicate it is possible for patients treated with metformin to initiate exenatide therapy with potential benefits in both clinical and patient-reported outcomes. In the past decade, several new classes of medication for type 2 diabetes have been introduced, including thiazolidinediones (TZD), glucagon-like peptide agonists (GLP- 1 agonists), and dipeptidy...|$|R

40|$|Recombinant human {{erythropoietin}} (rhEPO) is used {{to treat}} anemia in chronic renal insufficiency. Erythropoietin (EPO) immunogenicity can lead to EPO-resistant anemia. Conjugating proteins with polyethylene glycol (PEG) can prolong elimination half-life and diminish protein immunogenicity. We investigated the efficacy of new erythropoietic agents, synthesized by single (Ro 50 - 3821) and multiple (MIX) integrations of PEG and succinimidyl butanoic acid with rhEPO, in rats with chronic renal insufficiency. Sprague–Dawley rats with surgically induced renal insufficiency received Ro 50 - 3821 or MIX subcutaneously (s. c.) over 4 – 12 weeks compared to rhEPO and NaCl. Hemoglobin and antibody levels served as primary efficacy and safety variables. Dosing intervals and dose–response characteristics were investigated. Ro 50 - 3821 (2. 5 [*]μg/kg <b>once</b> <b>weekly)</b> increased hemoglobin levels by 7 [*]g/dl after 4 weeks compared to 1 [*]g/dl in NaCl controls (P< 0. 05). MIX (2. 5 [*]μg/kg <b>once</b> <b>weekly)</b> and rhEPO (0. 25 [*]μg/kg three times weekly) increased hemoglobin levels by 3 [*]g/dl. Ro 50 - 3821 administered for 12 weeks (0. 75 [*]μg/kg <b>once</b> <b>weekly)</b> increased hemoglobin levels (from 13 to 19 [*]g/dl) more effectively than rhEPO (0. 75 [*]μg/kg <b>once</b> <b>weekly,</b> decline from 13 to 11 [*]g/dl, P< 0. 05). No antibodies against Ro 50 - 3821 were detected after 12 weeks of treatment. Antibodies against rhEPO were seen in 69 % of animals (P< 0. 00001). Ro 50 - 3821 increased hemoglobin levels with <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> s. c. dosing. Multiple pegylated EPO is less effective. In rats, rhEPO failed to increase hemoglobin levels with <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> long-term dosing. Antibody formation following rhEPO may explain this finding. Therefore, Ro 50 - 3821 may provide important clinical advantages compared to unpegylated EPO. It can be administered in longer dosing intervals and has a lower risk of unfavorable immunological responses...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: <b>Once</b> <b>weekly</b> dosing of alendronate {{has been}} shown to provide {{equivalent}} efficacy to once daily dosing for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Whether patients will prefer weekly dosing to daily dosing for a chronic condition such as osteoporosis has not been studied. The aim of this international study was to assess preference for the weekly or daily dosing regimen of alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Methods: This randomised open-label crossover study was conducted at 45 study sites in 19 countries. Four hundred and six postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were assigned randomly to treatment with either alendronate 70 mg <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> for 4 weeks followed by alendronate 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks or vice versa. The main outcome was the responses of the participants to the Dosing Regimen Questionnaire administered {{at the end of the}} study. Results: Of the participants expressing a preference, 84 % preferred the <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> dosing regimen with alendronate to the once daily dosing regimen. In addition, the <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> regimen was considered by 87 % of the participants to be more convenient and was the regimen most of the participants (84 %) would be more willing to take for a long period of time (P< 0. 001 for each parameter). Conclusions: The majority of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis preferred the <b>once</b> <b>weekly</b> to the <b>once</b> daily dosing regimen of alendronate. Physicians should consider patient preference for dosing regimen when selecting the appropriate treatment for osteoporosis. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
