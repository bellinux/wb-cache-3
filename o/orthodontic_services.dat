The {{aim of this study}} was to present the most frequently used occlusal indices in orthodontic practice and to determine their reliability when applied to dental models. Material and Methods. Three occlusal indices were selected for analysis: the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN), the Peer Assessment Rating Index (PAR) and the Index of Complexity, Outcome and Need (ICON). Twenty dental models of patients referred to Department of Orthodontics, School of Dentistry, Belgrade, with malocclusions of different type and severity were used in this study. All dental models were measured by three afore mentioned indices twice, two months apart, in order to determine intraexaminer reliability. Results. The results showed that three indices had good reliability. Weighted Kappa was calculated for IOTN (0. 72 and 0. 79 for the aesthetic and the dental health component, respectively) and root mean square error was calculated for PAR and ICON (2. 1 and 4. 5, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in scores between two measurements of these two indices (p< 0. 01). Conclusion.

40|$|Background: Due to {{numerous}} difficulties in patients suffering from varieties of cleft lip and palate, their therapeutic management involves interdisciplinary teamwork. This {{study was conducted}} to compare the age of commencing treatments such as speech therapy, secondary palate and alveolar bone grafting and orthodontics between those who sought treatment early and late. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 260 files of patients with cleft lip and palate based on their age at the time of admission to a cleft care team were divided into two groups: The early admission and late admission. Both groups compared based on four variables including the mean age of beginning speech therapy, palatal secondary surgery, alveolar bone grafting, and receiving orthodontics using t-test. Results : Based on the results, among 134 patients admitted for speech therapy, the mean age of initiating speech therapy in early clients was 3. 3 years, and in the late ones was 9 years. Among 47 patients with secondary surgery, the mean age in early clients was 3. 88 years, and in the late clients was 15. 7 years.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment need in 13 – 18 -year-old schoolchildren of Nalagarh, Himachal Pradesh, India using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment need (IOTN) and to analyze the treatment needs between males and females and correlation between the esthetic component (AC) and dental health component (DHC) of IOTN. Subjects and Methods: The sample comprised 2000 school children (1125 females and 875 males) who had not undergone orthodontic treatment. No radiographs, study casts, were used; IOTN was calculated from clinical examination. Results: DHC results showed that little need for orthodontic treatment was found in 31. 6 % and moderate need in 30. 85 %. A great need was estimated at 37. 55 %. Severe contact point displacement of more than 4 mm was the most common occlusal feature in the definite treatment need group, followed by increased overjet, impeded eruption of teeth, and anterior or posterior cross bite. AC results showed that little need for orthodontic treatment was in 86. 15 %, moderate need in 8. 90 %, and great need in 4. 95 %. Limitations: Index does not consider midline discrepancy, soft tissue abnormalities, and AC does not include Class III and Class II div 2 malocclusion photographs.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to analyse {{orthodontic}} care in Finnish health centres with special reference to the delivery, outcome and costs of treatment. Public orthodontic care was studied by two questionnaires sent to the chief dental officers of all health centres (n = 276) and to all specialist orthodontists in Finland (n = 146). The large regional variation was mentioned by the orthodontists as the most important factor requiring improvement. Orthodontic practices and outcome were studied in eight Finnish municipal health centres representing early and late timing of treatment. A random sample of 16 - and 18 -year-olds (n = 1109) living in these municipalities was examined for acceptability of occlusion with the Occlusal Morphology and Function Index (OMFI). In acceptability of occlusion, only minor differences were found between the two timing groups. The percentage of subjects with acceptable morphology was higher among untreated than among treated adolescents. The costs of orthodontic care were estimated among the adolescents with a treatment history. The mean appliance costs were higher in the late, and the mean visit costs higher in the early timing group. The cost-effectiveness of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>services</b> differed among the health centres, but was almost equal in the two timing groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Variation in {{dental service}} {{provision}} over {{time has been}} related to changes in factors such as oral health and demographics. Dentist factors such as age and cohort effects are also potential sources of influence. The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the operation of age, period, and cohort factors on variation in service rates. BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: data were collected by a mailed survey of a random sample of 10 % of male and 40 % of female dentists from each state/territory of Australia in 1983 - 84, 1988 - 89. and 1993 - 94 with response rates of 73, 75 and 74 % respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on main areas of service were obtained from a log of service items provided on a typical day. RESULTS: Poisson regressions of rates for the 10 main areas of service over time showed increased rates over the study period for diagnostic, preventive, endodontic, crown and bridge, general/miscellaneous and <b>orthodontic</b> <b>services,</b> and decreased rates of prosthodontic services. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that models for periodontal and endodontic services had a good fit. However, only endodontic services were readily interpretable in terms of descriptive trends. While the age-period-cohort model was preferred, age-period and age-cohort models were also examined because of problems of identification with age-period-cohort models. Endodontic rates were higher among younger dentist birth cohorts, and increased over the 10 -year study period for most cohorts of dentists. CONCLUSIONS: If these effects for dentist cohorts were extrapolated over the next 10 -year interval, the distribution of services would alter, with endodontic services emerging as a dominant area behind restorative, diagnostic, and preventive services...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : With the {{observed}} increase {{in number of}} Indian patients seeking orthodontic treatment, a number of investigators have reported on the prevalence of malocclusion and need for orthodontic treatment. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the pattern of malocclusion and dentofacial characteristics among the patient population, who were presented for orthodontic treatment at a tertiary care dental establishment, providing free treatment. Materials and methods: All patients aged 7 years and above who visited the Division of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, of a tertiary care dental establishment for orthodontic consultation and orthodontic patients presently undergoing orthodontic treatment, were included in the study. Pretreatment orthodontic records of a total of 688 patients were obtained. Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics were calculated to find the means and standard deviations. Chi-square tests were used to determine the possible gender differences and to find the association between the skeletal and Angle′s Classes. The dental health component (DHC) of the index of orthodontic treatment need (IOTN) was determined to obtain an idea of the distribution of the IOTN grades. Results and conclusion: Prevalence of malocclusion was found to be 86. 5 % with Angle′s Class I malocclusion being more prevalent as compared to the other types of malocclusion. Increased overjet in 81. 5 % of subjects was the major occlusal finding. This study has tried to highlight a number of factors which play an important role in making the decision to start orthodontic treatment and may provide a base line data for planning <b>orthodontic</b> <b>services</b> to policy makers and orthodontists with implications on the provision of care and the use of limited resources...|$|E
40|$|Measuring the {{prevalence}} of malocclusion and treatment need in a population is useful for the planning of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>services.</b> In addition, knowledge concerning the attitudes of patients to malocclusion is becoming increasingly important in orthodontics. Without a satisfactory estimate of the need and demand for treatment {{it is difficult to}} develop and organize a meaningful service. The aims of this investigation were to estimate the need for orthodontic treatment in 12 – 13 ?year?old school children in urban and rural schools in Latvia. Five hundred and four school children aged 12 – 13 years were examined using the Index of Complexity, Outcome and Need (ICON). The children were invited to complete a questionnaire about treatment need and their appearance. The survey was carried out in four urban and five rural school settings. There were no statistically significant differences in treatment need between rural and urban settings or between boys and girls. However, there was a difference in ICON scores between Riga and Daugavpils, with a greater need for treatment in Daugavpils. Individual responses to questionnaires illustrated a correlation between individuals who expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangement of their teeth and treatment need according to the ICON score. The overall prevalence of individuals needing orthodontic treatment in Latvia was 35. 3 per cent, but this figure masked considerable variation between schools. For example, a greater need was found in Daugavpils than in Riga. This difference is not fully explained but could be due to genetics, the individuals in Daugavpils being mainly of Russian origin. The individuals' perception of the arrangement of teeth and the need for treatment correlated significantly with the ICON score...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Evaluation of self {{perceived}} and actual need for orthodontic treatment helps in planning <b>orthodontic</b> <b>services</b> and estimating the required resources and man power. In the present study, the perceptive need as evaluated by patients {{and the actual}} need to orthodontic treatment, as assessed by orthodontists, were evaluated at two types of dental practices {{in the city of}} Jeddah using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). Methods A consecutive sample of 743 adults seeking orthodontic treatment at two different types of dental practices in Jeddah; King Abdulaziz University, Faculty of Dentistry (KAAU) (Free treatment) and two private dental polyclinics (PDP) (Paid treatment), was examined for orthodontic treatment need using the dental health component (DHC) of the IOTN. The self-perceived need for orthodontic treatment was also determined using the aesthetic component (AC) of the IOTN. The IOTN score and the incidence of each variable were calculated statistically. AC and DHC categories were compared using the Chi-Square and a correlation between them was assessed using Spearman's correlation test. AC and DHC were also compared between the two types of dental practices using the Chi-Square. Results The results revealed that among the 743 patients studied, 60. 6 % expressed no or slight need for treatment, 23. 3 % expressed moderate to borderline need and only 16. 1 % thought they needed orthodontic treatment. Comparing these estimates to professional judgments, only 15. 2 % conformed to little or no need for treatment, 13. 2 % were assessed as in borderline need and 71. 6 % were assessed as in need for treatment (p Conclusion Patient's perception to orthodontic treatment does not always correlate with professional assessment. The IOTN is a valid screening tool that should be used in orthodontic clinics for better services especially, in health centers that provide free treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Orthodontic {{treatment}} {{being provided}} by pediatric dentists and general practitioners in Indiana was investigated. A two page questionnaire {{constructed by the}} investigator was used to gather the data. The study sample consisted of 571 dentists. All 71 Indiana pediatric dentists primarily in private practice were surveyed. General practitioners (500) were chosen {{on the basis of}} age, year of graduation from dental school, geographic location and size of community in which they practiced. Seventy-eight percent of the questionnaires were returned; of this total, 93 percent of the pediatric dentists and 77 percent of the general practitioners responded. The study showed that currently in Indiana 62 percent of the pediatric dentists and 17. 9 percent of the general practitioners surveyed provided comprehensive orthodontic treatment. These results are much higher than results of previous surveys of pediatric dentists and general practitioners. The study also found that pediatric dentists provide significantly more comprehensive orthodontic treatment and spend significantly more time providing orthodontic treatment than do general practitioners. Age of practitioner was found not to significantly affect the percentage of time spent providing orthodontic treatment, the orthodontic conditions treated or the type of appliances and techniques used. Population of the community in which the practice was located did have a significant effect. Practitioners in communities of over 100, 000 provided significantly less comprehensive orthodontic treatment. Practitioners who practiced in communities of 5, 000 - 25, 000 spent significantly more time providing <b>orthodontic</b> <b>services.</b> Sixty-three percent of the practitioners surveyed had taken some type of continuing education course in orthodontics. An overwhelming majority of practitioners (over 90 percent) stated that their undergraduate orthodontic training in dental school inadequately prepared them for private practice. The majority of pediatric dentists (78 percent) also stated that their postgraduate education instruction in orthodontics was inadequate...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM:Estimation of {{need and}} demand for {{orthodontic}} treatment is important for both healthprofessionals and health policymakers. Need assessment is traditionally done using experts’ opinions;however, patient-centered evaluation can provide a bigger picture ofpatient’s esthetic and psychological needs. The willingness to pay(WTP) technique is a potentially valid tool for assessing the patient views on their needs and for market research inhealthcare. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the need anddemand for orthodontic treatment with a patient-centeredapproach using economic analysis. METHODS:A cross-sectional study was designed. Two hundred people attending Shiraz Dental School Clinic wereinterviewed. Their views on the importance and costs of orthodontic treatments and the maximum amountthat theywould pay for such treatments were obtained along with their demographic and socioeconomic factors. Their WTP wasused to elicit values for orthodontic treatment using contingent valuation method (CVM) and econometric techniques. RESULTS:The response rate was 95 %. Although 53. 5 % of respondents felt they needed orthodontic treatment, only 33. 7 % had expressed their need, and just 17. 5 % hadactually gone for such treatment. The main reason for not takingthe treatment was its cost (56. 5 %). More than 60 % of respondents viewed orthodontics as only a luxurytreatment and 70 % considered beauty and elegant smile as the most, or one of the most, benefit(s) of orthodontic treatments. WTPresults showed that <b>orthodontic</b> <b>services</b> have highdemand elasticity. Assuming fixed monthly income of 8 millionRials, 61 % of subjects were ready to pay 20 millionRials for a course of orthodontic treatment. CONCLUSIONS:The result showed that esthetics and high cost of treatment were respectively the most intriguing andthemain inhibiting factors for getting orthodontic treatment. Economic evaluation showed a high elastic estimation fororthodontic treatment...|$|E
