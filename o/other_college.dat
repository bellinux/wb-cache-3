5|$|The Stanford rugby {{teams of}} 1906 to 1917 {{represented}} Stanford University as the school's only football program during those years, replacing American football with rugby union.

Stanford played twelve seasons of rugby, during which it played <b>other</b> <b>college</b> teams, club teams from the United States, Canada, and Australia, {{as well as the}} New Zealand national team and Australia national team. Despite the team's success, it became clear that other schools were not adopting rugby in large numbers, and after rival California returned to football in 1915, Stanford faced a limited number of potential opponents; and after a year of playing neither sport officially due to World War I, the school returned to American football in 1919.|$|E
