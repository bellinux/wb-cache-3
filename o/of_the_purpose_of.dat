5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one {{purpose is to}} attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of American {{intervention in the}} Middle East, Lynch has made twelve trips to Iraq {{and a total of}} ten trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> these visits was to ensure accountability in reconstruction projects. He voted for the Iraq War authorization in 2002, against the Democratic House leadership, and later voted to continue funding the war. He has since supported Obama's drawdown of troops in Iraq throughout 2010 and 2011. He also supports Obama's renewal of the War in Afghanistan, and was the only Massachusetts representative to vote for funding for Obama's Afghanistan initiative. Lynch voted for increased foreign aid to Pakistan in 2009, but along with Oversight Chairman John F. Tierney, he pushed for strict oversight of the aid's distribution.|$|E

Workers were recruited in the Knoxville area. The typical recruit was a young woman, a recent graduate of a local high school. Training was initially conducted at the University of Tennessee. Training switched to Berkeley from April to September 1943, where it {{was conducted on the}} XA calutron and a 1:16 scale model of the Alpha racetrack, and then to Oak Ridge when the XAX calutron became available. Some 2,500 operators would be required once all the Alpha II calutrons were available. The Tennessee Eastman payroll at Y-12 ballooned from 10,000 in mid-1944 to 25,000 in mid-1945. For security reasons, the trainees were not informed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the equipment they were taught to operate.|$|E

5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with a consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> one's life and {{the relationship with the}} rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E
5|$|The local land {{assemblies}} (Sejmiks) {{refused to}} elect deputies to the Sejm, and after great difficulties {{less than half}} of the regular number of representatives came to attend the session led by Marshals of the Sejm, Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł and Adam Poniński; the latter in particular was one of many Polish nobles bribed by the Russians and following their orders. This sejm became known as the Partition Sejm. In order to prevent the disruption of the Sejm via liberum veto and the defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the invaders, Poniński undertook to turn the regular Sejm into a confederated sejm, where majority rule prevailed. In spite of the efforts of individuals like Tadeusz Rejtan, Samuel Korsak, and Stanisław Bohuszewicz to prevent it, the deed was accomplished with the aid of Poniński, Radziwiłł, and the bishops Andrzej Młodziejowski, Ignacy Jakub Massalski, and Antoni Kazimierz Ostrowski (primate of Poland), who occupied high positions in the Senate of Poland. The Sejm elected a committee of thirty to deal with the various matters presented. On September 18, 1773, the committee signed the treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the lost territories.|$|E

25|$|A {{study by}} Auburn Barron-Lutzross showed no {{correlation}} between sexual identity and any phonetic variables, but did show that speakers' self-assessed “familiarity with queer culture” had a statistically significant correlation with phonetic variation. Higher familiarity with queer culture was correlated with lower median pitch and faster rate of speech. However, this correlation existed most strongly for straight women, less so for bisexual women, {{and not at all}} for lesbian women. Barron-Lutzross theorized that because lesbians are stereotyped as having a lower mean pitch, the straight women may have been attempting to express their affinity with queer people by adopting a lower pitch, because of their awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the study.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps a {{more typical}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> Restoration {{revisions}} is Davenant's The Law Against Lovers, a 1662 comedy combining the main plot of Measure for Measure with subplot of Much Ado About Nothing. The {{result is a}} snapshot of Restoration comic tastes. Beatrice and Benedick are brought in to parallel Claudio and Hero; the emphasis throughout is on witty conversation, and Shakespeare's thematic focus on lust is steadily downplayed. The play ends with three marriages: Benedick's to Beatrice, Claudio's to Hero, and Isabella's to an Angelo whose attempt on Isabella's virtue was a ploy. Davenant wrote many of the bridging scenes and recast much of Shakespeare's verse as heroic couplets.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> this {{investigation}} was to describe tenth grade students' views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> geometric proof within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> their learning. Classroom observations, the curriculum, assessment tools, journal questions, and a preconceptions questionnaire were used to provide context for the views expressed by students from a single classroom. Eleven classroom episodes selected from the classroom observations were {{used to describe the}} instructional context as well as discourse among the students during group work. The episodes provided details about how and when the classroom teacher addressed various <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> proofs involving geometry concepts throughout two instructional units on coordinate geometry proofs and two-column proofs. The episodes also consisted of student discourse relating to <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> geometric proof as students worked on assigned proof problems. The students' views were examined through journal questions given at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> selected days and through a post-instruction questionnaire and individual interviews. There were three main findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study. First, several students experienced difficulty in expressing their views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> geometric proof when asked directly. One-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students could only list properties or theorems they encountered during the unit on geometric proof. However, when these students were asked to describe <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> for each column, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students listed both explanation and verification. Second, the students expressed limited views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> proof, referring mainly to verification. Only a few students mentioned explanation, systematization, and communication. However, students generally referred to at least two <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> proof (explanation, verification, and communication) when describing the proving process involved in coordinate geometry. Third, <b>the</b> students' views <b>of</b> various <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> geometric proof were diverse. Recommendations for future research include <b>the</b> examination <b>of</b> students' views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> geometric proofs for students who use paragraph form and studies to investigate <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> students' views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> proof as they gain more experience with formal proof writing and other methods of proof...|$|R

Camp authorities told them that since the charges against their clients had been dropped, while the Department of Justice figured out where to charge them, they no longer needed legal counsel.
