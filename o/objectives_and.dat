5|$|On 27 March, {{the entire}} brigade {{participated in a}} general Allied {{offensive}} aimed at {{taking control of the}} area around Tamera. 1st and 2nd Parachute Battalions launched an attack at 23:00 the same day, taking numerous prisoners and securing their <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> then repulsed a German counterattack, albeit with heavy losses. Further heavy and often confusing fighting continued, with several companies of 3rd Parachute Battalion having to be attached to 2nd Parachute Battalion to reinforce it. 1st Parachute Battalion also seized its own <b>objectives,</b> <b>and</b> by the end of 29 March the brigade had secured all of its <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> taken 770 German and Italian troops as prisoners. On 31 March the brigade then took up positions covering the left flank of 46th Division, and {{for the next two weeks}} it remained in the area, conducting numerous patrols but encountering little opposition. On 15 March the brigade was relieved by 39 US Regimental Combat Team and moved to the rear. It then travelled to Algiers on 18 April and remained there; Brigadier Flavell left for England to take up a new command, and was replaced by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury. Shortly afterwards the brigade rejoined 1st Airborne Division and began training for the airborne landings that would take place during Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects.

Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} from The Two Towers is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete <b>objectives,</b> <b>and</b> use environmental objects as weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E

5|$|After the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Allies {{initiated}} several {{operations against}} Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces {{were sent to}} eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians. Soon after, the U.S., with support from Australian and New Zealand forces, began major operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these <b>objectives,</b> <b>and</b> had also neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands. In April, the Allies launched an operation to retake Western New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} {{out of the}} line, the {{division}} attacked the Hindenburg Line itself on 29 September, easily achieving its <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> capturing 1,000 prisoners. With the New Zealanders on the St. Quentin Canal and the adjacent Scheldt River, a platoon had managed to cross it and reach the village of Crèvecœur. However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of the war for the New Zealand Division, for his efforts in relaying messages between his companions and his company commander. He also defused demolition charges on the bridge spanning the Scheldt River.|$|E

5|$|Due to Muhammad's rushed actions, Ibrahim {{failed to}} {{co-ordinate}} his own uprising with his brother's, and only declared himself {{two weeks before}} Muhammad's death, on 23 November. Ibrahim's revolt at first met with quick success, securing control over Ahwaz, Fars and Wasit, and his army register (diwan) was said to number 100,000 names. When the news of Muhammad's death arrived, the rebels acclaimed Ibrahim as his successor. Ibrahim now {{was faced with a}} choice: a group of dedicated Alid supporters, which had managed to escape from Kufa, urged him to march on the city, while the Basrans preferred to stay in place and reach a negotiated settlement. This dissension is indicative of the disparate nature of Ibrahim's supporters. The Alid cause was fractured into several competing groups with different political <b>objectives,</b> <b>and</b> Ibrahim represented the Hasanid branch only. The Husaynids refused to take part in an uprising, while Ibrahim quarrelled with the Zaydi branch on everything from political <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> leadership to the tactics to be followed or the provisioning of their troops. Elsewhere, support for the uprising was cautious and most Alid supporters adopted a wait-and-see attitude, limiting themselves to verbal support or contributions of money.|$|E
