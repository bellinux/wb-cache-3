5|$|All {{significant}} Flemish {{political parties}} {{were reluctant to}} enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The Court of Appeal in Ghent in April 2004 ruled {{that some of the}} party's organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang. By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> of the Flemish electorate, as well as being {{one of the most successful}} radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.|$|E

5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{continued}} to be particularly strong in and around Antwerp, where it received as much as 33% {{of the vote in}} the 2000 local elections. In 2001, the party was forced to alter its political program, as according to the laws for party financing, it was not compatible with the European Treaty on Human Rights. In the 2004 Flemish Parliament election, the party finally became the single largest party group in parliament. The party was invited by the formateur for government discussions, only to find that its differences with the other parties was insurmountable, resulting in the three traditional parties forming a majority government, retaining the cordon sanitaire. By this time, the party had nevertheless become the very most popular Flemish party in Belgium, being supported by about <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> of the Flemish electorate.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{breakage}} {{is related}} to a carnivore's behavior. A study of nine modern carnivores found that <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> adults had suffered tooth breakage and that half of these breakages were of the canine teeth. The most breakage occurred in the spotted hyena that consumes all of its prey including the bone; the least breakage occurred in the African wild dog, and the gray wolf ranked in between these two. The eating of bone {{increases the risk of}} accidental fracture due to the relatively high, unpredictable stresses that it creates. The most commonly broken teeth are the canines, followed by the premolars, carnassial molars, and incisors. Canines are the teeth most likely to break because of their shape and function, which subjects them to bending stresses that are unpredictable in both direction and magnitude. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when killing large prey.|$|E
