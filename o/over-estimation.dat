5|$|Early on the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, March1, at 1:08pm CST (19:08 UTC), a destructive tornado first developed near the Enterprise Municipal Airport. The tornado lifted off the ground briefly before returning to the ground as an even stronger storm. It quickly slammed into Enterprise, Alabama, at 1:12pm CST (19:12 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large section of the city. The most severe damage took place at Enterprise High School, where a section of the school was destroyed {{during the middle of the}} school day. Eight students were killed at the school and 50 other people were taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an <b>over-estimation.</b> It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the Grand Isle, Louisiana tornado in 1993, and the deadliest tornado-related school disaster since one in Belvidere, Illinois in 1967. One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when a woman's living room window was shattered by the tornado.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To report {{possible}} erroneous {{estimates of}} diffusion parameters in the twice-refocused spin-echo (TRSE) technique, proposed to eliminate eddy-current-induced geometric distortions in diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging, when stimulated echo signals are inappropriately included. Materials and Methods: Eleven subjects were included for imaging experiments on two 1. 5 Tesla systems using the TRSE sequence. Three versions, two with unbalanced crusher gradients inserted to dephase the stimulated echo from the b = 0 images {{and one with}} balanced crusher gradients, were implemented. The apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived and compared. Results: The ADCs obtained with unbalanced crusher gradients were closer to values reported in the literature. Stimulated echo led to ADC <b>over-estimations</b> by 34. 2 %, 50. 4 %, 54. 0 %, 51. 5 %, 24. 0 %, and 41. 9 % in the genu of corpus callosum, splenium of corpus callosum, bilateral corona radiata, internal capsule, mediofrontal gyrus, and the cuneus, respectively (P < 0. 01), with concomitant reduction in FA in highly anisotropic regions. <b>Over-estimations</b> of diffusion coefficients {{were found to be}} roughly equal along all directions. Conclusion: Formation of stimulated echo in the TRSE technique can lead to erroneous estimations of the diffusion parameters, even if no prominent morphological artifacts are seen. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

For a simple one-bay structural steel frame, we survey typical uncertainties and compute an interval solution for displacements and forces.

30|$|Let us {{consider}} the accuracy validation of ML models for prediction. Usually, this accuracy validation undergoes an error analysis that computes {{the difference between}} the actual and predicted values. Recall, a prediction is an outcome of ML models for classification and regression problems. In classification, the common metrics for error analysis are based on the logistic function, such as binary and categorical cross-entropy—for binary and multi-class classification, respectively. In regression, the conventional error metrics are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Both regression error metrics disregard the direction of under- and <b>over-estimations</b> in the predictions. MAE is simpler and easier to interpret than MSE, though MSE is more useful for heavily penalizing large errors.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose novel and more {{realistic}} analytical models for {{the determination of the}} peak demand under four power demand control scenarios. Each scenario considers a finite number of appliances installed in a residential area, with diverse power demands and different arrival rates of power requests. We develop recursive formulas for the efficient calculation of the peak demand under each scenario, which take into account the finite population of the appliances. Moreover, we associate each scenario with a proper real-time pricing process in order to derive the social welfare. The proposed analysis is validated through simulations. Moreover, the performance evaluation of the proposed formulas reveals that the absence of the assumption of finite number of appliances could lead to serious peak-demand <b>over-estimations...</b>|$|R
30|$|Increased rigor in {{thinking}} about the competition among wildlife and livestock not only leads to the identification of important areas for further research (areas of uncertainty), but also reveals areas of relative certainty to guide policy particularly related to wildlife protection and management. Contrary to popular impression, {{the presence or absence}} of dietary or habitat overlap is insufficient to claim competition between livestock or wildlife. Such arguments provide little room for mutually beneficial use of common rangeland resources by wildlife and livestock for which there is historical and contemporary evidence (Homewood and Rodgers 1987; Little 1996). Such thinking not only leads to <b>over-estimations</b> of competition, but also leads to land-use decisions that exclude grazing wildlife from pasturelands or livestock from protected areas - decisions that will increase the vulnerability of the whole wildlife–livestock–grassland system.|$|R
40|$|Wetlands are {{important}} to the environment because they perform many hydrologic and chemical “cleansing” functions and provide habitat for a variety of plant and animal lifeforms. It seems essential to measure and to monitor the variable proportions of open standing water versus emergent macrophyte vegetation, to more effectively monitor environmental change, to better model its contribution to greenhouse gas production and to improve the accuracy of landcover classifications of wetland communities involving digital aircraft or satellite data. ^ The research focused on using both close-range spectral and satellite image data to innovate new methods to delineate emergent macrophyte vegetation within a water background. ^ The close-range experiments investigated the relationship between close-range, hyperspectral and broad, multi-band reflectance patterns and their derivatives associated with varying densities of selected species of potted emergent macrophyte vegetation over a water surface. The magnitude of the near infrared reflectance in both the hyperspectral and multi-band data was found to be profoundly affected by the presence of water beneath the plant canopy. Hyperspectral derivative spectra near 720 nm and multi-band derivative spectra centered near 745 nm were both found to be highly correlated to changing percent cover. A hyperspectral reflectance ratio composed of a NIR band divided by a red light band and two, broad-band, NDVI-based models and a broad-band NIR/RED reflectance ratio were also compared to percent cover of plant canopies and were shown to be very useful in delineating sparse stands of emergent macrophyte vegetation in a water background. ^ Satellite image data of a portion of the western Nebraska Sandhills (containing several freshwater wetland communities) were used in an unsupervised classification program (ISODATA) to determine how to best delineate emergent vegetation from a water background. In general, the unsupervised classification of first derivative bands best delineated emergent macrophyte vegetation from other aquatic and terrestrial classes, regardless of the values of selected user-defined program inputs. Using only reflectance data resulted in <b>over-estimations</b> of open water and possible <b>over-estimations</b> of certain emergent vegetation communities. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} pilot study, an {{optimized}} LOPAP in-strument (LOng Path Absorption Photometer) for the detec-tion of nitrous acid (HONO) {{in the atmosphere}} (DL 0. 2 pptV) was tested at the high alpine research station Jungfraujoch at 3580 m altitude in the Swiss Alps under conditions compa-rable to polar regions. HONO concentrations in the range < 0. 5 – 50 pptV {{with an average of}} 7. 5 pptV were observed at the Jungfraujoch. The diurnal profiles obtained exhibited clear maxima at noon and minima with very low concentra-tion during the night supporting the proposed photochemical production of HONO. In good agreement with recent mea-surements at the South Pole, it was demonstrated, that in-terferences of chemical HONO instruments can significantly influence the measurements and lead to considerable <b>over-estimations,</b> especially for low pollution level. Accordingly, the active correction of interferences is of paramount impor-tance for the determination of reliable HONO data. ...|$|R

Two case studies indicate the feasibility of these analyses and show that a classical reliability analysis for confused GSPNs may lead to significant <b>over-estimations</b> of the true probabilities.

40|$|A {{long-lasting}} endeavor in {{the area}} of software project management is minimizing the risks caused by under- or <b>over-estimations</b> of the overall effort required to build new software systems. Deciding which method to use for achieving accurate cost estimations among the many methods proposed in the relevant literature is a significant issue for project managers. This paper investigates whether it is possible to improve the accuracy of estimations produced by popular non-parametric techniques by coupling them with a linear component, thus producing a new set of techniques called semi-parametric models (SPMs). The non-parametric models examined in this work include estimation by analogy (EbA), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and locally weighted regression (LOESS). Our experimentation shows that the estimation ability of SPMs is superior to their non-parametric counterparts, especially in cases where both a linear and non-linear relationship exists between software effort and the related cost drivers. The proposed approach is empirically validated through a statistical framework which uses multiple comparisons to rank and cluster the models examined in non-overlapping groups performing significantly different...|$|R
