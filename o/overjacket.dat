50|$|A genuine marinière has, {{front and}} back, twenty navy blue stripes each 10 mm wide, spaced 20 mm apart, {{and on the}} sleeves {{fourteen}} navy blue stripes spaced the same.

40|$|A. Heating cables {{shall be}} self regulating, {{such that they}} vary their output in {{response}} to temperature variations {{along the length of}} a traced pipe. Heating cable to be used for a given application shall be based on the design and operating environment requirements. The following self-regulating heating cables are approved: 1. Self-regulating heating cable design shall be capable of maintaining process temperatures up to 150 º F (65 º) and continuous exposure to temperatures of 185 º (85 º) while de-energized. JULY 2012 UCB STANDARDS 16121 - 12. Cable must be capable of being cut to a desired length to suit the installation conditions and must form a continuous heating circuit. 3. The heating cable shall consist of two parallel 16 AWG (minimum) nickel-plated copper bus wires embedded in a semi-conductive polymer core that forms a continuous matrix heating element. A polyethylene dielectric insulating jacket is extruded over the heating element core. 4. A metallic braid of tinned copper shall cover the basic cable. The braid shall provide a nominal coverage of 80 %. 5. The cable shall be further covered with a polyolefin <b>overjacket.</b> 6. Long-term stability shall be established by the service life performance test per IEEE Std 515. 1...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Overjacketing</b> {{extrusion}} is a coating process, {{in which}} individual bare wires or bundles of pre-coated wires are {{coated with a}} layer of insulating polymer. A wide variety of materials may be used, depending on the specific application. For many applications, such as [...] insulated cables, the polymer should be a good insulator, flexible, and wear resistant.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two major}} types of dies used in <b>overjacketing</b> extrusion, both based on an overall {{crosshead}} design. Regardless of die type used, the polymer melt is often extruded at a rate less {{than the speed of}} the bare wire that is drawn through the die, typically on the order of 1-4 times the speed of the melt. This causes the polymer jacket to extend, thin, and tighten around the central wire, increasing adhesion of the new layer.|$|R
50|$|Co{{extrusion}} is the extrusion {{of multiple}} layers of material simultaneously. This type of extrusion utilizes two or more extruders to melt and deliver a steady volumetric throughput of different viscous plastics to a single extrusion head (die) which will extrude the materials in the desired form. This technology is used {{on any of the}} processes described above (blown film, <b>overjacketing,</b> tubing, sheet). The layer thicknesses are controlled by the relative speeds and sizes of the individual extruders delivering the materials.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I will review recent work at Southampton on tapered single mode optical fibre devices. In {{particular}} I will describe our recent work on single mode beam expanders and fused fibre couplers. It {{is well known}} that a gap of up to 100 µm in a single mode fibre results in about 1 dB loss. By tapering the fibre so that the field expands into an LP cladding mode with increased spot size it is possible to introduce a larger gap of about one mm. This will allow the insertion of small electro-optic devices, such as a liquid crystal cell. By <b>overjacketing</b> the fibre with a silica capillary, or combination of Vycor and silica capillaries {{it should be possible to}} achieve a beam diameter of several hundred microns. This would allow a gap of about 1 cm and this would allow the insertion of a very wide range of optical devices, such as acousto optic modulators. Considerable progress has been made recently in the fabrication and analysis of long fused-taper 4 -port directional couplers. This has resulted in several important devices, including polarization beam splitters, wavelength division multiplexers, optical fibre filters, and wavelength selective ring resonator...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{exploitation}} of the beam-expanding properties of tapers in single-mode fibres and {{on the development of}} a new and versatile approach to fibre polishing. A theoretical study of the fused-taper coupler explains the differences in coupling and polarisation characteristics of strongly-fused and weakly-fused couplers in terms of the difference in tunnelling capability of TE and TM polarised waves. A study of the application of glass capillary <b>overjackets</b> in the production of stable taper-based devices resulted in the realisation of the first practical tapered beam-expander for single-mode fibres and a class of couplers in which cut-off of the LP 11 mode of the composite waveguide comprising the coupler waist induced a flattening of the wavelength characteristics of splitting ratio. The operational principles and fabrication of a single-mode fibre beam-splitter is described. This new device which operates as a LP 01 mode transformer exhibits wavelength independent 50 : 50 power splitting. A new polishing technique in which the optical fibre is polished on a motor driven polishing wheel is reported. The polishing can be completed in less than ten minutes and polished lengths of up to 40 mm are easily attainable. The technique was successfully applied to the construction of spectrally broad fibre polarisers...|$|R
