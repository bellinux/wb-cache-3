Using aerogel blankets as <b>insulation</b> <b>material</b> in a wall means replacement of existing <b>insulation</b> <b>material.</b> When a material in a building component is replaced in order to improve a specific performance, it is important to verify the influence of the other functional requirement of the wall such as fire performance.

In order to achieve this aim, experiments and numerical simulations were carried out. First, two wall models using aerogel blankets as <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> were designed.

The investigation for a Mach 5 flight shows {{that a combination of}} foam and fully load-bearing aerogel blanket leads to the lightest tank, with a gravimetric efficiency of 73 %. If the aerogel blanket cannot be strengthened sufficiently so that it can bear the full load, then a combination of foam and fibrous insulation materials gives the best solution with a gravimetric efficiency of 70. 3 %.

40|$|To {{enable the}} next {{generation}} subsea boosting and processing facilities, high power electrical connectors are strongly needed and {{considered one of the}} most critical components of the system. Electrical tree growth is a precursor to electrical breakdown in high voltage insulation materials. Therefore, the study of the tree growth dependency with hydrostatic pressure is needed to understand the behaviour of the insulation material used in subsea connectors. Silicone rubber (SiR) is used as an insulation material for these applications thanks to its higher viscosity characteristic in comparison with other solid insulation materials used in subsea cables. This property is the main factor that allows the water to be swiped off the connector when a receptacle is mated into the plug of a subsea connector. In addition, the silicone rubber must provide similar electric field control as <b>other</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> used in cable terminations and connectors. The characteristics of partial discharges generated during the electrical tree growth and the light emission from the partial discharge pulses, have been studied under different pressure conditions. SiR samples, with a needle to plate electrode configuration, have been put into a pressure vessel to grow the electrical tree in the material under high hydrostatic pressure conditions. The electrical tree growth has been divided in three stages (initiation, intermediate and final or pre-breakdown stage) and tests have been performed at 1, 20 and 60 bar. A digital NIKON camera and a CCD camera have been used, both attached to a long-distance microscope, to observe in real time the tree growth and light emission, respectively. Pictures showed a higher growth speed for the electric tree as voltage and pressure were increased. The length of electrical trees pre-grown at lower pressures collapsed faster as the pressure increased, than those pre-grown at higher pressures under the same pressure increasing conditions. As the pressure increased, Pulse Sequence Analysis performed to the partial discharges measured confirmed the partial discharge inception and extinction voltage increase and showed a polarity dependency to space charge generation in addition to other patterns regarding the charge magnitude and phase of occurrence characteristics. Pressure vessel internal reflections have suggested changes to be done in future studies for the light emission measurement. Finally, partial discharge patterns from the electrical tree growth process have been identified to be characteristics from void faults in the dielectric with a spherical void shape.

The important results are summarized as the followings: Regarding the woody panel wall, the panels that were made from higher specific gravity showed better sound insulation performance, the TL values for red oak 39. 3 dB and china fir 36. 2 dB. The values of sandwich structure panel walls was more excellent than single panel. All of the samples, the improved effect of filling with insulation materials for red oak panel walls showed that the soundproof carpet with glassfiber (7. 2 dB) was the best, and the coated metal sheet (4. 2 dB) was the worst. With respect to the woody floors, the floor which made from different wood species showed the higher hardness and MOE, this could increase the floor impact vibration characteristics. The floor made of the lumber frame type of the red oak floor panel showed the light-weight impact characteristics,it was better than the flat type. Filling with the glass fiber can improve the resonance of floor panel. All of the samples, the best improvement of sound pressure level (SPL) in light- weight impact panel which filling up the vibration- resistant pad with the glassfiber (9. 9 dB), the improved value was 13. 1 dB and the improved extent was 14 %.

50|$|Batt fiberglass, {{blown in}} cellulose, or an {{insulated}} sawdust mixture are also insulators in cordwood walls. Rob Roy {{has found that}} a mixture of only vermiculite and sawdust, soaked in water overnight, results in an R value of 2.1- 2.5 per in. In a 16” wall this translates to an R value of 11-16. The use of cellulose (with an R value up to 3.7 per in.) can equalize the overall R value {{to that of a}} 2 x 6 stud frame with fiberglas <b>insulation.</b> <b>Other</b> <b>materials</b> like polystyrene or packaging peanuts have been economically used, and provide a purposeful use of recycled materials. A wall consisting of merely cordwood and mortar does not usually provide sufficient insulation for comfortable living in snowy regions, unless it is of the highly insulative Throughwall type.|$|R

That is, we are looking beyond both the traditional and the state-of-the-art thermal building <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> and solutions, e. g. beyond vacuum insulation panels (VIP). Thus advanced <b>insulation</b> <b>material</b> (AIM) concepts like vacuum <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> (VIM), gas <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> (GIM), nano <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> (NIM) and dynamic <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> (DIM) are introduced and defined. The VIMs and GIMs have closed pore structures, whereas the NIMs may have either open or closed pore structures. The objective of the DIMs are to dynamically control the thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>material</b> properties, e. g. solid state core conductivity, emissivity and pore gas content. In addition, fundamental theoretical studies aimed at developing {{an understanding of the}} basics of thermal conductance in solid state matter at an elementary and atomic level will also be carried out. The ultimate goal of these studies will be to develop tailor-make nove...|$|R
40|$|Water treeing is a {{well known}} {{phenomenon}} in polymeric cables, where it {{plays an important role}} in insulation ageing and degradation process of the material. Water treeing had been investigated for three decades and the level of investigation of water treeing field on electrical insulation has grown considerably especially in polymeric power cable. One of the polymeric <b>insulation</b> <b>materials,</b> named crosslink polyethylene (XLPE) has been widely used as <b>insulation</b> <b>material</b> in power cables. This project focuses more on analysis of insulation parameters such as insulation resistance, tan δ (delta), power factor, capacitance and return voltage profile in 1 kV aged XLPE cable due to water trees under AC and DC stress. As a result, water treeing affects the insulation degradation of polymeric power cable and influences <b>other</b> <b>insulation</b> parameters such as insulation resistance, tan δ, power factor, capacitance, and voltage recovery profile. The value of insulation resistance and capacitance decreased while the value of power factor and tan d increased after injection of 2 kV AC voltage, due to water treeing for certain ageing time...|$|R
