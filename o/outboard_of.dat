The rear gunner/radio operator operated one 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 machine gun for defensive purposes.|$|E
5|$|Ise was {{attacked}} by 80-odd aircraft from the fourth wave, but they failed to inflict any serious damage. She dodged 11 torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once, on the bulge <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the port catapult. Some 34 other bombs near missed her, spraying her with splinters and ruptured some hull plates that contaminated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler rooms. While an exact total of her casualties is not available, {{it has been estimated}} that 5 men were killed and some 111–121 crewmen were wounded during this attack. Hyūga was unsuccessfully attacked by an American submarine at 18:43. Around 19:00 Ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the Japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day and sank Chiyoda. He ordered the Fourth Carrier Division to reverse course and engage the Americans, but the battleships were unable to find them, and Ozawa ordered them to reverse course and head for Amami Ōshima. When they arrived on 27 October, Ozawa transferred to Hyūga and hoisted his flag aboard her. While en route for Kure, the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine.|$|E
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. <b>Outboard</b> <b>of</b> the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

25|$|Some chainrings can be {{outfitted}} with a chain guard — a plastic or metal ring slightly larger in diameter than the chainring. Its purpose is mostly to help prevent the chain from touching or catching clothing. Chain guard is usually mounted on the <b>outboard</b> side <b>of</b> the chainring or, in case of multi-sprocket chainring, on the <b>outboard</b> side <b>of</b> the largest chainring. Single-sprocket chainrings may have chain guards on both inboard and outboard sides, helping keeping the chain on the chainring; this is common on multi-speed juvenile bicycles.|$|R

25|$|The {{prototype}} T-37C was {{a modified}} T-37B. The primary changes included stronger wings, with a stores pylon under each wing <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the {{main landing gear}} well. The T-37C could also be fitted with wingtip fuel tanks, each with a capacity of 65US gal (245l), that could be dropped in an emergency.|$|E
25|$|The Tempest line {{received}} another facelift for the 1970 model year. Hidden headlights were deleted {{in favor}} of four exposed round headlamps <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> narrower grille openings. The nose retained the protruding vertical prow theme, although it was less prominent. While the standard Tempest and Le Mans had chrome grilles, the GTO retained the Endura urethane cover around the headlamps and grille.|$|E

25|$|The {{stronger}} undercarriage {{legs were}} angled 2inches (5.08cm) forward when extended, making the Spitfire more stable {{on the ground}} and reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its nose. In addition the retractable landing lights were no longer fitted. Structural hard-points were added <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the wheel-wells, allowing racks to be fitted under each wing which were capable of carrying one 250lb (113kg) bomb each.|$|E
25|$|It was {{determined}} that the accident {{was caused by a}} fatigue crack in the main spar of the left wing that caused the outer part of the left wing, <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the engine nacelle, to separate from the remainder of the aircraft.

25|$|The wing had {{a span of}} , with a {{wing area}} of 279 sq ft (29.6 sq m). It was {{designed}} {{with a small amount}} of inverted gull wing bend; the inner sections had a 1° anhedral, while the outer sections, attached just <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the undercarriage legs, had a dihedral of 5½°. The airfoil was a NACA 22 wing section, with a thickness to chord ratio of 19.5% at the root tapering to 12% at the tip.|$|E
25|$|The wings {{were covered}} with Madapolam fabric and doped {{in a similar manner}} to the fuselage. The wing was {{installed}} into the roots by means of four large attachment points. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.|$|E

25|$|The KDW was {{produced}} in Austria-Hungary under license by Phönix. 58 were built in five production batches. The first batch entered combat in late 1916. The wings extended well beyond the outboard ends of the star struts, and {{it was found that}} this unbraced part of the upper wing flexed when the ailerons were actuated, reducing their effectiveness. Starting with the second batch a light steel-tube vee brace was added <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the star struts to stiffen the outer upper wing.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was fitted with five gun turrets, and bomb bays {{that were in}} the engine nacelles. The gull wing was of cantilever design, and featured clean aerodynamics with an unbraced twin tail. The PBM-1 was equipped with retractable wing landing floats that were hinged outboard, with single-strut supported floats that retracted inwards to rest beneath the wing, with the floats' keels just <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> each of the engine nacelles. The PBM-3 had fixed floats, and the fuselage was three feet longer than that of the PBM-1.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 A-0: The {{pre-production}} Fw 190 A-0 {{series was}} ordered in November 1940, {{a total of}} 28 being completed. Because they were built before the new wing design was fully tested and approved, the first nine A-0s were fitted with the original small wings. All were armed with six 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns — four synchronised weapons, two in the forward fuselage and one in each wing root, supplemented by a free-firing MG 17 in each wing, <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the propeller disc.|$|E

25|$|Pitch {{control is}} {{achieved}} by tilting the rotor fore and aft; roll control by tilting the rotor laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect the tilt of the rotor are a tilting hub (Cierva), swashplate (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not always, {{as seen in the}} McCulloch J-2, with twin rudders placed <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the propeller arc).|$|E
25|$|The Skywarrior had a 36° degree {{swept wing}} and two Pratt & Whitney J57 {{turbojet}} engines. Early prototypes {{had used the}} intended Westinghouse J40, a powerplant {{that proved to be}} disastrous and subsequently canceled. The turbojets could be supplemented by a provision for twelve 4,500lbf (20kN) thrust JATO bottles. The aircraft had a largely conventional semi-monocoque fuselage, with the engines in underwing nacelles. Flight controls were hydraulic, and for storage below deck, the A-3's wings folded <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the engines, lying almost flat, and its vertical stabilizer was hinged to starboard. Capacious internal fuel tanks provided long range.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was an equal span pusher biplane with a monoplane tailplane and an elevator mounted on booms {{forward of the}} wings, the elevator being extended <b>outboard</b> <b>of</b> the supporting booms. Single-acting ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings. The Green engined aircraft had a single rudder mounted underneath the tailplane, while Grace's E.N.V. engined example had an additional rudder mounted above it. The undercarriage was simpler than Farman's design, and consisted {{of a pair of}} wheels mounted on an axle attached to the skids: supplementary tailskids were attached {{to the ends of the}} tail booms.|$|E
