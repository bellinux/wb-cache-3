5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, the Takelma Indians inhabited the Illinois Valley.

In 1856, after the wars ended, they were moved to the Grand Ronde Reservation and the Siletz Reservation.|$|E
5|$|Former All Black Jamie Joseph {{was hired}} as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh {{replaced}} Cowan as team captain. The campaign {{would prove to be}} the franchise's most successful in several years, as they raced out to a 3–0 start including a monumental away win over the Bulls in Pretoria. They remained in playoff contention for almost the entire season, sitting 8–4 at one juncture, before slumping under an injury cloud {{at the end of the}} year to finish 8th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fuseli painted other {{versions}} of The Nightmare following {{the success of}} the first; at least three survive. The other important canvas was painted between 1790 and 1791 and is held at the Goethe Museum in Frankfurt. It is smaller than the original, and the woman's head lies to the left; a mirror opposes her on the right. The demon is looking at the woman rather than out of the picture, and it has pointed, catlike ears. The most significant difference in the remaining two versions is an erotic statuette of a couple <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the completion of Astronomia Nova, most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the Rudolphine Tables and a comprehensive set of ephemerides (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> (though neither would be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio Magini. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the dating {{of events in the}} life of Jesus, and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of Helisaeus Roeslin.|$|E
5|$|Inside, Davos pleads with Melisandre {{to attempt}} to resurrect Jon, {{reminding}} her of her previous miracles. Though Melisandre's faith has been shattered by Stannis Baratheon's defeat, she is reminded of her encounter with Thoros of Myr, and attempts a ritual, but seemingly to no avail. Defeated, Melisandre, Davos, Edd and Tormund leave the room. Within moments, Jon suddenly awakens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 2009 season {{started with}} a sole win and a draw from the Crusaders' first five matches; this {{included}} a 6—0 loss to the Highlanders. The side found its feet later in the season, and won key away games which ultimately saw them finish in fourth place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> – {{just ahead of the}} Waratahs. Both the Crusaders and Waratahs finished the season with 41 competition points, but the Crusaders advanced through to the semi-finals due to a greater 'points for and against' difference.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders' 2004 {{season began}} with two losses: {{first to the}} Waratahs, then to the Blues. They {{recovered}} to again finish second <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with seven wins.

The Brumbies dominated in the final, scoring 33 unanswered {{points in the first}} 19 minutes. The Crusaders managed to salvage some pride by narrowing the loss to a 47–38 finish.|$|E
5|$|The {{month of}} August 1943 {{was used by}} the 45th Division for some rest and planning. Seven plans for the {{invasion}} of Italy were put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and three of them were adopted, of which the British had two (Operation Baytown and Operation Slapstick) and the Americans had one, called Operation Avalanche. The 45th Division would be under Major General Ernest J. Dawley's U.S. VI Corps, within the U.S. Fifth Army commanded by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. The plan called for the landing of the Allied forces in the vicinity of Salerno, Italy, about 200 miles north of Sicily.|$|E

5|$|With paying gigs {{harder to}} find and paying less, Sims turned to other sources of income. Despite not having had any formal {{instruction}} himself, he taught dance, including to such later stars as Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen. He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, he ran a café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic. Despite the lean times for hoofers, Sims was always able to put food <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> for his family, having married in 1959.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{in front of the}} board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
