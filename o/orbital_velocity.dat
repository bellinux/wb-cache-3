The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> {{of at least one}} of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E
5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E

This could give the impression that the Moon orbits Earth in such a way that sometimes it goes backwards when viewed from the Sun's perspective. Because the <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> of the Moon around Earth (1km/s) is small compared to the <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> of Earth about the Sun (30km/s), this never happens.

25|$|The true {{mass and}} true <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> cannot be {{determined}} from the radial velocity because the orbital inclination is generally unknown. (The inclination is {{the orientation of}} the orbit {{from the point of view}} of the observer, and relates true and radial velocity.) This causes a degeneracy between mass and inclination. For example, if the measured radial velocity is low, this can mean that the true <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> is low (implying low mass objects) and the inclination high (the orbit is seen edge-on), or that the true velocity is high (implying high mass objects) but the inclination low (the orbit is seen face-on).|$|E
25|$|Because {{the orbital}} period and orbital {{velocities}} in the binary system {{are related to}} the masses of the binary components, measuring these parameters provides some information about the masses of one or both components.

This apparently anachronistic analysis implies that Rømer was measuring the ratio , where c is the speed of light and v is the Earth's <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> (strictly, the component of the Earth's <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> parallel to the Earth–Jupiter vector), and indicates that the major inaccuracy of Rømer's calculations was his poor knowledge of the orbit of Jupiter.|$|E

This is made evident by calculating the ratio of greatest and smallest <b>orbital</b> <b>velocities</b> and by invoking the concept of energy. Students should acquire an intuitive understanding for the way <b>orbital</b> <b>velocities</b> vary along each orbit according to Kepler's second law. They will review the concepts of potential energy and kinetic energy and understand that orbital motion also conserves energy, in a somewhat similar way, although the formulas look different.

25|$|The seasons are {{quadrants}} of the Earth's orbit, {{marked by}} the two solstices and the two equinoxes. Kepler's second law states that a body in orbit traces equal areas over equal times; its <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> is highest around perihelion and lowest around aphelion. The Earth spends less time near perihelion and more time near aphelion. This means that the lengths of the seasons vary.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to control}} {{systematic}} error in the measurement of the CMB anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate.

40|$|Bed surface {{coarsening}} {{was found}} to be an important effect for the formation of ripples and the dynamics of the boundary layer above a predominantly silt-sized sediment bed (median particle size equal to 26 μm; ~ 20 % fine sand, 70 % silt, 10 % clay) under oscillatory flow (with <b>orbital</b> <b>velocities</b> of 0. 32 - 0. 52 m/s) in a laboratory wave duct. Following bed liquefaction, substantial winnowing of the bed surface occurred due to entrainment of finer material into suspension. Bed surface coarsening was quantified with micro-scale visualization using a CCD (charged-coupled device) camera. Under most wave <b>orbital</b> <b>velocities</b> investigated, the coarse surface particles were mobilized as a near- bed transport layer approximately 4 grain-diameters thick. The transport of these coarse sediments ultimately produced suborbital or anorbital ripples on the bed, except for the highest <b>orbital</b> <b>velocities</b> considered where the bed was planar. Micro-scale visualizations were used to construct a maximum (particle) velocity profile extending through the near-bed transport layers using particle-streak velocimetry (PSV). These profiles had a distinctive kink in log linear space {{at the height of the}} transport layer, suggesting that the near-bed sediment transport reduced skin friction and contributed to the boundary roughness through extraction of momentum...|$|R

40|$|Theoretically, {{potential}} waves cannot {{generate the}} vortex motion, but scale considerations indicate {{that if the}} steepness of waves is not too small, Reynolds number can exceed critical values. This means that in presence of initial non-potential disturbances the <b>orbital</b> <b>velocities</b> can generate the vortex motion and turbulence. In the paper, this problem was investigated numerically on basis of full two-dimensional (x-z) equations of potential motion with the free surface in cylindrical conformal coordinates. It was assumed that all variables are a sum of the 2 D potential <b>orbital</b> <b>velocities</b> and 3 D non-potential disturbances. The non-potential motion is described directly with 3 D Euler equations, with very high resolution. The interaction between potential <b>orbital</b> <b>velocities</b> and non-potential components is accounted through additional terms which include the components of vorticity. Long-term numerical integration {{of the system of}} equations was done for different wave steepness. Vorticity and turbulence usually occur in vicinity of wave crests (where the velocity gradients reach their maximum) and then spread over upwind slope and downward. Specific feature of the wave turbulence at low steepness (steepness was kept low in order to avoid wave breaking) is its strong intermittency: the turbulent patches are mostly isolated and intermittency grows with decrease of wave amplitude. Maximum values of energy of turbulence are in agreement with available experimental data. The results suggest that even non-breaking potential waves can generate turbulence, which thus enhances the turbulence created by the shear current...|$|R
25|$|In these systems, the {{separation}} between the stars is usually very small, and the <b>orbital</b> <b>velocity</b> very high. Unless {{the plane of the}} orbit happens to be perpendicular to the line of sight, the orbital velocities will have components in the line of sight and the observed radial velocity of the system will vary periodically. Since radial velocity can be measured with a spectrometer by observing the Doppler shift of the stars' spectral lines, the binaries detected in this manner are known as spectroscopic binaries. Most of these cannot be resolved as a visual binary, even with telescopes of the highest existing resolving power.|$|E

This {{allows for a}} Debris Avoidance Manoeuvre (DAM) to be conducted, which uses thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment to alter the station's orbital altitude, avoiding the debris. DAMs are not uncommon, taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance. Eight DAMs had been performed prior to March 2009, the first seven between October 1999 and May 2003.
