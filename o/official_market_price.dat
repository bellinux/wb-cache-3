40|$|When a {{formerly}} centrally {{planned economy}} frees prices and allows or compels producers to respond to market signals, conventional measures tend to severely overstate short-run output decline and inflation. The overstatement stems partly from neglect of private sector activity or belated recognition of inflation previously disguised as quality improvements. Even when individual prices and outputs are correctly measured, however, shifts in relative prices consequent to price decontrol create a serious aggregation problem. Moreover, standard indices ignore the deflationary trends in black markets. Theoretically superior indices are devised using a mixture of <b>official</b> and black <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In 2004, the new pricing {{regulation}} was enforced in Bulgaria. It liberates the OTC medicines pricing procedure from reference pricing to registration {{according to}} marketing authorization holder proposal. The {{goal is to}} analyse {{the changes in the}} pricing regulations concerning OTC and its impact on prices and utilization of analgesic medicines. Two main hypotheses are tested in the study. H 1 : The changes in the price regulation liberate the market in terms of increase in the analgesics utilization; H 2 : The changes in the regulation lead to the decrease in <b>prices.</b> Regulatory and <b>market</b> analysis were performed focusing on procedures for price settlement and their changes for 4 international non-proprietary names (INNs) of analgesics on the local market – methamizole sodium, paracetamol, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid for the period before and after the changes in the regulation. The descriptive statistic, z-test for proportions, and one way ANOVA analysis were performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the changes in utilization and prices. An increase in the analgesics utilization has been observed in 2006 compared to 2003. Increase in utilization was found to be statistically significant for all INN and thus confirms our first hypothesis. After the changes in the regulatory control we observe the increase in the mean <b>official</b> and <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> of methamizol and paracetamol in 2006 and decrease in 2009. The prices of ibuprofen decrease in 2006, but in 2009 the officially registered price increased while the market one remains lowest. For acetylsalicylic acid the mean prices decreased slowly in 2003 and then increased in 2009. All changes in the prices were not statistically significant even when we compare the prices in 2009 with the ones in 2003. Thus our second hypothesis is not confirmed. The liberalization of the price control led to increase in utilization but also to increase in prices...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{commodity}} {{money and the}} method of money analysis through its function formulated by Copernicus belong to the significant achievments {{of the history of}} economic thought. In the field of money theory there is so called Copernic Law, whose invention has been unjustly attributed to Gresham. The above mentioned Law can be formulated in short as follows: if there are two sorts of currency in circulation, having the same nominal value but not the same real (substantial) value, then the full-value coins (standart money) are driven out of circulation by undervalued money. Another Copernicus intellectual inventions in the domain of money theory are the following, 'still actual conceptions: a) unity of <b>official</b> and <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of currency metal constitutes the basic condition of functioning of metallic commodity money, b) transgression of the threshold of currency arbitrage (melting of currency into the pure metal) brings that unity down and therefore should be corrected by the state interventionism, c) creeping depreciation of currency originates usually negative and grave in results economic changes in the structure of prices. The Copernican views of money, especially the principle of periodicity of currency system reforms (every 25 years) and also that one concerning the subordination of currency to raison d'Etat are of great importance. To Copernicus the money has not been an object of its own, but it was the mean serving to an end. One of his statements said that the countries with full-value coins were prosperous in contradiistinctioin to those ones having had currency... and "good coin is not only advantegous to the state but also [ [...] . ] to all classes of population while the bad money is disastrous".

50|$|In an {{empirical}} study, Martin Spann, Marc Fischer and Gerard Tellis analyze the prevalence and choice of dynamic pricing strategies {{in a highly}} complex branded market, consisting of 663 products under 79 brand names of digital cameras. They find that, despite numerous recommendations in the literature for skimming or penetration <b>pricing,</b> <b>market</b> <b>pricing</b> dominates in practice. In particular, the authors find five patterns: skimming (20% frequency), penetration (20% frequency), and three variants of market-pricing patterns (60% frequency), where new products are launched at <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> Skimming pricing launches the new product 16% above the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> and subsequently increases the price relative to the <b>market</b> <b>price.</b> Penetration pricing launches the new product 18% below the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> and subsequently lowers the price relative to the <b>market</b> <b>price.</b> Firms exhibit a mix of these pricing paths across their portfolios. The specific pricing paths correlate with market, firm, and brand characteristics such as competitive intensity, market pioneering, brand reputation, and experience effects.|$|R

In addition, 50 (1200) scenarios are generated for wind speed realization after intraday market. The large number of original total scenarios yields an optimization problem which is intractable. To achieve tractability, the size of scenarios is reduced through Kantorovich distance approach. Consequently, the number of scenarios is reduced to 5, 10, 10, 10 scenarios for demand, day-ahead <b>market</b> <b>price,</b> intraday <b>market</b> <b>price</b> and real time <b>market</b> <b>price,</b> respectively.
