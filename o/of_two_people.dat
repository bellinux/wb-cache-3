5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} adapted by the writer Nick Dear, who {{considered}} the story more mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised {{it as one}} of realism and truthfulness, particularly in telling the story <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.|$|E
5|$|The town of Tehachapi {{suffered}} the greatest damage {{and loss of}} life from the earthquake, though other locations in Kern County experienced significant damage as well, but its effects were widely felt throughout central and southern California. The July mainshock had a significant aftershock sequence that persisted into July and August with many magnitude 5+ events with intensities of V (Moderate) to VII (Very strong). Six of these aftershocks occurred {{on the day of}} the mainshock, but the strongest aftershock came on August 22 as a M5.8 event that had a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) and resulted in the deaths <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> and caused an additional $10 million in property damage.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Norman was a weak {{tropical}} cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico in October 2006. The twelfth named storm of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Norman developed on October 9 from a tropical wave {{well to the}} southwest of Mexico. Unfavorable conditions quickly encountered the system, and within two days of forming, Norman dissipated as its remnants turned to the east. Thunderstorms gradually increased again, as it interacted with a disturbance to its east, and on October 15 the cyclone regenerated just {{off the coast of}} Mexico. The center became disorganized and quickly dissipated, bringing a large area of moisture which dropped up to 6inches (150mm) of rainfall to southwestern Mexico. Rainfall from the storm flooded about 150houses, of which 20 were destroyed. One person was injured, and initially there were reports <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> missing due to the storm; however, it was not later confirmed.|$|E

5|$|On September1, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while {{near the}} {{hurricane}} 200mi (320km) {{southeast of the}} Frying Pan Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship. Off of the East Coast, {{an offshoot of the}} hurricane resulted in the drownings <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>people.</b> In the Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24in (610mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September1. This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Most of the rain was in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast. The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams. An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks. Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $2,500,000. In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1million. Four fatalities were reported {{as a result of the}} floods. In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less. However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000 in damages and one death. Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{tries to}} wend {{its way through}} the trail of human debris, the visions and the {{shattered}} dreams {{on both sides of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to a rational analysis of the applicability of international human rights norms, to the conflicting claims <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>peoples</b> to the same land. The right of both Jews and Palestinians to self-determination seems to be self-evident from the stories <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> <b>peoples.</b> Almost forty years after the Six Days War, the author turns to this issue in an attempt to analyze where this conflict now stands in terms of international human rights. This article will concentrate on structuring a basic analytical framework, incorporating both Israeli and Palestinian perspectives, and will try to show the symmetries and asymmetries between them. This involves discussion of the rights <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>peoples</b> to self-determination and the means by which such parallel rights can be implemented. It also involves discussing differences in the means of implementation of the right to self-determination for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and minority rights for Palestinian-Israelis living in Israel within the 1948 Armistice Lines...|$|R
