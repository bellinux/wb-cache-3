500|$|In February 1999, Jimmy Eat World {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Clarity, through Capitol Records. The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, that was sort <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> because it let us take control of what we needed to do. We learned {{we had to do}} it ourselves, because no one else would do it for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{front-office}} woes {{affected the}} team {{regardless of who}} {{was brought in to}} coach. [...] After McKay stepped {{down at the end of}} the 1984 season, Leeman Bennett, who had coached the Atlanta Falcons to their first-ever playoff win, was hired. [...] After two disastrous 214 seasons, he was replaced by former New York Giants and University of Alabama head coach Ray Perkins. [...] Perkins brought back much-needed discipline and [...] "three-a-day" [...] practices, but it proved too much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> [...] The team was so physically drained by game day that the losses continued to pile up, and Perkins was fired before the end of the 1990 season. [...] Offensive coordinator Richard Williamson was elevated to head coach, and after his brief success in the final remaining games, he retained his head coaching position for the following year. [...] The momentum didn’t last, however, and was fired after the 1991 season when the team went 313.|$|E
2500|$|Liberace {{was often}} {{said to be}} worth over $110 million {{at the time of}} his death, and to have bequeathed $88 million to the Liberace Foundation {{at the time of his}} death. The story was perpetuated by the {{officers}} of the Liberace Foundation often and as late as 2013. Only in 2015 did Liberace Foundation Chairman Jonathan Warren reveal in a lecture at the Mob Museum in Las Vegas that these figures were all part of the showmanship of Liberace, and that the real figures were closer to one tenth those amounts. The Liberace Foundation saw the sunset of its in-house endowment fund in 2011. University endowment funds provided by it continue to provide scholarships annually. [...] The original Liberace museum closed its doors in 2010, citing the recession and an outdated, outmoded facility. In November 2013, a dozen of Liberace's famous costumes, together with one of his stage cars and a piano went on display for a six-week period at the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas in an exhibition titled [...] "Too Much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Thing</b> Is Wonderful", Liberace's unofficial motto, and an often-used one-liner from his act. During the exhibit, Jonathan Warren took over as Chairman of the Foundation, and negotiated the extension of the exhibit for an additional seven months. [...] The resulting audience response resulted in the new era of brand licensing of Liberace.|$|E
