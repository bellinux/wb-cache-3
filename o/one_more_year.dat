5|$|Barcelona {{ended their}} refusal of {{corporate}} sponsorship {{prior to the}} commencement of the 2011–12 season, signing a five-year, €150 million deal with Qatar Sports Investments, that meant the Qatar Foundation was on the club's shirt for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, then replaced by Qatar Airways for the 2013–14 season, the deal allowing for a commercial sponsor logo to replace the charity logo, two years into the six-year deal.

5|$|After {{graduating in}} 1933, {{he entered the}} medical program at the University of Melbourne. His mentors {{included}} Anatomy Professor Frederic Wood Jones. While at the University, he passed the primary exam for the Royal College of Surgeons in 1934, one of only four successful candidates who sat the examination in Melbourne that year. He finished the program in 1937 and received an MBBS with honours {{as well as two}} prizes in surgery. After graduation, he studied internal medicine for <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>year,</b> and served as a house surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Woodruff then started his surgical training.|$|E
5|$|Morton {{was elected}} to Mar's office and proved {{in many ways the}} most {{effective}} of James's regents, but he made enemies by his rapacity. He fell from favour when Frenchman Esmé Stewart, Sieur d'Aubigny, first cousin of James's father Lord Darnley and future Earl of Lennox, arrived in Scotland and quickly established himself as the first of James's powerful favourites. Morton was executed on 2 June 1581, belatedly charged with complicity in Darnley's murder. On 8 August, James made Lennox the only duke in Scotland. The king, then fifteen years old, remained under the influence of Lennox for about <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though {{he would}} later become indelibly {{associated}} with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club's local rivals Port Vale. His father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a boxer, but Stanley decided {{at the age of}} 13 {{that he wanted to be}} a footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>year</b> at school, should follow his passion of football. His father conceded that should he be picked for England Schoolboys then he could continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.|$|E

5|$|When the deanship of the {{law school}} came open in 1929, Macdonald agonized over whether he should seek the job. He {{apparently}} had strong support from several members of the university's board of governors. At the same time however, he was increasingly drawn to politics and accepting the deanship would mean postponing his political ambitions indefinitely. In the end, the job was offered to Sidney Smith, another prominent Canadian academic who accepted on condition that Macdonald remain at the school. Macdonald did stay, but only for <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>year.</b> In 1930, he resigned so he would be free to enter politics.|$|E
5|$|In the 1976–77 {{season the}} Flyers' win total slipped from 51 to 48, {{but they still}} managed a 0.700 winning percentage. This marked the fourth {{consecutive}} year of having a 0.700 or better win percentage – once again winning their division and finishing first in the Campbell Conference. In the post season the Flyers again reached the semi-finals, but lost to the Bruins in four straight games. The following season the Flyers' record fell to 45–20–15 finishing second to the Islanders in both the division and the Conference. Shero again led the Flyers to the semi-finals, where they lost to the Bruins once more. At {{the end of the}} season Shero, who had <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>year</b> left on his contract, submitted a letter of resignation stating that the Flyers needed a change whether they realized it or not. Flyers management had previously heard rumors about Shero wanting to leave Philadelphia and re-join the Rangers organization, and refused to accept his letter of resignation. Shero then signed a $250,000, five-year contract with the Rangers to be their new Head Coach and General Manager, believing he no longer had a contractual agreement to the Flyers. A few weeks after signing Shero, the Rangers gave the Flyers their first-round pick in the 1978 draft (Ken Linseman) and cash as compensation, allowing the Rangers to avoid tampering charges.|$|E
5|$|Portugal's {{debt was}} in September 2012 {{forecast}} by the Troika to peak at around 124% of GDP in 2014, {{followed by a}} firm downward trajectory after 2014. Previously the Troika had predicted it would peak at 118.5% of GDP in 2013, so the developments {{proved to be a}} bit worse than first anticipated, but the situation was described as fully sustainable and progressing well. As a result, from the slightly worse economic circumstances, the country has been given <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>year</b> to reduce the budget deficit to a level below 3% of GDP, moving the target year from 2013 to 2014. The budget deficit for 2012 has been forecast to end at 5%. The recession in the economy is now also projected to last until 2013, with GDP declining 3% in 2012 and 1% in 2013; followed by a return to positive real growth in 2014. Unemployment rate increased to over 17% by end of 2012 but it has since decreased gradually to 10,5% as of November 2016.|$|E

5|$|While Busby was in {{hospital}} {{recovering from the}} injuries he sustained in the air crash, his managerial duties were left to his assistant, Jimmy Murphy. After Busby recovered, he set about rebuilding his side, and within five years, in 1963, he had won the FA Cup {{for the first time}} in 15 years. This was followed up by two league titles in three years, and then the greatest prize in European club football, the European Cup. He continued as manager for <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>year</b> after this success, leaving his managerial duties to club trainer Wilf McGuinness. McGuinness struggled in his new post, however, and Busby was convinced to return for the second half of the 1970–71 season. However, he retired from football permanently that summer, and was succeeded that summer by Frank O'Farrell. O'Farrell's stay was short-lived, though, as his inability to control George Best's extravagances forced the board to sack him with three years still to run on his contract.|$|E

3000|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, {{experience is}} argued {{to be either}} a [...] "stock" [...] (Evans [1989]) or [...] "flow" [...] (Kidd [1993]). In this study, we found that labour market experience works as a [...] "stock" [...] for recent immigrants in New Zealand. Labour market experience significantly increases the propensity for immigrants to be self-employed. With <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>year's</b> labour market experience, the probability of self-employment will be increased by 0.15 %. Therefore, with greater experience, immigrants tend to have obtained more management skills and better market information, which leads to greater skills for operating their own businesses.|$|R
3000|$|The {{coefficients}} of [...] "years since migration" [...] (YSM) in all models are positive {{at the highest}} level of statistical significance. By having <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> of living experience in the host country, immigrants can gain more information about the host labour market and business opportunities and can also expand their network. We find that the probability of self-employment is increased by 0.1 % by one year's increase in YSM. The positive effect of YSM observed in this panel study also confirmed the positive effect of YSM found by previous international studies (e.g. Li [2010]; Toussaint-Comeau [2008]).|$|R
