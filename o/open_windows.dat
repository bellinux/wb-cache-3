5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare {{and when they}} did appear usually consisted of glimpses through <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E

This paper {{analyzes}} a standard low energy consumption university office that has a standard envelope. Dynamic thermal simulations with EDSL Tas software, a predicted mean vote (PMV), and a {{predicted percentage of dissatisfied}} (PPD) with all local discomfort as stated in ASHRAE, ISO 7730 : 2005, EN 15251 : 2007 were used for thermal sensation, in order to optimize the best window to external wall proportion in a hot and humid climate that exists in the Famagusta case study. A simulated office building is oriented east to west in order {{to take advantage of the}} wind direction. In May 45 % (PPD < 6 %– 0. 7 % <b>open</b> <b>window),</b> 93 % (PPD < 10 – 0. 2 <b>open</b> <b>window),</b> and 97 % (PPD < 15 %– 0. 1 % <b>open</b> <b>window)</b> thermal comfort scores are obtained when the window to external wall ratio (WWR) is 10 %.

30|$|The {{definitions}} also {{speak to}} {{the social construction of}} hazard viewpoint, in that some hazards might not be hazardous unless they interact with society, while hazardousness can be a function of this interaction. Rain is an essential environmental phenomenon for human and other life. Rain coming into a house through an <b>open</b> <b>window</b> has hazardous properties when falling on carpets and computers. If rain enters an <b>open</b> <b>window</b> and causes computer and carpet damage, is the hazard the rain, the <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> or the decision to leave damageable property beside an <b>open</b> <b>window</b> when it might rain? The carpet and computer themselves represent vulnerability (or exposure), discussed in the next section.|$|R

25|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of green roofs {{is that the}} initial cost of installing a green roof can be double that of a normal roof. Depending {{on what kind of}} green roof it is, the maintenance costs could be higher, but some types of green roof have little or no ongoing cost. Some kinds of green roofs also place higher demands on the waterproofing system of the structure, both because water is retained on the roof and due to the possibility of roots penetrating the waterproof membrane. Another disadvantage is that the wildlife they attract may include pest insects which could easily infiltrate a residential building through <b>open</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} Phlyax vases are {{a principal}} {{source of information}} on the genre. By 1967, 185 of these vases had been identified. Since depictions of theatre and especially comedy are rare in fabrics other than the South Italian, these have been thought to portray the distinctly local theatre tradition. The vases first appeared {{at the end of the}} 5th century BCE, but most are 4th century. They represent grotesque characters, the masks of comedy, and the props of comic performance such as ladders, baskets, and <b>open</b> <b>windows.</b> About a quarter of them depict a low wooden temporary stage, but whether this was used in reality is a point of contention.|$|E
25|$|Employees {{were given}} 14 minutes between each shift to punch the time clock, walk to their {{respective}} workbench and prepare for work. It took a minimum of eight minutes for all the employees to get by the time clock. The estimated walking time for employees ranged from 30 seconds to three minutes, but some workers needed {{as many as eight}} minutes to reach their workbenches. Upon arriving at their workbench, employees were required to put on aprons or overalls, removed shirts, tape or grease arms, put on finger cots, prepare equipment, turn on switches, <b>open</b> <b>windows,</b> and/or assemble or sharpen tools. Such preparatory activities consumed three to four minutes.|$|E

25|$|Hoping to {{accomplish}} this, Martin Schenck devised a scheme {{through which he}} would take Nijmegen and enhance his own treasury. On the evening of 10nbsp&August 1589, Schenck and 20nbsp&barges of men—approximately 200nbsp&soldiers—made {{their way down the}} Waal to Nijmegen. Schenck's plan was simple: they would find a house with <b>open</b> <b>windows.</b> Using scaling hooks and ropes, they would climb into the house and overpower the inhabitants, who should be sleeping at that hour. Once the house was secured, they would quietly find the city gate, and open it {{to the rest of the}} force, which would be waiting on the river landing. They could then overpower the small local garrison and any citizens who felt resistance was necessary. Not only would they reinforce the city, but there would be opportunity for plunder as well.|$|E
25|$|GNOME 2 {{was very}} similar to a {{conventional}} desktop interface, featuring a simple desktop in which users could interact with virtual objects, such as windows, icons, and files. GNOME 2 used Metacity as its default window manager. The handling of windows, applications, and files in GNOME 2 {{is similar to that}} of contemporary desktop operating systems. In the default configuration of GNOME 2, the desktop has a launcher menu for quick access to installed programs and file locations; <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> may be accessed by a taskbar along the bottom of the screen, and the top-right corner features a notification area for programs to display notices while running in the background. However, these features can be moved to almost any position or orientation the user desires, replaced with other functions or removed altogether.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} memorial {{has three}} main parts: entry, assembly room, and shrine. The central assembly room features seven large <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> on either wall and ceiling, {{to commemorate the}} date of the attack. Rumor says the 21 windows symbolically represents a 21-gun salute or 21Marines standing at eternal parade rest over the tomb of the fallen, but guides at the site will confirm this was not the architect's intention. The memorial also has an opening in the floor overlooking the sunken decks. It is from this opening that visitors can pay their respects by tossing flowers in honor of the fallen sailors. In the past, leis were tossed in the water, but because string from leis poses a hazard to sea life, leis now are placed on guardrails in front of the names of the fallen.|$|E

Support for DirectX 8.1 and OpenGL was added, allowing Mac users to play some Windows games without the need to boot into Windows with Boot Camp. A new feature called SmartSelect offers cross OS file and application integration by allowing the user to <b>open</b> <b>Windows</b> files with Mac OS X programs and vice versa. Parallels Explorer was introduced, which allows the user to browse their Windows system files in Mac OS X without actually launching Windows. A new snapshot feature was included, allowing one to restore their virtual machine environment to a previous state in case of issues. Further, Parallels added a security manager to {{limit the amount of}} interaction between the Windows and Mac OS X installations. This version included a long-awaited complete “Parallels tools'” driver suite for Linux guest operating systems. Therefore, integration between Mac OS X and Linux guest-OS's has been greatly improved.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 Vanbrugh {{married the}} actor Dion Boucicault Jr., son {{of his more}} famous namesake. They {{frequently}} appeared together {{for the rest of}} his life, and he became her manager in 1915. There were no children of the marriage. Between the turn of the century and World War I she had leading roles in new plays by J. M. Barrie (The Admirable Crichton, 1902; and Rosalind, 1912), Pinero (Letty, 1903; His House in Order, 1906; and Mid-Channel, 1909), and Maugham (Grace, 1910; and The Land of Promise, 1914). She also starred in new plays by Charles Haddon Chambers (Passers-By, 1911), and A. E. W. Mason (<b>Open</b> <b>Windows,</b> 1913). In 1913 she played Lady Gay Spanker in a revival of Boucicault senior's London Assurance in an all-star cast including Tree, Charles Hawtrey, Bourchier, Weedon Grossmith and Marie Tempest. This was one of the many charity fund-raising productions in which Vanbrugh appeared throughout her career.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} stages of the attack, one of the Land Rovers was set on fire and another was driven away. One of the RMPs, Cpl Miller was wounded by small arms fire as they ran for cover inside the police station. When the {{situation}} deteriorated even further, the Iraqi police left the compound through some <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> at the back and in doing so, encouraged the six British policeman to escape too. The Iraqi policemen feared that they would be shot for being traitors and so decided to leave, but the RMPs decided the best policy was to stay behind and defend their position whilst awaiting help. They asked the Iraqis for a radio before they left, but the Iraqi policeman did not have one to give them. The area around Majar al-Kabir is very flat and as a result, HF and VHF radios don't work very well; even within close range, there are dead zones where the signal cannot be accessed. The Paratroopers had PRRs (Personal Role Radios), an Iridium satellite phone and a VHF radio. All the RMPs had was a selection of radios in their Land Rovers.|$|E
