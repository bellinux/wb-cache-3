40|$|Metal cutting {{has been}} shown by other researchers, as well as within this work, to be a {{stochastic}} process with many complex behaviours and sources of variance which detrimentally affects the scatter in tool life results. Empirical testing is still the preferable method for cutting tool development especially in an industrial environment, as models are currently unable to replicate the complex interaction between cutting tool and workpiece as tool wear {{is the result of}} several mechanisms working simultaneously. The need to quantify differences in sample groups and make sound statistical inferences about their populations is crucial for any tooling manufacturer to manage the level of quality, as well as to continually improve their products. This is highlighted in the cutting tool market as end users are continually demanding longer tool lives, low variance and no early tool life failures, as large amounts of overhead costs are incurred in partially manufactured components, with sudden tool failure resulting in substantial costs to a business. Therefore, the objective of this research was to design and develop a destructive accelerated drill test which is robust, sensitive, rapid and low cost. It was found, that although sources of machining complexity and variance which affects the scatter in tool life data have been identified within the literature, a solution to deal with it has not yet been provided. Using a systems approach facilitated the management of the complex behaviours so a machining regime could be identified which offered a repeatable and mono-modal tool failure, a robust test, as well as, where possible, to minimise and empirically model the effect of machining variance on tool life scatter, a sensitive test. Annealed D 2 cold work tool steel was able to offer a low tool life standard deviation and a mono-modal tool failure mode. In stark contrast P 20 plastic mould steel showed a larger standard deviation and a bi-modal failure mode. This work also showed that for accelerated testing of HSS cutting tools, which are thermally sensitive, an abrasive wear test is preferable over a thermo-chemical wear type. Pre inspection of drill geometries for the rejection of Jobber drills <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> was found to be insignificant when distinguishing the difference between sample means. It was assumed that the drills <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> would be randomly distributed, along with their effect on tool life. It was important however to determine, that the drills <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance,</b> would have a small effect on the standard deviation in tool life, relative to the sample size and relative to the sample means so statistically significant results could be determined. An extended Taylor&rsquo;s tool life model was generated which modelled the effect of plate hardness between the range of 467 HLD to 511 HLD for annealed D 2. This work showed that the life of uncoated M 2 HSS 6. 35 mm Jobber drills is sensitive to small changes in plate hardness. At a cutting speed of 25 m/min an increase in plate hardness from 467 HLD to 492 HLD, an increase of 5. 3 %, decreased drill life by 70. 9 %...|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{which allows}} one to maintain precision placement of a manipulator which undergoes repeated controlled motions or trajectories is provided. The structure of the apparatus is compliant such that the manipulator may be displaced by forces applied to the mechanical structure. This compliance {{is due to a}} lack of precision in the fabrication of the component parts of the machine, and to a lack of rigidity due to a lightweight design. This displacement is of a greater magnitude than the precision positioning <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the apparatus. Consequently, the manipulator may then be displaced <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the positioning <b>tolerance</b> due to applied forces. However, it is a characteristic of the present invention, that despite the compliance of the mechanical structure of the apparatus, the positioning tolerance will be maintained. The controlled motion is accomplished by the generation of control signals by computer software running on a computer control system. The control software enables the system to run at much greater speeds while not exciting unwanted movement or vibration in the compliant mechanical structure. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

40|$|Construction {{of silicon}} neutron interferometers {{requires}} a perfect crystal silicon ingot (5 cm to 30 cm long) be machined such that Bragg diffracting "blades" protrude {{from a common}} base. Leaving the interferometer blades connected to the same base preserves Bragg plane alignment, but if the interferometer contains crystallographic misalignments of greater than about 10 nrad between the blades, interference fringe visibility begins to suffer. Additionally, the parallelism, thickness, and distance between the blades must be machined to micron tolerances. Traditionally, interferometers do not exhibit usable interference fringe visibility until 30 μm to 60 μm of machining surface damage is chemically etched away. However, if too much material is removed, the uneven etch rates across the interferometer cause {{the shape of the}} crystal blades to be <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the required <b>tolerances.</b> As a result, the ultimate interference fringe visibility varies widely among neutron interferometers that are created under similar conditions.

50|$|A key {{biological}} {{feature of}} an NPMR model is that failure of an organism to tolerate any single {{dimension of the}} predictor space results in overall failure of the organism. For example, assume that a plant needs a certain range of moisture in a particular temperature range. If either temperature or moisture fall <b>outside</b> the <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the organism, then the organism dies. If it is too hot, then no amount of moisture can compensate to result in survival of the plant. Mathematically this works with NPMR because {{the product of the}} weights for the target point is zero or near zero if any of the weights for individual predictors (moisture or temperature) are zero or near zero. Note further that in this simple example, the second condition listed above is probably true: the response of the plant to moisture probably depends on temperature and vice versa.|$|R

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} the most widely {{harvested}} of the renewable energy resources. The offshore wind sector is becoming ever more established with large turbines being installed in bigger arrays. A current limitation to fixed offshore wind is water depth. In recent years floating structures {{have been developed to}} support wind turbines for deeper water application, which has the potential to unlock vast expanses of ocean in assessable to current fixed offshore wind turbines. One of the currently leading floating wind designs is the StatoilHydro Hywind spar project, which has successfully undergone several year of operation in the North Sea. However, a limiting factor of the design is the large draft preventing application in water depth less than 120 m. This project investigated the potential benefits of modifying the Hywind design for shallower water application. The modified design added a heave plate and a soft tank to {{the lower part of the}} structure in the attempt to reduce draft whilst maintaining a favourable response to wind and wave loading through dynamic damping. 1 to 75 scale numerical and physical models were used to assess the devices response. The physical modelling was used to validate numerical modelling. After validating the numerical model, a full scale numerical model was simulated, to compare the device’s response with the Hywind device. Aqwa was the chosen software for numerical modelling. Physical testing was conducted in the University’s Ocean Basin. The physical model showed a closes correlation with the numerical model, which would validate the numerical model. At full scale the modified design shows some benefit in motion response over the original design. However, the scaled up physical test results appear less beneficial, with the responses <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> acceptable <b>tolerances,</b> which could potentially causing damage to the turbine. This prompts questions about the accuracy of the full numerical scale model...|$|R

40|$|Most {{multivariate process}} {{capability}} indices proposed by other researchers provide quality measure in losses due to variability and being off-target. Some suggested loss function models that estimate losses due to rejection and quality costs {{but failed to}} consider {{the correlation between the}} multivariate quality characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel new approach for estimating the total expected quality cost that provides quality cost measure not only in losses due to variability and being off-target but also losses due to rejection. The proposed model also estimates the quality costs for correlated quality characteristics with nominal specifications and provides the estimated costs due to individual characteristics; it helps to identify those process quality characteristics which have high variation when compared with their specification spread. The model will also improve the estimate of the rejection cost suggested by earlier researchers as it identifies the reject region as the region <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the modified <b>tolerance</b> region. We present four different correlated bivariate normal process scenarios where the proposed method can be applicable and demonstrate that our approach provides a robust tool in estimating the risk of the product being rejected and performs as well as existing methods in estimating the total quality cost...|$|R

40|$|The central {{thesis of}} this paper is that, for most issues of multiculturalism, {{regarding}} them as a problem <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> puts us on the wrong track because there are certain biases inherent in the principle <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> These biases - individualism, combined with a focus on religion and a focus on beliefs rather than on persons or practices - can be regarded as distinctly Protestant. Extending the scope <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> may seem a solution but if we really want to counter these biases, the principle <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> becomes so general that it loses any distinctive meaning. Therefore, we should accept the limited scope <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> and its biases. The principle <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> can still be useful for some problems where there is a clear and direct link to political or religious beliefs. Moreover, it should be cherished as a more general attitude or practice in Dutch society.
