5|$|Two {{most popular}} multi-pitch routes for {{technical}} climbing {{are on the}} eastern and south-western walls. Both are exceptionally long and situated on solid granite walls. The best season for climbing is mid September to mid October <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> snow falls. Another good season lasts from late June to early August.|$|E
5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a hero is {{randomly}} selected on both sides for one minute, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of bird species are {{socially}} monogamous. These species pair {{for at least}} the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.|$|E

5|$|The head of {{government}} is responsible to the National Assembly and serves as the Deputy Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security. Moreover, prime minister is also Chairman of the Council for National Education. The tenure of a prime minister is five years, and the term is renewable once. The current prime minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has served since 2016. In case of incapacity, a deputy prime minister assumes the office of acting prime minister until the prime minister resumes duty, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> appointment of a new prime minister.|$|E
5|$|After {{moderate}} beach erosion {{from previous}} hurricanes Dennis and Floyd, Irene caused significant beach erosion {{on the eastern}} Florida coastline. The erosion exposed the foundations of private homes, leaving some uninhabitable. Beach erosion damage totalled to $21million. Many beach access points were closed until more sand could be pumped in, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> stairways were rebuilt. Strong north winds and high seas severely destroyed or damaged docks in the Indian River Lagoon. Heavy rainfall, ranging from 5 to 9inches (127 to 229mm) in Martin and St. Lucie Counties flooded 260homes. Strong wind gusts from 60 to 70mph (97 to 113km/h) severely damaged 34houses and caused light damage to 1,114homes in Martin, St. Lucie, and Brevard Counties. In addition the winds damaged 465mobilehomes, 15severely, and destroyed one. 555commercial buildings also experienced light damage, and gusty winds downed about 1,000trees. Rough seas broke a large barge free from its mooring into a bridge on Florida Highway 528. In Flagler County, the hurricane caused severe damage to four homes, and minor damage to 173houses and 18businesses. Damage in northeastern Florida totaled to $51million.|$|E
5|$|In most battle situations, Aya is {{accompanied}} by a group of allied NPC (non-playable character) soldiers that the player can direct around the battle area. Available commands include offering supporting fire, directly attacking enemies, or staying behind cover. They can also all fire at the same enemy in certain situations, dealing high damage. Each NPC has a separate health meter, and is permanently removed from battle upon defeat. Central to combat is Overdive, an ability which enables Aya to transmit herself between bodies. If her health is low, Aya can transport into the body of an allied NPC, taking on their health level, position and current weapon in the process. NPCs not controlled by Aya are controlled by the game's AI. Aya can remain in a body for the duration of a level, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> unit has died. If Aya cannot jump to another body, she dies and the level must either be restarted or exited. Overdive can be activated at any time, enabling Aya to transport around the battlefield to avoid enemy attacks or save herself when her current unit's health is low. Overdive {{can also be used to}} attack enemies if Aya maintains a sustained assault. After a time, a triangle icon appears on enemies, allowing her to perform an Overdive attack, dealing high damage to the targeted enemy.|$|E

5|$|Play {{starts with}} a batter {{standing}} at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts {{to hit the ball}} with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (<b>or,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely {{as a direct result of}} a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> following breeding season.|$|E

25|$|There are traditions long {{associated}} with football games. Students growl like wildcats when {{the opposing team}} controls the ball, while simulating a paw with their hands.
