25|$|Hadith (reports of Muhammad's sayings {{and deeds}} from {{those close to}} him in his lifetime) on the subject are inconsistent, with {{different}} writers interpreting the Prophet in different ways. Shariah (Islamic law) defines sodomy outside marriage as adultery or fornication or both, and it thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars. In practice, few modern Muslim countries have legal systems based fully on Shariah, and {{an increasing number of}} Muslims do not look to shariah but to the Quran itself for moral guidance. For sodomy within marriage, the majority <b>of</b> <b>Shiite</b> interpreters hold that (1) anal intercourse, while strongly disliked, is not haram (forbidden) provided the wife agrees; and (2), if the wife does not agree, then it is preferable to refrain.|$|E
