50|$|If {{we wanted}} to {{retrieve}} all of the Orders for Customer 1234567890, we could query the database to return every row in the <b>Order</b> <b>table</b> with Customer ID 1234567890 and join the <b>Order</b> <b>table</b> to the Order Line table based on Order No.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{consider}} a database with two tables: a CUSTOMER table that includes all customer data and an <b>ORDER</b> <b>table</b> that includes all customer orders. Suppose the business requires that each order must {{refer to a}} single customer. To reflect this in the database, a foreign key column {{is added to the}} <b>ORDER</b> <b>table</b> (e.g., CUSTOMERID), which references the primary key of CUSTOMER (e.g. ID). Because the primary key of a table must be unique, and because CUSTOMERID only contains values from that primary key field, we may assume that, when it has a value, CUSTOMERID will identify the particular customer which placed the order. However, this can no longer be assumed if the <b>ORDER</b> <b>table</b> is not kept up to date when rows of the CUSTOMER table are deleted or the ID column altered, and working with these tables may become more difficult. Many real world databases work around this problem by 'inactivating' rather than physically deleting master table foreign keys, or by complex update programs that modify all references to a foreign key when a change is needed.|$|E

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of multi-touch, {{a new form of}} human computer interaction is introduced. Due to recent innovations multitouch technology has become affordable. Unlike interaction on a desktop computer multi-touch allows multiple users to interact with the same device at the same time. To demonstrate the vast possibilities of multi-touch technologies an ‘interactive RFID-based Multi-touch Device ’ can be constructed which can be utilised in a hotel. The objective of the project is to enhance the customer’s dining experience and to provide an enjoyable and user friendly interface thereby reducing human effort and time. The multi-touch table constructed is a camera based multi-touch device which is designed using front-side illumination technique. Card associated with a RFID tag will be used, priced to a specific amount which is issued to the customer at the reception desk. Each <b>order</b> <b>table</b> at the restaurant will have a multi-touch device along with the RFID reader.

40|$|Latin squares {{are well}} studied {{combinatorial}} objects. In this paper we generalize {{the concept and}} propose new objects like Latin triangles, free Latin squares, Latin tetrahedra, free Latin cubes, etc. We start with a classic definition of Latin squares followed by one based {{on the concept of}} latinized board. A Latin square appears then as a combinatorial design whose points are geometric and whose lines (the rows and columns) are invariant under the symmetries of the square. The generalization that follows proceeds by 1. broadening this geometric symmetry 2. considering more general configurations of points and 3. admitting lines that intersect more freely. The resulting concept is the Latin board. Finally, we particularize Latin boards to define Latin polytopes, Latin polygons and Latin polyhedra. Comment: 60 pages, 65 figures, LaTex.

40|$|Most {{techniques}} for managing relational schemas assume a given schema that adequately models the data [1]. H owever, {{we know that}} in practice, the semantics of the data may evolve over time and its schema (the data structures and constraints) is not always updated to reflect these changes [5]. Common examples include the overloading of tables to store facts of different types (for example, an <b>order</b> <b>table</b> originally designed to store service orders may be used to store various product orders as a company expands the scope of its business). Similarly, the semantics (typically represented as constraints) may evolve, perhaps because new data does not share the original semantics or because the full semantics were not captured in the original legacy design. Our long term research goal is to find {{techniques for}} discovering schemas that fit the data. In this work, we are taking an initial step toward this goal. Specifically, we are examining the benefits of using categorical clustering to discover groupings of tuples that share similar structural characteristics...|$|E

Its importance has been emphasized by Van Riper (1954), Westlake and Rutherford (1961), Boone (1971), and other authors. A {{review of the literature}} revealed three trials of sustained phonation have been utilized by most researchers to determine maximum duration of phonation. Additionally, the review revealed a lack of test-retest reliability in maximum phonation time in children. The present study was designed to determine the variability in test-retest of maximum duration of· sustained /a/ among prepubescent male and female children. Eighty subjects, twenty at each of the four age levels, seven, eight, nine and ten, were selected from a larger pool using a random <b>order</b> <b>table.</b> Each age level was further divided into two groups of ten male and ten female subjects. A tape recording of twenty maximum phonations of /a/. was obtained for each subject. A second measure of maximum phonation time was recorded between two weeks and a month following the original run. The essential questions of this investigation were: 1. Given the means of age and sex groups of the longest performance of maximum duration of sustained /a/, is there a significant difference between runs one and two? 2. In the test cohort does the rank order of maximum phonation time differ between runs one and two? The following secondary questions were also posed: 1. Is there a significantly greater duration of the longest sustained /a/ when given twenty trials as opposed to the first three trials? 2. Is there a relationship between sex and the duration of sustained /a/? 3. Given four prepubescent age groups, is age a factor in relation to length of phonation...|$|E
