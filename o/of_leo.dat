5|$|Bohemond died in April 1201. His son {{hurried to}} Antioch to attend his funeral. The commune proclaimed him prince, but many noblemen who {{remained}} loyal to Raymond-Roupen fled to Cilicia.

Leo invited Bohemond and his family to Bagras, saying {{that he wanted to}} start negotiations regarding the surrender of the fortress either to Antioch or to the Templars in early 1194. The meeting was a trap: Bohemond was captured and taken to Leo's capital, Sis.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, the {{independent}} Republic of Lucca came under French influence and adopted as its flag a horizontal tricolour with green uppermost; this lasted until 1801.

5|$|In 2010, Vesta reached {{opposition}} in the constellation <b>of</b> <b>Leo</b> {{on the night of}} 17–18 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visible in binocular range but generally not for the naked eye.

Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in the constellation of Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{precision}} of BeiDou orbit determination under the conditions of regional ground monitoring station and {{make good use of}} increasingly rich on-board data and upcoming ISL technology, a method of BeiDou precision orbit determination is proposed which combines the use of ground monitoring stations data, low earth orbit satellite(LEOs) data and Inter-Satellite Link(ISL) data. The effects of assisting data <b>of</b> <b>LEOs</b> and ISL on the precision orbit determination of navigation satellite are discussed. Simulation analysis is carried out mainly from the number <b>of</b> <b>LEOs,</b> orbit slot configuration and ISL. The results show that the orbit precision of BeiDou will greatly improve about 73 % with a small number <b>of</b> <b>LEOs,</b> while improvement <b>of</b> clock bias is not remarkable; the uniform orbit slot configuration of the same number <b>of</b> <b>LEOs</b> has a modest effect on the accuracy of combined orbit determination; compared with <b>LEOs,</b> the increase <b>of</b> ISL will significantly improve the accuracy of orbit determination with a higher efficiency...|$|R

5|$|Leo {{was dying}} when Raymond-Roupen came to Cilicia. Leo did not forgive his great-nephew and willed Cilicia to his five-year-old daughter, Isabella, in May 1219. Both Raymond-Roupen (the {{grandson}} <b>of</b> <b>Leo's</b> elder brother, Rupen) and John, King of Jerusalem (the husband <b>of</b> <b>Leo's</b> eldest daughter, Stephanie) {{refused to accept}} Leo's last will, claiming Cilicia for themselves.

5|$|Raymond died {{in early}} 1197, leaving a posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen. Raymond-Roupen's mother, Alice, was the niece <b>of</b> <b>Leo</b> I of Cilicia who persuaded the Antiochene noblemen to {{acknowledge}} Raymond-Roupen's right to succeed his grandfather. However, the Latin and Greek burghers proclaimed Bohemond heir to his father. After {{his father died}} in April 1201, Bohemond seized Antioch {{with the support of}} the burghers, the Knights Templar and Hospitallers, and the Italian merchants.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the March 1605 {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the only ones that were seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici.

Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but this occurred after the election <b>of</b> <b>Leo</b> XI, and the cardinals did not view the veto as valid.|$|E

5|$|The tide {{began to}} turn again after 920. Coincidentally, the same year {{witnessed}} the ascension of an admiral, Romanos Lekapenos (920–944), to the imperial throne, for the second (after Tiberios Apsimaros) and last time in the Empire's history. Finally, in 923, the decisive defeat <b>of</b> <b>Leo</b> of Tripoli off Lemnos, coupled {{with the death of}} Damian during a siege of a Byzantine fortress in the next year, {{marked the beginning of the}} Byzantine resurgence.|$|E
5|$|After {{the move}} to Exeter, Leofric worked to {{increase}} the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found almost empty upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only five books owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained on good terms with the king, for he was present at Edward's Christmas court in 1065 that saw the consecration of Edward's Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, nor does Leofric appear to have attended any papal councils or synods. He was {{a supporter of the}} cult <b>of</b> <b>Leo</b> IX, who was proclaimed a saint after Leo's death.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} Ivy League pitcher focus, Krichell also {{unearthed}} several position players. He signed Charlie Keller, a highly touted prospect {{playing for the}} University of Maryland. To encourage Keller to sign, Krichell met and had dinner with his family. In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who had tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them {{on the grounds that}} he was too small. Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and was impressed by the way Rizzuto accomplished double plays; his technique reminded Krichell <b>of</b> <b>Leo</b> Durocher, one of his favorite players. He signed Rizzuto for $75 a month and sent him to the Yankees' farm club in Bassett, Virginia.|$|E
