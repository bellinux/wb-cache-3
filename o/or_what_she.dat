25|$|As {{traditional}} folklore {{tends to}} portray Wu {{as a power}} hungry woman with no care for who she hurt <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did, the most popular theory is that Wu killed her own child in order to implicate Wang. Other schools of thought argue that Wang indeed killed the child out of jealousy and hatred toward Wu since Wang had no children of her own. The third argument is that the child died of asphyxiation or crib death, considering that the ventilation systems of the time were non-existent or of poor quality. Lack of ventilation combined with using coal as a heating method {{could lead to a}} build-up of fumes that would lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. No matter what caused the death of the child, Wu blamed Wang for it and Wang was removed from her position as empress.|$|E

I think the real idea of the video is in a moment like that— in a private moment like that, she can never be by herself... This song is not about someone who feels those emotions, it's about Beyoncé feeling those emotions. It's {{personal}} to her. It's her that cannot be by herself no matter where she goes <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does, because she's who she is." ...|$|E
500|$|As a {{displaced}} girl, Maya's pain is worsened by {{an awareness}} of her displacement. [...] She is [...] "the forgotten child", and must {{come to terms with}} [...] "the unimaginable reality" [...] of being unloved and unwanted; she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced – her belief in her own ugliness was [...] "absolute". McPherson believes that the concept of family, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> calls [...] "kinship concerns", in Angelou's books must be understood {{in the light of the}} children's displacement at the beginning of Caged Bird. Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2010, {{there was}} a sudden surge in suicide rates amongst gay {{teenagers}} in the United States. In September 2010, at least six adolescents took their lives due to factors related to gay bullying. After reading about the surge of gay teen suicides, Kesha was inspired to write [...] "We R Who We R", along with Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, and Jacob Kasher Hindlin. Production of the song was completed by Luke alongside Blanco and Ammo. After being nominated for the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Kesha elaborated on the song's initial inspiration. She stated that she was concerned with today's society, criticizing the fact that people have to hide themselves and pretend to be someone other than who they are. Regarding her music she said that it was not for everyone, claiming that she is a misfit in society and not everyone understands her <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> stands for.|$|E
500|$|Butters and Fazekas {{stated that}} Underwood [...] "doesn’t quite {{understand}} what it’s {{like to be}} a normal woman" [...] after her upbringing in the program, and is intrigued by Carter. Regan elaborated that [...] "she’s never seen anyone like [...] before and she’s never been beaten before. There’s this competitive but playful obsession with her" [...] which is seen with Underwood's [...] "flirtation" [...] and [...] "feminine prowess". Regan continued, [...] "She knows that to be on top she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie does want to get under her skin. She tries to make her feel uncomfortable and that might be with a look or a glance <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> says." [...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin." [...] After Carter defeats Underwood and Leviathan in the first season, Underwood becomes [...] "a lone wolf ... she’s a woman without a country right now, but she is more involved in the [...] case" [...] for the second season than it initially appears.|$|E
500|$|Gather Together, {{like much}} of African-American literature, depicts Rita's search for self-discovery, identity, and dignity in the {{difficult}} environment of racism, and how she, like other African Americans, were able to rise above it. [...] Rita's search is expressed both outwardly, through her material needs, and inwardly, through love and family relationships. [...] In Caged Bird, despite trauma and parental rejection, Rita's world is relatively secure, but the adolescent young woman in Gather Together experiences the dissolution of her relationships many times. The loneliness that ensues for her is [...] "a loneliness that becomes, at times, suicidal and contributes to her unanchored self". Rita is unsure of who she is <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would become, so she tries several roles in a restless and frustrated way, as adolescents often do {{during this period of}} their lives. Her experimentation was part of her self-education that would successfully bring her into maturity and adulthood. Lupton agrees, stating that Rita survived through trial and error while defining herself as a Black woman. Angelou recognizes that the mistakes she depicts are part of [...] "the fumblings of youth and to be forgiven as such", but young Rita insists that she take responsibility for herself and her child.|$|E
5000|$|Head {{writer and}} {{executive}} producer Steven Moffat said about having Williams on Doctor Who, [...] "We're thrilled to have Maisie Williams joining us on Doctor Who. It's not possible to say too much about who <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> playing, but {{she is going to}} challenge the Doctor in very unexpected ways. This time he might just be out of his depth, and we know Maisie is going to give him exactly the right sort of hell." ...|$|R

500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1987, Ronstadt {{released}} Canciones de Mi Padre, {{an album}} of traditional Mexican folk songs, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has described as [...] "world class songs". [...] Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia. Her musical arranger was mariachi musician Rubén Fuentes.|$|E
2500|$|Woolf's [...] "Modern Fiction" [...] essay {{focuses on}} how writers should write <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> hopes {{for them to}} write. Woolf does not suggest a {{specific}} way to write instead she wants writers to simply write what interests {{them in any way}} that they choose to write. Woolf suggests, “Any method is right, every method is right, that expresses what we wish to express, if we are writers; that brings us closer to the novelist's intention if we are readers". Woolf wanted writers to express themselves {{in such a way that}} it showed life as it should be seen not as [...] "a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged". She set out to inspire writers of modern fiction by calling for originality, criticizing those who focused on the unimportant things, and comparing the differences of cultural authors, all for the sake of fiction and literature.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{an account}} first {{published}} in 1999 by the widely cited newsletter Taylorology, on October 21, 1964, while still living in Hollywood, Gibson suffered a heart attack. Sensing that she was dying, a highly distraught Gibson—a recently converted Roman Catholic—asked for a priest and then confessed to neighbors the February 1, 1922 murder of Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor. She may have made statements about a motive but in 1999, the only surviving witness to this incident wrote that at the time, he was young, distracted by the immediate crisis of her heart attack, {{had no knowledge of}} who William Desmond Taylor was <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was talking about. As a result, he could not remember many further details about what Gibson said as she lay dying on the kitchen floor of her small house. The witness did recall Gibson also said she had been [...] "nearly caught" [...] and had [...] "fled the country".|$|E
2500|$|Bayonetta {{takes place}} in Vigrid, a fictional city in Europe. [...] The title {{character}} (voiced by Hellena Taylor) is a witch who shapeshifts and uses various firearms, along with magical attacks she performs with her own hair by summoning demons to dispatch her foes. She awakens after a 500-year sleep near Eggman's tombstone and finds herself in an unfamiliar area with no memories of who <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is. Over time, she begins to remember what caused her current predicament. 500 years before the incident that caused Bayonetta's memory loss, there were two factions preserving the balance between darkness and light in the world: the Umbra Witches, who are followers of darkness, and their counterparts, the Lumen Sages, who are followers of light. [...] The factions shared two distinct treasures, the 'Eyes of the World' (separately named the 'Left Eye' and the 'Right Eye') which they used to oversee the just passage of time. Both factions mysteriously disappeared from Vigrid under unknown circumstances. Bayonetta still has an ornate piece of jewelry which contains a small red gem, and believes this gem is the Left Eye of the World. While searching for the Right Eye, she often receives flashbacks that make her remember what caused her current predicament.|$|E
