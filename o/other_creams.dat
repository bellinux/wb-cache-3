5000|$|Molluscum Contagiosum {{is caused}} a DNA {{poxvirus}} called the molluscum contagiosum virus. For adults, molluscum infections are often sexually transmitted, but in wrestling, it is spread either through direct contact or through contact with shared {{items such as}} gear or towels. Molluscum Contagiosum can be identified by pink bulbous growths that contain the virus. These typically grow to be 1-5 millimeters in diameter, and last from 6 to 12 months without treatment and without leaving scars. Some growths may remain for up to 4 years. [...] Treatment for Molluscun Contagiosum must bedesignated by a healthcare professional {{because they can be}} dangerous. Usuallyfor treatment liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze the molluscum off but other methods include <b>other</b> <b>creams</b> that burn the warts off, or oral medications.|$|E

The video starts with a woman (played by member Kim Hyuna) and her boyfriend (Jung-shin) sitting on a couch and talking; she notices how much he has changed, but he stands up and walks off. Soon afterwards, she and the other 4Minute members are at a club when she notices her boyfriend is talking with another woman. She and 4Minute then plan all sorts of mischief for revenge including spraying his sandwich, replacing his toothpaste and shaving cream with <b>other</b> <b>creams,</b> delivering inappropriate items to his workplace, making his car not start, dropping a large fake spider while he {{is sitting on the}} couch, and getting him arrested using edited photos.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of the total proteose-peptone (TPP) fraction on some physico-chemical properties of recombined cream was studied. Oil-in-water emulsions, 30 % or 20 % (w/w) fat, were prepared using only the dairy components buttermilk, milkfat and TPP. The effect of different concentrations of TPP on droplet size, creaming stability, flow behaviour, viscosity and whippability of recombined creams was tested. Of the different creams, those containing 2 % (w/w) or more TPP were more viscous, showed different flow behaviour, and had improved stability and whippability compared with the <b>other</b> <b>creams.</b> The modifications in physico-chemical properties appeared to be driven by changes in particle size distribution caused by droplet aggregation. The percentage of fat also influenced the properties of the final product. It may therefore be possible to obtain desirable modifications in recombined cream using only dairy ingredients.

40|$|The role of milk serum {{proteins}} {{in the development}} of foam structure during the whipping of 38 % fat cream was investigated. Proteins were removed from the aqueous phase by washing the cream with simulated milk ultrafiltrate. The natural protein complement was replaced with either casein or whey protein preparations. When creams with different protein compositions were whipped to a defined end point the structural properties of the foams were similar but removal of protein caused a 50 % reduction in whipping time. <b>Other</b> <b>creams</b> were whipped for fixed times of between 30 and 180 seconds to investigate the development and formation of the foam structure. This was greatly influenced by the protein composition. The presence of whey protein resulted in an initial lag phase in structure development, which was not so apparent when the added protein was casein. The lag phase was attributed to differences in structure of globular and disordered proteins and their behaviour at interfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} {{contains many}} {{references to the}} wide range of uses of rosin-based polymers, but little has appeared in the area of rosin-based polymers used as cream bases. Various rosin polymers based on glycerol, sorbitol, and pentaerythritol were prepared and screened for efficacy as cream bases. Among these polymers, polymer 2 (glycerol-based) is reported in the present study as it produced creams with a better stability and release profile as compared to <b>other</b> <b>creams.</b> The creams were formulated employing polymer 2 (P 2) and Tween 60 as surfactants. The stability of the prepared creams, as well as the diclofenac diethylammonium release pattern, was investigated using particle size analysis, conductivity, relative dielectric constant, spreadability, and irritation potential measurement, and was compared with that of creams containing Tween 60 (RT) prepared in the laboratory. The release of the drug, diclofenac diethylammonium, was measured after eight hours and compared with a standard cream (RT) and a marketed cream (RM) ...|$|E
