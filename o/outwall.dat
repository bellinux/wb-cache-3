50|$|The Keep {{was over}} 50 ft high, with 5 stories and a spiral stair; in c.1908 only the <b>outwall</b> {{and parts of}} the {{southern}} wall remained; it shows architectural indicators dating it to the 14th of 15th centuries. To the east of the keep was a three story residence, probably 16th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{battle to}} control the ruins of Osgiliath had {{actually}} been fought, on and off, {{for over a century}} since the fall of Ithilien to Mordor. Minas Tirith was surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a fortified wall encircling the Pelennor Fields and meeting up with Osgiliath, where the Causeway Forts were built and garrisoned, though Osgiliath itself remained in ruins. This <b>outwall</b> fell into disrepair as the kingdom declined.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{research}} consists in development of engineering solutions {{to be used in}} the production of prefabricated wall panels made of a composite material that consists wood chips. The authors have also developed a theoretical grounding, compositions and technological concepts of a composite material comprising wood chips and various types of binders. The authors also provide their findings associated with the laboratory-based manufacturing and completion of partially prefabricated w all panels followed by the assembly of a pilot residential house comprising one flat. This concept contemplates the manufacturing of wall panels to be made of a composite material comprising wood chips. The structure has a permanent wood shuttering designated for prefabricated low-rise buildings that have a supplementary effective insulation system and external finishing. Structural solutions implemented in wall panels are based on the engineering solution of a prefabricated low-rise building and of their <b>outwalls</b> that have several layers. <b>Outwalls</b> have one layer of a composite material comprising wood chips, one layer of an effective insulation material, internal and external finishing. Содержание исследований соотносится с разработкой научных и инженерных решений изготовления стеновых панелей на основе композита из древесной щепы. Научно обоснованы и разработаны составы и технологические принципы получения композита из древесной щепы на различных вариантах связующего. Представлены результаты лабораторного и полузаводского изготовления стеновых панелей с последующей сборкой из них одноквартирного опытно-экспериментального дома...|$|R
5000|$|The first Ming emperor was proclaimed in 1368 and a {{great deal}} of {{preparation}} was done prior to this to have an imperial city and all the imperial trappings ready. The name of the city was changed again to Yingtianfu (responding to heaven). A [...] "new city" [...] was built to the east of the old one to be used as a new palace or [...] "forbidden" [...] city. This city was laid out in much the same pattern as Beijing; indeed Nanjing’s was the pattern for Beijing’s Forbidden City.In expanding the walls, it appears the Hongwu Emperor intended initially to simply add a bulge to the existing walls and encompass the New City to the east. The main north gate would have been the Drum Tower. However, it was decided to bring Lion Hill to the northwest into the city defences for strategic reasons, and this almost doubled the area the walls would encompass. In addition to the surviving walls of stone and brick, an <b>outwall</b> was built along the river and to the south as an additional defensive measure. Old maps show that there were close to twenty gates in this rammed earth wall. This <b>outwall</b> is long gone, but the names of the gates survive as local place names. Part of the wall on the south shore of Xuanwu Lake was built on the foundations of the old Stone City walls from the Six Dynasties period, and reused many of the bricks from that old wall.|$|E
5000|$|Transylvania also {{developed}} fortified towns extensively during the Middle Ages; their urban growth respected principles of functionality (the usual pattern {{is a central}} market place with a church, narrow streets with sides linked here and there by archways): the cities of Sighişoara, Sibiu and Braşov are remarkable examples in that sense. Building greatly developed in Moldavia, too. A great number of fortresses were built or rebuilt {{during the reign of}} Moldavia's greatest prince, Stephen the Great (1457-1504). Suceava, Neamţ, Hotin, Soroca and others were raised and successfully withstood the sieges laid in the course of time by Sultan Mehmet II, the conqueror of Constantinople, by the kings of Poland and Hungary. [...] It was during his time that the Moldavian style, of great originality and stylistic unity, developed, by blending Gothic elements with the Byzantine structure specific to the churches. Among such constructions, the monumental church of the Neamţ Monastery served, for more than a century, as a model for Moldavian churches and monasteries. The style was continued in the 16th century, during the rule of Stephen the Great's son, Petru Rareş (1527-1538, 1541-1546). The main innovation was the porch and the <b>outwall</b> paintings (the churches of Voroneţ, Suceviţa, Moldoviţa monasteries). These churches of Northern Moldavia have become famous worldwide, due to the beauty of their painted elegant shapes that can be seen from afar.|$|E
