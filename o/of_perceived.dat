5|$|After {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>perceived</b> provocations from Prussia, {{culminating}} in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which {{he was supposed to}} fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.|$|E

5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha).

5|$|Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination.

It is still used in all multi-dose vials of flu vaccines in the U.S. In the context <b>of</b> <b>perceived</b> increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism.|$|E

In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{visual system}} has a {{remarkable}} ability to reconstruct 3 -D structure from moving 2 -D features. The processing of structure from motion is generally thought {{to consist of}} two stages. First, the direction and speed of features is measured (2 -D velocity measurement) and, second, 3 -D structure is reconstructed from the measured 2 -D velocities (3 -D structure recovery). Most models have assumed that these stages occur in a bottom ^ up fashion. Here, however, we present evidence that the 3 -D structure-recovery stage influences the 2 -D velocity-measurement stage. We developed a stimulus in which two perceptual modes of motion correspondence (one-way translation versus oscillation), and two perceptual modes of 3 -D surface structure (flat surface versus cylinder) could be achieved. We found that the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>perceiving</b> both one-way motion and cylindrical structure increased in similar ways with increasing frame duration. In subsequent experiments we found, first, that a higher likelihood <b>of</b> <b>perceiving</b> one-way motion {{did not affect the}} likelihood <b>of</b> <b>perceiving</b> cylindrical structure; and, second, that a higher likelihood <b>of</b> <b>perceiving</b> cylindrical structure increased the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>perceiving</b> one-way motion. These results suggest that the higher, 3 -D structure-recovery stage may influence the lower, 2 -D motioncorrespondence stage. This result is not in accordance with most computational models that assume that there is only one-way, feedforward information processing from the 2 -D velocity (energy) measurement stage to the 3 -D structure-recovery stage. Perhaps, one of the roles of feedback processing is to seek consensus of the information processed in different stages. ...|$|R
