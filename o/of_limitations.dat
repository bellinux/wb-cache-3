5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E

40|$|There {{are four}} issues when the law <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> periods is {{mandatory}}: Firstly, the public interests, which the law <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> periods {{can help to}} protect, cannot {{be the basis of}} the mandatory nature of the law <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> periods, because these interests are relatively weaker than other interests protected by law. Secondly, the mandatory nature of the law <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> periods shapes it as an unchangeable norm group, which is in contradiction with some specific rules of the law <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> periods. Thirdly, according to legal practices, the contractual agreement about limitation periods cannot easily jeopardize the public interests protected by the law <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> periods. On the contrary, the mandatory nature <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> periods will not only frustrate the reasonable expectations of the parties, but also induce bad faith behaviors, and trigger the trust crisis of the society. Lastly, the legislations in comparative law cannot be used as evidence for Section 2 of “Provisions of the Law <b>of</b> <b>Limitation</b> Periods”. Instead, they reveal the crisis of the mandatory nature of the law <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> periods. In the context that the law <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> periods should be dispositive, some boundaries can be set to meet special needs of the parties under special circumstances...|$|R

50|$|Von Neumann {{proved that}} the axiom <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> size implies the axiom of replacement, which can be {{expressed}} as: If F is a function and A is a set, then F(A) is a set. This is proved by contradiction. Let F be a function and A be a set. Assume that F(A) is a proper class. Then there is a function G that maps F(A) onto V. Since the composite function G ∘ F maps A onto V, the axiom <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> size implies that A is a proper class, which contradicts A being a set. Therefore, F(A) is a set. Since the axiom of replacement implies the axiom of separation, the axiom <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> size implies the axiom of separation.|$|R
40|$|Limitation as a {{legal fact}} Legal {{institute}} <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> {{has been a part}} of the legal system since the days of Roman law, yet it is not a legal relic, which in the modern concept of rights had their place. Limitation is a legal institute that is an integral part of modern legislation and whose meaning in law is a proven tradition of more than fifteen hundred years. The aim of this thesis is to give a comprehensive explanation about the institute <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> in civil law. This thesis divided into five chapters approaches the status <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> among other legal facts, subjecting it to a thorough analysis, gives the view on the concept <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> de lege lata and its evolution in our country through historic civil law codification and compares its approach with adjustments in selected European countries.

5|$|The long {{investigation}} {{time span}} was causing {{problems for the}} prosecutors as {{an increasing number of}} the counts were meeting their statutes <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b> The police announced in September 1973 that they were working on indictments towards Tjøntveit and two of the creditors who placed their representatives on the board after the company was insolvent. The police investigation was concluded in May 1975. By then, the statutes <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> for the accounting issues had passed, and the police focused on the more serious charge of debt manipulation. Tjøntveit and two board members were indicted in 1976. The managing committee for the winding-up released its report in November 1977; the report concluded that although the company's books showed assets of NOK8.6 million, in reality it only had fifty Norwegian krone. The committee further criticized the company for having too low a share capital, lack of qualified management and insufficient competence in operation and management of large aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that the statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> would not begin to run.

5|$|Controversy emerged over Entrance 2's {{location}} in February 2011, when a lawsuit was {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers over the location of Entrance 2. The entrances, planned to service 3,600 people an hour, were alleged in the lawsuit to be destroying {{the quality of life}} for building tenants, if the entrances were to be built in the location. The lawsuit was later dismissed because the suit had been filed two years after the FTA's FONSI was published, which was past the statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b> A new lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2013, after the MTA started construction on the entrances. In June 2013, that lawsuit was also dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|Federal law {{states that}} {{national}} parks {{will have the}} same underage laws as the state that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage drinking statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent can serve alcohol to their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage drinking and serving alcohol to a minor are federal misdemeanors, punishable by a fine and up to 6 months in jail. There is a five-year statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> for DUI, underage drinking, and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves.|$|E
5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing {{to a lack of}} evidence. The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling of the case and deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> on murder.|$|E

Many activists were disappointed to learn that the statute <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days.
