40|$|A {{company could}} grow up {{steadily}} and create different values {{if it makes}} use of resource efficiently. In the growing process of the digital content industry, using resources efficiently and investing innovation activities are the essential factors in operation performance, R&D performance, and human performance. We build the research framework based on the resource-based theory in accordance with innovative technology and human resource, and explore the effect of resources on the performances about sustained advantage. The paper adopts the method of case study to investigate current situations {{about the relationship between}} resource features and performance in digital content industry. The result shows six propositions. (1) An <b>organization</b> <b>with</b> valuable, rare, and imperfectly imitable product upgrade could be superior operation performance. (2) An <b>organization</b> <b>with</b> valuable, rare, and imperfectly imitable IP rights could be superior operation performance. (3) An <b>organization</b> <b>with</b> valuable and rare disruptive innovation could be superior R&D performance. (4) An <b>organization</b> <b>with</b> valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substitute R&D input could be superior R&D performance. (5) The staff of an <b>organization</b> <b>with</b> valuable and imperfectly imitable skill could be superior human performance. (6) The staff of an <b>organization</b> <b>with</b> valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable knowledge could be superior human performance...|$|R

5|$|During the 1973–1975 biennium, {{pressure}} {{was put on}} Kappa Kappa Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of {{an equal number of}} members from Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two <b>organizations,</b> <b>with</b> the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger—Kappa Kappa Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. With the idea of a merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.|$|E
5|$|The Fasci {{movement}} {{was made up}} of a federation of scores of associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers. The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land. Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous <b>organizations</b> <b>with</b> their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses. They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) because everyone can break a single stick, but no one can break a bundle of sticks.|$|E

5|$|When Soviet troops, {{pursuant}} to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine. Many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was {{to ensure that the}} occupied areas voted for union with the USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that their new territories would elect assemblies which would unanimously petition for union with the USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) on 1 November 1939. Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian <b>organizations</b> <b>with</b> Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (kolkhozes) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity.|$|E
