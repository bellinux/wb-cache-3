40|$|The goal of {{the present}} paper is to {{evaluate}} {{the status of the}} protection of consumer right to information before the purchase from Romanian <b>online</b> <b>stores.</b> The perspective focuses on technical consumer goods. The research pursued two major objectives. The former consisted in analysing the compliance of the <b>online</b> <b>stores</b> with the provisions of article 6 paragraph 1 of the Directive 2011 / 83 /EU on consumer rights, relative to the information provided to potential buyers before the purchase. The latter was to identify the consumer awareness of the rights stipulated by article 6 of the directive, as well as to study the opinions of consumers relative to the information that <b>online</b> <b>stores</b> are compelled to supply before purchase. The first objective was accomplished by applying the content analysis method to the information available on the Web for a sample of 100 <b>online</b> <b>stores.</b> The second objective was achieved through the survey method on a sample of 351 persons from the 25 to 34 age group, residing in Bucharest. Compared to other studies, the major contributions of the present research approach are the following: the investigation of an extensive sample of online stores; the wider range of products; the focus on both <b>online</b> <b>stores</b> and consumers. The results show that improvements are needed in the level of compliance and in the consumer awareness of own rights...|$|R
