40|$|Cloud-based systems get changed more {{frequently}} than traditional systems. These frequent changes involve sporadic operations such as installation and upgrade. Sporadic operations on cloud manipulate cloud resources and they are prone to unpredictable and inevitable failures largely due to cloud uncertainty. To recover from failures in sporadic operations on cloud, we need cloud <b>operational</b> <b>recovery</b> strategies. Existing <b>operational</b> <b>recovery</b> methods on cloud have several drawbacks, such as poor generalizability of the exception handling mechanism and the coarse-grained recovery manner of rollback mechanisms. Hence, this thesis proposes a novel and innovative recovery approach, called POD-Recovery, for sporadic operations on cloud. One novelty of POD-Recovery {{is that it is}} based on eight cloud <b>operational</b> <b>recovery</b> requirements formulated by us (e. g. recovery time objective satisfaction and recovery generalizability). Another novelty of POD-Recovery is that it is non-intrusive and does not modify the code which implements the sporadic operation. POD-Recovery works in the following innovative way: it first treats a sporadic operation as a process which provides the workflow of the operation and the contextual information for each operational step. Then, it identifies the recovery points (where failure detection and recovery should be performed) inside the sporadic operation, determines the unified resource space (the resource types required and manipulated by the sporadic operation), and generates the expected resource state templates (the abstraction level of resource states) for all operational steps. For a given recovery point inside the sporadic operation, POD-Recovery first filters the applicable recovery patterns from the eight recovery patterns it supports and then automatically generates the recovery actions for the applicable recovery patterns. Next, it evaluates the generated applicable recovery actions based on the metrics of Recovery Time, Recovery Cost and Recovery Impact. This quantitative evaluation leads to the selection of an acceptable recovery action for execution for a given recovery point. We implement POD-Recovery and evaluate it by recovering from faults injected into five representative types of sporadic operations on cloud. The experimental results show that POD-Recovery is able to perform <b>operational</b> <b>recovery</b> while satisfying all the recovery requirements and it improves on the existing recovery methods for cloud operations...|$|E

In 2010 the average <b>operational</b> cost <b>recovery</b> was 105%, varying from 46% to 130% in Mulonga. According to one study, higher levels of cost recovery are impeded by a high level of non-revenue water (44% in 2010) and low collection efficiency due to a large extent to the non-payment of water bills by public institutions.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into rural credit delivery system in Maharashtra shows slower growth in institutional finances through commercial banks, credit cooperatives, RRBs and LDBs, {{particularly during the}} decade of 1991 - 2000, which is mainly due to adverse environment created by the financial sector reforms. Due to unfavourable policy framework, the entire rural credit delivery system is reduced to a moribund state. High transaction costs and poor repayment performance are the twin root causes of the moribund state of rural credit delivery system. With a view to revive the agricultural credit delivery system, there is need to adopt innovative approaches like linking of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) with mainstream financial institutions. The revival of rural credit delivery system of Maharashtra also depends on strategies that are required for tackling issues such as sustainability and viability, <b>operational</b> efficiency, <b>recovery</b> performance, small farmer coverage and balanced sectoral development of the state. ...|$|R

The concept and general economic benefits of SRM recovery are equally valid for the series-burn SRMs, provided that those SRMs are also designed for the same strength, stiffness, segmentation, and interchangeability as the present design, and that those SRMs are also recovered as individual units. Feasibility studies were initiated to investigate SRM recoverability. These studies were based upon recovery of the SRM boosters for the Titan 3 C. Ground rules precluded SRM modification that required significant changes in motor qualification or schedule. Even with this restriction, the study determined that the recoverable booster concept was completely feasible, both technically and economically. Parachute recovery has been selected as the best method, principally because it can accomplish the task with a minimum development cost and time to achieve <b>operational</b> <b>recovery</b> status.

40|$|The RFIs {{operating}} in Maharashtra {{have not only}} shown slower growth in their loan advances and other operational indicators during the period between 1991 and 2000 but also poor performance thereafter. The credit cooperatives in particular have shown significantly high NPAs in Maharashtra. In Maharashtra, Vidarbha region not only shows very low magnitudes of credit flow through cooperatives but also decline in share of loan for cotton crop vis-à-vis other field crops. One of the adverse effects of slowing down in loan advances for cotton crop is seen on the farming community of this region where {{a significant number of}} cotton growers have committed suicide either due to lack of loan advances to them or because of pressure created by various financial institutions in terms of recovery of loan despite crop failure.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} regards the studies of strategies for regeneration large residential settlements in the urban peripheries that were constructed {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century. These settlements, being subjected to a high level of social, technical, and functional deterioration, have their origins mostly in housing policies implemented during the post-WWII recovery period by public authorities to meet the intense demand for public housing through the urban planning of areas that were, at the time, peripheries but have since been absorbed by the urban fabric. The existing buildings in question were planned and constructed with no attention having been paid to energy issues from the points of view of both heating and natural illumination as well as ventilation, relying on non-renewable sources of energy to maintain adequate interior levels of comfort. The primary objective is to elaborate multidisciplinary analyses of strategies that include different yet complementary aspects of the construction attributes, such as: sustainability, energy efficiency, usability, accessibility, and multipurpose functions. Monitoring and control tools will be analysed in the research for specific renovation actions and programmes, with particular reference to those based on forms of partnership between public and private entities. The expected result is the elaboration of strategies and reflection for regeneration interventions, gathered from case studies but offering wide-scale applications on public housing complexes, including criteria, regulations, and requalification principles.

40|$|The airline crew pairing problem (CPP) {{is one of}} the {{classical}} problems in airline operations research due to its crucial impact on the cost structure of an airline. Moreover, the complex crew regulations and the large scale of the resulting mathematical programming models have rendered it an academically interesting problem over decades. The CPP is a tactical problem, typically solved over a monthly planning horizon, with the objective of creating a set of crew pairings so that every ight in the schedule is covered, where a crew pairing refers to a sequence of ights operated by a single crew starting and ending at the same crew base. This paper discusses how an airline may hedge against a certain type of operational disruption by incorporating robustness into the pairings generated at the planning level. In particular, we address how a set of extra fights may be added into the fight schedule at the time of operation by modifying the pairings at hand and without delaying or canceling the existing fights in the schedule. We assume that the set of potential extra fights and their associated departure time windows areknown at the planning stage. We note that this study was partially motivated during our interactions with the smaller local airlines in Turkey which sometimes have to add extra fights to their schedule at short notice, e. g., charter fights. These airlines can typically estimate the potential time windows of the extra fights based on their past experiences, but prefer to ignore this information during planning since these flights may not need to be actually operated. Typically, these extra flights are then handled by recovery procedures at the time of operation which may lead to substantial deviations from the planned crew pairings and costs. The reader is referred to [3] for an in-depth discussion of the conceptual framework of this problem which we refer to as the Robust Crew Pairing for Managing Extra Flights (RCPEF). In [3], the authors introduce how an extra flight may be accommodated by modifying the existing pairings and introduce a set of integer programming models that provide natural recovery options without disrupting the existing flights. These recovery options are available at the planning stage and render <b>operational</b> <b>recovery</b> procedures that pertain to crew pairing unnecessar...|$|E

Four organizing domains of recovery are proposed: (1) Traditional Recovery; (2) Addictions Recovery; (3) New Recovery; and (4) Mutual Recovery. One of the challenges of providing mental health services efficiently is to consider which method of recovery is most suited to the needs of different service users. By comparing and organizing different recovery modalities, it is possible to consider the best fit between client and modality. For example, there is a necessary demarcation between clients who are amenable to recovery, and those who are harder to engage.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P LMS 2016 Yangxv, 185 pages :illustrationsThis {{research}} employs two perspectives (i. e. {{continuous process}} improvement perspective and frontline employee perspective) {{to develop a}} new approach, operational improvement competence (OIC), and explores new, useful, empirically-based insights into the effectiveness of OIC in improving <b>operational,</b> service <b>recovery</b> and new service development performance. OIC is conceptualized as an operational team's ability to use a process perspective and structured methods to continuously improve operational activities and comprises three operational practices 1) continuous improvement; 2) process management; and 3) structured methods. However, the operational environment of service firms is often more dynamic and challenging than that of manufacturing firms so that the effectiveness of OIC in service operations may be affected by certain characteristics concerning service processes, employee characteristics and contextual factors. To offer useful insights into the challenges of OIC adoption in service operations, we conduct three empirical studies as follows: Study 1, guided by the operations management (OM) literature and agency theory, proposes that the effectiveness of OIC in operational performance in service operations is contingent on two factors, namely operations control and process control formality. Specifically, we theorize that operations control enhances the effectiveness of OIC by suppressing frontline service employees' discretion in service processes and guiding them to follow proper procedures to perform OIC activities. In addition, when there are high levels of ethical risks, operations control will become particularly important. Study 2 examines the impact of OIC on new service development (NSD) performance. Since creative ideas are crucial to NSD and it is common that service firms involve frontline employees in the process of NSD, we argue that frontline employees' creativity enhances NSD performance. In addition, since OIC pertains to making changes and solving problems regularly, we argue that OIC has a positive impact on employee creativity. Furthermore, we draw on the contingency theory to argue that the relationships between OIC, employee creativity, and NSD performance are contingent on team's characteristics and contextual environment. Study 3 argues that OIC leads to improved service recovery performance. However, the effectiveness of OIC in enhancing service recovery performance can be hindered by one common problem in service employees, namely stress. We draw on the role stress theory and the conservation of resources theory to argue that the negative impact of stress can be alleviated by job resources, including organization inducement and psychological resilience. Thus, we propose that frontline employees' stress and two types of job resources (i. e. organization inducement and psychological resilience) can moderate the effectiveness of OIC in improving service recovery performance. Based on data from 146 frontline teams in the banking industry of China, we empirically test the posited hypotheses of these three studies. The main contribution of this research lies in its consideration on the job characteristics of frontline service employees and use of several relevant theories to ascertain the intricacies between OIC and performance outcomes with respect to <b>operational</b> performance, service <b>recovery</b> performance and NSD performance.

Also, the performance of different <b>operational</b> conditions and <b>recovery</b> scenarios can be compared. The mechanisms behind different recovery methods are studied by analyzing {{the relative importance of}} driving forces, such as viscous and capillary forces, in the form of dimensionless numbers. There are different definitions of the dimensionless variables in the literature (Abrams 1975; Alipour Tabrizy 2014; Brownell and Katz 1947; Dombrowski and Brownell 1954; Foster 1973; Green and Willhite 1998; Kulkarni and Rao 2006; Moore and Slobod 1955; Pennell et al. 1996; Rostami et al. 2010, 2018; Srivastava et al. 2016; Talluru and Wu 2017; Trivedi and Babadagli 2008; Wood et al. 2006).

40|$|Background: Disaster {{recovery}} {{is a complex}} phenomenon. Too often, {{recovery is}} measured in singular fashion, such as quantifying rebuilt infrastructure or lifelines, without taking in to account the affected population’s individual and community recovery. A comprehensive framework is needed that encompasses a much broader and far-reaching construct with multiple underlying dimensions and numerous causal pathways; without the consideration of a comprehensive framework that investigates relationships between these factors, an accu-rate measurement of recovery may not be valid. This study proposes a model that encapsulates these ideas into a single framework, the Socio-Ecological Model of Recovery. Methods: Using confirmatory factor analysis, an <b>operational</b> measure of <b>recovery</b> was developed and validated using the five measures of housing stability, economic stability, physical health, mental health, and social role adapta-tion. The data were drawn from a sample of displaced households following Hurricane Katrina. Measures of psy-chological strength, risk, disaster exposure, neighborhood contextual effects, and formal and informal help were modeled to examine their direct and indirect effects on recovery using a structural equation model.

Two hundred seventy-four early young psychiatric patients from the Chicago Followup Study, in-cluding 64 schizophrenia patients, 12 schizophreniform patients, 81 other psychotic patients, and 117 nonpsy-chotic patients, were assessed as inpatients and then reas-sessed 5 times over 15 years. Patients were evaluated for recovery for 1 or more years using an <b>operational</b> defini-tion of <b>recovery.</b> Cumulatively, over the 15 -year period slightly over 40 % of patients with schizophrenia showed 1 or more periods of recovery. However, schizophrenia is still a relatively poor outcome disorder, showing poorer courses than other types of psychotic and nonpsychotic disorders (p <. 001). Most schizophrenia patients did not show the severe social isolation often described prior to the modern treatment era. Schizophreniform patients tended to show more favorable outcomes than schizophre-nia patients. Over 50 % of the schizophrenia patients did not have a disorder that was chronic and continuous. Rather, their disorder was episodic, although for many more vulnerable and less resilient schizophrenia patients the episodes were more frequent and severe, with slower recovery...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into rural credit delivery system in Maharashtra shows slower growth in institutional finances through commercial banks, credit cooperatives, RRBs and LDBs, {{particularly during the}} decade of 1991 - 2000, which is mainly due to adverse environment created by the financial sector reforms. Due to unfavourable policy framework, the entire rural credit delivery system encompassing rural branches of commercial banks, cooperative credit institutions and RRBs is reduced to a moribund state. High transaction costs and poor repayment performance are the twin root causes of the moribund state of rural credit delivery system. With a view to revive the agricultural credit delivery system, there is need to adopt innovative approaches like linking of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) with mainstream financial institutions. Such linkages are reported to have not only reduced transaction costs but also ensured better repayment performance. One of the recent studies conducted in Maharashtra has shown cent per cent recovery of loans through SHGs despite having excessively high rates of interest (24 - 36 per cent per annum) on their loan advances. One of the further disquieting features of RFIs in Maharashtra has been the high proportion of NPAs to total assets, particularly of RRBs and SCARDBs, which are estimated to hover around 36 - 48 per cent during the mid-to late nineties. One {{of the reasons for}} such high incidence of NPAs of RFIs has been the familiar practice of debt forgiveness, which eroded repayment and allowed defaulters to scot free with no deterrent reprimand. Political interference in issues of prudent fiscal management has got {{a lot to do with}} this unfortunate scenario. In order to rejuvenate rural credit delivery system, the twin problems facing the system, viz., high transaction costs and poor repayment performance, need to be tackled with more fiscal jurisprudence reserving exemplary punishment for willful defaults, especially by large farmers. In fact, insofar as the rural credit delivery system is concerned, the focus should be on strategies that are required for tackling issues such as sustainability and viability, <b>operational</b> efficiency, <b>recovery</b> performance, small farmer coverage and balanced sectoral development. ...|$|R
