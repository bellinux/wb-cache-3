The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{with other}} {{regional}} groupings in Europe, such as Nordic council or Visegrad Four, Baltic cooperation is rather limited. Possible explanations include the {{short history of}} restored sovereignty and fear of losing it again, along with an orientation toward Nordic countries and Baltic-Nordic cooperation in The Nordic-Baltic Eight.

The Kingdom of Sikkim was established as a princely state after the Anglo-Sikkimese Treaty of 1861; however, the issue of sovereignty was left undefined. The Maldive Islands were a British protectorate from 1887 to 1965, but not part of British India.|$|E

Egypt is a member of the IAEA and has both signed and ratified the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Currently, a draft Law on Nuclear Energy is being reviewed by the IAEA and expected to be passed by the Egyptian Parliament.

25|$|During {{the period}} between the two world wars, {{democracy}} thrived in Czechoslovakia. Of all the new states established in central Europe after 1918, only Czechoslovakia preserved a democratic government until the war broke out. The persistence of democracy suggests that Czechoslovakia was better prepared to maintain democracy than were <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Thus, despite regional disparities, its level of development was much {{higher than that of}} neighboring states. The population was generally literate, and contained fewer alienated groups. The influence of these conditions was augmented by the political values of Czechoslovakia's leaders and the policies they adopted. Under Tomas Masaryk, Czech and Slovak politicians promoted progressive social and economic conditions that served to defuse discontent.|$|E

The newly elected majority-opposition Congress quickly demonstrated its independence from the executive by rescinding legislation passed by the previous Colorado-dominated Congress. With support from the United States, the Organization of American States, and <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> the Paraguayan people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General Lino Oviedo to oust President Wasmosy, taking an important step to strengthen the Paraguayan Republic.|$|E

25|$|In the 13th century, Arabs {{migrated}} to {{the shores of the}} lake after they were banished from Mecca for refusing to pay tributes to a new calif.

Portuguese colonized the lake in 16th century followed by the Dutch. The Dutch drifted to the lagoon as their ships got stuck on the shores of Karimanal village {{on the opposite side of}} the mouth of the lake. During the Dutch occupation, Pulicat was known by the name Pallaicatta.

25|$|As Singaporean {{surgeons}} {{became more}} skilful, some like Prof. S Shan Ratnam were authorised to perform male-to-female sex-reassignment surgery at Kandang Kerbau Hospital from 1971 onwards.

Later, the more technically demanding female-to-male variety was also offered there and at Alexandra Hospital, performed by gynaecologists such as Dr. Ilancheran. A Gender Identity Clinic and Gender Reassignment Surgery Clinic were set up at the National University Hospital two decades later. In fact, for thirty years, Singapore {{was one of the}} world leaders in gender-reassignment surgery. Bugis Street and Johore Road started to become populated with a range of genders from transvestites to iatrogenic intersex individuals to fully transformed women. Local hospitals and clinics also attracted transgender clients from <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> especially Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E
