2500|$|The album Music from Big Pink, in particular, is {{credited}} with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, [...] "We certainly didn't want everybody to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll." ...|$|E

Instead of taking the easy way <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> established contractor, Pirojsha Godrej decided to entrust the entire work to Naval. Initially confined to planning, by 1972 Naval was involved in the total execution of the project.|$|R

But I got kind of lonely. I thought of {{you a lot of}} times. Wished we could go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> ale together. Maybe pick up a couple of pretty girls." ...|$|R

"Yes; but if {{you take}} my advice you will do as most of them do, get a big basket and lay in a stock of bread and cooked meat, cheese, and {{anything}} you fancy, then you will only have to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> cup of tea at the stopping-places.

6000|$|When he {{had gone}} we {{discussed}} the situation, which filled me with alarm. I did {{not at all like}} the accounts of this mysterious Queen, [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed," [...] or more shortly She, who apparently ordered the execution of any unfortunate stranger in a fashion so unmerciful. Leo, too, was depressed about it, but consoled himself by triumphantly pointing out that this She was undoubtedly the person referred to in the writing on the potsherd and in his father's letter, in proof of which he advanced Billali's allusions to her age and power. I was by this time too overwhelmed with the whole course of events that I had not even the heart left to dispute a proposition so absurd, so I suggested that we should try to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> bath, of which we all stood sadly in need.|$|E

I {{consider}} you, Mrs. Gripper, the most valuable person in the house. For this reason, that nobody in the house eats a heartier dinner every day than I do. Directions? Oh, no; I've no directions to give. I leave all that to you. Lots of strong soup, and joints done with the gravy in them--there's my notion of good feeding, in two words. Steady! Here's somebody else. Oh, to be sure--the butler! Another valuable person. We'll go right through all the wine in the cellar, Mr. Butler; and if I can't give you a sound opinion after that, we'll persevere boldly, and go right through it again. Talking of wine--halloo! here are more of them coming up stairs. There! there! don't trouble yourselves. You've all got capital characters, and you shall all stop here along with me. What was I saying just now? Something about wine; so it was. I'll tell you what, Mr. Butler, it isn't every day that a new master comes to Thorpe Ambrose; and it's my wish {{that we should all}} start together on the best possible terms. Let the servants have a grand jollification downstairs to celebrate my arrival, and give them what they like to drink my health in. It's a poor heart, Mrs. Gripper, that never rejoices, isn't it? No; I won't look at the cellar now: I want to go <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> breath of fresh air before breakfast. Where's Richard? I say, have I got a garden here? Which side of the house is it! That side, eh? You needn't show me round. I'll go alone, Richard, and lose myself, if I can, in my own property." ...|$|E

I can still hear T-Bone in my mind today, from that first record I heard, ‘Stormy Monday.’ He was the first electric guitar player I heard on record.
