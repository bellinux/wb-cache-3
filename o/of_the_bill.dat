5|$|After the Committee's {{first and}} second reports were considered, the Lords passed the bill 221 to 81 on 26 October 1999. During the session, Earl of Burford, son of the Duke of St Albans, {{launched}} a protest at the constitutional implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> from the Woolsack, and was ejected from the chamber. Once the Lords settled the differences between their version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> and the Commons version thereof, the Bill received Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 and became an Act of parliament. The Act then came into force the same day.|$|E
5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights {{to state and local}} governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
5|$|If the Council {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend {{the bill to}} rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending {{it back to the}} Council for inspection. The MP having charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> may give two clear days' notice of the amendments he or she proposes to move in Parliament to the provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> that were adversely reported upon by the Council. The bill then stands recommitted to a committee of the whole Parliament on those provisions, and the proposed amendments are considered. Parliament then resumes, and the MP having charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> reports whether the amendments were agreed to by the committee. If so, the MP moves that the amended bill should be resubmitted to the Council. There is uncertainty as to whether the Council will have to make another report within any time limit, or if the bill will then be directly presented to the President for assent.|$|E

5|$|In June 2013, Maloney {{voted against}} the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> is to ban abortions that would take place 20 or more weeks after fertilization.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{was pleased}} with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became its leading {{supporter}} in the Senate. The measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> at first seemed assured. Minton's support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses {{on behalf of his}} party in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E
