25|$|The {{shell is}} medium-sized, {{cylindriform}} to subcylindriform, greatest width {{at about the}} middle of the shell, glossy and transparent when fresh, with narrowly open umbilicus to more or less rimate. Spire produced, sides straight to very slightly convex and (sub)parallel, apex <b>obtusely</b> conical. Whorls seven to seven and three-quarters, very slightly convex, covered with fairly close, straight, oblique and little prominent costulae, interstices wider than (at most as wide as) costulae, smooth but with clear traces of spiral sculpture, apical whorls smooth with faint traces of spiral engraving; sutures fairly shallow to somewhat incised, crenellate. Labrum incrassate and reflected, sharply angulate at its point of attachment to the body whorl near the angular lamella. The aperture is fairly large, roughly triangular in shape, little obstructed by fourfold dentition: a strong, almost perpendicular, inrunning angular lamella, (almost) free from apex of labrum; a more or less horizontal, triangular mid-labral process, protruding as far as angular lamella, corresponding to noticeable outside depression; a small, but noticeable superficial tubercle above or on {{the middle of the}} columella; a deeply situated, little prominent, almost vertical, inside columellar process.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} small to minute, clavate, {{more or less}} tapering, {{greatest}} width well below the middle, always more than two-and-a-half times as long as wide, transparent when fresh to whitish when worn. The umbilicus is completely closed. The spire is produced, slightly tapering or sides at most subparallel, not convex. The apex is flattened, <b>obtusely</b> conical to mamillate. The shell has from five-and-a-half to just under six hardly convex whorls, that are superficially smooth but under high magnification with faint spiral sculpture and growth lines, growth lines turning to weak costulation behind the labrum. Sutures are somewhat impressed, fairly shallow, simple and filiform. The aperture is subovate, sometimes distinctly squarish at base, peristome slightly incrassate and reflected, aperture not or hardly obstructed by three-fold dentition: a small angular process (usually a mere swelling), somewhat distant from and therefore not connected with apex of labrum {{so that there is}} no sinus; opposite the angular denticle there is an upper labral process {{in the form of a}} thickening of the labrum, which process does not correspond to a depression behind the labrum; finally, a very faint thickening of the lower columella may be interpreted as a columellar process.|$|E
500|$|The cap of M.stylobates is [...] in diameter, and {{depending}} on its age may range in shape from <b>obtusely</b> conic to convex to bell-shaped to flattened. The structure of the cap margin also depends on {{the age of the}} mushroom, progressing from straight or curved inward slightly, to margin flaring or curved backward. The cap surface is smooth, although if viewed with a magnifying glass, minute spines can be seen. As it ages, the surface becomes smooth, moist and somewhat glistening, and it shows grooves corresponding to the position of the gills underneath the cap. The cap color is evenly pale watery gray. The flesh is thin, pallid, and has no distinguishable odor or taste.|$|E
500|$|The cap of C.tuberosa ranges {{in shape}} from <b>obtusely</b> convex to cushion-shaped with a margin curved inward when young, to {{flattened}} in age, with margin curved downward to straight.

Its diameter is small, reaching a maximum of [...] The cap surface is dry to moist, smooth to covered with fine soft hairs, and somewhat hygrophanous—changing color depending {{on the level of}} hydration. Sometimes the cap margin is pleated or grooved. The center of the cap is pinkish-buff but whitish around the margin, and it becomes whitish overall as it matures. The flesh is thin, and colored whitish to light buff. The mushroom has no distinctive taste or odor, and is considered inedible.|$|E
500|$|The cap of M.aurantiomarginata ranges {{in shape}} from <b>obtusely</b> conic to bell-shaped, and becomes flat in maturity, {{reaching}} diameters of [...] The cap color is variable, ranging from dark olive [...] (dark brownish-gray) to yellowish-olive in the center, while the margin is orangish. Alexander H. Smith, in his 1947 monograph of North American Mycena species, {{stated that the}} caps are not hygrophanous (changing color depending {{on the level of}} hydration), while Mycena specialist Arne Aronsen says they are. The overall color fades as the mushroom ages. The surface is moist, and young individuals are covered with fine whitish powder, but this soon sloughs off to leave a polished surface that develops radial grooves in maturity. The flesh is thin (about 1mm thick {{in the center of the}} cap) and flexible.|$|E

2500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tanner Stransky {{started his}} review by {{pointing}} out the album's lead single [...] "Put It Down" [...] was actually the weakest song on Two Eleven. Stransky said [...] "It's one of the weakest offerings from an otherwise well-crafted for-the-fans album. Ignore what's pushed to pop radio. Brandy scores when her raspy-sweet voice soars during ballads and slow jams, and that's what stands out on this intimate, often ethereal collection." [...] He gave the album a B+ rating. Sarah Godfrey from Washington Post complimented the songs on the album and wrote that the album [...] "serves as a fine tribute , {{in part because it}} {{is a testament to the}} fact that, despite whatever trends are happening in popular music right now, a good voice always shines through." [...] Vibe noted that [...] "experimentation can spell struggle for some artists, but Two Eleven finds Brandy cruising fluidly past the predictable. Swinging from OVO-worthy emo-ethereal reflections to quirky up-tempos, the 18-year vet deviates from overdone slow-tempo production." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Gawker felt that Two Eleven [...] "doesn't sound any younger or older than Brandy is. It's not <b>obtusely</b> hip or desperately serious. It just is, it's just now and it's just right." [...] Elliot Robinson, writing for So So Gay, dismissed Brown's appearance on Two Eleven but praised the tone of the album, writing [...] "When Brandy hits the old school R sound she was aiming for, the tracks are simply stunning." [...] Less enthusiastic with the album, Noah Berlatsky from The Atlantic felt the songs on the album were [...] "worse than the largely ignored Human, but better than the beloved-yet-boring 2002 Full Moon," [...] and added, that [...] "but such parsing seems mostly beside the point. If you're one of the dwindling number of fans of this '90s style, you know what you're getting; if not you'll probably skip it anyway." ...|$|E

60|$|In a very {{interesting}} essay on {{the architecture of the}} Parthenon, by the Professor of Architecture of the École Polytechnique, M. Émile Boutmy, you will find it noticed that the Greeks do not usually weaken, by carving, the constructive masses of their building; but put their chief sculpture in the empty spaces between the triglyphs, or beneath the roof. This is true; but in so doing, they merely build their panel instead of carving it; they accept, no less than the Goths, the laws of recess and limitation, as being vital to the safety and dignity of their design; and their noblest recumbent statues are, constructively, the fillings of the acute extremity of a panel {{in the form of an}} <b>obtusely</b> summited triangle.|$|E
60|$|Capitulum, <b>obtusely</b> triangular, massive: valves close together, rather thick, {{with their}} {{exterior}} surfaces convex, naked, {{except in the}} lower parts, where united together by tough, greenish-brown membrane, destitute of spines. The edges of the orifice are widely bordered by membrane, coloured fine crimson red. The valves, in a specimen with a capitulum above three quarters of an inch long, were 52 in number; in a specimen one fifth of an inch long, only between 20 and 30. Two whorls of valves are distinct beneath the carina and rostrum. In one specimen in Mr. Cuming's collection, with a capitulum 1.4 of an inch long, there were three whorls beneath the rostrum, and four beneath the carina. The scuta, terga, and carina are {{much larger than the}} other valves.|$|E
60|$|Evening.--After {{breakfast at}} Dumbarton, I {{went out to}} look at the town, which is of {{considerable}} size, and possesses both commerce and manufactures. There was a screw-steamship at the pier, and many sailor-looking people were seen about the streets. There are very few old houses, though still the town retains an air of antiquity which one does not well see how to account for, when everywhere there is a modern front, and all the characteristics of a street built to-day. Turning from the main thoroughfare I crossed a bridge over the Clyde, and gained from it the best view of the cloven crag of Dumbarton Castle that I had yet found. The two summits are wider apart, more fully relieved from each other, than when seen from other points; and the highest ascends into a perfect pyramid, the lower one being <b>obtusely</b> rounded. There seem to be iron-works, or some kind of manufactory, on the farther side of the bridge; and I noticed a quaint, chateau-like mansion, with hanging turrets standing apart from the street, probably built by some person enriched by business.|$|E
60|$|Most botanists rank all the {{varieties}} {{under the same}} species, the common wild nut. (10/134. The following details are taken from the 'Catalogue of Fruits, 1842 in Garden of Hort. Soc.' page 103; and from Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 943.) The husk, or involucre, differs greatly, being extremely short in Barr's Spanish, and extremely long in filberts, {{in which it is}} contracted so as to prevent the nut falling out. This kind of husk also protects the nut from birds, for titmice (Parus) have been observed (10/135. 'Gardener's Chron.' 1860 page 956.) to pass over filberts, and attack cobs and common nuts growing in the same orchard. In the purple-filbert the husk is purple, and in the frizzled-filbert it is curiously laciniated; in the red-filbert the pellicle of the kernel is red. The shell is thick in some varieties, but is thin in Cosford's-nut, and in one variety is of a bluish colour. The nut itself differs much in size and shape, being ovate and compressed in filberts, nearly round and of great size in cobs and Spanish nuts, oblong and longitudinally striated in Cosford's, and <b>obtusely</b> four-sided in the Downton Square nut.|$|E
60|$|Another {{class of}} tramp is a man, the most {{valuable}} part of whose stock-in-trade is a highly perplexed demeanour. He is got up like a countryman, and you will often come upon the poor fellow, while he is endeavouring to decipher the inscription on a milestone-- quite a fruitless endeavour, for he cannot read. He asks your pardon, he truly does (he is very slow of speech, this tramp, and he looks in a bewildered way all round the prospect while he talks to you), {{but all of us}} shold do as we wold be done by, and he'll take it kind, if you'll put a power man in the right road fur to jine his eldest son as has broke his leg bad in the masoning, and is in this heere Orspit'l as is wrote down by Squire Pouncerby's own hand as wold not tell a lie fur no man. He then produces from under his dark frock (being always very slow and perplexed) a neat but worn old leathern purse, from which he takes a scrap of paper. On this scrap of paper is written, by Squire Pouncerby, of The Grove, 'Please to direct the Bearer, a poor but very worthy man, to the Sussex County Hospital, near Brighton'--a matter of some difficulty at the moment, seeing that the request comes suddenly upon you in the depths of Hertfordshire.
