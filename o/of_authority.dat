5|$|Following the crisis, the Colonel Director of Retainers {{retained}} his privileged {{possession of}} the Staff <b>of</b> <b>Authority</b> and was granted the same investigative and censorial powers as the Chancellor and Imperial Counselor over officialdom. He routinely inspected the conduct of officials in the capital region and seven nearby commanderies. His investigative powers matched those of a provincial Inspector, although his Staff <b>of</b> <b>Authority</b> made him {{more powerful than the}} latter. The Colonel Director of Retainers was a personal servant of the emperor, answering only to him, allowing the emperor to greatly enhance his control over the bureaucracy. However, the Staff <b>of</b> <b>Authority</b> was removed from the Colonel in 45 BC, limiting his powers to inspection, investigation, and impeachment and he was distinguished from a provincial Inspector only by a higher salary-rank. The office of Colonel Director of Retainers was abolished in 9 BC, and reinstated once more as the Director of Retainers in 7 BC. He was now a subordinate of the new Excellency of Works and supervised convicts in public works projects, like his early Western Han counterpart. In Eastern Han, the Colonel Director of Retainers was reappointed without the Staff <b>of</b> <b>Authority,</b> with powers to inspect the capital region, but his salary-rank was reduced from 2000–dan to Equivalent to 2000–dan.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Thomas' election, Lanfranc, {{pursuing}} {{a claim that}} Canterbury was the primatial see, or bishopric, of England, demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and any future Archbishops of Canterbury. Thomas declined {{to make such a}} written promise, so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. Thomas argued that Lanfranc's demand was unprecedented, as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before. King William wanted clear lines <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in the church to match the lines <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in the secular sphere; thus, the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute. Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated, but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to any future archbishops of Canterbury. Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc, {{it was the beginning of}} the long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the claims of Canterbury to have jurisdiction over York.|$|E

5|$|The emperor's role as supreme judge {{could be}} {{temporarily}} duplicated by any official he designated {{in times of}} emergency or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was embodied in the Staff <b>of</b> <b>Authority</b> (Jiezhang 節杖). Roughly 2m (6ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff <b>of</b> <b>Authority</b> was often granted to an official with a specific errand, such as {{acting on behalf of}} the emperor as ambassador to a foreign country, appointing civilians to office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer on the field of battle. Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.|$|E

Anarchism is usually considered a far-left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism or participatory economics.|$|E

The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of “Slippery Slope Framework” has attracted many researchers who examined the effect <b>of</b> trust in <b>authorities</b> and power <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> on tax compliance using both the real taxpayer and student subjects. However, these researchers have neglected {{the use of}} cross country data to examine these effects. In line with prior empirical evidences that confirm the effect of trust and power <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> on tax compliance, this study hypothesizes that both trust and power have association with tax compliance across countries. It further hypothesizes that trust has more association with tax compliance than power. This study is based on 49 Sub-Saharan African countries as the population, out of which 37 countries were selected using multi-stage random sampling. The empirical results from these countries reveal {{that there is an}} association between both trust in <b>authorities</b> and power <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> and tax compliance across the 37 Sub-Saharan African countries, but the association between power <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> and tax compliance is stronger than that <b>of</b> trust in <b>authorities</b> and tax compliance. Further, the result does not find any causing effect of both trust and power on tax compliance in the countries that constituted the study sample...|$|R
