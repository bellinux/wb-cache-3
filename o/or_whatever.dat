5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this review essay on {{international}} policy-related English language literature on adult education from the 1970 s, 1980 s, and 1990 s, the following models of recent adult education policy options, aiming at social change and redistribution of power under varying conjunctures, have been constructed from the literature available: the revolutionary/transformational model, the humanist model, the rationalist economic model, the post-industrial society model, the new social movement model, and the welfare state model. These models are not exclusive-there may be others-nor are they to be forced into a chronological order. However, they may occur in an interconnected as well as in a dialectic sequence. Choice or application of any or a combination of these models have not brought about redistribution of knowledge <b>or</b> power. <b>Whatever</b> the philosophy, individualist <b>or</b> collective; <b>whatever</b> the approach, selective <b>or</b> campaign; <b>whatever</b> the economy, free market <b>or</b> centrally controlled; <b>whatever</b> the political system, capitalist <b>or</b> socialist; <b>whatever</b> the geographical region, developing <b>or</b> industrialized; indeed, <b>whatever</b> the conditions, the forces resisting an enduring redistributive effect seem to have capacities to reestablish or even reinforce hierarchies challenged by attempts at transformation.
