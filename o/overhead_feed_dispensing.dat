30|$|In principle, the {{traction}} current {{needed to move}} a train should flow in a closed circuit formed by an <b>overhead</b> <b>feeding</b> wire and a return path along the rails. Due to {{the proximity of the}} wire and the equal, but opposite, return current, the magnetic field should decrease sharply with the distance from the railway. In practice, however, the rails may have electric contacts with the ground enabling a current leakage into the Earth. Thus, the return current does not cancel the magnetic effect of the current in the traction wire. Moreover, the leakage current may flow to large distances in the ground.|$|R

40|$|Compounded feeds {{have been}} one of the {{essential}} requisites in the development of aquaculture. Rearing of larvae in the hatchery, postal larval rearing in the nursery until they become stockable size and their subsequent culture in grow-out ponds require appropriate and nutritionally balanced compounded feeds. Compounded feeds have many advantages. By understanding the nutritional requirements of the candidate species of culture, nutritionally well balanced feeds could be formulated using low-cost feedstuffs available in the concerned region. These feeds could be prepared in large quantities with good shelf life and can be used off the shelf wherever and whenever required. Preparation of compounded feed does not require extensive area and highly skilled man power. High efficiency of the feed could be achieved by judicious manipulation of feed ingredients and can be made economically feasible. <b>Dispensing</b> of compounded <b>feeds</b> is quite convenient over large farm areas and automatic <b>feed</b> <b>dispensing</b> devices could be successfully employed...|$|R
50|$|The {{concrete}} barn is a 14000 sq ft rectangular {{structure with}} twin concrete silos {{at the north}} end. Stalls were originally made of metal pipe. The original <b>overhead</b> <b>feeding</b> system is intact. The roof is front-gabled and covered with brown, composition shingles. A hayloft is centered on the roof ridge and has a hipped roof with a cupola and open eaves. The barn has 26 double-hung, 6/6 windows. The original wood frame windows have been replaced with aluminum sashes, which have been painted to simulate the original appearance. Drive-in doors are on the north, east and west sides of the barn, while cattle doors are on the south side. There are shed roofs along the outside east and west walls, supported by square wooden posts. The sheds were to provide shade and shelter from the weather.|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons for}} {{building}} the overhead powered Tyne & Wear Metro network roughly on {{lines of the}} long-gone third-rail Tyneside Electrics system in Newcastle area {{are likely to have}} roots in economy and psychology rather than in the pursuit of compatibility. At the time of the Metro opening (1980), the third rail system had already been removed from the existing lines, there were no third-rail light rail vehicles on the market and the latter technology was confined to much more costly heavy rail stock. Also the far-going change of image was desired: the memories of the last stage of operation of the Tyneside Electrics were far from being favourable. This was the construction of the system from scratch after 11 years of ineffective diesel service.The first <b>overhead</b> <b>feed</b> to German electric trains appeared on the Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn in 1907. Thirty years later, the main-line railway operator, Deutsche Reichsbahn, influenced by the success of the third-rail Berlin S-Bahn, decided to switch what was now called Hamburg S-Bahn to third rail. The process began in 1940 and was not finished until 1955.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 283 pigs (PIC TR 4 × 1050, {{initially}} 77. 2 ± 1. 4 lb BW) {{were used to}} compare phase feeding with blending finishing diets by using the FeedPro system (Feedlogic Corporation, Willmar, MN). There were 3 experimental treatments: (1) a standard 4 -phase complete feed program, (2) blending high- and low-lysine complete diets over the entire experiment, and (3) blending ground corn and a separate complete supplement within each phase. FeedPro is an integrated <b>feed</b> <b>dispensing</b> system that can deliver and blend 2 separate diets while dispensing. The 4 phases were 77 to 120, 120 to 175, 175 to 221, and 221 to 278 lb. Each treatment had 12 replicate pens and 8 pigs per pen. Overall (77 to 278 lb), ADG and ADFI were similar (P > 0. 24) across treatments. However, pigs fed the ground corn-supplement blend had poorer (P 0. 70) in HCW, percentage yield, and loin depth across treatments. Pigs fed using phase feeding of the ground corn-supplement blend had greater (P 0. 28) statistical differences in total revenue and income over feed costs (IOFC) across treatments. However, the highest IOFC was obtained from diet blending, which had a numeric advantage of $ 1. 44 to $ 2. 32 /pig over other treatments. In conclusion, the FeedPro system blended separate complete diets and a ground corn-supplement combination without adversely affecting growth performance and carcass characteristics...|$|R
50|$|Today {{railroad}} {{shipment of}} containers {{is limited to}} point-to-point trains, {{without the possibility of}} loading and unloading at intermediate stops. The reason is that wagons are loaded and unloaded vertically with gantry cranes or similar equipment, which obviously cannot operate under the <b>overhead</b> electric <b>feeding</b> line. Trains need to be shunted to marshalling yards and back to the regular railway tracks using a diesel locos, which is costly and time consuming, therefore only point to point trains are operated, excluding transfer and collection of load units along the territory they cross.|$|R
40|$|Summary Objective: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} three different types of gestation feed drops. Materials and methods: Econo, Accu, and Ultra feed drops (Automated Production Systems, Assumption, Illinois) were attached to feed lines at three angles (90 ˚, 75 ˚, and 60 ˚). Feed was collected and weighed at settings of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 lb (0. 9, 1. 8, 2. 7, 3. 6, and 4. 65 kg) for the Econo and Accu feed drops and 2, 4, 6, and 8 lb for the Ultra feed drops. Results: There was a drop type × angle × feed level interaction (P <. 01) for the feed settings versus the actual amount dropped. At 90 ˚, {{the relationship between the}} feeder setting (x) and actual quantity of feed dropped was best described by the regression equation (1. 156 x + 0. 244) for the Econo, (1. 010 x + 0. 072) for the Accu, and (1. 009 x + 0. 231) for the Ultra feed drops. At 75 ˚, the regression equations were (1. 014 x – 0. 139) for the Econo, (0. 997 x + 0. 057) for the Accu, and (1. 005 x + 0. 156) for the Ultra feed drops. At 60 ˚, the regression equations were (0. 689 x – 0. 076) for the Econo, (0. 989 x – 0. 249) for the Accu, and (0. 951 x + 0. 026) for the Ultra feed drops. Implications: The type of feed drop and its angle relative to the feed line influences the amount of <b>feed</b> <b>dispensed</b> at a feeder setting. The Accu and Ultra feed drops more accurately dispense the correct amount of feed than the Econo feed drops...|$|R

At {{the end of the}} trial, feed efficiency (weight gain/feed intake), protein efficiency ratio (g of weight gain/g of protein fed), and specific growth rate values were computed, and three fish were collected from each tank for subsequent measurement of whole-body composition according to established procedures (Webb et al. 2003).|$|R

40|$|Ruminant animals (domesticated or wild) emit methane (CH 4) through enteric {{fermentation}} in their digestive tract and from decomposition of manure during storage. These processes {{are the major}} sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from animal production systems. Techniques for measuring enteric CH 4 vary from direct measurements (respiration chambers, which are highly accurate, but with limited applicability) to various indirect methods (sniffers, laser technology, which are practical, but with variable accuracy).

40|$|A {{total of}} 808 pigs (PIC 337 x 1050, {{initially}} 78. 4 ± 1. 4 lb BW) {{were used to}} compare different feed-blending strategies for finishing pigs using the FeedPro system (Feedlogic Corp., Willmar, MN). There were 3 experimental treatments: (1) a standard-phase complete feed program, (2) blending a high- and low-lysine complete diet (curve), and (3) blending ground corn and a supplement. FeedPro is an integrated <b>feed</b> <b>dispensing</b> system that can deliver and blend 2 separate diets while dispensing. Treatment diets were fed over 4 phases (78 to 231 lb BW) with a common complete diet containing Paylean fed during the fifth phase. The 5 phases were from 78 to 115, 115 to 157, 157 to 191, 191 to 239, and 239 to 281 lb. Each treatment had 10 replicate pens and 26 to 27 pigs per pen. Overall (d 0 to 78), pigs phase-fed complete diets had greater (P < 0. 01) ADG than pigs fed blended diets and tended to have greater (P < 0. 07) ADG than those fed the ground corn-supplement blend. Pigs fed the blended diets had lower (P < 0. 001) ADFI than pigs phase-fed complete diets or fed the corn-supplement blend. However, pigs fed blended diets had improved (P < 0. 001) F/G compared to pigs phase-fed a ground corn-supplement blend and tended to have improved (P < 0. 07) F/G compared to pigs fed standard-phase diets. Pigs fed standard-phase diets had heavier (P < 0. 03) HCW than pigs fed the corn-supplement blend and tended to have heavier (P < 0. 03) HCW than pigs fed diets on a lysine curve. However, {{there were no differences}} (P ≥ 0. 11) in percentage yield, percentage lean, fat depth, or loin depth among treatments. There were no differences (P ≥ 0. 11) in total revenue or income over feed costs (IOFC) across treatments. However, standard phase-fed pigs held a numerical advantage in total revenue, mainly driven by a heavier HCW over other treatments. Also, pigs fed a ground corn-supplement blend had numerically the lowest IOFC compared to other treatments. In conclusion, feeding using the FeedPro system is competitive with standard phase-fed diets on a net return basis, while feeding a ground corn-supplement blend adversely affected net returns...|$|R
30|$|In {{the recent}} decades, demand growth in public {{transport}} systems has increased rapidly. Several {{cities across the}} world have planned {{to develop their own}} urban mass transit systems or to extend their existing routes to cover every street corner. Most urban metro systems require DC traction power supply to energize their rail vehicles [1, 2, 3]. The third rail conductor in DC power feeding systems is typically used for urban metros with the standard DC supply voltage of 750  V. At higher voltage level, 1500 VDC or 3000 VDC, the <b>overhead</b> catenary <b>feeding</b> configuration is more appropriate. It is necessary to characterize electrical performance and power loading at traction substations for planning, designing, and operation of mass rapid transit. Multi-train system simulation [4, 5, 6, 7] integrated with a power network solver is a potential tool to exhibit power supply performances.|$|R

These systems do not necessarily provide power as well as guidance, using conventionally powered buses. Experiments with hybrid systems on trams as a way of recovering power otherwise lost in braking (about 25% of the load) led to the concept of using supercapacitors in place of batteries because they could handle the large currents being generated. This led to the idea of removing the <b>overhead</b> electric <b>feeds</b> for portions of the tramways, using the hybrid to power the tram through these gaps - this allowed the often messy cable runs over road intersections to be removed, improving aesthetics. The two types of vehicle have recently converged {{in the form of the}} rubber wheeled tram, which uses tram-like overhead power and a single road-embedded rail as a guideway, a few of which allow the vehicle to leave the guide rail and operate as a traditional electric bus.|$|R
40|$|For {{distributed}} sensor/relay networks, {{high reliability}} and power efficiency are often required. However, several implementation issues arise in practice. One such {{problem is that}} all the distributed transmitters have limited power supply since the power source of the transmitters cannot be recharged continually. To resolve this, distributed beamforming has been proposed as a viable solution where all distributed transmitters seek to align in phase at the receiver end. However, it is difficult to implement such transmit beamforming in a distributed fashion in practice since perfect channel state information (CSI) need to be made available at all distributed transmitters, requiring tremendous <b>overhead</b> to <b>feed</b> back CSI from the receiver to all distributed transmitters. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that belongs to the category of deterministic phase adjustment algorithm: the Deterministic Differential Search Algorithm (DDSA), where the differences between the measured received signal strength (RSS) are utilized judiciously to help us predict the deterministic phase adjustment done at distributed transmitters.

50|$|MIT (Metrocargo Intermodal Transport) is {{a project}} partly funded by the European Union under the Programme “Research {{for the benefit of}} SMEs“ - Call ID “FP7-SME-2011” and managed by REA Research Executive Agency.Metrocargo is a concept of {{intermodal}} shipment based on horizontal loading and unloading containers and swap bodies on standard flatbed wagons under the <b>overhead</b> electric <b>feeding</b> line. The system being fully automated and very efficient, it is time and cost effective for the distributed intermodal transport over a territory and for processing full trains in port to dry port shuttling. The promoters constructed a full-scale prototype unit and the EC-funded research pro-ject VIT Vision for Innovative Transport successfully researched the remaining technical issues. This MIT Metrocargo Intermodal Transport project is about bringing Metrocargo from research to market stage and promoting its dissemination among logistic decision-makers throughout Europe. Technically, MIT will implement specific technical improvements and the scaling up from single prototypal unit to full industrial installation, developing typical plant design and SW applications to automate and optimise the work flow and provide interfaces with operators and external systems. Promotion and dissemination will be the main goal, carrying out market studies in several EU member states and subsequent market plans to exploit the Metrocargo features in terms of installation and operating costs, limited use of dock area, safety and environmental impact. Economic advantages to operators in typical situations will be deter-mined effecting specific feasibility studies. Dissemination events will be organised centred on the full scale Metrocargo prototype installed in the port of Vado Ligure. The SMEs will exhibit the system in main logistic and transport shows in Europe and will organise road-show presentations in several countries, using videos and a dynamic simulation SW tool to illustrate the solutions for specific needs. At the end of this Project the Metrocargo technology will be a fully developed market-ready system that will be widely known among European logistic decision makers.|$|R

Despite recognition {{of the importance of}} nutrition within the modern health agenda, evaluation of the efficacy of how such feeds are delivered is more limited. The accuracy, safety, and consistency with which enteral <b>feed</b> pump systems <b>dispense</b> nutritional formulae are important determinants of their use and acceptability. Enteral feed pump safety has received increased interest in recent years as enteral pumps are used across hospital and home settings. Four areas of enteral feed pump safety have emerged: the consistent and accurate delivery of formula; the minimization of errors associated with tube misconnection; the impact of continuous feed delivery itself (via an enteral feed pump); and the chemical composition of the casing used in enteral feed pump manufacture. The daily use of pumps in delivery of enteral feeds in a home setting predominantly falls to the hands of parents and caregivers. Their understanding of the use and function of their pump is necessary to ensure appropriate, safe, and accurate delivery of enteral nutrition; their experience with this is important in informing clinicians and manufacturers of the emerging needs and requirements of this diverse patient population.

40|$|Models of {{pastoral}} livestock strategies are typically driven by feed-supply assumptions. An alternative {{approach is to}} focus on the requirements necessary to meet specific animal performance levels and the implications thereof for biological efficiency, feed demand seasonality, and systems economics relative to alternative feed supply functions. A demand-driven deterministic steady-state enterprise level linear programming model of a self-contained breeding-finishing sheep meat livestock production system was developed in Microsoft ExcelTM incorporating SolverTM. For each week starting from ewe mating date, individual animal energy requirements (MJME) were simulated relative to specified performance levels. With the objective function being total carcass output and assuming a fixed but arbitrary system constraint of 10 million MJME, these simulation outputs were then brought together within a whole-of-system linear programming framework. Calculated outputs were animal numbers, flock structure, total meat carcass production and whole-of-system weekly feed requirements. Relative to a baseline scenario developed from industry average animal-performance levels, model experimentation was undertaken to investigate how key livestock-production parameters impact on feed conversion efficiency (g carcass/MJME) and feed demand seasonality (MJME/week). Parameters were tested both one-at-a-time and in-combination. In relation to feed conversion efficiency (FCE), parameters that reduced the maternal <b>feed</b> <b>overhead</b> cost per kg of production had the greatest effect with lamb-carcass weight and lambing percentage having the highest impact. Many system parameters had a curvilinear relationship to FCE with declining marginal returns. Effects were generally not additive with combined parameter effects either being less than additive or multiplicative. Overall system benefits tended to be lower than was superficially apparent from consideration of system components. Accordingly, major improvements require a focus on multiple system parameters. In relation to feed-demand seasonality, several system parameters had large impacts. Through combined changes to system parameters, the feed-demand profile could be changed from almost flat to highly seasonal with high peak feed demands. Within a fixed feed constraint, it was also shown that changes to system parameters had a large impact on ewe numbers. Although the main focus of this study was on FCE and feed demand seasonality, the base model was extended to incorporate the impact on economic returns. The purpose was primarily illustrative. With system feed demands still driven by assumed animal performance, in relation to a specified pastoral feed supply environment, initial feed deficits were calculated and then met, via transfer activities, by transferring feed from periods of excess to shortage at a pre-determined cost. Along with product pricing and animal production cost assumptions, system gross margin (GM) was then calculated per unit of system MJME. Testing four system parameters for illustration, livestock parameters were shown to have very different relationships between FCE and GM return. Maximisation of biological efficiency will therefore not maximise economic efficiency and vice versa. In comparison to biological efficiency, which can be characterised by a smooth non-linear response curve, changes in a system parameter such as carcass weight can result in abrupt and step-wise responses to economic outcomes. Lastly, optimal systems were shown to be highly dependent on the specific feed-supply context...|$|R
