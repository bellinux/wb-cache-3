5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950–51 NBA season, Mikan was {{dominant}} again, {{scoring a}} career-best 28.4 {{points per game}} in the regular season, again taking the scoring crown, and had 3.1 assists per game. In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: rebounds. In this category, Mikan also stood out; his 14.1 rebounds per game (rpg) was only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse. In that year, Mikan participated {{in one of the}} most notorious NBA games ever played. When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket. With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense, the score stayed 19–18 to make it the lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record. In the post season, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot,</b> he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.|$|E

25|$|Off-ice {{training}} {{is the term}} for physical conditioning that takes part off the ice.

5000|$|In breakdance, moves {{performed}} <b>on</b> <b>one's</b> {{hands and}} <b>feet</b> may {{be referred to}} as downrock or (especially in the southern United States) as footwork.

25|$|There are six {{jumps in}} figure skating that count as jump elements. All six are landed <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> {{on the back}} outside edge (with {{counterclockwise}} rotation, for single and multi-revolution jumps), but have different takeoffs, by which they may be distinguished. The two categories of jumps are toe jumps and edge jumps.|$|E

25|$|In partial {{suspension}} {{the person}} is bound {{in a way that}} part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains.

A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.|$|E

The prank was so successful that many readers believed the story, and the ensuing popularity of the joke resulted in Plimpton writing an entire book on Finch.|$|E
25|$|Artemis is {{described}} as having pale skin, deep blue eyes, premature wrinkling near the eyes, and raven black hair. He is said to resemble his father. As of his adventures in The Lost Colony, Artemis has exchanged one eye with Holly Short {{as a result of}} a botched re-materialization and now possesses one blue eye and one hazel eye, and a time travel in The Time Paradox aged him to his chronological age of 18 but then back again upon his return to his own time. A similar re-materialization resulted in the swapping of the index and second fingers on his left hand. His smile is called vampire-like, and he maintains manicured hands. Artemis has a slight build and is not physically fit. He often wears Armani suits. It is also mentioned by himself that his first suit was a Zegna custom made as worn by Holly in The Time Paradox. As of , Artemis has reverted to his image as it was at the start of the series due to being placed in a new body grown by Foaly when he lost his during Opal's attempt to dominate the world and wipe out the human race. He now possesses two blue eyes and all fingers are back in their original place. It is noted, however, that Artemis has the physical appearance of a boy just over the age of 15 and now also has six toes <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E

The key component of its success is its ability to breathe, that is, to allow air exchange.

50|$|The {{decision}} to remain standing {{or go to}} the ground obviously depended on the relative strengths of the athlete, and differed between anō and katō pankration.

In fact, in antiquity as today, falling to one's knee(s) was a metaphor for coming to a disadvantage and putting oneself at risk of losing the fight, as argued persuasively by Michael B. Poliakoff.|$|R
