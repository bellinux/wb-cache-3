5|$|In {{contrast}} to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy {{has been identified as}} being closer to the history <b>of</b> <b>astronomy</b> or to cultural history, insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual. The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies <b>of</b> <b>astronomy</b> in the Americas.|$|E

40|$|The study <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy</b> {{applied by}} Walisongo State Institute for Islamic Studies (IAIN Walisongo) {{is the most}} {{interesting}} study among all studies <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy</b> in Indonesia. The reason {{is that it is}} organized in the concentration form (Concentration <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy</b> / KIF), which is the only one in Southeast Asian. In addition, Prof. Nazaruddin Umar who was Director General of Islamic Society Guidance expected in order that IAIN Walisongo can be the development beacon <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy</b> in Indonesia. This research wants to express the study <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy’s</b> model applied by IAIN Walisongo through two problem focuses, which are how IAIN Walisongo establishes the epistemology of study <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy</b> and how the praxis of the study <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy</b> at IAIN Walisongo is. The category of this research is a qualitative research. The main source and the data input of this research is some information of people who are involved directly with the activity observed, so this research is also called field research, which has two data source types, which are primary data source and secondary data source. The primary data source of this research is interview results with the founders of KIF. The secondary data sources of this research are books, newspapers, magazines, working papers and Concentration <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy’s</b> documents related to this research. Next, these data are analyzed by descriptive analysis method. The results of this research are, first, Epistemology applied by Walisongo State Institute for Islamic Astronomy to organize the study <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy</b> is combinative epistemology, which combines the epistemology of astronomical science and Islamic law epistemology. As an observational science, Islamic Astronomy is a science to know the positions of celestial objects by calculation and observation. Therefore, the observation data is the primary data that can annul the Ephimeris data. Many mathematical sciences are originally developed to facilitate the astronomical research, such as observation. In addition, Islamic Astronomy also related to the Islamic worship, such as ṣalāt, ḥajji, fasting, etc. In Holly Quran, Allah commands Muslims to perform Islamic worships in the certain times. The natural phenomena are as indication of these times. Therefore, Islamic <b>astronomy</b> is part <b>of</b> Islamic law. Second, Practically, IAIN Walisongo has the high commitment to organize the study <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy</b> as the epistemology <b>of</b> Islamic <b>Astronomy.</b> This is based on three considerations, which are the curriculum framework covering not only the substantive courses, but also the supporting courses, such as Mathematics, Methodology <b>of</b> Science, <b>Astronomy,</b> Computing, and Instrumentations, teaching staff structure involving the internal lecturers and the external lecturers of Shariah Faculty of IAIN Walisongo, and (3) some discussions held by Shariah Faculty and scientific works. Both of them discuss about the subjects of ‘Ilm al-Falak (Qibla, prayer times, Qamariyyah months, and eclipses) from not only jurisprudence perspective but also scientific perspective. ...|$|R
