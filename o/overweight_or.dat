40|$|We {{develop a}} model to {{estimate}} the influence of child and parental characteristics on {{the likelihood that a}} child will become an obese <b>or</b> <b>overweight</b> youth. We use this model to test whether it is possible to forecast obesity and overweight among youth.

MethodsDogs were categorized into four {{body condition score}} groups and five body size groups based on their breed. Multilevel logistic regression models were applied to the data. A Chi-squared {{test was used to}} examine whether the percentage of obese <b>or</b> <b>overweight</b> dogs differed between breeds. ResultsThere were 15. 1 % obese dogs and 39. 8 % overweight dogs. Obese dogs were characterized by increased age and female sex, whereas overweight dogs were characterized by increased age and neuter status (P <  0. 05). Peak probabilities of dogs being either obese <b>or</b> <b>overweight</b> were between 7 and 9 years of age, with the probabilities then declining as the dogs got older. For example, in toy sized dogs, the probability of dogs being overweight increased from 33. 4 % to a peak of 55. 1 % as dog age rose from 1 to 8 years old. Also, in medium, small and toy sized dogs, neutered dogs {{were more likely to be}} overweight than intact dogs, whereas neutered small sized dogs were more likely to be obese than intact small sized dogs (P <  0. 05).

40|$|Institutional investors of {{all types}} exhibit {{substantial}} home-state bias when investing in private equity (PE) funds. This effect is particularly pronounced for public pension funds, where the local overweighting amounts to 9. 7 % of the private equity portfolio on average, based on 5 -year rolling average benchmarks. Public pension funds’ own-state investments perform significantly worse than their out-of-state investments, an average of 3 - 4 percentage points of net IRR per year, and those that that overweight their portfolios towards home-state investments also perform worse overall. These underperformance patterns are not evident for other types of institutional investors, such as endowments, foundations and corporate pension funds, {{and we do not}} observe similar <b>overweighting</b> <b>or</b> underperformance of investments in neighboring states. Overweighting in home state investments by public pension funds is greater in states with higher levels of corruption, although there is no positive correlation of underperformance with corruption for these investors.

25|$|Intentional {{weight loss}} {{is the loss}} of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve fitness and health, or to change {{appearance}} through slimming.

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} even in {{the first}} few months of mother–child relationships are an important factor to health in childhood, especially with obesity. A study using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development assessed mother–child interactions and categorized them in one of two groups: sensitive or insensitive. Their child's growth (height and weight) was monitored throughout their childhood, from 24 months all the way to grade six, and body mass index was calculated. As the children grew, the percentage of <b>overweight</b> <b>or</b> obese grew too. From 24 months the overall overweight-obese percentage was 15.58% and by grade six, 34.34% of the children were classified as <b>overweight</b> <b>or</b> obese. More interesting is the difference between the maternal sensitive group and the maternal insensitive group. The children with the sensitive mothers started out with an overweight-obese percentage of 14.96% (24 months) and ended the research with 29.54% (grade six). The children classified with insensitive mothers had an overweight-obese percentage of 16.16% at 24 months and 39.28% at grade six. This shows a significant correlation between the mother's sensitivity and the child's risk for overweight-obesity during their elementary years. This is very important for obesity prevention programs for children.|$|E
