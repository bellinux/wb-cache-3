5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of <b>operating</b> <b>parameters,</b> acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E

25|$|Because {{temperatures}} in flight had not dropped below the 777's designed <b>operating</b> <b>parameters,</b> the Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB) recommended Boeing and Rolls-Royce take interim measures on Trent 800-powered 777s {{to reduce the}} risk of ice restricting fuel delivery. Boeing did so by revising the 777 operating procedures so as to reduce the opportunities for such blockages to occur, and by changing the procedure to be followed in the event of power loss to take into account the possibility that ice accumulation was the cause.|$|E

25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop tractive effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or tractive force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E
25|$|There are {{distinct}} differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically {{emerge from a}} column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. <b>Operating</b> <b>parameters</b> are adjusted to maximize {{the effect of this}} difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed {{to the failure of}} the Argentinian fighters to shoot down a Sea Harrier. Although the Mirage III and Dagger jets were faster, the Sea Harrier was {{considerably}} more manoeuvrable. Moreover, the Harrier employed the latest AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles and the Blue Fox radar. Contrary to contemporary reports that [...] "viffing" [...] proved decisive in dogfights, the maneuver was not used by RN pilots in the Falklands as it was only used in emergencies against enemies unfamiliar with the aircraft. The British pilots had superior air-combat training, one manifestation of which was that they thought they noticed Argentinian pilots occasionally releasing weapons outside of their <b>operating</b> <b>parameters.</b> This is now thought to have been Mirages releasing external fuel tanks rather than weapons, and turning away from conflict with the Sea Harrier. This later reduced their capability to fight an effective campaign against the Sea Harrier due to reduced range and lack of external fuel tanks.|$|E

2500|$|Cathay Pacific Flight 780 {{took off}} from runway 28 at Surabaya's Juanda International Airport at 08:24 local time (01:24 UTC). During the climb, both engines had small engine {{pressure}} ratio (EPR, {{a measure of the}} amount of thrust output) fluctuations, with No. 2 engine fluctuating over a greater range than No. 1 engine. Just over half-an-hour after takeoff, when the aircraft was at its cruising altitude of Flight level (FL) 390 (about [...] above sea level), the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) system displayed an [...] "ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT" [...] message.

2500|$|The {{balance between}} gellation and blowing is {{sensitive}} to <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> including the concentrations of water and catalyst. The reaction to generate carbon dioxide involves water reacting with an isocyanate first forming an unstable carbamic acid, which then decomposes into carbon dioxide and an amine. The amine reacts with more isocyanate to give a substituted urea. Water has a very low molecular weight, so even though the weight percent of water may be small, the molar proportion of water may be high and considerable amounts of urea produced. The urea is not very soluble in the reaction mixture and tends to form separate [...] "hard segment" [...] phases consisting mostly of polyurea. The concentration and organization of these polyurea phases can {{have a significant impact}} on the properties of the polyurethane foam.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Mitsubishi {{released}} the Diamante (Sigma) in Japan. It featured a new electronically controlled active trace & {{traction control system}} (the first integration of these two systems in the world) that Mitsubishi developed (see Mitsubishi AWC). Simply named TCL in 1990, the system has now evolved into Mitsubishi's modern Active Skid and Traction Control (ASTC) system. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> through various sensors. When too much throttle has been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking are automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi's newly developed TCL system had a preventive (active) safety function which improved the course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called [...] "trace control") thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a ‘proper’ modern stability control system, trace control monitors steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds {{although there is no}} yaw input. The TCL system's standard wheel slip control function enables better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the TCL system's individual effect, it also works together with Diamante's electronic controlled suspension and four-wheel steering that Mitsubishi had equipped to improve total handling and performance.|$|E

40|$|Discrete event {{simulations}} need {{a priority}} queue to schedule events {{according to their}} timestamp. Up to 40 % of the time may be spent on {{the management of the}} pending event set. Thus the choice of a efficient data structure is vital to the performance of discrete event simulations. A conventional Calendar Queue (CQ) and Dynamic Calendar Queue (DCQ) are two data structures that promises O(1) time complexity regardless {{of the size of the}} pending event set. CQ however performs poorly over skewed event distributions or changes in the event distribution. DCQ improves on the CQ by adding a mechanism to detect the two scenarios above and redistribute events when necessary. Both of these data structures determine their <b>operating</b> <b>parameter</b> (bucket width) by sampling of events. Sampling sometimes fails to provide a good estimate for an optimum bucket width to use. This paper proposes a novel approach to determine the optimum <b>operating</b> <b>parameter</b> of a calendar queue based on its performance statistics and guarantees O(1) performance. Henceforth, we named our calendar queue adopting this mechanism, Statistically eNhanced with Optimum <b>Operating</b> <b>Parameter</b> Calendar Queue (SNOOPy CQ).
