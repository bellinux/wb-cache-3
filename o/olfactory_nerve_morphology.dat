40|$|Little {{is known}} {{regarding}} how alkali metal ions are transported in the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> following their intranasal administration. In this study, {{we show that}} an alkali metal ion, thallium is transported in the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers to the olfactory bulb in mice. The <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers of mice were transected {{on both sides of}} the body under anesthesia. A double tracer solution (thallium- 201, 201 Tl; manganese- 54, 54 Mn) was administered into the nasal cavity the following day. Radioactivity in the olfactory bulb and nasal turbinate was analyzed with gamma spectrometry. Auto radiographic images were obtained from coronal slices of frozen heads of mice administered with 201 Tl or 54 Mn. The transection of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers was confirmed with a neuronal tracer. The transport of intranasal administered 201 Tl/ 54 Mn to the olfactory bulb was significantly reduced by the transection of <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers. The <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> transection also significantly inhibited the accumulation of fluoro-ruby in the olfactory bulb. Findings indicate that thallium is transported by the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers to the olfactory bulb in mice. The assessment of thallium transport following head injury may provide a new diagnostic method for the evaluation of <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> injury. © The Author 2007.

40|$|Although <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> {{damage is}} a {{contributing}} factor in the diagnosis of posttraumatic olfactory loss, at present, there are no methods to directly assess injury to these nerves. We have shown that following <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> injury in mice, thallium- 201 (201 Tl) transport from the nasal cavity to the olfactory bulb decreases. To determine if <b>olfactory</b> function after <b>nerve</b> injury could be assessed with nasal administration of 201 Tl, we measured the correlation between odor detection ability (ODA) {{and the rate of}} transport of 201 Tl in <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves.</b> Both ODA and 201 Tl transport were measured after bilateral <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> transection for a 4 -week period. Cycloheximide solution was used for ODA against tap water. 201 Tl transport was measured as the ratio of radioactivity in the nasal cavity and olfactory bulb with gamma spectrometry.

40|$|During development, axons use {{guidance}} cues {{to direct}} {{them to their}} target destinations. The protein Sonic hedgehog (SHH) has been recently identified as a repulsive guidance cue and target recognition molecule for retinal ganglion cell axons; however, whether or not SHH functions in this manner for all sensory axons remains unclear. Here, we use the olfactory system in Xenopus laevis (X. laevis) in order to study the role of SHH in the developing <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves.</b> In X. laevis, <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> extend from the olfactory placodes on the epithelial surface and make connections with the developing olfactory bulb in the forebrain. Labeling the brain with neurofilament (NF) and SHH antibodies show that SHH is expressed on the forebrain during the later stages of <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> development and is localized to two distinct regions adjacent to the areas where the two <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> enter the brain. Knockdown of SHH signaling severely reduces the number of olfactory axons that reach the olfactory bulb and few axons, if any at all, grow towards secondary targets on the brain. The width of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> is therefore greatly reduced and the nerve bundle appears less dense, possibly {{as a result of}} increased defasciculation. SHH, therefore, seems to play a fundamental role in <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> wiring, though its specific role as either a pathfinding molecule or a target recognition molecule has yet to be uncovered...|$|R

40|$|Primary sensory {{olfactory}} axons {{arise from}} the olfactory neuroepithelium that lines the nasal cavity and then project via the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> into the <b>olfactory</b> bulb. The P-galactoside binding lectin, galectin- 1,and its laminin ligand have been implicated {{in the growth of}} these axons along this pathway. In galectin- 1 null mutant mice, a subpopulation of primary sensory olfactory axons fails to reach its targets in the olfactory bulb. In the present study we examined the spatiotemporal expression pattern of galectin- 1 in normal mice in order to understand its {{role in the development of}} the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> pathway. At E 15. 5, when olfactory axons have already contacted the olfactory bulb, galectin- 1 was expressed in the cartilage and mesenchyme surrounding the nasal cavity but was absent from the <b>olfactory</b> neuroepithelium, <b>nerve</b> and bulb. Between E 16. 5 and birth galectin- 1 began to be expressed by <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> ensheathing cells in the lamina propria of the neuroepithelium and nerve fibre layer. Galectin- 1 was neither expressed by primary sensory neurons in the olfactory neuroepithelium nor by their axons in the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve.</b> Laminin, a galectin- 1 ligand, also exhibited a similar expression pattern in the embryonic <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> pathway. Our results reveal that galectin- 1 is dynamically expressed by glial elements within the nerve fibre layer during a discrete period in the developing <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> pathway. Previous studies have reported galectin- 1 acts as a substrate adhesion molecule by cross-linking primary sensory olfactory neurons to laminin. Thus, the coordinate expression of galectin- 1 and laminin in the embryonic nerve fibre layer suggests that these molecules support the adhesion and fasciculation of axons en route to their glomerular targets...|$|R

40|$|The {{olfactory}} bulb is a specialized {{area of the}} CNS with well-defined areas containing both myelinated, and non-myelinated axons. The presence of plp gene transcripts has been demonstrated previously in the {{olfactory bulb}}, but no detailed description of plp gene activity in this complex area of the CNS is available. In this study we describe the developmental expression of the two plp gene isoforms, plp and dm- 20, and their products in the mouse olfactory bulb. plp gene activity was present in the non-myelinated <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> layer of the bulb from E 14 through to adult ages.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae cause {{considerable}} {{morbidity and}} mortality, with persistent neurological sequelae, particularly {{in young children}} and the elderly. It is widely assumed that carriage occurs through direct mucosal colonization from the environment whereas meningitis results from invasion from the blood. However, the results of published studies can be interpreted that pneumococci may enter the brain directly from the nasal cavity by axonal transport through <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves.</b> This hypothesis is based on findings that (i) teichoic acid of the pneumococcal cell wall interact with gangliosides (GLS), (ii) the interaction of GLS with cholera toxin leads to axonal transport through the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> into the brain, and (iii) viruses enter the brain through axonal transport into <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves.</b> After nasal inoculation, we observe high numbers of pneumococci in nasal washes and the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> and epithelium. Significant numbers of pneumococci also infected the olfactory bulbs, brain, and the trigeminal ganglia. The absence of bacteremia in this model makes it unlikely that the bacteria entered the brain from the blood stream. Recovery of colony-forming units from the brain, lungs, <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves,</b> and epithelium and nasal washes was inhibited by incubating pneumococci with GLS before nasal inoculation. These findings, confirmed by PCR and immunohistochemistry, support a GLS-mediated process of infection and are consistent with pneumococci reaching the brain through retrograde axonal transport...|$|R

The organization of the primary olfactory axons was clearly revealed by antisera to KLH, which reacted with no other neurons. When visualized with anti-KLH, fascicles of olfactory axons penetrated the basal lamina of the olfactory rosette at scattered sites and converged to form the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve.</b> Fascicles within the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> traveled parallel to the long axis of the nerve until resorted by extensive intermixing {{as they entered the}} olfactory bulb.

40|$|In this study, {{serotonin}} (5 -hydroxytryptamine; 5 HT) -immunoreactive (5 HT-IR) neuronal fibers {{were identified}} in the primary olfactory pathway of the sea lamprey. These neurons are likely part of a nonolfactory neural system that innervates the olfactory sac. Cell bodies with 5 HT immunoreactivity predominated in the lamina propria of the rostral portion of the nasal cavity and were less prevalent adjacent to the olfactory epithelium. The 5 HT-IR fibers were parallel to axons of the olfactory receptor neurons in the lamina propria of the olfactory mucosa and in the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve.</b> Serotonergic fibers crossed from the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> into the <b>olfactory</b> bulb or branched in the caudal portion of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> and terminated at the junction of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> with the <b>olfactory</b> bulb.

During ontogeny, acetylated tubulin (AT) -immunocytochemistry, Dil tracing and transmission electron microscopy revealed short axons that spanned the short distance between the olfactory epithelium and the primordial olfactory bulb. In larvae, the entire <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> pathway could be viewed in single horizontal sections. Lectin and Dil labeling demonstrated small ORN fascicles {{that emerged from the}} olfactory epithelium and extended to the olfactory bulb as a single <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve.</b> Expression of proteins associated with development (GAP- 43, vimentin, acetylated tubulin and NCAM) confirmed that the larval olfactory system was still developing. The role of the ECM molecule, tenascin-C was investigated during ontogeny, in larvae and perturbation studies. Although tenascin-C immunoreactivity was present in the larval <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> pathway, it was absent during ontogeny and in the larval olfactory mucosa during initial ORN outgrowth following axotomy. In both circumstances, the presence of relatively fewer ORN axons, and the short axonal pathway infer that in the absence of tenascin-C, ORN axonal fibers do not undergo extensive growth or pathway guidance. Similarly, during antibody blocking of tenascin-C in larvae, AT-immunoreactivity was diffuse. On the other hand, when tenascin levels were increased by injections following axotomy, ORN axon outgrowth of irregular-looking fascicles was stimulated. These results support previous studies of tenascin-C that demonstrated boundary signaling during axonal outgrowth.
