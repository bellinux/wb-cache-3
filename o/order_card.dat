5000|$|Building on {{locomotive}} shop practice, Metcalfe developed {{three classes}} of cards: the shop order, a [...] "service" [...] or labor record, and a materials receipt. The <b>order</b> <b>card</b> authorized {{the work and}} listed the steps necessary. Foremen handed it to workers, who returned it upon task completion. Forwarded from one foreman to another through departments until fully checked off, the <b>order</b> <b>card</b> recycled to the office.Metcalfe also issued each worker bound pads of service cards, printed with his name, hourly rate of pay, and payroll number. For each task, foremen inscribed the order number along with a brief work description, then later certified the time expended. These tickets were [...] "as good as money," [...] for their collation in the office authorized payroll disbursements.|$|E

50|$|Players {{command a}} variety of units: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Each unit is {{composed}} of a varying number of plastic figures. During each turn, players alternate playing cards from their hands. There are Order and Special <b>Order</b> <b>cards</b> <b>Order</b> <b>cards</b> allow a player to activate a number of units on a specified section -left flank, center, or right flank. Special <b>Order</b> <b>cards</b> provide specific unique manipulations of game mechanics that are detailed on the card. Attacks are made by rolling a number of dice, depending on the attacking unit and any defensive terrain. Each six-sided die is labeled with each unit symbol; if the rolled symbol matches the target's unit type, a single figure is removed. A flag roll on the die forces the unit to retreat one square.|$|R

5000|$|Rick Swan {{reviewed}} GURPS IOU: Illuminati University for Dragon magazine #228 (April 1996). Noting SJG's {{success with}} the Illuminati: New World <b>Order</b> <b>card</b> game, he commented that [...] "despite its title, GURPS IOU {{has nothing to do}} with cards. Nor, for that matter, does it have much to do with the GURPS Illuminati supplement of a few years back. IOU looks like a setting for the GURPS role-playing game - and indeed, it has its share of game stats and adventure hooks - but the anything-goes, logic-down-the-dumper approach makes it virtually unplayable, at least by anyone who takes their games even semi-seriously. So what is it? Basically, IOU is a glorified joke book, a drop of Monty Python mixed with a bucket of Three Stooges." [...] Swan concluded his review by saying: [...] "Maybe you consider yourself too sophisticated for silly stuff like this. But you've gotta admit - Democrats for Cthulhu, that’s pretty good." ...|$|E
40|$|Obesity in {{children}} is a nationwide problem. Physical activity {{is one way to}} help children stay fit and prevent obesity. Unfortunately, access to technology involving sedentary behavior is easier than ever. Fortunately, for this generation of students {{there is a way to}} combine physical activity and technology through exergaming. In order to encourage students to participate in exergaming, the students should be able to play games they prefer. The purpose of this study was to apply a paired choice preference assessment, rank <b>order</b> <b>card</b> sort, and social validity surveys to determine the preference order of six exergames for six elementary students and measure heart rates as the children played the six exergames. The results of this study show that children had different preferences as evident by the rank <b>order</b> <b>card</b> sort, social validity survey, and paired choice preference assessment. The pre-rank <b>order</b> <b>card</b> sort was significantly correlated with the paired choice assessment. On the other hand, the pre-social validity survey was not significantly correlated with the paired choice assessment...|$|E
