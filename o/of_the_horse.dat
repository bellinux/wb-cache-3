5|$|Domestication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{most likely}} {{took place in}} central Asia prior to 3500 BC.

5|$|Each forelimb <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{runs from}} the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{runs from the}} pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Early fur {{traders and}} explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown {{some to be}} of considerable antiquity.

5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons.

The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of a three-field rotation system for planting crops increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The {{development of}} the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by the spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> collar, {{which led to the}} use of draught horses in place of oxen.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} for the domestication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 3500–4000 BC.

5|$|The limbs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> are {{structures}} made {{of dozens}} of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of horses}} in World War I marked a {{transitional}} {{period in the}} evolution of armed conflict. Cavalry units were initially considered essential offensive elements of a military force, but {{over the course of the}} war, the vulnerability of horses to modern machine gun and artillery fire reduced their utility on the battlefield. This paralleled the development of tanks, which would ultimately replace cavalry in shock tactics. While the perceived value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> in war changed dramatically, horses still played a significant role throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{apparatus}} in {{the limbs}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint {{is supported by}} group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much of the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the apparatus stores and releases energy {{in the manner of}} a spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament, the check ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones.|$|E
