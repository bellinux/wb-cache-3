40|$|Summary. Interface {{boundary}} conditions {{are the key}} ingredient to design efficient domain decomposition methods. However, convergence cannot be obtained for any method {{in a number of}} iterations less than the number of subdomains minus one {{in the case of a}} <b>one-way</b> <b>splitting.</b> This optimal convergence can be obtained with generalized Robin type {{boundary conditions}} associated with an operator equal to the Schur complement of the outer domain. Since the Schur complement is too expensive to compute exactly, a new approach based on the computation of the exact Schur complement for a small patch around each interface node is presented for the two-Lagrange multiplier FETI method. ...|$|E

50|$|U.S. Route 321 Alternate (US 321A) was {{established}} 1948 {{as a number}} swap with US 321 through downtown Lenoir. In 1957, US 321A was extended south, replacing mainline US 321 through Hudson and Granite Falls, ending at its current southern terminus north of the Catawba River. In June, 1964, US 321A was placed on <b>one-way</b> <b>splits</b> through downtown Lenoir; northbound continued along Mulberry Street and West Avenue, southbound rerouted along Main Street and College Avenue. In September, 2006, US 321A was rerouted to its current northern terminus, just south of downtown Lenoir, via McLean Drive. Its old alignment through downtown Lenoir was carried on by NC 90 until 2012, when it too was rerouted; the old alignment is now under city control.|$|R
50|$|Between 1939-1944, US 64/US 70 {{was removed}} from Knobs Landing (SR 1620), in Icard; in Statesville, US 64 is rerouted to its current routing, leaving NC 90. In 1941, US 64 was placed on new bypass south of Franklinville; its old {{alignment}} becoming US 64A. Around 1942, US 64 was placed on new routing east of Hayesville to NC 175; most of the old route was abandoned when Chatuga Lake was formed. Between 1945-1949: US 64 is placed on its modern alignment from the Tennessee state line to Murphy. US 64 {{was removed from}} Old Quebec Road (SR 1316), near Lake Toxaway. US 64 was placed on <b>one-way</b> <b>splits</b> in downtown Raleigh. US 64 was rerouted onto Thomas Avenue in Rocky Mount, eliminating US 64A. In Plymouth, US 64 was placed on new bypass south of the downtown area. In 1949, US 64 was placed on new bypass north of Siler City; its old alignment becoming US 64A.|$|R
50|$|Across {{the street}} from a wye {{junction}} with the previously mentioned railroad line, SR 67 turns north onto Railroad Avenue. The <b>one-way</b> <b>split</b> of US BUS 460 ends east of Grayson Avenue, and the first intersection after this split is the shared intersection with Dickerson Place and Teah Park Street. The business route resumes running parallel to the N&W line, which itself now follows that Clinch River. Front Street rises above the tracks along a mountain, then curves towards the south. A local street branches off to the south as the railroad line and river follow that street instead, while US BUS 460 briefly curves back to the east. Near Richlands High School, the road turns southeast once again, descending gradually down a hill as it approaches its parent route. US BUS 460 ends at an unconventional quarter-cloverleaf interchange with US 460 at the Richland-Cedar Bluff border, which is also shared with the western terminus of SR 631 (Cedar Valley Drive).|$|R
5000|$|The routes {{cross the}} Jeff Davis-Telfair County line by passing over the Dr. C. R. Youmans Memorial Bridge over the Ocmulgee River where it enters Lumber City. Georgia State Route 19 leaves the US 23/341/SR 27 {{concurrency}} at Victory Boulevard. Shortly afterwards at Main Street, it has another intersection with the southeastern terminus of Georgia State Route 117, across from Burns Street. The routes then curve more towards {{the west as}} they cross the same railroad line that US 23 encountered near the Hazlehurst border. Curving back to the northwest, it becomes a divided highway once again. Beyond that, it winds through farms and forestland of Georgia with few landmarks of any significance other than intersections with former Georgia State Route 134, and later Georgia State Route 149. West of SR 149 is the Talmadge Home (a.k.a. [...] "Sugar Creek Plantation"), which is now a restaurant and catering hall. It also passes the Telfair County Elementary School, and then the broadcast home of WYSC and WYIS, which is incorrectly marked as WDAX-AM by Google Maps. The divided highway ends at a Husqvarna plant along the border of McRae where after the intersection with East Avenue, the route later splits onto a pair of one way streets. Though the northbound lanes are still {{considered part of the}} Golden Isles Parkway, street name signs still refer to it as Railroad Street, as they do to the local street {{on the opposite side of}} the railroad tracks. Though the historic Telfair County Courthouse and Jail can be seen from both northbound and southbound US 23/341, it is officially located only on the southbound street. The northbound street passes a former Southern Railway station across from an agricultural seed and feed store at the intersection of Second Street, which has a former grade crossing that was closed, and then intersects with US 280-319-441. The <b>one-way</b> <b>split</b> ends between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. US 23/341/SR 27 crosses the former McRae-Helena border at a shopping center called the Telfair Plaza. A few blocks after this, it encounters a former Seaboard Air Line railroad crossing west of Forsyth Avenue. The divided highway resumes just west of the city limits.|$|R
25|$|Most {{of southeastern}} {{downtown}} Rochester's major streets are <b>one-way,</b> resulting in <b>split</b> routings for both NY15 and NY31 {{as they pass}} through downtown. Westbound NY31 continues north from {{the north end of}} NY15 on South Clinton Avenue to East Broad Street, onto which it turns west. Southbound NY15, meanwhile, begins one block to the west at the intersection of South Avenue and Woodbury Boulevard (where eastbound NY31 makes a left turn). NY15 follows South Avenue, {{as well as a number}} of ramps traversing the Inner Loop and I-490, to the intersection of Mount Hope Avenue and Byron Street, where it joins northbound NY15 on Mount Hope Avenue.|$|R

50|$|US 178 {{meets the}} {{southern}} end of SC 135 shortly before entering Anderson County, where the highway becomes Liberty Highway and intersects SC 88 (Old Greenville Highway). The highway crosses the Six and Twenty Creek arm of Lake Hartwell and temporarily expands to four lanes around its intersection with US 176 Connector, which feeds into SC 28's western bypass of Anderson, Pearman Dairy Road. US 178 gradually approaches US 76 and SC 28 Business (Clemson Boulevard) as it enters a commercial area before meeting and joining those highways at an oblique intersection. The three highways follow an undivided highway with three southbound lanes, two northbound lanes, and a center turn lane into the city of Anderson, where the road's name changes to Main Street and passes to the east of the Civic Center of Anderson. South of Anderson Mall, SC 28 Business continues on Main Street while US 178 and US 76 veer onto four-lane North Avenue, which parallels Main Street on the west. Shortly after North Avenue <b>splits</b> into <b>one-way</b> carriageways <b>split</b> by a wide parked median, the avenue veers east toward Main Street and the U.S. Highways continue along Club Drive and Park Drive, which have several sports field in their wide median.|$|R
50|$|East of there, {{the road}} runs along {{small portion of}} the border with Valdosta {{becoming}} West Hill Avenue then enters it completely just before encountering the quarter cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 75 at Exit 16, and from there also serves as the beginning of the Interstate 75 Business Loop. US 84/221/I-BUS 75/SR 83 makes a brief curve to the southeast before the intersection with the southern terminus of SR 133. After crossing over a railroad bridge and then intersecting North Wells Street, the routes become a <b>one-way</b> pair <b>splitting</b> between Hill Avenue (eastbound) and Central Avenue (westbound). Further downtown, US 84/221/SR 38 encounters another one-way pair at US 41 Business, the southbound road uses North Patterson Street, and the northbound road which is a block later is at North Ashley Street, which takes I-BL 75 with it. West Hill and West Central Avenues become East Hill and East Central Avenues east of Patterson Street. Central Avenue ends at Hill Avenue and Forrest Street making the routes bidirectional four-lane undivided highway with center-left turn provisions once again. After Blanchard Street, the road becomes a divided highway just before crossing a pair of bridges over Knights Creek, then passes by some radio towers for WJEM (1150 AM). The end of US 221's multiplex with US 84/SR 38 takes place at the intersection with US 41/SRs 7/31 (Inner Perimeter Road), and US 221 turns north along a new multiplex. After a curve to the northwest, the four routes intersect East Park Avenue. Here, US 221/SR 31 split off to the northeast and then leaves the city, while US 41/SR 7 heads northwest towards I-75 at Exit 22. East Park Avenue runs northeast becoming Lakeland Highway, and passes through spares residencies and occasional farm fields of little importance. The only site of any significance along this route is the Bemiss Auxiliary Army Airfield which is hidden off in a wooden area accessible only by a dirt road just south of the Lowndes-Lanier County Line.|$|R
50|$|In New Bedford, {{the route}} splits {{just east of}} the {{terminus}} of Massachusetts Route 140 onto Kempton Street (eastbound) and Mill Street (westbound), two one-lane, one-way streets. The two halves join again to cross over Massachusetts Route 18 just before crossing the New Bedford - Fairhaven Bridge into the town of Fairhaven. After passing the terminus of Massachusetts Route 240 the route continues east into Mattapoisett and Marion along a four-lane road. Access to I-195 is provided in both towns along North Street in Mattapoisett and Massachusetts Route 105 in Marion. US 6 then crosses the Weweantic River into Wareham. In the central part of town the route turns southeast along Main Street, then east-northeast along Sandwich Road before beginning a concurrency with Massachusetts Route 28, with the first 3/4 mi being <b>split</b> <b>one-way</b> between east and west, just south of Massachusetts Route 25, the major connecting highway between Cape Cod and Interstates 195 and 495. The route passes through busy retail area of East Wareham before passing into the Buzzards Bay section of Bourne. The two routes split into east and west one-way sections again before Route 28 leaves the concurrency to cross the Bourne Bridge across the Cape Cod Canal. US 6 then follows the western side of the canal along the Scenic Highway before joining the right-of-way for Massachusetts Route 3 that ends at the Sagamore Bridge, in which US 6 crosses onto Cape Cod proper.|$|R
