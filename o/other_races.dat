40|$|Facial cues {{of threat}} such as anger and <b>other</b> <b>race</b> {{membership}} are detected preferentially in visual search tasks. However, {{it remains unclear}} whether these facial cues interact in visual search. If both cues equally facilitate search, a symmetrical interaction would be predicted; anger cues should facilitate detection of <b>other</b> <b>race</b> faces and cues of <b>other</b> <b>race</b> membership should facilitate detection of anger. Past research investigating this race by emotional expression interaction in categorisation tasks revealed an asymmetrical interaction. This suggests that cues of <b>other</b> <b>race</b> membership may facilitate the detection of angry faces but not vice versa. Utilising the same stimuli and procedures across two search tasks, {{participants were asked to}} search for targets defined by either race or emotional expression.

The study by Humphreys et al. was replicated using the same stimuli, while participants’ eye movements were recorded.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. People are poorer at recognising <b>other</b> <b>race</b> faces, {{referred to as}} an own race bias (ORB). This project examined perceptual tasks requiring attention to the identity of faces and access to long-term memory (face matching and detection). A sequential matching task involving own or <b>other</b> <b>race</b> faces showed ORB only on same and not different decisions. 			 			Examining the causes of ORB in relation to configural and featural processing by manipulating the orientation of stimuli, showed that inverting faces increased response latencies, with increase being greater for own <b>race</b> than <b>other</b> <b>race</b> faces. Using whole or part faces in a simultaneous matching task to compare local versus global configural processing, showed that face context is important for own <b>race</b> but not <b>other</b> <b>race</b> faces, suggesting the difference in processing may relate to local configural processing. Face detection viewing Caucasian or Asian faces or non-face stimuli, showed no overall difference in face detection latencies for the two races, while obscuring features of a face affected response latencies to own <b>race</b> but not <b>other</b> <b>race</b> faces. ORB thus influences several tasks not requiring access to long-term memory, showing that previous accounts of ORB based only on access to memorial representations need extending...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The <b>other</b> <b>race</b> effect, {{also known}} as own race bias, refers to the {{enhanced}} ability to recognize faces belonging to one’s own race relative to faces from another <b>race.</b> The <b>other</b> <b>race</b> effect is associated with increased amygdala response in healthy individuals. The amygdala is a key node in emotion processing which shows impaired functioning in depression and has been proposed to be a marker of depressive state. We investigated {{the impact of the}} <b>other</b> <b>race</b> effect on amygdala responses in depression. Methods: Participants were 30 individuals with major depression (mean age 39. 4 years) and 23 healthy individuals (mean age: 38. 8 years) recruited from the community. Participants were Asian, Black/African American and Caucasian. During a functional MRI scan, participants viewed Caucasian faces which displayed a range of sad expressions. A region of interest analysis of left and right amygdala responses was performed. Results: Increased bilateral amygdala responses were observed in response to the Caucasian face stimuli in participants who were Asian or Black/African American as compared to Caucasian participants in both healthy individuals and individuals with major depression. There was no significant group by race interaction effect. Conclusions: Increased amygdala responses associated with the <b>other</b> <b>race</b> effect were evident in both individuals with major depression and in healthy participants. Increased amygdala responses with the <b>other</b> <b>race</b> effect is a potential confound of the neural correlates of facial processing in healthy participants and in mental health disorders.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{determine}} if race saliency affected responses on implicit measures of racial bias. Including racial labels in measures assessing implicit bias, particularly when presenting two racial groups vs. just one group, may inadvertently cue children that race is an important grouping variable and, in turn, increase the bias they display. We investigated 8 - and 13 -year old children’s performance on the affective priming task (APT), which does not use labels; the single category implicit association test (SCIAT) with Black faces and the SCIAT with White faces, each of which includes only one racial label; and the implicit association test (IAT), which contrasts two racial labels. Results supported the hypothesis that presenting two racial groups relative to one racial group increased bias. A secondary {{goal of this}} research was to examine relations between children’s bias on implicit and explicit racial bias tasks. Bias displayed on the implicit measures was unrelated, but bias displayed on an explicit task and the IAT was related, perhaps because both measures present two groups within the task. A final goal {{of this study was to}} examine whether the amount of <b>other</b> <b>race</b> friends or <b>other</b> <b>race</b> interactions was related to children’s implicit and explicit bias. The amount of <b>other</b> <b>race</b> interactions was unrelated, but the amount of <b>other</b> <b>race</b> friends negatively correlated with most of the racial bias measures; the more <b>other</b> <b>race</b> friends a child had, the lower their negative bias toward Black faces.
