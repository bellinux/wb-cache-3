In April 2010 the Philharmonic was awarded the Oregon Symphony's Patty Vemer Excellence in Music Education Award, marking the first time the recognition for inspiring students was presented to an organization. Hattner accepted the award on the orchestra's behalf. In order to make use of all musicians in the Philharmonic as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> Hattner often uses Romantic music and symphonies and ballets from the early 20th century in his programs. The Philharmonic began offering chamber orchestra concerts during his tenure.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after this}} agonizing pedicure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The {{bindings}} were pulled even tighter {{each time the}} girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants {{two or three times}} a week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery made a {{great effort}} to appear before troops as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> {{frequently}} visiting various units and making himself known to the men, often arranging for cigarettes to be distributed. Although he still wore a standard British officer's cap on arrival in the desert, he briefly wore an Australian broad-brimmed hat before switching to wearing the black beret (with the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment next to the British General Officer's badge) for which he became notable. The black beret was offered to him by Jim Fraser while the latter was driving him on an inspection tour. Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the transformation in atmosphere when they visited on 19 August, {{less than a week}} after Montgomery had taken command.|$|E
25|$|Despite being a {{decorated}} pilot, Nungesser was placed {{under house arrest}} {{on more than one}} occasion for flying without permission. He disliked strict military discipline and went to Paris to enjoy its many pleasures (such as alcohol and women) as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> He was a leading fighter pilot whose combat exploits against the Germans were widely publicized in France. Nungesser's rugged good looks, flamboyant personality, and appetite for danger, beautiful women, wine, and fast cars made him the embodiment of the stereotypical flying ace. He would sometimes arrive for morning patrol still dressed in the tuxedo he'd worn the night before and even occasionally with a female companion. In contrast to the unsociable but nonetheless top French ace René Fonck, Nungesser was well liked by his comrades.|$|E

25|$|After {{the inaugural}} {{presidency}} of Douglas Hyde, {{who was an}} interparty nominee for the office, the nominees of the Fianna Fáil political party won every presidential election until 1990. The party traditionally used the nomination {{as a reward for}} its most senior and prominent members, such as party founder and longtime Taoiseach Éamon de Valera and European Commissioner Patrick Hillery. Most of its occupants to that time followed Hyde's precedent-setting conception of the presidency as a conservative, low-key institution that used its ceremonial prestige and few discretionary powers sparingly. In fact, the presidency was such a quiet position that Irish politicians sought to avoid contested presidential elections as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> feeling that the attention such elections would bring to the office was an unnecessary distraction, and office-seekers facing economic austerity would often suggest the elimination of the office as a money-saving measure.|$|E
25|$|Harvey's meals {{were served}} in sumptuous {{portions}} {{that provided a}} good value for the traveling public; for instance, pies were cut into fourths, rather than sixths, which was the industry standard at the time. The Harvey Company and AT established a series of signals that allowed the dining room staff {{to make the necessary}} preparations to feed an entire train in just thirty minutes. Harvey Houses served their meals on fine China and Irish linens. Fred Harvey, a fastidious innkeeper, set high standards for efficiency and cleanliness in his establishments, personally inspecting them as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> It was said that nothing escaped his notice, and he was even known to completely overturn a poorly set table. Male customers were required to wear a coat and tie in many of Harvey's dining rooms. The Harvey Houses served many a meal to GIs traveling on troop trains during World War II.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{requirements}} that [...] "new music" [...] be composed as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> Bach seldom chose older poems for his cantatas; consequently, the conductor Craig Smith has suggested that parts of this work may have been composed earlier than the first recorded Leipzig performance. Bach had already composed his first solo cantata on a text by Lehms, , composed during his tenure in Weimar, also for an alto soloist.|$|E

Another particular love was film. In Cairo, during the Second World War, he was a regular at the cinema, a location that suited his photographic memory and preference for working at night; he often conducted meetings there. Films influenced his work in other ways, for instance in the inspiration he took from Northwest Passage to name the US Rangers.|$|E

He wrote that he had his football future worked out in his mind and that, even when working in the pit, he was only [...] "killing time". He always believed that {{it was only a matter}} of time before he became a professional player. He explained that, in football terms, he had always been an optimist with a belief in his destiny and that was the basis of his undying enthusiasm for the sport.|$|E

She also asked her daughters to cut her hair, which was then sewn into a cushion and placed on Wagner's breast. On 16 February the journey back to Bayreuth began, and on Sunday 18 February the cortège processed to Wahnfried, where, following a brief service, Wagner was buried in the garden. Cosima remained in the house until the ceremonies were over; according to her daughter Daniela she then went to the grave [...] "and for a long time lay down on the coffin until Fidi (Siegfried) went to fetch her". Afterwards she went into seclusion for many months, barely even seeing her children, with whom she communicated mainly through written notes.

By way of travelling wave analysis, conditions are derived under which the invasion of the host population is slowed down, stopped or reversed as a consequence of a subsequently introduced disease. Hence, pathogens can dramatically control the rate of spread of invasive species...|$|R
500|$|... "Hero" [...] is a mid-tempo ballad. It {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Carey and Afanasieff, {{and was released}} as the second single from her third studio album, Music Box. It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the piano, guitar and organ. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 62 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of E5. The song's chorus has a basic chord progression of Gsus2–G–G/F–Em7–G/D–C-G/B–Am7. Originally, Carey felt the song was [...] "too schmaltzy" [...] and over the top for her, and not in line with her other work. However, after being convinced by Mottola to keep the song, Carey changed the song and personalized it, during which time she grew to feel {{a connection to the}} song and its lyrics. According to author Chris Nickson, [...] "Hero" [...] is one of Carey's most personal and inspirational ballads. Carey has described how the song was never her favorite, however, after all the fan letters and messages she received about the song, she felt the need to perform it as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> In an interview with Fred Bronson, Carey described the song's meaning to her and to fans: ...|$|E
500|$|Responses from {{critics have}} given mostly average {{reviews of the}} album. Polly Coufos from The Sunday Times {{considers}} Damien Leith as [...] "the most complete artist Australian Idol has yet uncovered". Coufos rated the album 3.5 stars, and comments that [...] "Leith uses that heavenly falsetto as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> without making himself appear a one-trick pony". Coufos, however says that the two cover songs, [...] "Songbird" [...] and [...] "Danny Boy" [...] are an [...] "unnecessary hedging of bets". Andrew Murfett from The Age notices the album's different arrangement from the previous Idol debuts and considers it {{to be better than}} those, but says that the album still contains too many ballad songs. Murfett remarks [...] "Songbird" [...] as a good choice for a cover song. Lauren Katulka from 'Oz Music Scene' compliments Leith's songwriting and composing, and says that Where We Land [...] "is a great indication of the potential of Australia's revamped Idol franchise". Lucy Tyler from the Sydney Anglican Network says that though the album is well-produced; it is unbalanced and bland, and [...] "its lack of variety means that it gives listeners little to think about". Tyler notes that Where We Land focuses on the melancholic aspects of life and remarks that [...] "Leith appears to have forgotten that life can sometimes be happy, too".|$|E
500|$|Soon {{they heard}} about an {{engaging}} minister named John Cotton who preached at Saints Botolph's Church {{in the large}} port of Boston, about [...] from Alford. Cotton was installed as minister at Boston the year that the Hutchinsons were married, after having been a tutor at Emmanuel College in Cambridge. [...] He was only 27years old, yet he had gained {{a reputation as one}} of the leading Puritans in England. [...] Once the Hutchinsons heard Cotton preach, the couple made the trip to Boston as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> enduring the ride by horseback when the weather and circumstances allowed. [...] Cotton's spiritual message was different from that of his fellow Puritans, as he placed less emphasis on one's behavior to attain God's salvation and more emphasis on the moment of religious conversion [...] "in which mortal man was infused with a divine grace." [...] Anne Hutchinson was greatly attracted to Cotton's theology of [...] "absolute grace", which caused her to question the value of [...] "works" [...] and to view the Holy Spirit as [...] "indwelling in the elect saint". [...] This allowed her to identify as a [...] "mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty"; such a theology was empowering to women, according to Eve LaPlante, whose status was otherwise determined by their husbands or fathers.|$|E

Using a sample of real estate investment trusts, which have no significant correlation between dividend size and yield, we find that close‐to‐open ex‐dividend price drops are related to dividend size {{as suggested by the}} microstructure models, but close‐to‐close price drops are related to dividend yield as predicted by the tax theory. These results imply that overnight price drops are primarily determined by microstructure, but that trading during the ex‐day causes prices to adjust to reflect individual tax preferences. ...|$|R
