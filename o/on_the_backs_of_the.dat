25|$|A {{baseball}} uniform {{is a type}} {{of uniform}} worn by baseball players. Most baseball uniforms have the names and uniform numbers of players who wear them, usually <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uniforms to distinguish players from each other. Baseball shirts (jerseys), pants, shoes, socks, caps, and gloves are parts of baseball uniforms. Most uniforms have different logos and colors to aid players, officials, and spectators in distinguishing the two teams from each other and the officials. They are made out of polyester instead of cotton, because washing shrinks the cotton fabric.|$|E

The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps, with an optional sunroof.

Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback.

25|$|Names began {{appearing}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jerseys for bowl games {{beginning in the}} 1970s. Around 1980, the players' names {{began appearing}} on the road jerseys. The home jerseys remained nameless except for when worn during bowl games, with one exception. A brief tradition was established for the last home game of each season, where seniors (playing their final game in Memorial Stadium) were allowed to wear names on their jerseys; underclassmen, however, did not. This explains why footage of many Oklahoma-Nebraska games played in Lincoln during this era feature some Nebraska players with names on their jerseys and some without. From 1990 onward, names were permanently affixed to the home jersey, where they remain.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Zack Handlen for The A.V. Club gave the episode an overall score of C-, saying that at points the episode just got {{annoying}} especially when Troi was describing Armus' feelings. He thought that Yar's death scene was out of place in the episode and that overall Armus was unthreatening, saying [...] "Murdering Yar should make Armus seem much more dangerous, but he's just so whiny and petulant and bland that he could've killed half a dozen cast members without leaving an impression." [...] Keith DeCandido for Tor.com thought that Yar's death was [...] "pointless", but thought that it was in a manner suitable for a security officer in Star Trek. He also felt that it was one of Troi's better episodes, but that Armus [...] "fails in every possible way as a villain, and that’s entirely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people doing the visual effects and the voice casting." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} plates {{in this group}} reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of {{religious}} images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. , Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the [...] "Virgin of Solitude". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, [...] "It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations." [...] Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were [...] "illusory, since what they proposed {{was nothing more than}} the adoration of an empty form".|$|E

500|$|Several NBA {{players and}} coaches said the brawl was the worst fight they had ever seen. Pacers fans began {{to refer to the}} team as [...] "the Thugs". Pistons CEO Tom Wilson later stated that Artest's action took away {{physical}} barriers, such as tables and benches, that normally separate fans and players, and Indianapolis Star reporter Mark Montieth claimed [...] that [...] "in a way, [...] provoked [...] passively by lying down". In the post-game commentary on ESPN's NBA Shootaround, ESPN's studio analysts laid the blame on the Pistons' fans instead of on the players. John Saunders of ESPN referred to the fans as [...] "a bunch of punks". [...] Tim Legler said that [...] "the fans crossed the line". Stephen A. Smith stated that [...] "They should be ashamed of themselves and some of them (the fans) should be arrested as far as I'm concerned". Their commentary prompted ESPN vice president Mark Shapiro to place calls to host Saunders, as well as analysts Legler, Smith, and Greg Anthony. Shapiro felt their commentary was biased. The following Tuesday, Shapiro stated, [...] "I wish the studio hadn't laid the blame solely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fans Friday night." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Great Patriotic War {{broke out}} in 1941, the Efimovs refused to leave Moscow, though the winter of 1941–1942 was bitterly cold. Simonovich-Efimova worked in the Lefortovo District at the First Mobile Hospital tending to wounded {{soldiers}} and writing letters for them to their families and comrades. In a series of drawings called [...] "The Wounded", she drew portraits of the soldiers trying to capture their courage, noting their injuries and their addresses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drawings. Some of the drawings she would work up in oil or watercolor, spending most of the daylight hours at the hospital. In the evenings, the couple worked on puppetry, preparing concerts and puppet shows for the troops based on historic and patriotic themes. They also allowed artists to take refuge at their home and work the small garden to supplement their food. They trained and rehearsed their actors daily, though finding male actors was difficult, compounded by gas and electrical shortages. Simonovich-Efimova also compiled a memoir of her cousin and teacher Valentin Serov, though her book, Memories of V. A. Serov (...) was not published until 1964.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{weightlessness}} {{increases the}} amount of fluid in {{the upper part of}} the body, astronauts experience increased intracranial pressure. This appears to increase pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyeballs, affecting their shape and slightly crushing the optic nerve. [...] This effect was noticed in 2012 in a study using MRI scans of astronauts who had returned to Earth following at least one month in space.

They are roughly of twice human size, and were occasionally killed in battle by Elves and Men. [...] They were fierce demons, associated with fire, armed with fiery whips of many thongs and claws like steel, and Morgoth delighted in using them to torture his captives. They were loyal to Morgoth, and once came out of hiding to save him from capture.|$|E
