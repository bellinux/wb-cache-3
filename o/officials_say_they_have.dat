5000|$|Political {{reform and}} corruption: The minor parties have all {{come forward with}} {{strategies}} designed to prevent the large-scale <b>official</b> corruption <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>has</b> taken place under the outgoing administration.

The building itself is being constructed in a way that it is not directly settled on the ground surface and is not compressing the earth underneath the structure, in a sense rendering no harm to any artifacts that may be housed there and yet to be found. The museum is continuing to work with officials to make sure that any artifacts or heritage items found at the site are handled appropriately. The museum also pointed out that it has met all of the provinces guidelines for heritage sites.|$|R

Ted Lewis, his son, firmly said his father was born in 1923 to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York.
