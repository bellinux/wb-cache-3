In each proceeding, citizens are given time to speak and express their opinion on pending legislation. The hall is open to any of Mongolia's 2.9 million people and is located in Ulaanbaatar; some additional halls have been opened in other provinces. They are designed to encourage civil participation to have consensus between legislators and citizens before any <b>open</b> <b>issue</b> becomes law.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 2001, the National Assembly of France {{passed the}} Taubira law, {{recognizing}} slavery {{as a crime}} against humanity. Apologies on behalf of African nations, for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery, remain an <b>open</b> <b>issue</b> since slavery was practiced in Africa even before the first Europeans arrived and the Atlantic slave trade was performed {{with a high degree}} of involvement of several African societies. The black slave market was supplied by well-established slave trade networks controlled by local African societies and individuals. Indeed, as already mentioned in this article, slavery persists in several areas of West Africa until the present day.|$|E

500|$|Some media experts {{consider}} that pursuit of luxury retail advertising an effective strategy, {{but whether the}} magazine becomes a success is an <b>open</b> <b>issue.</b> [...] Immediate speculation commented on the likelihood for success given {{the demographics of the}} initial subscription base. [...] Others ascribed their great expectations to the brand. [...] Some skeptics claim that since Journal readers are financial information seekers giving them a free magazine of luxury ads may be a waste of time. Others note the magazine's launch despite a market with declining advertising and a world economy suffering from the Financial crisis of 2007–2008. [...] Some advertisers expressed appreciation for an opportunity to present to The Wall Street Journals readers in a different format.|$|E
2500|$|A 2007 paper {{published}} in PNAS put forward DNA and archaeological evidence that domesticated chickens {{had been introduced}} into South America via Polynesia by late pre-Columbian times. These findings were challenged by a later study {{published in}} the same journal, that cast doubt on the dating calibration used and presented alternative mtDNA analyses that disagreed with a Polynesian genetic origin. The origin and dating remains an <b>open</b> <b>issue.</b> [...] Whether or not early Polynesian–American exchanges occurred, no compelling human-genetic, archaeological, cultural or linguistic legacy of such contact has turned up.|$|E

30|$|Although {{big data}} {{analytics}} {{is a new}} age for data analysis, because several solutions adopt classical ways {{to analyze the data}} on big data analytics, the <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> of traditional data mining algorithms also exist in these new systems. The <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> of noise, outliers, incomplete, and inconsistent data in traditional data mining algorithms will also appear in big data mining algorithms. More incomplete and inconsistent data will easily appear because the data are captured by or generated from different sensors and systems. The impact of noise, outliers, incomplete and inconsistent data will be enlarged for big data analytics. Therefore, how to mitigate the impact will be the <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> for big data analytics.|$|R

50|$|Raorchestes tinniens is {{a species}} of frog in the Rhacophoridae family. It is endemic to the Nilgiri Hills, {{a part of the}} Western Ghats, in Tamil Nadu, {{southern}} India. It has a rather complicated taxonomic history, and there is still an <b>open</b> <b>issue</b> whether Ixalus montanus Günther, 1876 from Kudremukh (Karnataka), now in synonymy with Raorchestes tinniens, is indeed a valid species.|$|E
5000|$|Construction work {{started on}} September 10, but stopped in November when the {{concrete}} tower was 494 ft in height.

50|$|In general, a legal {{contract}} signed {{between two}} or more people will often include penalties for the severing of the contract by a party or parties.

In each key area we identify prominent approaches and methodologies that have <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> warranting further investigation within the community, challenges associated with certain techniques, and algorithms necessitating clarification of their implications.

30|$|Algorithm 1 {{summarizes}} {{the processing of}} a NextBug Ajax event. It selects the filtered <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> that follows the criteria defined by the filter options (line 3), and then performs standard IR techniques on these <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> along with the browsed issue (lines 4 - 9). The processed issues are passed to the recommender system which selects {{the ones that are}} more relevant to the browsed issue (line 10). Finally, the produced recommendations are returned to the Bugzilla interface (line 14).|$|R
50|$|Many {{attorneys}} establish {{asset protection}} trusts {{under the laws}} of another country and deposit the trust assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein. One question raised by this approach is whether a creditor can seize assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein without having to bring a claim in the trust-protective jurisdiction. Again, a lack of precedent suggests {{that this is an}} <b>open</b> <b>issue</b> in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.|$|E
5000|$|Deschamps J {{noted that}} the SCC had {{previously}} left for future determination the operation of equitable subordination in Canada but that she declined to endorse it in the Indalex decision. She held {{there was no evidence}} that the DIP Lenders committed a wrong or engaged in inequitable conduct. As a result, it remains an <b>open</b> <b>issue</b> as to whether the doctrine of equitable subordination can be invoked in Canada to subordinate the claims of prior-ranking secured creditors in favour of junior-ranking creditors.|$|E

40|$|Doing some {{electronic}} {{business on the}} Internet is already an easy task today. As is cheating and snooping. Several reasons contribute to this insecurity: The Internet does not offer much security per-se. Eavesdropping and acting under false identity is simple. Popular PC operating systems offer little or no security against viri or other malicious software. At the same time, user awareness for security risks is threateningly low. A few specific security tools are in wide use, and several projects have been aiming at more comprehensive security for electronic commerce. Still {{there are a lot}} of important <b>open</b> <b>issues.</b> This article reviews these <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> in a structured way. It is based on experience with the European R&D project SEMPER, but it is not a presentation of the project results beyond some useful concrete background for the more general <b>open</b> <b>issues.</b> 1 Introduction Since the invention of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1991, Internet-based electronic commerce has been transforme [...] ...|$|R

In December, when the Swedes lifted their siege, the Polish forces had begun to gain the upper hand, and the defence of Jasna Góra, an important symbol for the Poles, was certainly a significant morale boost. However, to what extent the defence of Jasna Góra motivated the defenders is still an <b>open</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

40|$|Commission (NRC) {{staff and}} representatives of Lost Creek ISR, LLC (LCI) was held to discuss LCI’s {{application}} for a license to construct and operate a uranium in situ recovery facility (ISR) in Wyoming. The NRC staff had completed its review of LCI’s application and prepared an internal draft of the Safety Evaluation Report (SER). The conference call was held as a follow-up to the conference call between the NRC and LCI on September 25, 2009 (ML 093130083) to discuss <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> that NRC staff identified in preparing the draft SER.

50|$|The book {{contains}} an introductory chapter summarising {{the history of}} BWS and the three cases, together with why the respondent must think whether (s)he wishes {{to use it to}} understand theory (processes) of decision-making and/or merely to collect data in a systematic way. Three chapters, one for each case, follow, detailing the intuition and application of each. A chapter bringing together Marley's work proving the properties of the key estimators and laying out some <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> then follows. After laying out <b>open</b> <b>issues</b> for further analysis, nine chapters (three per case - describing applications from a variety of disciplines) then follow.|$|R
