5|$|To {{the east}} of the village, Felin Uchaf is an {{educational}} centre exploring ways <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> working in partnership with the environment. Developed on a redundant farm, it provides residential courses in rural skills and sustainable agriculture. A traditional Iron Age roundhouse has been built on the site.|$|E
5|$|After renovations were {{finished}} in 2005, {{the number of}} two- and three-bedroom units was increased dramatically, due to {{the combination of the}} building's original studio apartments. The larger layouts attracted more families to the cooperative community. In recent years the lobby has been restored, hallways remodeled, and amenities increased, including larger storage areas, a bike room, and an improved laundry facility. The building is now said to be luxurious as measured both by residents' quality <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> by the purchase prices they pay.|$|E

His original herbarium of 2,699 plants included specimens dated and numbered in his journal as follows: New Ireland (Bismarck Archipelago, Jul 17–24 1792, collection numbers 699-786); Ambon (Sept 6 – Oct 12, 1792, nos. 787-1113), Boeroe (Sept3–5, 1793, nos 1517-1669), Sourabaya, East Java (Oct 29 1793–Aug 1794, nos 1670-1962), Java (from 1794–96, nos 1963-2296), Batavia, west Java (Jun 1796–Jan 1797, nos 2297-2419) and the remainder from Isle de France.|$|E

5|$|Born into a Fang family, Aubame was {{orphaned}} {{at a young}} age. He {{was raised}} by the stepbrother of Léon M'ba, who became Aubame's chief political rival. Encouraged by his colleagues, Aubame entered politics, serving as Gabon's first representative in the National Assembly of France from 1946 to 1958. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> planning urban sites. Aubame's quick rise in Gabonese politics was spurred by {{the support of the}} missions and administration, whereas much of M'ba's strength came from the colonists.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz's {{childhood}} environment exerted a {{major influence}} on his literary work. His early years were shaped by immersion in Belarusian folklore and by vivid memories, which he later reworked in his poems, of the ruins of Navahrudak Castle and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and Napoleonic troops during Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. The year 1812 also marked his father's death. Later, the poet's personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> studying in Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|Social conditions, the {{standard}} <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> the self-confidence {{of the workers}} gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while {{the standard}} of living rose among the common people, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of the socioeconomic and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' responses and the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E

On 7 July 1984, the band played a benefit gig at Aberdare, Wales, for striking miners, and on the return trip guitarist N. A. Palmer announced {{that he intended to}} leave the group. This confirmed Crass's previous intention to quit in 1984, and the band split up.|$|E
5|$|The {{party is}} {{strongly}} individualistic, wanting {{to reduce the}} power of the state and the public sector. It believes that the public sector should only be there to secure a minimum standard <b>of</b> <b>living,</b> <b>and</b> that individuals, businesses and organisations should take care of various tasks instead of the public sector, in most cases. The party also generally advocates the lowering of taxes, various duties, as well increased market economy.|$|E
5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of price {{controls}} to restrain the price <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 she brought an entourage of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E

He was {{the mayor of}} Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, from 1 January 2011 to 30 September 2013. His political projects focused on promoting education, improving the standards <b>of</b> <b>living,</b> <b>and</b> in bringing back a sense of public security {{to the citizens of}} the city. He also owned the newspapers Primera Hora and Última Hora. During his mayoral administration in Nuevo Laredo, Galván received numerous threats from organized crime. Five months after his term, he was kidnapped and killed by alleged members of the Los Zetas crime syndicate.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{stayed in}} the RAF and joined the Night Fighter Development Wing of the Central Fighter Establishment where he tested and {{developed}} existing and new night fighting equipment. However, the massive disarmament and reduction of the RAF—mimicking that of the early 1920s—disillusioned Braham even more. Flying was reduced to save costs and removed the one activity that had drawn him into the RAF in 1937. Initially he still managed regular flights to Belgium, where the RAF retained large bases. While there {{he was awarded the}} Order of the Crown and Croix de guerre with Palm for his wartime work. The arrangement was short-lived. The Central Fighter Establishment was cut by half. Coupled with rationing and a declining standard <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> low-wages, Braham resigned from the RAF in March 1946 and applied to join the Rhodesian Colonial Police. Bill Gregory heard of Braham's decision and contacted Basil Embry, Braham's former commanding officer. Embry soon persuaded him to return to the RAF at the rank of flight lieutenant with the pay of an acting wing commander. There followed a period of two years of non-flying appointments in the Air Ministry in London.|$|E
5|$|Gabon gained its {{independence}} from France on 17 August 1960. The country had a relatively high standard <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> {{was considered one of}} the more stable countries in West Africa, both politically and economically. At the time of the coup, the country had an estimated US$200 average annual income {{and was one of the}} few countries in Africa with a positive trade balance, with exports exceeding imports by 30 percent. As of 1964, the country was among the largest producers of uranium and manganese in French Africa, which Time suggested was one of the reasons for France's response to the coup. It also had petroleum, iron, and logging interests stationed in Gabon.|$|E

5|$|Henry of Huntingdon {{records that}} noblemen sent their {{children}} to be educated at Bloet's household, {{whether or not they}} were destined for a career in the church. King Henry's illegitimate son Robert of Gloucester was educated in Bloet's care. Another illegitimate son of Henry's, Richard of Lincoln, was also in Bloet's household for an education. Gilbert of Sempringham, who founded the Gilbertine Order, was also educated in Bloet's household, entering it before Bloet's death and continuing there under Bloet's successor Alexander of Lincoln. Besides educating laymen, Bloet educated his own household clergy, including sending some of them to study under Ivo, Bishop of Chartres. He was known for his ostentatious manner <b>of</b> <b>living,</b> <b>and</b> served personally in war when needed. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury claimed that he hated monks. Henry of Huntingdon, however, remembered him as handsome, cheerful and affable. Earlier in his episcopate, Bloet had aided Christina of Markyate's family in their attempts to get the religious hermit to marry, at one point giving a judicial judgement that she must marry, which she refused to do. It was only after Bloet's death that Christina was able to be consecrated as a recluse at St Albans Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{belongs to}} the group of least {{developed}} countries, according to the United Nations. Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. The majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs, Christianity, or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. , the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low {{for the majority of the}} Malagasy population.|$|E

The Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) felt this insufficient given the rise in the cost <b>of</b> <b>living,</b> <b>and</b> called a general strike. Protesters clashed with police, although the government refused to increase the rise, accusing protesters of being pawns of the right. In August 2010, violent protests then broke out in southern Potosí over widespread unemployment and a lack of investment in infrastructure.|$|E
