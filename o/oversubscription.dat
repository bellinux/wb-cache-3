25|$|In 2007 the Edinburgh DVLA office {{exceptionally}} issued TN07 prefixed registrations {{for some}} vehicles, {{instead of the}} expected 'SN07'. This was stated to be because of potential offence caused by interpreting SN07 as 'snot'. This is the first known use of the 'T' code as the first letter, as it was not allocated to a region in the 2001 system. Also, TF07, TH07 and TJ07 registrations have been issued in Glasgow, most probably because the SA07–SJ07 allocations were exhausted. Similarly, along with TN07, TK07 has also been issued by Edinburgh, probably for the same <b>oversubscription</b> reason as in Glasgow. It has also been observed that the TP07 mark has also been issued.|$|E
50|$|In a {{communications}} {{system in which}} multiple users share a common resource, <b>oversubscription</b> refers to {{the ratio of the}} allocated bandwidth per user to the guaranteed bandwidth per user. Underlying the <b>oversubscription</b> model is the fact that statistically few users will attempt to utilize their allocated bandwidth simultaneously. Calculation and management of <b>oversubscription</b> ratios is common in the CATV industry.|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{calculation}} can {{be performed}} using upstream bandwidths. Typically, advertised upload rates are 1/4 the download rates [...] however the available upload bandwidth using DOCSIS 1.1 or 2.0 is also lower. If 100 users allocated 1.75 Mbit/s of upload bandwidth share a single DOCSIS 1.1 upstream, the upload <b>oversubscription</b> ratio is 17:1. One article found a typical DOCSIS download <b>oversubscription</b> ratio to be 28.125:1, while a best case <b>oversubscription</b> may be 12:1.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oversubscription</b> is not {{the same}} as overselling, {{provided}} that the <b>oversubscription</b> ratio, for a given number of subscribers traffic, which is multiplexed over time, does not significantly impact performance. A significant impact to performance might be one in which the performance of the oversubscribed portion of the network is less than that of the end to end service that the subscriber is using. In other words, <b>oversubscription</b> works because not everyone uses it at the same time. <b>Oversubscription</b> is the basis for all non-dedicated telecommunications services. Even if a subscriber had a dedicated access network, that network is still oversubscribed against many others with respect to Internet access for example. The same is true in telephony and in wireless.|$|E
5000|$|For over {{a decade}} since March 1996, the NSE had only listed three new companies, namely Kenya Airways, Mumias and ICID-I.

50|$|Congestion control modulates traffic {{entry into}} a {{telecommunications}} network {{in order to}} avoid congestive collapse resulting from <b>oversubscription.</b> This is typically accomplished by reducing the rate of packets and it {{should not be confused with}} flow control, which prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{a seventh}} form was {{temporarily}} introduced {{for that year}} of entry only, called Pankhurst (after 1900s suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst).

50|$|The BSP {{model is}} also well-suited to enable {{automatic}} memory management for distributed-memory computing through overdecomposition {{of the problem}} and <b>oversubscription</b> of the processors. The computation is divided into more logical processes than there are physical processors, and processes are randomly assigned to processors. This strategy can be shown statistically to lead to almost perfect load balancing, both of work and communication.|$|E
5000|$|System recovery: {{measures}} {{the speed at}} which a DUT recovers from an overload or <b>oversubscription</b> condition. This subtest is performed by temporarily oversubscribing the device under test and then reducing the throughput at normal or low load while measuring frame delay in these two conditions. The different between delay at overloaded condition and the delay and low load conditions represent the recovery time.|$|E
5000|$|Fat tree DCN {{architecture}} {{handles the}} <b>oversubscription</b> and cross section bandwidth problem {{faced by the}} legacy three-tier DCN architecture. Fat tree DCN employs commodity network switches based architecture using Clos topology. The network elements in fat tree topology also follows hierarchical organization of network switches in access, aggregate, and core layers. However, the number of network switches is {{much larger than the}} three-tier DCN. The architecture is composed of k pods, where each pod contains, (k/2)2 servers, k/2 access layer switches, and k/2 aggregate layer switches in the topology. The core layers contain (k/2)2 core switches where each of the core switches is connected to one aggregate layer switch in each of the pods. The fat tree topology offers 1:1 <b>oversubscription</b> ratio and full bisection bandwidth. [...] The fat tree architecture uses a customized addressing scheme and routing algorithm. The scalability {{is one of the major}} issues in fat tree DCN architecture and maximum number of pods is equal to the number of ports in each switch.|$|E

50|$|It is not {{economically}} practical, environmentally reasonable, or {{technically feasible}} to provide dedicated access for every service to every customer. A well-engineered oversubscribed service appears {{to function as}} a dedicated service to a subscriber. Another way of saying this is that a good engineer designs the <b>oversubscription</b> {{in a way that makes}} the service appear to be a dedicated service for that customer. That means no dropped calls on your cell phone, no busy signals when dialing, and no failed downloads on the Internet (for example).|$|E
50|$|JCoSS (Jewish Community Secondary School) is a state-funded Jewish {{secondary}} school in New Barnet, London. Established in 2010, {{it is the}} first Jewish cross-denominational {{secondary school}} in the UK. It was established after a mother observed that while her son had gone to JFS, a nearby Jewish school, many of his friends {{had not been able to}} attend because of <b>oversubscription</b> and halachic requirements, and initiated in 2001 the ultimately successful proposal for a new British faith school. Construction of the school began in April 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Call Admission Control (CAC) {{prevents}} <b>oversubscription</b> of VoIP networks. It {{is used in}} {{the call}} set-up phase and applies to real-time media traffic as opposed to data traffic. CAC mechanisms complement and are distinct from the capabilities of Quality of Service tools to protect voice traffic from the negative effects of other voice traffic and to keep excess voice traffic off the network. Since it averts voice traffic congestion, it is a preventive Congestion Control Procedure. It ensures that there is enough bandwidth for authorized flows.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{cable network}} {{utilizing}} DOCSIS 1.1, for example, the full 38 Mbit/s download bandwidth [...] is typically shared by some 500 subscribers, {{each of which}} may be allocated 7 Mbit/s. [...] Calculating the guaranteed bandwidth per subscriber in this case is accomplished by dividing the maximum total bandwidth of 38 Mbit/s by 500, the maximum number of simultaneous users. The advertised peak bandwidth per user of 7 Mbit/s is 92 times the guaranteed bandwidth per user of 0.076 Mbit/s. In this example, the download <b>oversubscription</b> ratio is 92:1.|$|E
5000|$|Congestion avoidance: Congestion control {{can control}} traffic entry into a {{telecommunications}} network, {{so as to}} avoid congestive collapse by attempting to avoid <b>oversubscription</b> of any of the processing or link capabilities of the intermediate nodes and networks and taking resource reducing steps, such as reducing the rate of sending packets. For example, automatic repeat requests may keep the network in a congested state; this situation can be avoided by adding congestion avoidance to the flow control, including slow-start. This keeps the bandwidth consumption at a low level {{in the beginning of the}} transmission, or after packet retransmission.|$|E

The IPO was oversubscribed by an average of 363.5 per cent with the retail segment, recording the highest <b>oversubscription</b> of 715 per cent. For the first time ever, the transaction team implemented the delivery versus payment (DVP) method, which allowed institutional investors and insurance firms to hold off payment until the share allocation was completed. http://allafrica.com/stories/200708061780.html ...|$|E
5000|$|The way {{in which}} {{students}} come to live in particular Houses has changed greatly over time.

Today, groups of one to eight freshmen form a block which is then assigned, essentially at random, to an upperclass house.|$|E
50|$|Scalability {{is one of}} the {{foremost}} challenges to the DCNs. With the advent of cloud paradigm, data centers are required to scale up to hundreds of thousands of nodes. Besides offering immense scalability, the DCNs are also required to deliver high cross-section bandwidth. Current DCN architectures, such as three-tier DCN offer poor cross-section bandwidth and possess very high over-subscription ratio near the root. Fat tree DCN architecture delivers 1:1 <b>oversubscription</b> ratio and high cross section bandwidth, but it suffers from low scalability limited to k=total number of ports in a switch. DCell offers immense scalability, but it delivers very poor performance under heavy network load and one-to-many traffic patterns.|$|E

50|$|Competition {{by users}} {{of a system}} {{for use of the}} same {{facility}} at the same time. This may also be known as <b>oversubscription.</b> The term contention ratio applies specifically to the number of people connected to an ISP who share a set amount of bandwidth. Typical values would be 50:1 for home users (that is to say that 50 people or lines will vie for the same bandwidth) and 20:1 for business users. It {{is for this reason that}} the shortfall between supplier-claimed access speeds and those experienced by the consumer once signed-up to a contract is particularly bad at just those times when most consumers actually want to use the service.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to directing monitoring traffic, data monitoring switches {{are capable of}} filtering traffic by Layer 2 to Layer 4 protocol criteria such as VLAN or IP address, enabling only traffic of interest {{to be sent to}} specific tools. This capability can prevent tool <b>oversubscription</b> and facilitate drilling down on issues. As this is still a relatively new set of technologies, there are several different approaches to the hardware and software configurations. As such, each product sports benefits that none of the competitors includes. Some data monitoring switches offer different management interfaces (fully integrated GUI, automation, etc.), load balancing across multiple tool ports, filtering on patterns in packet payloads, and converting media and data rates so tools can be used to monitor traffic from dissimilar links.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{services}} - POTS, {{for example}} - require essentially constant upstream bandwidth, and the OLT {{may provide a}} fixed bandwidth allocation to each such service that has been provisioned. DS1 and some classes of data service may also require constant upstream bit rate. But much data traffic, such as browsing web sites, is bursty and highly variable. Through dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA), a PON can be oversubscribed for upstream traffic, according to the traffic engineering concepts of statistical multiplexing. (Downstream traffic can also be oversubscribed, {{in the same way}} that any LAN can be oversubscribed. The only special feature in the PON architecture for downstream <b>oversubscription</b> is the fact that the ONU must be able to accept completely arbitrary downstream time slots, both in time and in size.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Data {{monitoring}} switches facilitate centralizing {{network traffic}} monitoring in the NOC. By providing remote monitoring and control, they save {{the time and}} expense of traveling to remote locations to install monitoring tools. They {{make it easier to}} share tools among groups. With data rate conversion capabilities, they enable 1 Gigabit tools to support 10 Gigabit links, and 10 Gigabit tools to monitor traffic aggregated from multiple 1 Gigabit links. [...] They prevent tool <b>oversubscription</b> by pre-filtering traffic. They can Tap network links directly, instead of relying on switch SPAN ports for monitoring access. Because of their high port densities compared to discreet Taps, they save rack space and power, and can have a lower price per port. They are fully passive, unable to disrupt network traffic in the most commonly found circumstances. (Integrated Taps, if present have fail-to-wire on power failure.) This is compared to SPAN ports, where network traffic can be disrupted if the switch is not properly configured while setting up the SPAN port.|$|E
40|$|Part 2 : Economics and Technologies for Inter-Carrier ServicesInternational audienceNetwork <b>oversubscription</b> {{has long}} been used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

This paper investigates the impacts of <b>oversubscription,</b> both from a {{technical}} (OpEx, Energy footprint etc.) and from a value network point of view (Control and Value creation etc.). A multi-parameter sensitivity analysis of a power model is performed to establish that the choice of <b>oversubscription</b> ratio by an ISP can have a serious impact on their operational energy and capital expenditures. As a next step, a set of business model parameters are operationalized in order to evaluate and establish long-term and short-term impacts of network <b>oversubscription</b> on business stakeholders. Key findings include {{that there is a}} need to establish a fit between the technical and business gains of network <b>oversubscription,</b> and that is possible only when an ISP leverages its control and influence over its customer base to better understand and anticipate the network usage, thereby being able to promptly adapting the overall network <b>oversubscription</b> ratios...|$|E
