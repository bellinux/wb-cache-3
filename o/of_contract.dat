40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{different}} categories of building project procurement routes based on organisational, contractual, financial and technical issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on review of literature and conditions <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> The UK construction industry serves as a general frame of reference. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey <b>of</b> <b>Contracts</b> in Use from 1985 to 2004 is used to probe the share and value <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> along different procurement routes and across different conditions <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in the UK. The logic is that the value and the share <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> will indicate the behaviour of different procurement routes in the UK construction market while the in-depth analysis <b>of</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> will show the gaps and relationships between the general definition/categorisation and contractual context (conditions <b>of</b> <b>contracts)</b> <b>of</b> each of the procurement routes. Findings – The preliminary result of the analysis shows that traditional routes remain the main type of procurement route for the construction project industry sector, within which different management and incentivisation systems are applied for greater efficiency. The conditions <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in the UK support this assertion by aligning different procurement routes to different conditions <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> and additionally specifying different forms of agreements, special provisions and incentivisation in order to increase performance, reduce risks and improve compensation methods. Research limitations/implications – The study can serve as a learning opportunity for construction project stakeholders internationally, and clients in particular, to differentiate between procurement routes, management-oriented systems, relational contracting and incentivisation. Originality/value – The research provides an original assessment of construction procurement which can be used as intervening tool in different levels of private and public procurement strategies...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{construction}} procurement has {{been subject to}} considerable transformation from lowest cost to best value procurement and a revised agenda for delivering broader policy goals related to social and environmental sustainability.

Some research indicates that increased levels <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> lead to better prices for processors/users while other research is inconclusive.

Using experimental economics allowed the control <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> levels and other variables (e. g. supply levels) that are not possible using industry data. Pricing dynamics changed considerably with increased levels <b>of</b> <b>contracting,</b> but the mean price level was found to be not related to contracting levels. The response of price to a given supply was found to increase as contracting levels increase. In addition, price variability with high levels <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> showed long periods with relatively little adjustments followed by short periods of abrupt changes. Marketing,...|$|R
