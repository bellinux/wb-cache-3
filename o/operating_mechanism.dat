25|$|The Winchester Model 1907 is a blowback-operated, {{semi-automatic}} rifle {{produced by the}} Winchester Repeating Arms Company beginning in 1906 with production ending in 1958. It fired a cartridge of intermediate power (roughly equivalent in energy to the 7.62x39), cycled through a semi-automatic <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism,</b> fed by a detachable magazine. It was fed from a 5, 10, or 15 round detachable box magazine located immediately forward of the trigger guard. In size and handling, it is much like an M1 carbine, though the 1907 is heavier and fires a much harder hitting round.|$|E
25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the accident had been caused by the baggage door becoming lodged {{on the leading edge}} of the right tailplane after it had opened and detached. This changed the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics so that it became uncontrollable. This in turn resulted in overstressing of the wings and tailplane leading to inflight structural failure, with both wings and tailplane detaching from the fuselage. Contributory factors were the mis-rigged state of the door <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which allowed the top and bottom pairs of catches to lose synchronisation, and failure of the door warning indicators to give the crew enough time to respond to door safety alerts.|$|E

30|$|Following {{the idea}} of signal injection, this paper proposes an {{islanding}} detection strategy based on single-phase <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of CB. With the development of micro-processor based control technology and the increased requirement of customers on power supply reliability, it is feasible for medium-voltage CB to employ single-phase <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and to open three phase circuits asymmetrically [11, 16]. Following islanding formation induced by the asymmetric tripping of CB, specific signal is obtained at DG side to identify genuine islanding from system disturbances.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{existing}} {{information systems}} have static structures, similar functions, and certain <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> These features can’t provide attackers with the facilitation such as objective identification, defense behavior detection, attack techniques testing and refining, combat effectiveness evaluation and so on. Meanwhile, {{most of the}} information systems inherit the <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of single processing space and resources sharing, so that invaders can achieve the desired operation through the <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of resources sharing when they enter this space. This {{is also one of the}} important basic conditions in many network attack theories, including “the side channel attack” which is used to break through the “physical isolation network” nowadays. As a result, the largest black hole of cyber security consists of determinacy in the information system architecture and mechanism, fragility in passive defensive system, deficiency in active immune mechanisms and other key issues.|$|R
25|$|Alternatively, the {{gap fillers}} may be {{mounted on the}} train, and linked to the door <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism.</b> They may be found on modern trainsets, like various {{versions}} of the Stadler GTW. Train-mounted gap fillers {{eliminate the need for}} careful alignment and, as the driver only gets the signal that the doors have closed when the fillers have fully retracted, require no special synchronization on departure. Moving all active components of the system to the train instead of the platform allows maintenance to be performed in a shop, rather than in the field. The city of Singapore has committed to specifying its newer trains with gap fillers, to reduce the incidence of platform gap accidents in its crowded stations.|$|E
500|$|The {{cylindrical}} piers of {{the bridge}} were [...] in diameter and finished with an ashlar of cut granite. The completed bridge had its bascule leaves pivot on trunnions located [...] {{from the end of}} the girders. The bridge's reinforced-concrete counterweights, measuring [...] high by [...] wide, was supported by pivots at the ends of the girders. The trunnions were supported by box-girder posts on the sides of the bascule leaves and each set of inside trunnion posts were braced by a girder ran both between them and to the <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Earle Gear and Machine Company provided the <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the bridge. The bascule leaves were raised by a motor that used reduction gears and engaged a pinion to move the rack quadrant to raise the bridge. A manual-operation shaft was originally present so that it could be operated from the surface of the roadway, but it was later paved over. The operator's house was located on the south side of the western approach, it originally housed the operator's house and public bathrooms, but it was removed in 1936. The plans originally dictated for a second station on the opposite end, but 1930s photos shows it was apparently never constructed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{applications of}} disaster risk reduction (DRR) principles and <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to migration influenced by environmental change. It {{is well established}} that DRR addresses change in risk, well-being and security including through adaptation and resilience building. However, {{the manner in which}} this applies to migration influenced by environmental change has to date not been well analysed. This is a multi-sectoral and inter-disciplinary field for which interpretation and consequent reactions to environmental change and migration involves technology, civil societal engagement, and political commitment. The paper presents implications for reacting to migration influenced by environmental change apparent from DRR principles of prevention, mitigation and post event response. Four <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of DRR are also considered. They are early warning, risk management, improved communication and the use of appropriate response standards. The applicability and efficacy of these DRR principles and <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for reacting to migration influenced by environmental change are conditioned by hazard uncertainty and potential impact. Disaster prevention or mitigation for those who move, host or stay behind involves community based risk reduction, resilience building, rights approaches, and migration as adaptation. The application of DRR to migration influenced by environmental change therefore highlights the importance of engaging localised strategies and well-being aspirations, and of knowing the limitations of humanitarian response in upholding rights and sustainable development outcomes. Whilst the development of DRR principles may analytically frame potential environmental migration responses, there are ongoing theoretical and applied challenges in this relationship...|$|R
