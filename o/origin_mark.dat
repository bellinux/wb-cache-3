40|$|In the Stara planina region, around county Pirot, in {{the last}} 100 years the {{production}} of kachkaval cheese, known in the wide region as Pirotski kachkaval, has been developed. Stara Planina is well known by its pastures for sheep and cattle, high height above the sea level and specific climate. Pirotski kachkaval was produced on Stara planina {{in the period of}} sheep pasture, May - September. It was manufactured traditionally by soaking of mature cheese (baskija) and hand making a wheel of cheese. Ripening and salting of cheese in the climate conditions of Stara Planina, gave recognizable taste of Pirotski kachkaval. The necessity of protection of traditionally manufactured Pirotski kachkaval cheese, brought up the investigations which proved that all characteristics of cheese produced in traditional way, are kept, pointing out that this unique procedure satisfies demands for PDO (Protected Denomination of <b>Origin)</b> <b>mark...</b>|$|E

40|$|Teaching is {{a multidimensional}} process {{comprising}} {{a number of}} aspects, e. g., instructor attributes, which sometimes are difficult to evaluate. In particular teaching effectiveness, that is an aspect of teaching, is influenced {{by a combination of}} teacher characteristics (such as clarity, capacity to motivate the students and to help them in the study of his topic, ability to organize the lesson also with exercises and handouts, for example but also gender, age, previous experiences), physical aspects of the classroom or laboratory (too crowded or with an insufficient number of computers) and class characteristics (such as students ’ characteristics: gender, age, highschool of <b>origin,</b> <b>mark</b> obtained at the end of compulsory or high school, faculty attended by the student, or class size). As teaching effectiveness is becoming even more important in a system of school evaluation (in our case university system of evaluation), it is necessary to find how to measure it. This paper considers the problem of assessment of teaching effectiveness from students ’ point of view, analysing the questionnaires given to the students of the University of Udine {{at the end of their}} courses. The problem, in statistical terms is to relate an “outcome ” variable (the dependent one), in this case ratings given by the students or a particular linear combination of it, to a set of explanatory variables both to the student and teacher level. The data set used in the analysis consists of almost 9500 questionnaires regarding 416 courses of the University of Udine covering the academic year 1999 - 2000, its structure (questionnaires clustered in courses) suggest the use of a particular class of regression models, the multilevel models. ...|$|E
40|$|Com o presente artigo pretende-se mostrar a expressão da linha como elemento da linguagem do desenho e, simultaneamente, perceber a relação que a linha estabelece com o espaço. Toma-se como referência a obra do artista Lewitt enquanto marco de origem concetual do desenho na relação que ele estabelece com o espaço. Consideraremos as obras dos artistas Sandback, Gego, Derdyk e Grzymala, cujo trabalho usa o espaço como suporte do desenho e, a partir daí, procuraremos perceber que relações se estabelecem entre o espaço – que corporiza a obra - e o espectador. Com base neste pressuposto procuramos interpretar a obra como instalação ou site-specific, resultado da integração do desenho num determinado espaço. Para tal, abordaremos metodologicamente três momentos: 1. a contextualização, 2. a clarificação do conceito, 3. a experiência do artista e 4. o envolvimento e participação do espectador na obra. Procuraremos concluir acerca da presença instigadora do desenho quanto à participação do espectador na obra. The present article {{pretends to}} {{demonstrate}} the line’s expression as {{an element of the}} drawing’s language and understand, at the same time, the relation that the line establishes with the space.

The works of the artists Sandback, Gego, Derdyk and Grzymala shall be considered as the starting point, whose work refers to the spatiality as means of the drawing, and from there, we shall try to understand the relations established between the space – that embodies the work – and the spectator. On this basis we try to interpret the work as an installation or site-specific as result of the drawing’s integration in a certain space. In this way we shall methodologically approach three moments: 1. the contextualization, 2. the concept’s clarification, 3. the artist’s experience and 4. the involvement and participation of the spectator regarding the installation. We will reach the conclusion about the drawing’s instigating presence in relation to the spectator’s participation in the work...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{loading of}} {{oligomeric}} helicases onto replication <b>origins</b> <b>marks</b> an essential step in replisome assembly. In cells, dedicated AAA+ ATPases regulate loading, however, the {{mechanism by which}} these factors recruit and deposit helicases has remained unclear. To better understand this process, we determined {{the structure of the}} ATPase region of the bacterial helicase loader DnaC from Aquifex aeolicus to 2. 7 Å resolution. The structure shows that DnaC is a close paralog of the bacterial replication initiator, DnaA, and unexpectedly shares an ability to form a helical assembly similar to that of ATP-bound DnaA. Complementation and ssDNA-binding assays validate the importance of homomeric DnaC interactions, while pull-down experiments show that the DnaC and DnaA AAA+ domains interact in a nucleotide-dependent manner. These findings implicate DnaC as a molecular adaptor that uses ATP-activated DnaA as a docking site for regulating the recruitment and correct spatial deposition of the DnaB helicase onto origins...|$|R
