500|$|Prior to his death, Kaliokalani {{seemed to}} have been working as an {{interpreter}} in the Police Court with Charles Coffin Harris, a New England lawyer who later became a leading politician in the Kingdom. During his world tour in 1881 and upon learning of Harris's death, Kalākaua, who had also received his first instruction in law under Harris, wrote to their sister Liliʻuokalani reminiscing about their elder brother and his work as an interpreter: [...] "I feel it [...] the more when I recall the days of my childhood and that of <b>our</b> <b>brother</b> James Kaliokalani, who was our first instructor in Law and remained with him as assistant interpreter of the Police Court for two years".|$|E

500|$|Anne's {{stepmother}} {{gave birth}} to a son, James Francis Edward, on 10 June 1688, and a Catholic succession became more likely. Anne was still at Bath, so she did not witness the birth, which fed the belief that the child was spurious. Anne may have left the capital deliberately to avoid being present, or because she was genuinely ill, but {{it is also possible that}} James desired the exclusion of all Protestants, including his daughter, from affairs of state. [...] "I shall never now be satisfied", Anne wrote to her sister Mary, [...] "whether the child be true or false. It may be it is <b>our</b> <b>brother,</b> but God only knows... one cannot help having a thousand fears and melancholy thoughts, but whatever changes may happen you shall ever find me firm to my religion and faithfully yours." ...|$|E
500|$|Lafayette, in his dispatches {{and reports}} {{throughout}} the later {{stages of the}} Virginia campaign, painted Cornwallis's movements to Williamsburg and Portsmouth as a retreat. [...] These reports bolstered Lafayette's reputation, and the battle, although a tactical setback, did not harm that reputation. [...] General Wayne wrote of his decision to charge the full British force that it was [...] "one of those prudent, tho' daring manoeuvers which seldom fail of producing the desired effect; the result in this Instance fully Justified it." [...] Lafayette publicly lauded Wayne's performance, but recorded privately that Wayne made tactical mistakes and the battle read well [...] "in a gazette". [...] Militia general Peter Muhlenberg blamed the loss on [...] "the impetuosity of <b>our</b> <b>brother</b> Brigadier." [...] Wayne biographer Paul Nelson opines that Americans of the day could [...] "hardly decide after the battle whether to admire Wayne for his brave and impetuous character or to condemn him as a foolhardy adventurer." ...|$|E
500|$|When Babcock {{was called}} to New York City's Brick Presbyterian Church in 1900, many {{prominent}} Baltimoreans, including the faculty of Johns Hopkins University, unsuccessfully implored Babcock to remain at Brown instead of accepting the call to Brick Church. Babcock resigned on January 17, 1900, to pastor the Manhattan church but died suddenly the following year at age42. At his New York funeral, the presiding clergyman eulogized him, [...] "We do not need a candle to show a sunbeam...The work <b>our</b> <b>brother</b> has done– the life he lived speaks for him." [...] A memorial service for the esteemed former pastor was held at Brown Memorial on May 22, described as [...] "impressive" [...] by the New York Times. So inspired was former U.S. Postmaster General James Albert Gary, a member of Brown Memorial, that he chaired a committee to raise $50,000 (the equivalent of $1.4million in 2009) for {{construction of a new}} church in memory of the beloved former pastor. More than half of that amount was raised the first day from the wealthy congregation, the New York Times reported, and the new Babcock Memorial Presbyterian Church was soon constructed on Brown Memorial Church's North Avenue property.|$|E

500|$|... "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of four minutes and twenty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Musicnotes.com, [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a CCM and alternative CCM set in common time in the key of F major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Mark Hall's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The song has regarded as a re-invention of [...] "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee" [...] and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, the song alters {{the format of the}} former, rearranging the song's overall structure while adding a chorus. [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is led by a [...] "driving" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] string section that has been compared to Coldplay's [...] "Viva la Vida". Mark Hall felt that the band's arrangement brought out the message of one of the song's final verses ("God our Father/Christ our brother/all who live in love are thine/teach us how to love each other/and fill us to the joy divine"); Hall described the message by saying [...] "God's our father and Christ's <b>our</b> <b>brother,</b> we have this connection with God. But if we can't love each other, the joy isn't completed. Its not real joy yet until we know how to love the people that are around us".|$|E
500|$|Wheelwright's {{purpose in}} {{publishing}} {{this work was}} so that his innocence and the unfairness of his trial be recognized, and that [...] "his views on {{the process by which}} the saved acquired grace be accepted as correct, even orthodox". He chose to emphasize seven theological issues which he divided into three [...] "propositions," [...] and four [...] "theses". The three propositions consisted of the substance of Wheelwright's doctrine, which provided the basis for his fast-day sermon. Following the propositions, but before the theses, are nine pages of text recounting the events and personalities of the Antinomian Controversy. Here Wheelwright says that justice was not served, and that he was accused of the political crimes of sedition and contempt, when the real reason for his banishment was doctrinal differences with the other ministers. He goes on to accuse his prosecutors of engaging in [...] "underhanded dealings," [...] and working in secret. He had learned of these dealings through a magistrate friend (possibly William Coddington) who secretly transcribed some of these proceedings and gave them to him. In this section Cotton's defense of Wheelwright is included: [...] "I do conceive and profess that <b>our</b> <b>Brother</b> Wheelwright's Doctrine is according to God..." [...] (these words published by Cotton in his 1648 Way of Congregational Churches Cleared). Wheelwright then wraps up this middle section by [...] "vehemently accusing Weld of lying," [...] and deceiving his readers.|$|E

It is Judah who spots a caravan of Ishmaelites coming towards them, on its way to Egypt and suggests that Joseph be sold to the Ishmaelites rather than killed. (Gen. 37:26-28, [...] "What profit is it if we slay <b>our</b> <b>brother</b> and conceal his blood? ... Let not our hand be upon him, for he is <b>our</b> <b>brother,</b> our flesh.") ...|$|E
