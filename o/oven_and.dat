25|$|In a kugelrohr a {{short path}} {{distillation}} apparatus is typically used (generally {{in combination with}} a (high) vacuum) to distill high boiling (> 300°C) compounds. The apparatus consists of an oven in which the compound to be distilled is placed, a receiving portion which is outside of the <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> a means of rotating the sample. The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.|$|E
25|$|The <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> {{ancillary}} space (where {{was discovered}} full of pottery from the VSNP 2 era) constitutes a group {{associated with the}} industrial fabrication of ceramics, receiving water from the cistern for its operation.

25|$|A popcorn bag is a {{specially}} designed, microwaveable bag that contains popcorn, along with oil, spices and seasoning.

Empanadas are individual sized and closed savoury pastries which may be fried or baked in the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> are generally eaten with the hands.|$|E
25|$|The {{house was}} built in 1729 of native limestone. It was {{expanded}} several {{times over the years}} but it does include an original single room with fireplace and bake <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> a second room that Weiser added to his home in 1750. The home is decorated with many of the furnishings and household tools that were most common during the frontier era. A family cemetery behind the house is the final resting place of Weiser, his wife Anna and many friendly Indian Chiefs.|$|E
25|$|The {{camp was}} {{situated}} between a main road and a railway line. The site {{consisted of a}} large communal area, a visitors centre and several personal dwellings. All buildings were made from re-cycled materials. The communal area featured seating, heating and a bookcase. The buildings were heated by wood burning fires and run off donated wood. Water was collected on a daily basis. Food was cooked on a calor gas <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> there was a composting toilet. A wind generator provided some of the evening lighting.|$|E

25|$|The Persians {{introduced}} a clay oven called a tanur (similar to the Indian tandoor), which had an {{opening at the}} bottom for the fire, and through which the bread was placed to be baked on the inner wall of the upper chamber from {{the heat of the}} <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> ashes after the flames had died down. This continued to be the way in which Yemenite Jews baked bread until modern times. The remains of clay ovens, and fragments of bread trays have been found in several archaeological excavations.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the house {{remained}} {{much the same as}} the previous series, although the kitchen moved {{to the other side of}} the main living area. One big theme in the house was annoyance; the kitchen appliances were scattered around the house, with the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> heat proof surface in the bedroom and the fridge in the garden. As further annoyance, the bathtub was placed in an open space right next to the main living room. Where the oven was in the bedroom was approximately where the kitchen area was located in Big Brother 7.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|E
