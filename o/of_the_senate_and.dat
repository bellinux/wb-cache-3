5|$|On 9 June 68, amid growing {{opposition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the army, Nero {{committed suicide}} {{and with him}} the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors, during which the four most influential generals in the Roman Empire—Galba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasian—successively vied for imperial power.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{was then}} {{elected to the}} state Senate and served from 1832 to 1835. He {{was a member of}} the Committee for Internal Improvements.

5|$|He {{returned}} to South Australia to assist Charles Kingston in his government, but ultimately crossed {{the floor to}} bring down Kingston over his plans to lessen {{the power of the}} Legislative Council. With the advent of Australian Federation, Playford became a Senator for South Australia. He was leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the 7th Minister for Defence. After one term as a Senator, Playford was defeated. He ran again in 1910, was unsuccessful, and retired to Kent Town, where he died in 1915 at the age of 78.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the formal}} {{ceremony}} of granting assent in parliament {{has not been}} regularly used since the early 20th century. Now, the bill {{is sent to the}} governor-general's residence by the house in which it originated. The governor-general then signs the bill, sending messages to the president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the speaker of the House of Representatives, who notify their respective houses of the governor-general's action. A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.|$|E
5|$|Professional {{services}} for members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the House of Delegates {{are provided by}} the Department of Legislative Services, which is non-partisan. Individual members are also assisted by partisan staff members, and those in leadership positions have additional partisan staff. These staff members help to manage {{the offices of the}} Senators in the Miller Senate Office Building. Each Senator has one year-round administrative assistant, as well as a secretary who assists them during the legislative session. There is also an allowance given to help pay for district offices.|$|E

5|$|Sections 301 to 303 {{establish}} a Joint Commission on the Coinage in the Executive Branch, chaired by the Treasury Secretary.

If {{a member of the}} commission left the position that qualified him for membership, he would leave the commission as well. The members of the public were not to have any financial conflicts of interest.|$|E
5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on its knees. Although all three have been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their background as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate,</b> <b>and</b> a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor.|$|E

5|$|The Legislature of Oklahoma {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the House of Representatives. As the lawmaking {{branch of}} the state government, it is responsible for raising and distributing the money necessary to run the government. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two-year terms. The state has a term limit for its legislature that restricts any one person to twelve cumulative years service between both legislative branches.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of parliamentary committees is mentioned in section 49 of the Constitution of Australia, which makes reference to 'The powers, privileges, and immunities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> of the House of Representatives, {{and of the}} members and the committees of each House...' However, the Senate had few committees, engaged in limited activities, until 1970. A number of domestic committees had operated since {{the establishment of the}} parliament, but prior to 1970 the only significant committee to be established was the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in 1932, one of the legislative scrutiny committees (see below).|$|E
5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of this period is handed down to us by Tacitus, whose Annals dedicate the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born {{during the reign of}} Nero in 56 AD, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the Acta Senatus (the minutes of the session <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate)</b> <b>and</b> the Acta Diurna (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Pliny the Elder (all of which are lost).|$|E

5|$|After {{following}} his father {{into the local}} politics of his home county, Clements agreed to chair the gubernatorial campaign of Thomas Rhea in 1935. Already committed to Rhea, he turned down an offer from Happy Chandler to chair his campaign, beginning the rift between the two men. Clements {{went on to the}} Kentucky Senate in 1941. In 1944, he was selected as Democratic floor leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>and</b> successfully campaigned for a larger budget than that proposed by Republican governor Simeon Willis. His stand against Willis made him popular in the Democratic Party, and he went on to serve two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1944 to 1948.|$|E
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Around 66 BC, a {{movement}} to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began. After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named Lucius Sergius Catilina. The movement was based {{in the town of}} Faesulae, which was not a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation. The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome, and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63 BC. The consul for the year, Marcus Tullius Cicero, intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate,</b> <b>and</b> the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.|$|E
