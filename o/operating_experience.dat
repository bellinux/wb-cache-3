5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, <b>operating</b> <b>experience</b> over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{building}} reactors in 1943. A group was created in Bacher's P Division, the P-7 (Water Boiler) Group, {{under the leadership of}} Donald Kerst, that included Charles P. Baker, Gerhart Friedlander, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway and Raemer Schreiber. Robert F. Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the critical mass. He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form a critical mass in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the Water Boiler at 10kW, but Fermi and Samuel K. Allison visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created {{that would have to be}} chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the Water Boiler would only run at 1kW until more <b>operating</b> <b>experience</b> had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.|$|E

40|$|The Mobile Post Distribution system MOPS {{has been}} {{developed}} at the ETH Zurich {{during the last few}} years. Numerous technical problems had to be solved during this period. Currently, we are operating and testing it in our office building. A service robot like MOPS is a highly complex system, as it includes, in addition to the robot itself, the task, the operator, and the environment. <b>Operating</b> <b>experiences</b> with such service robots are not easily available yet.

25|$|The MSRE was a {{core region}} only {{prototype}} reactor. The MSRE provided valuable long-term <b>operating</b> <b>experience.</b> According to estimates of Japanese scientists, a single fluid LFTR program {{could be achieved}} through a relatively modest investment of roughly 300-400 million dollars over 5–10 years to fund research to fill minor technical gaps and build a small reactor prototype comparable to the MSRE.|$|E
25|$|The more noble metals (Pd, Ru, Ag, Mo, Nb, Sb, Tc) do {{not form}} {{fluorides}} {{in the normal}} salt, but form fine metallic particles in the salt. They can plate out at metal surfaces like the heat exchanger or some kinds of high surface area filters that are easier to remove. Still there is some uncertainty where these noble elements end up, as the MSRE only provided a relatively short <b>operating</b> <b>experience</b> and independent laboratory experiments are difficult.|$|E
25|$|Molten salts can {{be highly}} {{corrosive}} and corrosivity increases with temperature. For the primary cooling loop, a material is needed that can withstand corrosion at high temperatures and intense radiation. Experiments show that Hastelloy-N and similar alloys are suited to these tasks at operating temperatures up to about 700°C. However, <b>operating</b> <b>experience</b> is limited. Still higher operating temperatures are desirable – at 850°C thermochemical production of hydrogen becomes possible. Materials for this temperature range have not been validated, though carbon composites, molybdenum alloys (e.g. TZM), carbides, and refractory metal based or ODS alloys might be feasible.|$|E

25|$|In January 2006 Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso and the City Council delayed a {{raise in}} water tariffs due to protests by city councillors. In {{the same year}} Suez Environnement reduced its share in the {{concession}} to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), {{which is part of}} the Indonesian conglomerate Astra International, and Citigroup of the US (19 percent). Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia’s ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. While both mother companies of Acuatico had no <b>operating</b> <b>experience</b> in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before.

25|$|Soon {{after the}} Union cavalrymen had {{captured}} the trains, Confederate artillery began to {{fire at the}} station. Colonel Randol reported that the regiment suffered little damage from the artillery fire because the artillery had to fire through dense woods between the artillery park and the station. When Colonel Randol called for troopers with train <b>operating</b> <b>experience</b> to move the trains, enough men came forward to move the cars along the track to a position out of danger a few {{miles to the east}} toward Farmville within the Union lines. At least two of the volunteers were from the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry Regiment of Colonel Henry Capehart's brigade. The Confederate battery that had targeted the train and station later was captured when the Union cavalry assaulted the nearby Confederate wagon and artillery park. When Gary's cavalry detachment arrived at the railroad soon after the Union cavalry had taken control of the station, they were driven back toward Walker's position.|$|E
