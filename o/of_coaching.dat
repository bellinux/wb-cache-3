5|$|Overall, the Dartmouth {{football}} program went 23–23–2 in Wurtenburg's five years <b>of</b> <b>coaching.</b> The 1898 season {{was the final}} Triangular Football League championship the school would win; the conference would become defunct in 1901, two years later. Following Wurtenburg's departure, Frederick E. Jennings, a player under Wurtenburg, would take over the program, leading it to a 2–4–2 record in one year <b>of</b> <b>coaching.</b> Another former player, Walter McCornack would coach the program starting in 1901, and led the team to a 15-win record in two years. Wurtenburg's tenure as coach has occasionally been remarked {{as the beginning of}} Dartmouth's acceptance as a major team.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{principle}} of oxygen consumption, relationship between heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire and ventilation factor is studied. The peak heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire is estimated under four typical ventilation conditions: one window, two windows, four windows and all windows <b>of</b> the fire <b>coach</b> are opened, respectively. Results were compared with the predictions by traditional empirical formulas for flashover in confined space. A suitable calculation method for forecasting the heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire is presented. CFD means were also applied to simulate and analyze the impact of the ventilation factor on the burning characteristics <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire. The results indicate that the calculation method can predict the heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire well. The peak heat release rate <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire is proportional to the ventilation factor. The calculation results are 6. 3 MW, 8. 4 MW, 12. 6 MW and 39. 7 MW and simulation results are 6. 5 MW, 9. 9 MW, 14. 8 MW and 39 MW respectively under different ventilation conditions in this study. The results also show that the heat release rate and <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> fire increases with the increase of ventilation factor...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: {{to justify}} {{theoretically}} {{the need for}} musical training <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> in aesthetic-oriented sports. Material & Methods: theoretical analysis and generalization of scientific and methodological literature, pedagogical supervision.
