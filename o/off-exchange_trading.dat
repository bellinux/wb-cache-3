50|$|Over-the-counter (OTC) or <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading</b> is done {{directly}} {{between two}} parties, without {{the supervision of}} an exchange. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via exchanges. A stock exchange has the benefit of facilitating liquidity, mitigates all credit risk concerning the default of one party in the transaction, provides transparency, and maintains the current market price. In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily published for the public.|$|E
50|$|Over-the-counter (OTC) or <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading</b> is {{to trade}} {{financial}} instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities or derivatives directly between two parties. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via facilities constructed {{for the purpose}} of trading (i.e., exchanges), such as futures exchanges or stock exchanges.In the U.S., over-the-counter trading in stock is carried out by market makers that make markets in OTCBB and Pink Sheets securities using inter-dealer quotation services such as Pink Quote (operated by Pink OTC Markets) and the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB). OTC stocks are not usually listed nor traded on any stock exchanges, though exchange listed stocks can be traded OTC on the third market. Although stocks quoted on the OTCBB must comply with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements, other OTC stocks, such as those stocks categorized as Pink Sheets securities, have no reporting requirements, while those stocks categorized as OTCQX have met alternative disclosure guidelines through Pink OTC Markets. An over-the-counter contract is a bilateral contract in which two parties agree on how a particular trade or agreement is to be settled in the future. It is usually from an investment bank to its clients directly. Forwards and swaps are prime examples of such contracts. It is mostly done via the computer or the telephone. For derivatives, these agreements are usually governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement.|$|E
40|$|This paper applies an {{econometric model}} of {{imperfect}} competition to equity trading with competing exchanges. Stock {{of the same}} company is traded on multiple venues today. This development was driven by regulations, aimed at benefiting investors by fostering competition among exchanges. However, the welfare consequences of increased exchange competition are theoretically ambiguous. While competition does place down- ward pressure on the bid-ask spread, this force may be outweighed by increased adverse selection that stems from additional arbitrage opportunities. We investigate this ambi- guity empirically by estimating key parameters of the model using detailed trading data from Australia. The benefits of increased competition are outweighed by the costs of multi-venue arbitrage. Compared to the prevailing duopoly, we predict that the coun- terfactual spread under a monopoly would be 23 percent lower. Further, market design variations on the continuous limit order book would eliminate profits from cross-venue ar- bitrage strategies and reduce the spread by 51 percent. Finally, eliminating <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trades,</b> so-called dark trading, would reduce the spread by 11 percent...|$|R

50|$|Binary {{trading in}} the US is legal, {{but only if}} done through {{properly}} registered and regulated exchanges such as NADEX. Both the CFTC and SEC working in conjunction with one another filed civil suits against the company, seeking disgorgement, financial penalties and other preliminary and permanent injunctions against the company. In civil suits filed in Nevada, the SEC and CFTC allege {{that the company was}} offering <b>off-exchange</b> <b>traded</b> options to US customers and unlawfully solicited US customers to buy and sell options. The CFTC and SEC's suit also alleges that it did not limit its offerings to eligible contract participants, contrary to US regulations; a fully regulated broker would complete credit checks on customers to ensure that those with low finances did not trade with them. Among the allegations made by the SEC was that Banc De Binary induced people with limited funds, including one unemployed person with less than $1000, to open accounts. In response to the US charges the company put out a statement that made no mention of its legal problems, but instead incorrectly implied that they were in negotiations and that they had voluntarily left the US market, when in fact the SEC had taken an injunction out to stop them.|$|R

40|$|The {{last several}} decades have seen the stock market {{transform}} from an exchange-dominated marketplace to a fragmented arena where trading is dispersed among various locales. Gone are the days where exchanges served as the primary marketplaces for order execution. Today, many orders execute at off-exchange venues. Namely, investors can choose from thirteen exchanges, several electronic communication networks, and more than forty dark pools. This Note analyzes the impact of <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading</b> and {{the implementation of a}} trade-at rule as a remedy for the consequences associated with <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading...</b>|$|E
40|$|Electronic markets use {{information}} technology to disseminate information on prices, quantities, and buyer and supplier identities. In {{spite of the}} recognized benefits of electronic markets, increased visibility and transparency may introduce imperfections, and create profitable opportunities to bypass markets that generates the information. In the U. S. securities markets, dissemination of market data has equipped several firms to develop competing, <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading</b> mechanisms that rely on market price data, but whose transactions bypass the established market. Concern is rising that the growing volume of trading occumng away from the main market may reduce liquidity, and increase transactions costs. A simulation model of securities trading in a continuous auction market (similar to the market structure of the New York Stock Exchange) is {{used to examine the}} market quality effects of increasing levels of trading activity through an off-exchange dealer. Market characteristics, such as transactions costs, are measured as <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading</b> increases from zero percent to 20 percent of the total trading volume. The results indicate that competition from an alternative trading venue reduces some trading costs borne by investors. Contrary to regulatory goals, however, off-market trading expands the role of profit-seeking dealers, and lowers the probability that some investors ' orders will execute. I...|$|E

Our theoretical setting analyzes {{the interaction between}} heterogeneous investors and trading services providers in presence of market externalities. We compare different forms of organization of the market, each in presence of an off-exchange and an incumbent facing a two-sided activity (issuers and investors) : a consolidated exchange with the incum- bent only, and fragmented exchanges with several platforms, including lit and dark pools, in competition for order ows. By capturing investors from <b>off-exchange,</b> dark <b>trading</b> may enhance market externalities and market stakeholders' welfare...|$|R

The companies were also banned permanently from operating in the US or selling to US residents.|$|R
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that, in the futures markets, <b>off-exchange</b> customers' <b>trades</b> with locals {{have a larger}} impact on prices than other types of trades. Furthermore, it appears that locals' trades {{are at least as}} strongly related to volatility as customers' trades. This evidence is derived from a detailed examination of generally proprietary CFTC data that can be partitioned more finely(by trader type and trade direction) than other, publicly available, data sets. We directly estimate depth (price impact per unit net customer order flow), document its intraday properties, and refine previous volume/volatility studies. Although we find that intraday depth is relatively stable, we find that the depth of a market is generally related to its underlying economic fundamentals. 1 I...|$|R
40|$|The London Stock Exchange (LSE) faces rising {{pressure}} {{in its efforts}} to maintain its position as a favored market of institutional fund managers and professional investors. Customers are satisfied with {{the current state of the}} LSE market, but member firms are pricing institutional brokerage and market making services below economic cost. The LSE's position will be significantly damaged when the effective subsidy ends, and commissions and dealing spreads reflect the costs incurred by members firms. Competition in the supply of trading services has increased, and a range of alternative, <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading</b> systems could draw order flow away from the Exchange market. These trading mechanisms provide order matching, crossing of basket and portfolio trades, and reduce investors' commissions and trading spread costs. Fund managers in the U. S. are using the systems more actively, and the result has been an erosion of the position of the New York Stock Exchange. The LSE's customers are also using an expanding range of portfolio management techniques, many of which require low-cost trading, and do not demand immediate order execution, as traditionally provided by London's market makers. The Exchange needs to respond to the changes in fund managers' demand for trading services, and to the growing competition in the supply of <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading</b> services. Enhancements to the existing LSE market structure are the best response to these threats. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of an order-driven {{exchange}} competing for order flow with <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading</b> mechanisms. Liquidity suppliers face a trade-off between benefits and costs of order exposure. If they display trading intentions, they attract additional trade demand. We show, in equilibrium, hiding trade intentions can induce mis-coordination between liquidity supply and demand, generate excess price fluctuations and harm price efficiency. Econometric high-frequency analysis based on unique data on hidden orders from NASDAQ reveals strong empirical support for these predictions: We find abnormal reactions in prices and order flow after periods of high excess-supply of hidden liquidity...|$|E

40|$|The NYSE {{has opened}} the limit-order book to <b>off-exchange</b> traders during <b>trading</b> hours. In this paper, we address the welfare {{implications}} of the recent change in market structure. We model a market similar to the single-price auction that the exchange uses to open the trading day. We consider two different environments. In the first, only the specialist can see the limit order book, while in the second {{the information in the}} book is available to all traders. We then compare equilibria. We find that traders who demand liquidity are better off when the book is open, while traders who supply liquidity (limit-order traders and the specialist) are better off when the book is closed. We also find that, on average, the opening price is more informative in the open book environment. The empirical implications with an open limit-order book are: 1) Opening prices are more informative; 2) Price impacts of market orders are smaller; and 3) The adverse-selection component of price impacts of market orders are larger...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{the main}} direct {{contribution}} of exchanges to corporate governance has been listing and disclosure standards and monitoring compliance. Stock exchanges have established themselves as promoters of corporate governance recommendations for listed companies. Demutualisation {{and the subsequent}} self-listing of exchanges have spurred debate {{on the role of}} exchanges. Regulators have been concerned about conflicts of interest between exchanges' for-profit activities and their regulatory responsabilities. The conversion of exchanges to listed companies is thought to have intensified competition. And, the sharper competition has forced the question of whether there is a risk of a regulatory 'race to the bottom'. Recently, the rise of alternative trading systems (ATS), first in the United States and then in Europe have had a profound impact. Their existence has induced exchanges to cut fees and in some cases launch their own <b>off-exchange</b> <b>trading</b> platforms. The effect of ATSs on corporate governance is not clear. Two practical concerns voiced so far are, first, that trading fragmentation may reduce the transparency of the markets for corporate control and adverse consequences for price discovery. Secondly, exchanges are uneasy about the prospect of having to continue performing their traditional regulatory and other corporate-governance enhancing functions amid a shrinking revenue base. ...|$|E
