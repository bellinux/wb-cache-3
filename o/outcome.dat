5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term <b>outcome</b> occurs in 42%, an intermediate <b>outcome</b> in 35% and a poor <b>outcome</b> in 27%.

30|$|This {{study is}} the first to use a {{definition}} of patient-important <b>outcomes</b> for critically ill patients. This definition is open to criticism on two points.

40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT:This {{research}} {{assignment is}} an exploratory qualitative study into mapping unplanned <b>outcomes</b> of executive coaching. The research purpose was twofold: {{to address the}} lack of a common and comprehensive framework for the mapping of <b>outcomes</b> of executive coaching, and to add to the body of knowledge regarding unplanned <b>outcomes</b> of executive coaching. In developing the mapping framework, the available literature was reviewed and, through an inductive process, a framework, model, taxonomy and mapping tool were developed. Based on core concepts attributable to Kirkpatrick, Wilber and Jaques, the mapping tool developed was then tested, using data obtained from a purposive sample of seven semi-structured interviews with Gauteng based coachees. The sample excluded any individuals who had been coached by the researcher. During the data analysis, the planned <b>outcomes</b> were mapped using the mapping tool and related processes. Thereafter the actual <b>outcomes</b> were mapped, identifying those <b>outcomes</b> that matched planned <b>outcomes</b> and those that supported the planned <b>outcomes.</b> A technique named ‘outcome chains’ was developed and used for this process. The unplanned <b>outcomes</b> were identified by a process of elimination, being those that remained unallocated in the planned chain process. It was found that <b>outcomes</b> of executive coaching can be mapped using a framework based on the principles of Kirkpatrick, Wilber and Jaques, with all identified <b>outcomes</b> being mapped successfully. Four categories of unplanned <b>outcomes</b> were identified, namely those that hinder the attainment of planned <b>outcomes,</b> insufficient evidence of achieving planned <b>outcomes,</b> actual <b>outcomes</b> related to planned <b>outcomes</b> but with scope different to planned and, fourthly, actual <b>outcomes</b> unrelated to planned <b>outcomes.</b> Additionally, three themes of unplanned <b>outcomes,</b> each with two sub-themes, were identified, namely personal (sub-themes: physical and spiritual), family (sub-themes: immediate and extended) and work (sub-themes: positive and negative). The most surprising finding was that all seven coachees experienced unplanned <b>outcomes,</b> which is markedly different to previous research findings and {{may be due to the}} inclusion of non-work related <b>outcomes.</b> The key recommendations arising from this research assignment embrace the research into, and practice of, executive coaching. Regarding the research elements, it is recommended that the mapping framework developed in this research be further refined and tested as a holistic standard for evaluating the <b>outcomes</b> of executive coaching, including those <b>outcomes</b> that impact the coachee as an individual. For the executive coaching fraternity, it is recommended that coaches challenge themselves and their practices regarding the probability, categories and impact of unplanned <b>outcomes,</b> and introduce measures to maximise the upside and minimise the risks of unplanned <b>outcomes.</b> Finally, the regular testing and recording of the coachee’s reaction to executive coaching is recommended as a predictor of coaching efficacy...|$|R
