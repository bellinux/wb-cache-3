40|$|This paper {{explains}} that the interest rate on long-term Japanese government bonds is low in comparison with other industrialised countries for four main reasons: lower inflation, net savings surplus, institutional restrictions and home bias. Monetary policy and institutionalised purchases of government bonds by semi-government agencies keep the market demand for bonds high. We find that since the 1970 s Japanese interest rate movements are better explained by the current account balance than in other industrialised countries. This is caused by sizeable net <b>oversavings</b> and institutional reasons increased the impact of <b>oversavings</b> as such on the long-term interest rate for Japan. Hence, the institutional reasons increase the coefficient value of the savings-investment balance. A reason {{for the existence of}} the high national net savings surplus could be that unsustainable budgetary deficits in Japan called for a Ricardian response. We doubt whether Ricardian equivalence is here the driving factor: household savings have actually fallen over the nineties. Corporate savings, in response to overcapacity and poor investment outlook, have risen more strongly. This has kept the private and national savings balance positive. There is also some indication that ageing has contributed to the structural current account surplus for Japan.

In particular, it is shown that the bequest motive is always too weak, and public debt therefore non-neutral, when non-physical assets have a well-defined function (reducing <b>oversavings)</b> in the corresponding economy without bequest motive, i. e., when the non-altruistic economy is dynamically inefficient...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{attribute}} of OLG type models {{is that it}} is possible that 'over saving' can occur when capital accumulation is added to the model—a situation which could be improved upon by a social planner by forcing households to draw down their capital stocks. [...] However, certain restrictions on the underlying technology of production and consumer tastes can ensure that the steady state level of saving corresponds to the Golden Rule savings rate of the Solow growth model and thus guarantee intertemporal efficiency. Along the same lines, most empirical research on the subject has noted that <b>oversaving</b> {{does not seem to be}} a major problem in the real world.|$|E

According to numerous studies on subjective survival beliefs, young people also " whereas old people " their objective survival chances on average. We take a structural behavioral economics approach to jointly address both empirical phenomena by embedding subjective survival beliefs that are consistent with these biases into a rank-dependent utility (RDU) model over life-cycle consumption. The resulting consumption behavior is dynamically inconsistent. Considering both naive and sophisticated RDU agents we show that within this framework underestimation of young age and overestimation of old age survival probabilities may (but need not) give rise to the joint occurrence of undersaving and <b>oversaving.</b> In contrast to this RDU model, the familiar quasi-hyperbolic discounting (QHD), which is nested as a special case, cannot generate <b>oversaving...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} integrates {{literature on}} optimization in sequencebased search and literature on affective forecasting and investigates {{one reason why}} consumers may be mistakenly <b>oversaving</b> things they own for the “right” moment. An initial survey of realworld consumer behavior documents {{the importance of the}} right moment in consumers’ choices of when to use what they own. A complementary analysis of historical behavior then identifies systematic delays of everyday item use beyond opportunities that would have been highly beneficial, a signal that consumers may commonly be waiting for but failing to find the right moment for item use in everyday scenarios. A theory is then proposed to explain those and other initial findings as the consequences of a systematic bias, affecting optimization: namely, ease of retrieval. A pair of controlled experiments test the theorized mechanism as an explanation for mistaken <b>oversaving</b> on the parts of item owners. Cumulative results indicate that the right moment’s relative ease of retrieval may be one direct cause of mistaken decisions to save rather than consume...|$|E

40|$|An {{integral}} part of global current account imbalances is the large and persistent current account surplus developing Asia has run since the 1997 – 1998 Asian crisis. A country’s current account surplus is, by definition, equal to its net saving. The central objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the extent to which the saving and investment rate of Asian countries can be explained by the underlying fundamental determinants of saving and investment such as gross domestic product growth and demographic factors. Our empirical analysis yields two key findings. First, we find stronger evidence of <b>oversaving</b> than underinvestment in the region. Second, we find stronger evidence of overinvestment prior to the Asian crisis than underinvestment after the Asian crisis. This suggests that the key to rebalancing Asian growth toward domestic sources lies in promoting consumption rather than investment.

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} about a home-court advantage in international portfolio" investment. One {{explanation for the}} bias is an information asymmetry between domestic and" foreign investors about the economic performance of domestic firms. This asymmetry causes" two types of distortions: an aggregate production inefficiency and a production-consumption" inefficiency, leading to foreign underinvestment and domestic <b>oversaving</b> respectively. Such" market failures {{are found to be}} quite severe, slightly more so with equity flows than with debt" flows. These inefficiencies can nonetheless be corrected by a mix of tax-subsidy instruments consisting of taxes on corporate income and on the capital incomes of both residents and" nonresidents. When only a partial set of instruments is available, however each tax instrument can change radically and may even be reversed although the welfare gains" can be fairly substantial and sometimes close to the first best optimum. This partial set of" instruments appears to be more effective in handling the market failure in the case of equity" flows than in the case of debt flows. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{debates on}} a {{sustainable}} {{recovery of the}} global economy have tended to overemphasise the "savings glut" hypothesis and the unavoidable imperative of higher consumption in China and other emerging Asian countries. That <b>oversaving</b> and not underinvestment is coming {{in the way of a}} quicker and more durable recovery is not just simplistic but misleading from a medium- term growth perspective for emerging Asian countries and other developing countries in this region. Drawing upon country panel data for developing countries and a sub-sample of Asian countries during the period 1991 to 2007, the present study makes a case for a bold and coordinated fiscal stimulus, directed to stimulating agricultural and overall growth, and mitigation of poverty and hunger. Our simulations further suggest that poverty reduction is likely to be larger if the fiscal stimulus is directed to social spending in health and education sectors. Indeed, if our simulations of fiscal impacts have any validity, the dire predictions of millions getting trapped in poverty and hunger may turn out to be exaggerated. The prospects of a strong recovery led by fiscal stimulus are thus real and achievable. Government Expenditure, Fiscal Policy, Economic Growth, Agricultural Growth, Poverty, Asia...|$|E
30|$|Nowhere in {{this paper}} do we demonstrate—nor argue—that {{either of the two}} pension systems {{themselves}} are welfare enhancing. It is possible that {{in the absence of a}} universal pension system as well as retirement age, agents would alternatively choose consumption, labor, and savings, working possibly less over possibly a longer share of their lifetime. In fact, there should be no gains from increasing the retirement age, as there should be no gains from a pension system at all, as long as agents are unconstrained in consumption/savings choices and can work as long as they like. Thus, rather than actual gains from retirement age increase, the results demonstrate reduction in welfare distortions introduced in baseline specification. However, such property of the model is only preserved if there is no age-dependent morbidity 20 or if there is no aggregate <b>oversaving</b> in the economy. These assumptions are violated in our cases—there is age-dependent non-zero probability of death at any given age j. Moreover, the baseline DC economy oversaves. In Appendix Appendix 5. Oversaving: Fig. 16 a–d, we show graphically that in the final steady state the baseline allocation under the DC system could be improved with labor adjustment at extensive margin and/or reduced saving.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study of the life cycle model in which subjects were asked to make preferred consumption choices under hypothetical life cycle economic conditions. The questions in the experiment are designed to test the model's assumption of rational choice and to elicit information about preferences. The subjects' responses suggest a widespread inability to make coherent and consistent consumption decisions. Errors in consumption decision-making appear to be very substantial and, in many cases, systematic. In addition, the experiment's data strongly reject the standard homothetic, time-separable life cycle model. The principal specific findings of the laboratory experiment are: (1) Subjects displayed significant inconsistencies in their consumption decisions; each of the subjects, in at least two pairs of economically identical situations, chose consumption values that differed by 20 percent or more. From the perspective of the standard life cycle model, error in decision-making accounts, on average, for roughly half of the variation in consumption. (2) A sizeable fraction of subjects undervalued future earnings relative to present assets; i. e., they systematically overdiscounted future earnings. (3) Almost all subjects exhibited <b>oversaving</b> behavior, apparently because they underestimated the power of compound interest. (4) The hypothesis that intertemporal consumption preferences are uniform across individuals is strongly rejected. Indeed, the demographic characteristics of subjects are significant determinants of consumption choice in the experiment. ...|$|E
