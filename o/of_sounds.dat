5|$|Like other Hawaiian honeycreepers, the hookbill {{possessed a}} {{distinctive}} musty odor.

5|$|The most usual call is a loud, short, {{and rapid}} caaw-caaw-caaw. Usually, the birds thrust their heads {{up and down}} as they utter this call.

5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>Sounds</b> {{players have}} {{led the league in}} {{multiple}} statistical categories during a single season. Balboni led the 1980 season in five categories: runs (101), runs batted in (122), total bases (288), home runs (30), and fielding percentage among first basemen (.990). In 1990, Hammond led the league in wins (15), winning percentage (.938 (15–1)), earned run average (2.17), and strikeouts (149). Durham, Ruffcorn, and Wever have also led a single season in three areas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003, running {{independently}} {{from the}} pioneering FWD night, an event called Filthy Dub, co promoted by Plastician, and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly. It was there that Skream, Benga, NType, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, dub values, and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.|$|E

5|$|By the Early Dynastic Period in {{the late}} 4th {{millennium}} BC, Egyptian hieroglyphs and their cursive form hieratic were well-established written scripts. Egyptian hieroglyphs are small artistic pictures of natural objects. For example, the hieroglyph for door-bolt, pronounced se, produced the s sound; when this hieroglyph was combined with another or multiple hieroglyphs, it produced a combination <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> that could represent abstract concepts like sorrow, happiness, beauty, and evil. The Narmer Palette, dated c. 3100 BC during the last phase of Predynastic Egypt, combines the hieroglyphs for catfish and chisel to produce the name of King Narmer.|$|E
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|Ilaiyaraaja {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string arrangements in Indian film music. This allowed him to craft a rich tapestry <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences. The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja's methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of ideas from a diversity of musical styles.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{analyses of}} the name must account for {{the origins of the}} different forms found in early sources Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from British Celtic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as * or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into West Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, already before English had become widely spoken in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting in a great variety <b>of</b> <b>sounds.</b> A combination action {{can be used to}} switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called pistons that can be pressed by the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) or above the pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be divisional (affecting only a single division) or general (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder or can be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations <b>of</b> <b>sounds,</b> syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

25|$|Aerodynamic {{problems}} {{can also be}} classified according to whether the flow speed is below, near or above the speed <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> transonic if speeds both below and above the speed <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed <b>of</b> <b>sound),</b> supersonic when the characteristic flow speed {{is greater than the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> and hypersonic when the flow speed is much greater than the speed <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with Mach numbers above 5 to be hypersonic.|$|R
5|$|The Hammond organ is an {{electric}} organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various {{models have been}} produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety <b>of</b> <b>sounds.</b> Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating {{an electric}} current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so it can drive a speaker cabinet. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.|$|E
5|$|The first Sounds mascot was {{introduced}} during the team's inaugural 1978 season.

5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed <b>of</b> <b>sounds,</b> gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E
