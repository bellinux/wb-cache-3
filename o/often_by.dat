5|$|Documentary {{evidence}} of cannon in Russia {{does not appear}} until 1382 and they were used only in sieges, <b>often</b> <b>by</b> the defenders. It was not until 1475 when Ivan III established the first Russian cannon foundry in Moscow that they began to produce cannon natively.|$|E
5|$|Humans employ {{nature for}} both leisure and {{economic}} activities. The acquisition {{of natural resources}} for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, <b>often</b> <b>by</b> different people. Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.|$|E

5|$|When tufted males clap, females look {{towards them}} and display {{a greater number}} of tap {{displays}} to them than to the gray morph. Females also respond to tufted morphs' clapping more <b>often</b> <b>by</b> settling than for gray males. However, after the females look towards the males, gray males approach the female more often than the tufted male. Females often tip their abdomens from side to side.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, chelicerates' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, <b>often</b> <b>by</b> means of setae.|$|E

In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, <b>often</b> <b>by</b> means of setae. Pedipalps carry {{a large number of}} such setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air-borne smells, such as female pheromones. Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as these keeps were being built by the {{extremely}} wealthy, much smaller, keep-like structures called tower houses or peel towers were built across Ireland, Scotland, and northern England, <b>often</b> <b>by</b> relatively poorer local lords and landowners. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall. Most academics have concluded that tower houses should not be classified as keeps but rather as a form of fortified house.|$|E

According to Jitendra Shah, the Director of L D Institute of Indology in Ahmedabad, {{an average of}} about 240 Jains practice Sallekhana each year in India. Most of them are not recorded or noticed. Statistically, Sallekhana is undertaken both by men and women of all economic classes and among the educationally forward Jains. It is observed more <b>often</b> <b>by</b> women than men.|$|E
