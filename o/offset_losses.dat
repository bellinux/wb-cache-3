5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in additional capital to <b>offset</b> <b>losses</b> from real estate investments.|$|E
5|$|With Yerkes as chairman, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was {{established}} in 1902 with a capitalisation of £5million, the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which, by 1903, raised a total of £18million (£ today) to be used across all of the UERL's projects. Yerkes died in December 1905, and Speyer took his place {{as chairman of the}} UERL. By 1907, the three new railways had opened and the electrification works had been completed. Despite the UERL's engineering success in carrying out the works in such a short time, the company was in a difficult financial position. The preliminary estimates of passenger numbers proved to be over optimistic and revenues were not covering operating costs. After bailing out the company, Speyer, with Managing Director Albert Stanley, struggled {{for a number of years}} to restore its finances. This was finally achieved with the purchase of the London General Omnibus Company in 1912, as its profits could be used to <b>offset</b> <b>losses</b> elsewhere in the group. In November 1912, Speyer further consolidated the UERL's control of London's underground railways when he negotiated the purchase of London's two other main tube railways, the City and South London Railway and the Central London Railway.|$|E
25|$|The Mark-to-Market Margin (MTM margin) on {{the other}} hand is the margin {{collected}} to <b>offset</b> <b>losses</b> (if any) that have already been incurred on the positions held by a firm. This is computed as the difference between the cost of the position held and the current market value of that position. If the resulting amount is a loss, the amount is collected from the firm; else, the amount may be returned to the firm (the case with most clearing houses) or kept in reserve depending on local practice. In either case, the positions are 'marked-to-market' by setting their new cost to the market value used in computing this difference. The positions held by the clients of the exchange are marked-to-market daily and the MTM difference computation for the next day would use the new cost figure in its calculation.|$|E

40|$|This note {{develops}} a behavioral {{explanation for the}} existence of an asymmetric tax treatment of gains and losses when investors are loss averse. We find that <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> rules should be more restrictive for investors which are (1) more risk averse in case of gains, (2) less risk seeking in case of losses, or (3) more loss averse. Our findings have important policy implications. Tax authorities often implement identical <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> rules for different investor clienteles. However, there should be specific <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> rules for investors who differ in risk attitude as well as in loss aversion.

It found that Weir would pay more corporation tax, despite the Scottish government's proposal to cut the rate of corporation tax, due to it no longer being able to <b>offset</b> <b>losses</b> in Scotland against profits {{in the rest of the}} UK.

The report found that 70% of all Scottish exports are sold to the rest of the UK, which it said would particularly affect the financial services sector.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how tax <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions affect an investor's evaluation of risky investments under bounded rationality. We analytically identify behavioral tax effects for {{different levels of}} <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions, tax rate and prospect theoretical biases (loss aversion, probability weighting and reference dependence) and find tax <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions significantly bias investor perception, even more heavily than the tax rate. If <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions are rather generous, investors are very loss averse or assign a huge weight to loss probabilities, taxation {{is likely to increase}} the preference value of risky investments (behavioral tax paradox). Surprisingly, the identified significant perception biases of tax <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions occur under both high and low tax rates and thus are relatively insensitive to tax rate changes. Finally, we identify huge differences in behavioral tax effects across countries indicating that tax <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions crucially determine the perceived tax quality of a country for risky investments. Our analysis is relevant for policy makers discussing future tax reforms as well as for investors assessing risky investment opportunities. asymmetric taxation,investment decisions,loss offset restrictions,perception bias,risktaking,tax effects,tax losses,prospect theory,behavioral taxatio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} particular <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> limitations on intrastate and cross-border investment decisions. Investment can be realized in the investor’s domestic business, in a foreign branch or in a foreign subsidiary. The relative impact on the optimal real investment alternative compared to the optimal financial investment alternative indicates the investment incentives of tax law asymmetries. Integrating an initial loss carryforward {{at the time of}} investment creates a special decision situation. Varying <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> parameters typically induces ambiguous effects that depend on the combination of all parameters under consideration. On average, a domestic minimum tax and a time limit on loss carryforwards tend to depress real investment. However, it is possible to find counter-examples. Real investment projects with decreasing cash flows and expected infra-marginal projects {{are less likely to be}} discriminated against than projects with increasing cash flows and expected marginal projects, respectively. An initial loss carryforward generates a domestic lock-in effect that may be intensified by <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> limitations.
