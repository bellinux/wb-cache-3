5|$|Gallium {{arsenide}} {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of <b>optoelectronic</b> infrared devices. Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) is used in high-power infrared laser diodes. The semiconductors gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are used in blue and violet <b>optoelectronic</b> devices, mostly laser diodes and light-emitting diodes. For example, gallium nitride 405nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density Blu-ray Disc compact data disc drives.|$|E
5|$|The {{energies}} {{between the}} Van Hove singularities {{depend on the}} nanotube structure. Thus by varying this structure, one can tune the <b>optoelectronic</b> properties of carbon nanotube. Such fine tuning has been experimentally demonstrated using UV illumination of polymer-dispersed CNTs.|$|E
5|$|Current {{limitations}} to p-doping limit electronic and <b>optoelectronic</b> applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of n-type and p-type material. Known p-type dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; {{as well as}} copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p-type conduction at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|Technetium-99 decays {{almost entirely}} by beta decay, {{emitting}} beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard beta emitter, and is used for equipment calibration. Technetium-99 has also been proposed for <b>optoelectronic</b> devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries.|$|E
5|$|Whereas mechanical, {{electrical}} and electrochemical (supercapacitor) {{properties of the}} carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics. In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab. Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light {{and the possibility of}} its fine tuning through the nanotube structure. In addition, bolometer and <b>optoelectronic</b> memory devices have been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Some <b>optoelectronic</b> applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E

25|$|Copper and {{aluminium}} {{are used}} as heat sinks and heat pipes in electronic cooling applications. A heat sink is a passive component that cools semiconductor and <b>optoelectronic</b> devices by dissipating heat into the surrounding air. Heat sinks have temperatures higher than their surrounding environments so that heat can be transferred into the air by convection, radiation, and conduction.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary use}} of {{metallic}} arsenic is in alloys of lead (for example, in car batteries and ammunition). Arsenic {{is a common}} n-type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices, and the <b>optoelectronic</b> compound gallium arsenide {{is the second most}} commonly used semiconductor after doped silicon. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of pesticides, treated wood products, herbicides, and insecticides. These applications are declining, however.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, a {{few months}} before the United States entered World War II, the {{cornerstone}} was laid for a research and development facility in Princeton, New Jersey called RCA Laboratories.

25|$|After 50 years, {{during which}} {{solid-state}} electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube, the photomultiplier remains {{a unique and}} important <b>optoelectronic</b> component. Perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts, electronically, as a nearly perfect current source, owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals. There is no Johnson noise associated with photomultiplier signal currents, {{even though they are}} greatly amplified, e.g., by 100 thousand times (i.e., 100dB) or more. The photocurrent still contains shot noise.|$|E
25|$|Resistive {{opto-isolator}} (RO), {{also called}} photoresistive opto-isolator, vactrol (after a genericized trademark introduced by Vactec, Inc. in the 1960s), analog opto-isolator or lamp-coupled photocell, is an <b>optoelectronic</b> device {{consisting of a}} source and detector of light, which are optically coupled and electrically isolated from each other. The light source is usually a light-emitting diode (LED), a miniature incandescent lamp, or sometimes a neon lamp, whereas the detector is a semiconductor-based photoresistor made of cadmium selenide (CdSe) or cadmium sulfide (CdS). The source and detector are coupled through a transparent glue or through the air.|$|E

25|$|The first diode lasers were {{homojunction}} diodes. That is, {{the material}} (and thus the bandgap) of the waveguide core layer {{and that of}} the surrounding clad layers, were identical. It was recognized that there was an opportunity, particularly afforded by the use of liquid phase epitaxy using aluminum gallium arsenide, to introduce heterojunctions. Heterostructures consist of layers of semiconductor crystal having varying bandgap and refractive index. Heterojunctions (formed from heterostructures) had been recognized by Herbert Kroemer, while working at RCA Laboratories in the mid-1950s, as having unique advantages for several types of electronic and <b>optoelectronic</b> devices including diode lasers. LPE afforded the technology of making heterojunction diode lasers.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to align an optical fiber with another optical fiber, or with an <b>optoelectronic</b> device {{such as a}} light-emitting diode, a laser diode, or a modulator. This can involve either carefully aligning the fiber and placing it {{in contact with the}} device, or can use a lens to allow coupling over an air gap. Typically the size of the fiber mode is much larger than the size of the mode in a laser diode or a silicon optical chip. In this case a tapered or lensed fiber is used to match the fiber mode field distribution to that of the other element. The lens {{on the end of the}} fiber can be formed using polishing, laser cutting or fusion splicing.|$|E
25|$|A {{night vision}} device (NVD), {{also known as}} night optical/observation device (NOD) and night vision goggles (NVG), is an <b>optoelectronic</b> device that allows images to be {{produced}} in levels of light approaching total darkness. The image may be a conversion to visible light of both visible light and near-infrared, while by convention detection of thermal infrared is denoted thermal imaging. The image produced is typically monochrome, e.g. shades of green. NVDs are most often used by the military and law enforcement agencies, but are available to civilian users. The term usually refers to a complete unit, including an image intensifier tube, a protective and generally water-resistant housing, and some type of mounting system. Many NVDs also include optical components such as a sacrificial lens, or telescopic lenses or mirrors. An NVD may have an IR illuminator, making it an active as opposed to passive night vision device.|$|E

500|$|Germanium {{has largely}} been {{replaced}} by silicon in semiconducting devices, being cheaper, more resilient at higher operating temperatures, and easier to work during the microelectronic fabrication process. Germanium is still a constituent of semiconducting silicon-germanium [...] "alloys" [...] and these have been growing in use, particularly for wireless communication devices; such alloys exploit the higher carrier mobility of germanium. The synthesis of gram-scale quantities of semiconducting germanane was reported in 2013. This comprises one-atom thick sheets of hydrogen-terminated germanium atoms, analogous to graphane. It conducts electrons more than ten times faster than silicon and five times faster than germanium, and {{is thought to have}} potential for <b>optoelectronic</b> and sensing applications. The development of a germanium-wire based anode that more than doubles the capacity of lithium-ion batteries was reported in 2014. In the same year, Lee at al. reported that defect-free crystals of graphene large enough to have electronic uses could be grown on, and removed from, a germanium substrate.|$|E
500|$|The Su-35 {{employs the}} {{powerful}} N035 Irbis-E ("Snow Leopard") passive electronically-scanned array (PESA) radar, {{which is a}} further development of the N011M radar that had been evaluated on Su-27M test-beds and constitutes {{the core of the}} Su-35's weapons-control system. It is capable of detecting an aerial target up to [...] away, and can track thirty airborne targets and engage eight of them simultaneously; in addition, the multi-function radar is capable of providing high-resolution images of the ground using synthetic aperture mode. The aircraft is equipped with an OLS-35 <b>optoelectronic</b> targeting system ahead of the cockpit to provide other forms of tracking including infra-red search and track. For defences against enemy tracking, the Su-35 is equipped with the L175M Khibiny-M electronic countermeasure system, while engineers have applied radar-absorbent materials to the engine inlets and front stages of the engine compressor to halve the Su-35's frontal radar cross-section and minimise the detection range of enemy radars. The multi-role Su-35 can deploy air-to-air missiles of up to [...] range, and can carry the heavy Oniks anti-ship cruise missile, as well as the multitude of air-to-ground weaponry.|$|E
500|$|It is a dopant in {{some types}} of glass in lasers and other <b>optoelectronic</b> devices. Europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red {{phosphor}} in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors. Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1g of europium oxide. Whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors, the luminescence of divalent europium depends strongly on {{the composition of the}} host structure. UV to deep red luminescence can be achieved. The two classes of europium-based phosphor (red and blue), combined with the yellow/green terbium phosphors give [...] "white" [...] light, the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors. This phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs. Combining the same three classes is one way to make trichromatic systems in TV and computer screens. Europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass. One of the more common persistent after-glow phosphors besides copper-doped zinc sulfide is europium-doped strontium aluminate. Europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug-discovery screens. It is also used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes.|$|E
