This is disputed, however, by those who claim that Horatio Torromé should hold this title as the first official Argentine representative.

She continued her suffragist work by joining the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage, where she impressed Margaret Ashton, the first woman member of Manchester City Council, by her efforts in the North Manchester and Gorton constituencies.
