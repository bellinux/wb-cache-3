40|$|In this dissertation, I {{developed}} a grounded {{theory that describes}} and explains the processes by which a sample of highly educated young adults organizes and gives meaning to work careers in the contemporary milieu. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 24 graduates from Harvard University 2 ̆ 7 s Class of 1996, I identified a sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as <b>the</b> core conceptual category for understanding how informants construct careers. Through a combination of cultural, relational and individual influences, informants {{developed a}} sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> that was either uncomplicated or complicated. An uncomplicated sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> included awareness <b>of</b> a limited range <b>of</b> <b>possibilities,</b> clarity about <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> a sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as relatively permanent career solutions and a conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as fixed. Conversely, a complicated sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> involved awareness <b>of</b> an extensive range <b>of</b> <b>possibilities,</b> ambiguity about <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> a sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as short-term career solutions, and a conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as pliable. <b>The</b> more complicated their sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> <b>the</b> more actively individuals engaged in constructing a career. Three subprocesses relate to this core category: becoming aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> explains <b>the</b> conditions under which a sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> develops, confronting <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> explains <b>the</b> strategies <b>of</b> action individuals employ to contend with their sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> and living with possibilities and choices explains how people 2 ̆ 7 s careers and lives are shaped by <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> their actions and choices in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> constructing their careers. The theory developed in this study suggests that, in constructing their careers, informants use whatever structural resources are available and impose their own structure where it is otherwise lacking and action is required. <b>The</b> convergence <b>of</b> available structural resources, a person 2 ̆ 7 s sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> and <b>the</b> action strategies employed to confront those possibilities leads people to construct either institutional or individual careers. These distinct career orientations have different consequences for <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting work career, for the relationships between work careers and other interdependent careers, {{as well as for}} people 2 ̆ 7 s overall well-being. ...|$|R

5|$|Although war pigeons {{and mobile}} dovecotes were used {{extensively}} during the Second World War, {{it is unclear}} to what extent, if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According {{to a report in}} 1942, the Soviet army discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry pigeons in baskets. On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American Signal Corps was aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of adopting the technique.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of {{subsurface}} liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, {{there has}} been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa Orbiter was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining {{the presence or absence}} of a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa Orbiter mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of using {{uranium-235}} {{to construct an}} atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly {{before and after the}} war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} exobiologists have {{proposed}} {{the existence of}} a shadow biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> in the bacterium GFAJ-1, was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.|$|E
5|$|How the Phylloxera aphid was {{introduced}} to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission in uranium by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in December 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, {{opened up the}} possibility that neutrons produced by fission could create a controlled nuclear chain reaction. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved. In August 1939, Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a German nuclear weapon project, and convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it.
