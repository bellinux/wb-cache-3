5|$|<b>Oxy-fuel</b> welding – {{also known}} as {{oxyacetylene}} welding or oxy welding, uses fuel gases and oxygen to weld and cut metals.|$|E
25|$|Torches {{that do not}} mix fuel {{with oxygen}} (combining, instead, {{atmospheric}} air) are not considered <b>oxy-fuel</b> torches and can typically be identified by a single tank (<b>oxy-fuel</b> cutting requires two isolated supplies, fuel and oxygen). Most metals cannot be melted with a single-tank torch. Consequently, single-tank torches are typically suitable for soldering and brazing but not for welding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxy-fuel</b> {{combustion}} – Fossil fuels such as coal are {{burned in}} a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO2 capture.|$|E
25|$|A typical <b>oxy-fuel</b> torch, {{called an}} equal-pressure torch, merely mixes the two gases. In an {{injector}} torch, high-pressure oxygen {{comes out of}} a small nozzle inside the torch head which drags the fuel gas along with it, using the venturi effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxy-fuel</b> {{processes}} may use {{a variety}} of fuel gases, the most common being acetylene. Other gases that may be used are propylene, liquified petroleum gas (LPG), propane, natural gas, hydrogen, and MAPP gas. Many brands use different kinds of gases in their mixes.|$|E
25|$|In short, <b>oxy-fuel</b> {{equipment}} is quite versatile, {{not only because}} it is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding but also because it lends itself to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), rust or scale removal, the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and is a ubiquitous means of cutting ferrous metals.|$|E
25|$|Some {{specific}} reactions {{have their}} niche applications. For example, the thermite reaction {{is used to}} generate light and heat in pyrotechnics and welding. Although it is less controllable than the more conventional <b>oxy-fuel</b> welding, arc welding and flash welding, it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails, especially in remote areas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxy-fuel</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} welding processes, besides forge welding. In recent decades it has been obsolesced in almost all {{industrial}} uses due to various arc welding methods offering more consistent mechanical weld properties and faster application. Gas welding is still used for metal-based artwork and in smaller home based shops, as well as situations where accessing electricity (e.g., via an extension cord or portable generator) would present difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Flashback is the {{condition}} of the flame propagating down the hoses of an <b>oxy-fuel</b> welding and cutting system. To prevent such a situation a flashback arrestor is usually employed. The flame burns backwards into the hose, causing a popping or squealing noise. It can cause an explosion in the hose with the potential to injure or kill the operator. Using a lower pressure than recommended can cause a flashback.|$|E
25|$|Robotic <b>oxy-fuel</b> cutters {{sometimes}} use {{a high-speed}} divergent nozzle. This uses an oxygen jet that opens slightly along its passage. This allows the compressed oxygen to expand as it leaves, forming a high-velocity jet that spreads {{less than a}} parallel-bore nozzle, allowing a cleaner cut. These are not used for cutting by hand since they need very accurate positioning above the work. Their ability to produce almost any shape from large steel plates gives them a secure future in shipbuilding and in many other industries.|$|E
25|$|For a basic {{oxy-acetylene}} rig, {{the cutting}} speed in light steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an <b>oxy-fuel</b> torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application.|$|E
500|$|Oxygen storage {{methods include}} high {{pressure}} oxygen tanks, cryogenics and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen {{is equivalent to}} 840liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and [...] Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and <b>oxy-fuel</b> welding and cutting.|$|E
2500|$|Welding/burning technologies: burning by laser, <b>oxy-fuel</b> burning, and plasma ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{coal-fired}} power stations, the main alternatives to retrofitting amine-based absorbers to existing power stations are two new technologies: coal gasification combined-cycle and <b>oxy-fuel</b> combustion. Gasification first produces a [...] "syngas" [...] primarily of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which is burned, with carbon dioxide filtered from the flue gas. <b>Oxy-fuel</b> combustion burns the coal in oxygen instead of air, producing only {{carbon dioxide and}} water vapour, which are relatively easily separated. Some of the combustion products must {{be returned to the}} combustion chamber, either before or after separation, otherwise the temperatures would be too high for the turbine.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Oxy-fuel</b> welding (commonly called {{oxyacetylene}} welding, oxy welding, or {{gas welding}} in the U.S.) and <b>oxy-fuel</b> cutting [...] are processes that use fuel gases and oxygen to weld and cut metals, respectively. French engineers Edmond Fouché and Charles Picard {{became the first}} to develop oxygen-acetylene welding in 1903. [...] Pure oxygen, instead of air, is used to increase the flame temperature to allow localized melting of the workpiece material (e.g. steel) in a room environment. A common propane/air flame burns at about , a propane/oxygen flame burns at about , an oxyhydrogen flame burns at , and an acetylene/oxygen flame burns at about [...]|$|E
2500|$|In <b>oxy-fuel</b> cutting, a torch {{is used to}} heat metal to its {{kindling}} temperature. [...] A {{stream of}} oxygen is then trained on the metal, burning it into a metal oxide that flows out of the [...] as slag.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is based}} on using [...] "common hand tools, picking tools, {{mechanical}} or portable electric tools, grinding points carbide drills, pressure applying devices or mechanisms, abrasive cutting wheels, power saws, coring tools, impact tools, fluxing rods, and <b>oxy-fuel</b> gas cutting torches".|$|E
2500|$|In <b>oxy-fuel</b> welding, a {{welding torch}} {{is used to}} weld metals. Welding metal results when two pieces are heated to a {{temperature}} that produces a shared pool of molten metal. [...] The molten pool is generally supplied with additional metal called filler. Filler material depends upon the metals to be welded.|$|E
2500|$|Drilling {{a hole in}} a {{metal part}} {{is the most common}} example of a chip {{producing}} process. [...] Using an <b>oxy-fuel</b> cutting torch to separate a plate of steel into smaller pieces is an example of burning. Chemical milling {{is an example of a}} specialty process that removes excess material by the use of etching chemicals and masking chemicals.|$|E
2500|$|A second tender {{process was}} {{launched}} by government in 2012 {{as part of}} DECC's CCS Commercialisation Programme and two bidders, namely the Shell Peterhead gas-fired power station CCS project and the White Rose CCS project based upon a new <b>oxy-fuel</b> coal-fired unit at Drax power station were selected in 2013 to proceed to a funded front-end engineering and design phase. [...] This second tender was cancelled in November 2015 following a government spending review {{at the time of}} the Chancellor's Autumn Statement.|$|E
2500|$|Acetylene is {{the primary}} fuel for <b>oxy-fuel</b> welding and is the fuel of choice for repair work and general cutting and welding. Acetylene gas is shipped in special {{cylinders}} designed to keep the gas dissolved. [...] The cylinders are packed with porous materials (e.g. kapok fibre, diatomaceous earth, or (formerly) asbestos), then filled to around 50% capacity with acetone, as acetylene is soluble in acetone. This method is necessary because above 207 kPa (30 lbf/in²) (absolute pressure) acetylene is unstable and may explode.|$|E
2500|$|Exposure to the {{brightness}} of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding goggles and helmets with dark face plates—much darker than those in sunglasses or <b>oxy-fuel</b> goggles—are worn to prevent this exposure. In recent years, new helmet models have been produced featuring a face plate which automatically self-darkens electronically. To protect bystanders, transparent welding curtains often surround the welding area. [...] These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
2500|$|Oxygen {{is not the}} fuel. It is what {{chemically}} combines {{with the}} fuel to produce the heat for welding. This is called 'oxidation', but the more specific and more commonly used term {{in this context is}} 'combustion'. In the case of hydrogen, the product of combustion is simply water. For the other hydrocarbon fuels, water and carbon dioxide are produced. The heat is released because the molecules of the products of combustion have a lower energy state than the molecules of the fuel and oxygen. In <b>oxy-fuel</b> cutting, oxidation of the metal being cut (typically iron) produces nearly all of the heat required to [...] "burn" [...] through the workpiece.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 20% of {{acetylene}} {{is supplied}} by the industrial gases industry for oxyacetylene gas welding and cutting due to the high temperature of the flame. Combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over , releasing 11.8kJ/g. Oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas. [...] Acetylene is the third-hottest natural chemical flame after dicyanoacetylene's [...] and cyanogen at [...] Oxy-acetylene welding was a popular welding process in previous decades. The development and advantages of arc-based welding processes have made <b>oxy-fuel</b> welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding equipment is quite versatile – {{not only because the}} torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. Bell Canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, <b>oxy-fuel</b> cutting is still popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in many metal fabrication shops. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a flashback), acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{example of}} a coal-based plant using (<b>oxy-fuel)</b> carbon-capture {{technology}} is Swedish company Vattenfall's Schwarze Pumpe power station located in Spremberg, Germany, built by German firm Siemens, which went on-line in September 2008. The facility captures CO2 and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO2 into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered {{not to be a}} final solution for CO2 reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical. In 2014 [...] research and development were discontinued due to high costs making the technology unviable.|$|E
2500|$|The German {{industrial}} area of Schwarze Pumpe, about [...] {{south of the}} city of Spremberg, is home to the world's first demonstration CCS coal plant, the Schwarze Pumpe power station. The mini pilot plant is run by an Alstom-built <b>oxy-fuel</b> boiler and is also equipped with a flue gas cleaning facility to remove fly ash and sulphur dioxide. The Swedish company Vattenfall AB invested some €70million in the two-year project, which began operation September 9, 2008. The power plant, which is rated at 30 megawatts, is a pilot project to serve as a prototype for future full-scale power plants. 240 tonnes a day of [...] are being trucked [...] where it will be injected into an empty gas field. Germany's BUND group called it a [...] "fig leaf". For each tonne of coal burned, 3.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide is produced. The CCS program at Schwarze Pumpe ended in 2014 due to inviable costs and energy use.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>oxy-fuel</b> {{combustion}} {{the fuel}} is burned in oxygen instead of air. To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and {{injected into the}} combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "zero emission" [...] cycles, because the [...] stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A certain fraction of the [...] generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water. To warrant the label [...] "zero emission" [...] the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately. The technique is promising, but the initial air separation step demands a lot of energy.|$|E
2500|$|Methylacetylene-propadiene (MAPP) gas and LPG gas {{are similar}} fuels, because LPG gas is {{liquefied}} petroleum gas mixed with MPS. It has the storage and shipping characteristics of LPG and has a heat value {{a little less than}} acetylene. Because it can be shipped in small containers for sale at retail stores, it is used by hobbyists and large industrial companies and shipyards because it does not polymerize at high pressures— above 15 psi or so (as acetylene does) and is therefore much less dangerous than acetylene. Further, more of it can be stored in a single place at one time, as the increased compressibility allows for more gas to be put into a tank. MAPP gas can be used at much higher pressures than acetylene, sometimes up to 40 or 50 psi in high-volume <b>oxy-fuel</b> cutting torches which can cut up to [...] steel. Other welding gases that develop comparable temperatures need special procedures for safe shipping and handling. MPS and MAPP are recommended for cutting applications in particular, rather than welding applications.|$|E
2500|$|The 2,000 hull {{plates were}} single pieces of rolled steel plate, mostly up to [...] wide and [...] long and {{weighing}} between 2.5 and 3 tons. Their thickness varied from [...] to [...] The plates were laid in a clinkered (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above that point they were {{laid in the}} [...] "in and out" [...] fashion, where strake plating was applied in bands (the [...] "in strakes") with the gaps covered by the [...] "out strakes", overlapping on the edges. Commercial <b>oxy-fuel</b> and electric arc welding methods, ubiquitous in fabrication today, were still in their infancy; like most other iron and steel structures of the era, the hull was held together with over three million iron and steel rivets, which by themselves weighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand. In the 1990s some material scientists concluded that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold, and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking. It is believed that, {{by the standards of}} the time, the steel plate's quality was good, not faulty, but that it was inferior to what would be used for shipbuilding purposes in later decades, owing to advances in the metallurgy of steelmaking. As for the rivets, considerable emphasis has also been placed on their quality and strength.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oxy-fuel</b> {{combustion}} is {{the process}} of burning a fuel using pure oxygen instead of air as the primary oxidant.
