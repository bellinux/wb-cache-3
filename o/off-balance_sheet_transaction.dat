Recently, <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>transactions,</b> specifically synthetic leases, have proliferated in connection with corporate acquisitions and with construction and development of corporate real estate facilities.

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>transactions</b> on {{interest}} and exchange rate exposures has become more important for emerging market countries that are experiencing remarkable growth in derivatives markets. Using firm level data, we report a significant fall in exposure over the past 10 years and relate this to higher derivatives market participation. Our methodology is composed of a three stage approach: First, we measure foreign exchange exposures using the Adler-Dumas (1984) model. Next, we follow an indirect approach to infer derivatives market participation at the firm level. Finally, we study the relationship between exchange rate exposure and derivatives market participation. Our results show that foreign exchange exposure is negatively related to derivatives market participation, and support the hedging explanation of the exchange rate exposure puzzle. This decline is especially salient in the financial sector, for bigger firms, and over longer time periods.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that financial market globalization has been developing. International financial markets have expanded substantially, and transaction volumes in foreign exchange markets and capital markets have increased markedly. Progress in information and telecommunications technologies, liberalization in capital markets, {{and development of}} new financial instruments have further stimulated international capital flows, leading to more expansion and efficiency in international financial markets. However, empirical evidence suggests that national borders have been serving {{as some sort of}} barriers to international capital flows. Portfolios of investors based in industrialized countries are biased toward domestic assets (the "home bias puzzle"), and national savings tend to be absorbed domestically (the "Feldstein-Horioka paradox"). From a long-term historical perspective, the size of net capital flows has not increased so much. Alternatively, such development of globalization can be viewed differently once we take account of other aspects such as <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>transactions.</b> Derivative instruments offer the possibility of unbundling risks inherent in underlying assets, and such unbundled risks can be repackaged and dealt in separately. Thus, cross-border derivatives transactions enhance the effectiveness of risk transfer. Given the recent growing trend toward financial globalization, how and at what pace financial globalization will develop in the future have important implications for the conduct of monetary policy by central banks. If financial markets become further integrated and international capital flows more actively, it is obvious that independent monetary policy directed toward domestic goals, liberalization of capital mobility, and fixed foreign exchange rates cannot be achieved simultaneously. In addition, prudential policy might face new problems pertaining to the stability of the financial system due to increasing international linkage...|$|R
40|$|Part I of the Article {{outlines}} {{the problems with}} the current method of board selection and functioning. Management or management-sympathetic board members often select the board nominees, who share social ties with other board members. Boards tend to avoid 2 ̆ 2 rocking the boat 2 ̆ 2 by questioning management 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations, and {{because of the way the}} proxy process is structured, shareholders cannot effectively use their votes to oust unsatisfactory board members. Part II analyzes the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s recent proposals for reform, which center on granting shareholders more opportunities to nominate candidates to the board. These proposals attempt to give shareholders a greater voice in the election process, but do so circuitously. They require that nominating shareholders be independent from the candidates they nominate, missing the point that it is precisely those individuals with a stake in the corporation that will make the best monitors. Part III presents the mechanics of the proposed solution, suggesting that the company offer the largest shareholder independent of management a spot on the company 2 ̆ 7 s slate of director candidates (an offer tantamount to a board seat, given the structure of the proxy process). If the largest such shareholder did not accept the position, it would be offered to the next-largest shareholder, and so on until the seat was filled. Because adoption of such a nomination process would be voluntary, only companies that strongly desired to signal their status as upstanding practitioners of responsible corporate governance would be likely to implement it. The Part concludes by pointing out that in the venture capital context, investors routinely sit on the board in order to monitor and protect their investments. Part IV then explains how having a shareholder representative on the board solves many of the problems that other proposed reforms do not. Part IV responds to potential criticisms, chief among which is that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other corporate reforms render further action unnecessary. The Article 2 ̆ 7 s response is that regulators, like generals, always fight the last war. Sarbanes-Oxley, and the new listing rules instituted by NASDAQ and the NYSE, prohibit Enron- and WorldCom style problems, such as loans to corporate officers, <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>transactions,</b> and conflicts of interest in company auditors. None of these reforms contemplate structural changes that will prevent new kinds of frauds in the future.

40|$|While leases {{are widely}} used to finance {{productive}} assets in the U. S, lease accounting has been sharply criticized for providing incomplete and unreliable information to investors because many leases are arranged <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> as operating leases. As such, a higher cost of equity capital may be required by investors to compensate for unrecorded liabilities and imperfect information. In this dissertation, I provide the empirical evidence as to how equity market participants perceive the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ^ First, I investigate the firm characteristics that determine the choice on operating versus capital leases. By summarizing the results from prior literature, I identify the determinants from three areas: operating risks, financial constraints and tax-driven incentives. The results suggest that both economic and opportunistic reasons drive a firm 2 ̆ 7 s lease choice. Specifically, fast-growing, financially constrained, or low-tax firms opt for <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases. ^ Second, I {{examine the impact of}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases on the cost of equity, and whether it would be different from that of capital leases or conventional debt. The results suggest that <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases are “value relevant” as indicated by an increased cost of equity capital being associated with greater use of operating leases. However, investors also seem to suffer from the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> position of disclosed operating leases. The leverage effect of operating leases is largely attenuated relative to capital leases and conventional debt. ^ Third, I explore the role of information intermediaries in compensation for the deficiency in accounting for leases. The results indicate that the cost of equity, with respect to the use of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases, diminishes in greater analyst followings and the existence of credit ratings. Specifically, the diminishing effect of 2 ̆ 7 financial analysts is more pronounced on <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases than that on capital leases and conventional debt. Lastly, whether a firm is audited by a big 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 firm appears to have no effect on either off- or on-balance sheet leases. ^ This study contributes to the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s lease accounting project and helps investors assess the risk of firms with <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ...|$|R

I examine a sample of publicly-listed banks in a cross-country setting, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and the USA, over the period of 1995 to 2011.

40|$|In recent years, {{the general}} public in many {{countries}} has become increasingly aware of issues concerning business accounting and financial reporting. Americans hardly {{need to be reminded}} of the Enron debacle, where members of the company 2 ̆ 7 s senior management engaged in fraudulent <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>transactions</b> to disguise the true state of the company 2 ̆ 7 s financial condition, a scheme that auditors failed to uncover until the company 2 ̆ 7 s implosion. This and other major corporate governance cases involving questionable or fraudulent accounting practices led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This law was an unprecedented Congressional intervention into corporate governance, an arena that had previously been left largely to Securities and Exchange Commission (2 ̆ 2 SEC 2 ̆ 2) rules and professional self-regulation (e. g., auditor independence requirements) or to state corporate law (e. g., requirements for board committees and their composition). Accounting scandals are not, however, a phenomenon limited to the United States. As a result of similar events in some European states, accounting reform has recently appeared on their policy agendas as well. Italy is notable in this regard, {{due in large part to}} its home-grown Parmalat scandal-until now Europe 2 ̆ 7 s most expensive financial scandal. At the end of 2003, a 14. 8 billion gap that had been disguised by the establishment of an offshore subsidiary was discovered in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s accounts. Surprisingly-at least at first glance-at a time when other countries were strengthening their stance to- ward accounting fraud, Italy eased the grip of its criminal law on accounting fraud in a 2002 legislative decree amending the Italian Civil Code. The Italian courts have submitted this amendment to the scrutiny of the European Court of Justice (2 ̆ 2 ECJ 2 ̆ 2) for a preliminary ruling. The objective of this note is to analyze the importance of three joint cases - one of them against the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi-where the amendment of Italian law is now at issue, and to situate them within the bigger picture of the current state of corporate governance and financial reporting. Part I explains the legal context of these cases and outlines the opinion submitted by the Advocate General Juliane Kokott. 9 Part II analyzes the three most important parts of the Advocate General 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in detail: the application of E. U. law on the nondisclosure of accounts to the publication of false accounts, the need for effective enforcement, and the effect of the principle nulla poena sine lege-that there must be neither crime nor punishment without law. The Advocate General recommends that Italy 2 ̆ 7 s judges should ignore the new Italian law, which takes a lax view of accounting fraud. On the one hand, this is surprising, as E. U. directives on corporate law and ac- counting do not address the issue at all. On the other hand, this strict approach to financial reporting is in line with increasing efforts toward stronger involvement of the E. U. 2 ̆ 2 federal 2 ̆ 2 level in corporate governance in general, in consideration of recent U. S. corporate governance developments as well as the economic underpinnings of accurate accounting.

The study describes the particular mechanism of structuring mortgage into mortgage credit derivatives as well as <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> financing of the mortgage credit derivatives is examined. Mortgage derivatives, such as an asset-backed security (ABS) and more complex collateralized debt obligation (CDO) structures among others {{are a part of}} the structured finance and have particular features. High-risk mortgage loans are attractive assets as a part of these derivatives since the loans offer better yields than prime class mortgage. On the other hand, the risks are bigger and the risks remain through structuring and off-balance financing. The mechanism of structuring mortgage credit derivatives is described. Structuring involves many market participants and financial intermediaries. Underlying assets of these credit derivatives are certain mortgage loans. Many benefits are evolved including new sources of external finance, credit risk transfer, improved liquidity, increased trading volume, better profits and a chance to straighten the financial supply chain. The benefits of structuring mortgage credit derivatives appear similar to common benefits of structured finance and securitization. Risks and disadvantages occur as well as the mechanism of structuring mortgage credit derivatives is sub-ject to risks or disadvantages. The major risks or disadvantages are the lack of control, asymmetric information, the lack of transparency and disadvantages of credit risk transfer. <b>Off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance or financial activities outside of the balance sheet is understudied area although it has a salient role in mortgage derivatives banking. <b>Off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance creates plenty of benefits that are a new source of external finance, improved profitability, new tools to attain new lines of business in the banking industry and a possibility to leverage. However, <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance is also a subject to increased risk in banking as it increases both risk of deposit, liquidity risk as well as risk of losses, it creates a possibility to leverage and <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance also increases financial risk.

In particular, this work aims to examine whether and how the increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> credit exposure to credit derivatives, mainly due to loan securitisation, may have affected the growth rate of loans over the past few years, also by distinguishing different categories of loans. For this purpose, we present the results of a panel fixed-effect estimation and of a panel VAR analysis, using quarterly data from the balance sheets of 39 US commercial banks and for a period between 1998 and 2008. The results show that a rise in off-balance credit exposure may have – after some time lags - a negative impact on the growth rate of bank lending, due to the potential and actual losses related to the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> activities. However, the effects on the single categories of loans depend on their maturity: the negative effect due to an increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> exposure is stronger for long-term loans, like mortgages or real estate loans, while some positive impact on bank lending may arise for short-term loans, such as commercial and industrial loans, because of the liquidity/maturity transformation function associated with securitisation activities. The results of the paper regarding the impact of an increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> exposures on bank deleveraging process may have some relevant policy implications for the design of financial regulation, particularly in the area of shadow banking, supporting the current policy initiatives for the revision of risk weights in securitisation exposures {{as well as for the}} implementation of consolidation regimes concerning bank <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> activities. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{bankruptcy}} of Enron {{drew attention to}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> instruments that were used fraudulently. During 2010, the court examiner's review of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy also brought these instruments back into focus, as Lehman had used an instrument called [...] "Repo 105" [...] to allegedly move assets and debt <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> to make its financial position look more favorable to investors. Sarbanes-Oxley required the disclosure of all material <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> items. It also required an SEC study and report {{to better understand the}} extent of usage of such instruments and whether accounting principles adequately addressed these instruments; the SEC report was issued June 15, 2005. Interim guidance was issued in May 2006, which was later finalized. Critics argued the SEC did not take adequate steps to regulate and monitor this activity.|$|R
