40|$|This paper reports an {{analysis}} of the articles published between 1998 and 2008 in the Journal of music therapy, an international, peer reviewed, impact factor journal. The aim of this analysis is to reveal the main <b>research</b> tendencies <b>in</b> the field of music therapy. The analysis process employed an inductive method based on “grounded theory” where categories emerged from the data rather than data being categorised according to pre-determined categories. The analysis sought to reveal as ‘themes’ the areas <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>music</b> therapy that were reported by this prestigious journal during the period under investigation. The ‘themes’ <b>of</b> <b>research</b> revealed were: prenatal/new-born/infant sound experiences, the effects of music, music therapy or music at school, music therapy or <b>music</b> <b>in</b> the social context, theoretical aspects of music therapy, meta-analysis, experimental research with music therapy, education and professional development of music therapists. The ‘themes’ are described and their importance for the development <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>music</b> therapy is discussed...|$|R

Possible directions <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>music,</b> assuming its affinity to NLP, are introduced.

40|$|This {{review article}} {{discusses}} the use <b>of</b> action <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>music</b> education {{and its potential}} for producing knowledge and improving practice. The discussion is situated in an analysis <b>of</b> action <b>research</b> studies <b>in</b> <b>music</b> education. The review demonstrates that action <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>music</b> education focuses {{on a wide variety}} of subject matter, integrates research and action, is collaborative, grounded in a body of existing knowledge, and leads to powerful learning for the participants. However, few action research projects are cyclical, deal with aspects of social transformation, or broad historical, political or ideological contexts, and there is little focus on reflexivity. The review suggests that, in order to undertake high-quality action research, researchers need a good understanding <b>of</b> action <b>research,</b> a focused use <b>of</b> <b>research</b> literature and a defensible position with regard to data analysis and the generation of trustworthy findings...|$|R
