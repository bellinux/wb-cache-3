25|$|Tank {{steering}} systems allow a tank, {{or other}} continuous track vehicle, to turn. Because the tracks cannot be angled {{relative to the}} hull (in any <b>operational</b> <b>design),</b> steering must be accomplished by speeding one track up, slowing the other down (or reversing it), {{or a combination of}} both. The half-track avoids this by combining steerable wheels and fixed-speed tracks.|$|E
25|$|Many of the <b>operational</b> <b>design</b> {{changes were}} also {{applied to the}} {{existing}} CANDU 6 to produce the Enhanced CANDU 6. Also known as CANDU 6e or EC 6, this was an evolutionary upgrade of the CANDU 6 design with a gross output of 740 MWe per unit. The reactors are designed with a lifetime of over fifty years, with a mid-life program to replace {{some of the key}} components e.g. the fuel channels. The projected average annual capacity factor is more than ninety percent. Improvements to construction techniques (including modular, open-top assembly) decrease construction costs. The CANDU 6e is designed to operate at power settings as low as 50%, allowing them to adjust to load demand much better than the previous designs.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The study {{investigated}} the impact of <b>operational</b> work system <b>design</b> on staff performance in selected construction firms in Nigeria. Research Design & Methods: The study used primary data gathered {{with the use of}} a  5 -point Likert scale questionnaire format administered to 138 respondents. A hypothesis was postulated to test the significance of the research problem. Data analysis was carried out using correlation and multiple regression analysis which proved the significance of the alternative hypothesis as a result of testing the hypothesis. Findings: The findings show that there is a significant relationship between <b>operational</b> work system <b>design</b> and staff performance. The study concludes that <b>operational</b> job <b>design</b> can be advanced as a motivation tool, which is non-monetary in nature, to improve staff performance. Implications & Recommendations: A key drive to improve performance is the satisfaction of staff coupled with an outstanding <b>operational</b> job <b>design</b> which takes into consideration the total physical and mental well-being of staff and its interaction with other organisational factors. The study recommends, among others, that there should be active participation of staff in the design of work in the organisation. Contribution & Value Added: The study provides an empirical approach to enhancing performance in the construction industry and thereby developing an indigenous firm to compete favourably on a growing market...|$|R
