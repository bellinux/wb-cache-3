5|$|The {{hymenium}} {{is developed}} on the under (outer) {{side of the}} fruit body. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) consist of a globular part (the hypobasidia) to which inflated or elongated epibasidia are attached. In Guepinia, the hypobasidia are egg-shaped to , measuring 12–16 by 9–12 μm, and attached to fibril-like epibasidia that are 20–45 by 3–4μm. The spore deposit is white, while the spores are 9–11 by 5–6μm, hyaline (translucent), cylindrical to elongated ellipsoid in shape, and have a large <b>oil</b> <b>drop.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive-brown.

The fusiform (fuse-shaped) cystidia are colourless with oil droplets, and have dimensions of 40–50 by 7–8μm. Cap cuticle tissue {{is in the}} form of a trichoderm, where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These cylindrical, interwoven hyphae contain septa.|$|E

Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the <b>oil</b> <b>drop</b> or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E

The spore dimensions are 32–43 by 25–38μm, the walls measuring 1–3μm thick. Although not reactive with Melzer's reagent, spores stain readily with Methyl blue. The asci contain 6 to 8 spores per ascus. They are variably shaped, with dimensions of 70–110 by 60–100μm, with a stem 10–40 by 6–10μm, and a forked base. Initially about 3μm thick, the ascus walls thin to roughly 1μm when mature. The gleba comprises loosely interwoven, thin-walled hyaline hyphae measuring 5–13μm in diameter.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, Robert Andrews Millikan began {{a series}} of {{experiments}} (see <b>oil</b> <b>drop</b> experiment) to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron.|$|E
25|$|Charge is the {{fundamental}} property of forms of matter that exhibit electrostatic attraction or repulsion {{in the presence of}} other matter. Electric charge is a characteristic property of many subatomic particles. The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the elementary charge e; we say that electric charge is quantized. Michael Faraday, in his electrolysis experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge. Robert Millikan's <b>oil</b> <b>drop</b> experiment demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge.|$|E

The second pair then back-converts the gravitational radiation into detectable microwaves. The enormous enhancement of the conversion efficiency for these quantum transducers over that for electrons arises from the fact that there exists macroscopic quantum phase coherence in these charged superfluid systems. The equivalence principle revisited: Does a falling charge radiate? Galileo first performed experiments demonstrating that all freely-falling objects, independent of their mass, accelerate downwards with the same acceleration g due to Earth’s gravity. Later, Eötvös, and still later, Dicke, performed more sensitive experiments, which showed that this statement of the equivalence prin-...|$|R

500|$|Bisporella citrina, {{commonly}} known as yellow fairy cups or lemon discos, is a species of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The fungus produces tiny yellow cups up to [...] in diameter, often without stalks, that fruit in groups or dense clusters on decaying deciduous wood that has lost its bark. The widely distributed species is found in North Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and Central and South America. Found in late summer and autumn, the fungus is fairly common, but is easily overlooked owing to its small size. There are several similar species that can in most cases be distinguished by differences in color, morphology, or substrate. Microscopically, B.citrina can be distinguished from these lookalikes by its elliptical spores, which have a central partition, and an <b>oil</b> <b>drop</b> at each end.|$|E

The hymenium lacks any cystidia. The hyphal system is monomitic, meaning that the context is made of thin-walled generative hyphae. These hyphae have lengths {{in the range of}} 3.5–30µm (most commonly 6–17µm), with thin walls (up to 1µm thick), and are hyaline (translucent). Although they are inamyloid, some hyphae have internal masses that are colored pale bluish-gray to black, which makes them appear collectively grayish-black under the microscope. Gloeoporous hyphae (wide and thin-walled with refractive contents) are also scattered throughout the context, as well as some hyphae with expanded tips that are thick-walled and amyloid.|$|E
