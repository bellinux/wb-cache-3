5|$|Galileo <b>observed</b> <b>the</b> planet Saturn, and {{at first}} mistook its rings for planets, {{thinking}} it was a three-bodied system. When he <b>observed</b> <b>the</b> planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think {{that two of the}} bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he <b>observed</b> <b>the</b> planet in 1616, further confusing him.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether <b>the</b> manufacturer should <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> common re-tail cost when exclusively delegating {{a retailer}} {{to sell her}} goods. We show that the expected sum of profits between the manufacturer and retailer is greater when the former does not <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> cost ex ante than when they do. However, the manufac-turer cannot acquire a greater expected private payoff when not <b>observing</b> <b>the</b> cost, regardless of the optimal contract. Even if the commitment to not <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> cost alleviates competition, the manufacturer must always pay higher information rent than the increasing payoff to the retailer...|$|R

5|$|A {{total of}} 13 benthic macroinvertebrates were {{observed}} by the West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition at site T-1.

One specimen of Sialis was <b>observed.</b> <b>The</b> benthic macroinvertebrates included three specimens of Chironomidae, and one each of Tipula and Trepobates.

5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, <b>observed</b> <b>the</b> high rate of thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as}} a diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|Again {{working with}} Johnston, Alvarez's last {{task for the}} Manhattan Project {{was to develop a}} set of {{calibrated}} microphone/transmitters to be parachuted from an aircraft to measure the strength of the blast wave from the atomic explosion, so as to allow the scientists to calculate the bomb's energy. He <b>observed</b> <b>the</b> Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress that also carried fellow Project Alberta members Harold Agnew and Deak Parsons.|$|E

5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} a {{position}} to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and <b>observed</b> <b>the</b> action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E

The Hussars reported German tanks heading towards Villers-Bocage, but Lieutenant Charles Pearce, of 4th CLY, thought that these were probably self-propelled guns.|$|E
