5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion as most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> is wasted as heat, {{and the rest}} while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse {{as much as one}} fifth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E

Second-order phase transitions are continuous in the first derivative (the order parameter, which is <b>the</b> first derivative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free <b>energy</b> with respect to the external field, is continuous across the transition) but exhibit discontinuity in a second derivative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free <b>energy.</b> These include <b>the</b> ferromagnetic phase transition in materials such as iron, where the magnetization, which is <b>the</b> first derivative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free <b>energy</b> with respect to the applied magnetic field strength, increases continuously from zero as the temperature is lowered below the Curie temperature.
