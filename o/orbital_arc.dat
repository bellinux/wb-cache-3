500|$|Sedna (provisionally {{designated}} [...] ) {{was discovered}} by Michael Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory), and David Rabinowitz (Yale University) on 14 November 2003. The discovery formed part of a survey begun in 2001 with the Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California using Yale's 160-megapixel Palomar Quest camera. On that day, an object was observed to move by 4.6 arcseconds over 3.1 hours relative to stars, which indicated that its distance was about 100AU. Follow-up observations in November–December 2003 with the SMARTS telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile {{as well as with}} the Tenagra IV telescope at the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii revealed that the object was moving along a distant highly eccentric orbit. Later, the object was precovered on older images made by the Samuel Oschin telescope as well as on images from the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking consortium. These previous positions expanded its known <b>orbital</b> <b>arc</b> and allowed a more precise calculation of its orbit.|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} {{model of}} Venusian global gravity has been obtained by fitting an eighteenth-degree and eighteenth-order spherical harmonic series to 78 <b>orbital</b> <b>arcs</b> of high altitude (950 - 1350 km at periapsis) tracking data and 351 <b>orbital</b> <b>arcs</b> of lower-altitude (150 - 200 km at periapsis) {{data from the}} Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO). Compared to a recently published tenth-degree model of Mottinger et al. (1985), {{which is based on}} the 78 high-altitude arcs only, the current model provides a significant improvement in resolution and fidelity. As a measure of this improvement, it is noted that for the low-altitude arcs alone, the variance of the residuals for the present model is reduced to 19 percent of the data variance, compared to 51 percent for the tenth-degree model. Venus differs significantly from the earth in that it exhibits a significant correlation between long-wavelength topography and gravity. The gravity/topography spectral admittances are inconsistent with either Airy or Pratt isostasy, but are consistent with dynamic support by mantle convection...|$|R
40|$|The {{atmosphere}} is constantly in motion. The changing gravitational force {{due to the}} air mass movement will slightly perturb the orbit of a satellite. As the instrument accuracy for geodetic satellites improves, failure to model this perturbation can result in significant systematic errors in the orbit determination. The latter, in turn, will degrade the Earth's gravity solutions. A direct modeling technique to analyze the atmospheric gravitational influence on geodetic satellite is developed. We use the global surface pressure data from the ECMWF Initial Analysis Database to compute the gravitational force due to atmospheric perturbation exerted on given satellite {{as a function of}} time during selected <b>orbital</b> <b>arcs.</b> Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) tracking data for selected Starlette (altitude 900 km) <b>orbital</b> <b>arcs</b> are used to test the computed force model. Although only a slight reduction in the rms residuals is observed when the atmospheric gravitational perturbation is included in the force model for data reduction of the SLR data, significant improvement is obtained in the predictability of the satellite orbit. Comprehensive studies involving more definitive test criteria and more refined models are still needed...|$|R
40|$|The first {{geodetic}} survey across the northern Caribbean plate boundary zone with GPS {{was conducted in}} June 1986. Baseline vectors defined by the six-station regional GPS network ranged from 170 to 1260 km in length. Repeatability of independent daily baseline estimates was better than 8 mm plus 1. 3 parts in 10 to the 8 th of baseline length for horizontal components. The wet tropospheric path delay during the experiment was both high, sometimes exceeding 30 cm at zenith, and variable, sometimes exceeding 5 cm variation over several hours. Successful carrier phase cycle ambiguity resolution (bias fixing) could not be achieved prior to construction of a regional troposphere model. With optimum troposphere treatment and single-day <b>orbital</b> <b>arcs,</b> most biases on baselines were resolved up to about 550 km in length. With multiday <b>orbital</b> <b>arcs</b> most biases in the network were resolved regardless of baseline length. The results suggest that constraints on plate-boundary zone deformation in the Greater Antilles, and on the North America-Caribbean relative plate motion vector, can be obtained {{with a series of}} GPS experiments spanning less than 10 and 15 years, respectively...|$|R
