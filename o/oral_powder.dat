40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>oral</b> Sanhuangwuji <b>powder,</b> anti-rheumatic drugs (ARDs), and ginger-partitioned acupoint stimulation at Zusanli (ST 36) on the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) complicated by peptic ulcer. MethodsThis prospective randomized controlled study included 180 eligible inpatients and outpatients randomly assigned to an ARD treatment (n = 60), ginger-partitioned stimulation (n = 60), or combination treatment (n = 60). Patients assigned to the ARD group were given oral celecoxib, methotrexate, and esomeprazole. Patients assigned to theginger-partitioned stimulation group were given ginger-partitioned acupoint stimulation at Zusanli (ST 36) {{in addition to the}} ARDs. Patients in the combination treatment group were given <b>oral</b> Sanhuangwuji <b>powder,</b> ginger-partitioned acupoint stimulation at Zusanli (ST 36), and ARDs. All patients were followed up for 2 months to evaluate clinical effects and safety. The study was registered in the World Health Organization database at the General Hospital of Chengdu Military Area Command PLA (ChiCTR-TCC 12002824). ResultsThe combination treatment group had significantly greater improvements in RA symptoms, laboratory outcomes, and gastrointestinal symptom scores, compared with the other groups (P < 0. 05). The peptic ulcer healing rate in the combination treatment group was significantly greater than that in the ARD treatment group (χ 2 = 16. 875, P < 0. 05) and the ginger-partitioned stimulation group(χ 2 = 6. 171, P < 0. 05). ConclusionsCombination treatment with ginger-partitioned acupoint stimulation at Zusanli (ST 36), <b>oral</b> Sanhuangwuji <b>powder,</b> and ARDs had a better clinical effect for RA with complicated peptic ulcer, compared with ARD treatmentalone or in combination with ginger-partitioned acupoint stimulation...|$|R
40|$|The paper briefly {{illustrates}} several approaches {{applied in}} delivering particulate drugs as powders. Microparticulate drug powders {{are difficult to}} manipulate with respect to dosage form preparation, particularly when they have very small size as this leads to poor flow and packing properties. When the dosage form performance resides {{on the presence of}} individual intact drug particles, the particle characteristics have to be retained in their original state, i. e., not altered during manufacturing and/or within the dosage form. There are several examples of dry powder dosage forms intended for different administration routes whose performance is strictly dependent on particle characteristics. In addition, the preparation of the finished dosage form is dependent on powder properties. The paper addresses dry powder formulations with special focus on <b>oral</b> <b>powders</b> mainly for elderly people or children, nasal powders and inhalation dry powders. These dosage forms are very attractive for both researchers and companies. Their formulation requires deep investigation, mainly in order to define particle structure and performance.

40|$|Purpose: Fenretinide [N-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4 -HPR) ] is a {{cytotoxic}} retinoid that {{suffers from}} a wide interpatient variation in bioavailability when delivered orally in a corn oil capsule. The poor bioavailability of the capsule formulation may have limited responses in clinical trials, and the large capsules are not suitable for young children. To {{support the hypothesis that}} a novel organized lipid matrix, LYM-X-SORB, can increase the oral bioavailability of fenretinide, fenretinide in LYM-X-SORB matrix and in a powderized LYM-X-SORB formulation was delivered to mice. Experimental Design: Fenretinide was delivered orally to mice as the contents of the corn oil capsule, in LYM-X-SORB matrix (4 -HPR/LYM-X-SORB matrix) or in a LYM-X-SORB matrix powderized with sugar and flour (4 -HPR/LYM-X-SORB <b>oral</b> <b>powder).</b> Levels of 4 -HPR, and its principal metabolite, N-(4 -methoxyphenyl) retinamide, were assayed in plasma and tissues. Results: In a dose-responsive manner, from 120 to 360 mg/kg/d, delivery to mice of 4 -HPR in LYM-X-SORB matrix, or as 4 -HPR/LYM-X-SORB <b>oral</b> <b>powder,</b> increased 4 -HPR plasma levels up to 4 -fold (P < 0. 01) and increased tissue levels up to 7 -fold (P < 0. 01) compared with similar doses of 4 -HPR delivered using capsule contents.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the competency level of mothers while preparing and scaling <b>oral</b> <b>powder</b> antibiotics (OPA) for their childrens's use. Material and Method: This descriptive study was carried out on 99 mothers while they bought prescribed OPA for their children from a pharmacy in Istanbul. The method of OPA preparation of each mother was observed. The amount of the prepared suspension was measured with 10 ml glass pipettes. Measured doses in the range of ± 1 ml of the prescribed dose were accepted as the correct dose. Results: Twenty-seven point three percent of the mothers' measurements were underscaled and 2 % of their measurements were overscaled compared to the required amounts (p< 0. 001). High educational status and using a syringe for scaling was found to be related with a correct dose measurement of OPA. Consclusion: We conclude that mothers who participated in this study were not able to prepare OPA appropriately, with less than or over the required dose. We suggest that physicians should encourage mothers to use syringes for accurate measurement...|$|E

40|$|Study objectives: To characterise {{the drug}} use pattern and {{prescription}} profile of extemporaneous formulations in Portuguese hospitals. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed over two months, in {{a convenience sample}} of six hospital pharmacy services. Results: A total of 52 extemporaneous formulations were dispensed to 303 paediatric patients. Most patients were children aged 1 - 12 years (49. 2 %). Premature babies and neonates accounted for 11. 2 %. Differences were not found between the proportion of male and female patients across the age groups (p = 0. 785). Analysing the frequency distribution between patients aged under and over one year, and the patient's setting (i. e. inpatients or outpatients), it was verified that there was a high proportion of inpatients aged under one year (65. 4 %) compared with those aged over one year (34. 6 %) (p = 0. 001). Eleven extemporaneous formulations were compounded by either crushing tablets or opening capsules, using the ingredients of the original medicine licensed for adults (63. 6 %), or from raw materials (36. 4 %). A total of 41 <b>oral</b> <b>powders</b> were prepared extemporaneously, of which the majority (39) were prepared from licensed tablets or capsules. The resulting powder was then redistributed in powder papers, each containing a smaller quantity. Folic acid powder papers were the most frequently prepared extemporaneously (14. 7 %). Where compounding is concerned, striking differences between hospitals were evident. In relation to four medicines formulated in all the hospitals studied, significant discrepancies were found in the compounding methods used. Conclusion: Although not the optimal solution, extemporaneous formulations allow the use of medicines in clinical practice when no other alternative exists. However, improvements have to be made, namely in the synchronisation of compounding practices and availability of paediatric formulations...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{immunosuppressant}} tacrolimus {{is usually}} administered orally. When {{this is not}} feasible, other routes of administration may be useful. Previous research suggested that tacrolimus may be applied sublingually or rectally. Pharmacokinetic data are sparse. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate and compare the pharmacokinetics of these alternative formulations with orally administered tacrolimus. Methods: Three single, fixed-dose formulations of tacrolimus were administered in a random sequence in 18 healthy subjects, using a cross-over study design. For sublingual administration, 3 mg of powder obtained from oral capsules was applied under the tongue for a period of 15 min without swallowing, with mouth rinsing afterwards. For rectal administration, a suppository containing 15 mg of the <b>oral</b> <b>powder</b> was used. Oral administration consisted of 7 mg of instant-release tacrolimus capsules (Prograf). Main pharmacokinetic outcome parameters were compared by anova. Results: Sublingual administration showed no clinically significant exposure, contrary to rectal administration, where all subjects had clinically relevant exposure, with a lower relative bioavailability (78 %), a lower maximal blood concentration and a later time of maximal blood concentration compared with oral administration. Conclusions: Sublingual administration of a single dose of tacrolimus does not result in systemic exposure if care is taken not to swallow saliva and to rinse the oral cavity afterwards. Rectal administration of tacrolimus results in clinically relevant systemic exposure and might represent an alternative formulation in case oral administration is not feasible. When used as a topical agent, systemic side-effects should be considered...|$|E

The retention of phosphate (P) and increased fibroblast growth factor- 23 levels are common, even at early stages of CKD, due to disturbances in normal P homeostasis. Later, hyperphosphatemia appears, which has also been strongly associated with high mortality rates linked to P-mediated cardiovascular and procalcifying effects. Treatment guidelines for these patients continue to be poorly implemented, at least partially {{due to the lack}} of adherence to a P-restricted diet and P-binder therapy. Calcium-free P binders, such as lanthanum carbonate, have been associated with a decreased progression of vascular calcification, rendering them an important therapeutic alternative for these high cardiovascular risk CKD patients. Lanthanum carbonate has typically been available as chewable tablets, and the new presentation as an <b>oral</b> <b>powder</b> may provide a useful alternative in the therapeutic armamentarium. This powder is a tasteless, odorless, and colorless semisolid compound miscible with food. In a recent study in healthy individuals, the safety and efficacy of this novel form were evaluated, and it was concluded that it is well tolerated and pharmacodynamically equivalent to the chewable form. In the long run, individualization of preferences and treatments seems an achievable goal prior to final demonstration of improvements in hard outcomes in wide clinical trials in CKD patients.

40|$|Background: The medical {{management}} of hemorrhoids should include an integrated approach. This integrated {{approach can be}} achieved by polyherbal formulations containing anti-inflammatory, styptics, analgesics, and laxative effect which reduce inflammation, pain, and bleeding, and increase gastro-intestinal motility and soften stools. One such polyherbal kit is "Arshkeyt™, a 7 day kit," which consists of <b>oral</b> tablets and <b>powder</b> along with topical cream. Objective: Efficacy and safety of Arshkeyt™, a 7 day kit, a marketed polyherbal formulation was evaluated in comparison with conventional therapy practiced in surgery outpatient departments. Materials and Methods: Patients (n = 90) with hemorrhoids were randomly allocated to receive either Arshkeyt™ or standard therapy (combination of <b>oral</b> Isabgul <b>powder</b> and 2 % lidocaine gel) for 14 days. Assessment on the basis of rectal symptoms and proctoscopic examination was done on day 0, 7, and 14 to derive a "composite score" which ranged from 0 to 25 by a blinded evaluator. The primary endpoint was number of patients achieving composite score 0 at the end of therapy (day 14). Inter-group analysis was done using Chi-square test. Results: On day 14, the composite score of 0 was achieved in 15 patients of Arshkeyt™ group versus 6 patients receiving standard therapy. The symptoms and signs which showed significant improvement in Arshkeyt™ group compared to standard treatment group were the tenesmus (visual analog score) score (P = 0. 047), anal sphincter spasm (P = 0. 0495) and a decrease in the grade of hemorrhoids (P = 0. 0205) on day 14. Arshkeyt™ was also more beneficial in case of bleeding hemorrhoids as compared to nonbleeding hemorrhoids (P < 0. 05). The incidence of adverse drug reactions in both groups was comparable and no patient required any treatment for the same.

40|$|Ninety-one Swiss veal farms {{producing}} under a label {{with improved}} welfare standards were visited between August and December 2014 to investigate risk {{factors related to}} antimicrobial drug use and mortality. All herds consisted of own and purchased calves, with a median of 77. 4 % of purchased calves. The calves' mean age was 29 ± 15 days at purchasing and the fattening period lasted at average 120 ± 28 days. The mean carcass weight was 125 ± 12 kg. A mean of 58 ± 33 calves were fattened per farm and year, and purchased calves were bought from a mean of 20 ± 17 farms of origin. Antimicrobial drug treatment incidence was calculated with the defined daily dose methodology. The mean treatment incidence (TIADD) was 21 ± 15 daily doses per calf and year. The mean mortality risk was 4. 1 %, calves died at a mean age of 94 ± 50 days, and the main causes of death were bovine respiratory disease (BRD, 50 %) and gastro-intestinal disease (33 %). Two multivariable models were constructed, for antimicrobial drug treatment incidence (53 farms) and mortality (91 farms). No quarantine, shared air space for several groups of calves, and no clinical examination upon arrival at the farm were associated with increased antimicrobial treatment incidence. Maximum group size and weight differences > 100 kg within a group were associated with increased mortality risk, while vaccination and beef breed were associated with decreased mortality risk. The majority of antimicrobial treatments (84. 6 %) were given as group treatments with <b>oral</b> <b>powder</b> fed through an automatic milk feeding system. Combination products containing chlortetracycline with tylosin and sulfadimidine or with spiramycin were used for 54. 9 %, and amoxicillin for 43. 7 % of the oral group treatments. The main indication for individual treatment was BRD (73 %). The mean age at the time of treatment was 51 days, corresponding to an estimated weight of 80 - 100 kg. Individual treatments were mainly applied through injections (88. 5 %), and included administration of fluoroquinolones in 38. 3 %, penicillines (amoxicillin or benzylpenicillin) in 25. 6 %, macrolides in 13. 1 %, tetracyclines in 12. 0 %, 3 th and 4 th generation cephalosporines in 4. 7 %, and florfenicol in 3. 9 % of the cases. The present study allowed for identifying risk factors for increased antimicrobial drug treatment and mortality.

40|$|Although PIs are {{relatively}} new, several generic drugs {{are already being}} produced by companies operating in countries with cheaper production capabilities and less stringent good manufacturing practice (GMP). So far, no methods {{have been published in}} the scientific literature for assay and purity control of PIs, but a few monographs are published in official compendia. The aim of this research was to {{contribute to the development of}} analytical methods and specifications for Int. Ph. monographs for selected PIs: IDV, SQV, SQVM and NFV(M). These are made available worldwide to control generic drugs at different levels (step-wise strategy). A recently adopted approach to provide alternative, simple tests in the Int. Ph. was implemented. This helps many laboratories in developing countries which do not have access to the more sophisticated techniques such as LC. In this work, complete monographs of IDV, SQV(M) and NFVM for implementation in the Int. Ph. were developed. These monographs have been adopted by the Expert Committee on Specifications for Pharmaceutical Preparations for inclusion in or addition to the 4 th edition of the Int. Ph. In general, chapters 2 to 4 are assigned to a particular PI and divided into: introduction, development/optimization of an LC method for purity control, development of assay methods and the monograph text proposed for inclusion in the Int. Ph. together with the results obtained for the analysis of various commercial samples. Special attention was given to evaluate already existing LC methods. The best ones were used as starting point for further method development. System suitability tests (SSTs) were developed by degradation of the respective sample solution. Since no brand names of LC stationary phases are mentioned in official monographs, the suitability of a set of similar columns towards the separation of PIs from their respective impurities was investigated based on the proposed SSTs and the chromatographic response factor (CRF). Finally, a relation was made with the column classification system developed in our laboratory. The LC method proposed for IDV separates well the main component from its impurities in bulk drug substances. Two related substances could be identified while three other remained unknown. A Hypersil BDS C 18 (25 cm x 4. 6 mm I. D.) 5 µm column was used for method development. Gradient elution was applied with mobile phases containing acetonitrile-sodium phosphate buffer pH 7. 5 -water (A: 30 : 5 : 65 v/v/v) and (B: 60 : 5 : 35 v/v/v). UV detection was performed at 220 nm. The column was kept in a water bath at 40 °C. The choice of a base-deactivated C 18 column (Hypersil BDS) allowed to achieve a better peak shape compared to a classical C 18 column. It was observed that end-capping could be an additional advantage to select a suitable stationary phase. The LC method proposed for SQV(M) was also developed using a Hypersil BDS C 18 (25 cm x 4. 6 mm I. D.) 5 µm column. It shows a good separation of the principal peak from its impurities by applying gradient elution. Mobile phase A consisted of 50 volumes of a mixture of acetonitrile-methanol (5 : 2 v/v), 15 volumes of sodium phosphate buffer pH 3. 4 and 35 volumes of water. Mobile phase B consisted of 70 volumes of acetonitrile, 15 volumes of sodium phosphate buffer pH 3. 4 and 15 volumes of water. UV detection was performed at 220 nm. The stationary phase was kept in a water bath at 30 °C. The Int. Ph. prescribes two SSTs. However, after evaluation of several columns, SST 2 was found to be not relevant and SST 1 also does not always provide the required information. A solution would be the use of reference substances or reference samples, but this is difficult to realize in the Int. Ph. context. It also illustrates that a SST, developed on a single brand of stationary phase, does not allow to adequately distinguish between suitable and non suitable columns. The best separation for the analysis of SQV(M) and its impurities was achieved on end-capped columns. A similar approach was used for NFVM. The main compound could be separated from 12 related substances on a Hypersil BDS C 18 column with gradient elution using mobile phases containing acetonitrile-methanol-sodium phosphate buffer pH 3. 4 -water (A: 27 : 20 : 28 : 25 v/v/v/v) and (B: 41 : 31 : 28 : 0 v/v/v/v). UV detection was performed at 225 nm. The column was kept in a water bath at 35 °C. Also here, the limitations of the SST test were experienced. The use of end-capped columns can improve the selection of a suitable column. From the separations discussed above, it is clear that the prescription of a base-deactivated and/or end-capped column in a monograph is not easy. Procedures in base-deactivation and end-capping vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and they do not provide much information how these modifications are done. As a consequence, it is difficult to assess the properties of a column based only on the information provided by them. The column characterization and classification procedure as developed by the laboratory for Pharmaceutical Analysis, indicated to be a helpful tool for this kind of problems since 4 chromatographic parameters can be used to describe a column. For each of the separations, a robustness study was performed by means of an experimental design. The proposed methods were found to be robust, except for NFVM where the pH of the buffer should be monitored carefully to ensure the best separation for the different peak pairs. Commercial samples from different origin were examined using the proposed monographs. Beside methods for the analysis of the active drug substances, methods for the analysis of SQVM and NFVM drug products (dosage forms) were also proposed in the respective chapters.

40|$|Background: Complementary and {{alternative}} medicines {{are used by}} many consumers, and increasingly are being incorporated into the general practitioner's armamentarium. Despite widespread usage, the evidence base for most complementary therapies is weak or non-existent. Post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis is a common problem in general practice, for which complementary therapies are often used.

40|$|Because the {{potential}} impact of habitual caffeine intake on blood pressure is a controversial issue, a study was carried out to explore the relationship between caffeine and various humoral factors that could account for a coffee-induced rise in blood pressure. Twenty-three hypertensive patients who refrained from caffeine for 2 to 3 weeks were given 250 mg <b>oral</b> caffeine <b>powder</b> dissolved in water. Blood pressure was recorded every 15 min by blood pressure monitor. Caffeine blood level, renin and endothelin were measured before and 1, 2, 3, and 6 h after caffeine intake. Urinary electrolytes and catecholamines were measured under caffeine influence (period I), and for the next 6 h (period II). A significant increase in systolic (P 5. 017) and diastolic blood pressure (P 5. 023) occurred in 13 subjects who were 58 6 10. 4 years old. Nonresponders were younger (44. 5 6 15. 8 years). A statistically significant decrease in heart rate was seen during the first hour after caffeine intake in both responders (P 5. 008) and nonresponders (P 5. 004). Marked diuresis and natriuresis were observed during period I in both groups. Renin and endothelin levels were unchanged. Although chronic studies point to development of tolerance to long-term caffeine ingestion, acute studies like the one described are essential to obtain data on the immediate effects that can be of practical importance, especially in the elderly.

40|$|Cold-chain requirements, limited {{stockpiling}} {{potential and}} the lack of potent immune responses are major challenges of parenterally formulated influenza vaccines. Decreased cold chain dependence and stockpiling can be achieved if vaccines are formulated in a dry state using suitable excipients and drying technologies. Furthermore, having the vaccine in a dry state enables the development of non-parenteral patient friendly dosage forms: microneedles for transdermal administration, tablets for <b>oral</b> administration, and <b>powders</b> for epidermal, nasal or pulmonary administration. Moreover, these administration routes have the potential to elicit an improved immune response. This review highlights the rationale for the development of dried influenza vaccines, as well as processes used for the drying and stabilization of influenza vaccines; it also compares the immunogenicity of dried influenza vaccines administered via non-invasive routes with that of parenterally administered influenza vaccines.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effect of Sancaijiangtang powders on plasma nitric oxide and endothelin- 1 levels. We sought to {{identify}} the common pathological link and mechanism of action for Traditional Chinese medicine in type 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular dementia, and to explicate the material basis for treating the different diseases with the same method in Traditional Chinese Medicine. MethodsIn total, 168 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular dementia {{were enrolled in the}} study, and randomly divided into two groups by simple randomization. Patients in the treatment group received <b>oral</b> Sancaijiangtang <b>powders</b> with pioglitazone hydrochloride three times daily, while patients in the control group received pioglitazone hydrochloride alone. The treatment course was for 12 weeks. Mini-mental state examinations (Chinese version) and Montreal Cognitive Assessments (Beijing version) were performed, and fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, hemoglobin A 1 c, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, plasma nitric oxide and endothelin- 1 levels were measured before and after the treatment. ResultsThe post-treatment levels for all measurements in both groups were better than pre-treatment levels (P < 0. 05). The post-treatment levels for all measurements in the treatment group were better than the levels measured in the control group (P < 0. 05). ConclusionType 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular dementia have common pathological mechanisms for insulin resistance and endothelium dysfunction. Sancaijiangtang powders could improve the release of nitric oxide and inhibit the secretion of endothelin- 1.

40|$|Herbs {{are used}} medicinally in {{different}} countries by around 80 % {{of people around the}} world, mostly in the developing countries. They are a source of many potent and powerful drugs, principally due to the common belief that they are without any side effects along with being economical and locally accessible. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) is an herb that grows anywhere around the world. Fenugreek {{is one of the oldest}} medicinal plants, originating in India and Northern Africa. Its dried seeds have a wide application as a flavoring additive and are good source of protein, fat, crude fiber, minerals and vitamins. In addition It has a broad spectrum of therapeutic properties. It has been used for numerous indications, including labor induction, aiding digestion, and as a general tonic to improve metabolism and health. Human and animal trials suggest possible hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemic properties of <b>oral</b> fenugreek seed <b>powder.</b> Mucilaginous fiber present in fenugreek seeds may bind bile acids to reduce cholesterol and fat absorption. The plant protein in fenugreek might exert a lipid lowering effect. Steroidal saponins, alkaloids and 4 -hydroxy-isoleucine may promote glucose metabolism and inhibit absorption of cholesterol.

To clarify their antidiabetic efficacy and hypoglycemic mechanisms, we treated streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with daily <b>oral</b> feeding of <b>powdered</b> Ipomoea batatas (5  g kg− 1 d− 1), Agaricus blazei (1  g kg− 1 d− 1) or Smallanthus sonchifolius (4  g kg− 1 d− 1) for 2 months. Treatments with Ipomoea batatas or Agaricus blazei, but not Smallanthus sonchifolius, significantly suppressed the increases of fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A 1 c levels, and restored body weight loss during diabetes. Serum insulin levels after oral glucose administration tests increased along the treatments of Ipomoea batatas or Agaricus blazei. Moreover, Ipomoea batatas and Agaricus blazei reduced superoxide production from leukocytes and vascular homogenates, serum 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine, and vascular nitrotyrosine formation of diabetic rats to comparable levels of normal control animals. Stress- and inflammation-related p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and tumor necrosis factor-α production of diabetic rats were significantly depressed by Ipomoea batatas administration. Histological examination also exhibited improvement of pancreatic β-cells mass after treatments with Ipomoea batatas or Agaricus blazei. These results suggest that hypoglycemic effects of Ipomoea batatas or Agaricus blazei result from their suppression of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production followed by improvement of pancreatic β-cells mass...|$|R

40|$|Artemisinin, {{a poorly}} {{water-soluble}} antimalarial drug, presents a low and erratic bioavailability upon oral administration. The {{aim of this}} work was to study an agglomerated powder dosage form for oral administration of artemisinin based on the artemisinin/β-cyclodextrin primary microparticles. These primary microparticles were prepared by spray-drying a water–methanol solution of artemisinin/β-cyclodextrin. β-Cyclodextrin in spray-dried microparticles increased artemisinin water apparent solubility approximately sixfold. The thermal analysis evidenced {{a reduction in the}} enthalpy value associated with drug melting, due to the decrease in drug crystallinity. The latter was also evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction analysis, while 13 C-NMR analysis indicated the partial complexation with β-cyclodextrin. Agglomerates obtained by sieve vibration of spray-dried artemisinin/β-cyclodextrin primary microparticles exhibited free flowing and close packing properties compared with the non-flowing microparticulate powder. The in vitro dissolution rate determination of artemisinin from the agglomerates showed that in 10 min about 70 % of drug was released from the agglomerates, whereas less than 10 % of artemisinin was dissolved from raw material <b>powder.</b> <b>Oral</b> administration of agglomerates in rats yielded higher artemisinin plasma levels compared to those of pure drug.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesElizabeth G. DavisObjective: To {{determine}} pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic {{properties of}} oral dexamethasone solution and powder compared to intravenous dexamethasone solution in healthy horses. Animals: 6 horses, 13 - 27 years if age, 385 - 630 kg Procedures: In a randomized, cross-over block design six healthy adult horses each received the following treatments 1) dexamethasone solution IV 0. 05 mg/kg, 2) dexamethasone solution orally (PO) 0. 05 mg/kg, and 3) dexamethasone powder PO 0. 05 mg/kg {{all in the}} fed and fasted state. Each horse acted as an untreated control as secretion of cortisol was monitored for normal circadian rhythm. Quantification of plasma dexamethasone concentration and serum cortisol activity was determined by LC/MS and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Results: Each horse exhibited a circadian rhythm in cortisol secretion; however there was variation present between each horse. Mean cortisol concentrations at 6 : 00 AM and 8 : 00 AM {{were significantly higher than}} concentrations at 8 : 00 PM and 10 : 00 PM. Cortisol concentrations were significantly less than base-line starting 1 hour post-administration of dexamethasone through 72 hours for the fasted treatment groups, and 2 hours through 48 hours for the fed groups. Pharmacokinetic modeling resulted in a two compartment model for the IV administration with elimination from the central compartment, and a one compartment model for orally administered dexamethasone. <b>Oral,</b> fasted, compounded <b>powder</b> achieved a significantly higher maximum concentration (Cmax) than both fasted and fed oral dexamethasone solutions. The AUC 0 inf for the orally administered compounded powder was significantly different when comparing fasted versus fed treatment groups. Bioavailability ranged between 33 % and 70 % among treatment groups, but due to the high variability there was not a significant difference. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Hospitalization of the horses did not have an effect on their circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion. Oral and intravenous administration of dexamethasone resulted in adrenal suppression with cortisol concentrations returning to base-line 48 - 72 hours post-administration. Although bioavailability was variable cortisol suppression was similar among all treatment groups. The variability in oral absorption will need to be taken in to account for oral dosing of dexamethasone...|$|R
