25|$|The role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> in Malian warfare changed {{dramatically}} after {{the reign of}} Sundjata from mere baggage handler to full-fledged warriors. A sofa was equipped by the state, whereas the horon brought their weapons. Sofa armies {{could be used to}} intimidate unfaithful governors, and they formed a majority of the infantry by the 15th century. So though imperial Mali was initially a horon-run army, its reliance on jonow as administrators (farimba) and officers (dùùkùnàsi) gradually transformed the character of its military.|$|E

25|$|The second series, Ben Harper, {{husband and}} father to three {{different}} and often difficult children, has spent his working life as a dentist. Just {{as well as most}} of his life seems rather like pulling teeth. His wife Susan is usually busy showing foreign tourists around London, a place she knows much better than her own kitchen. Ben and Susan have been married happily enough to have three children. However, Ben has the feeling that most of the time his children seem to speak a different language. Nick (20) has persuaded his parents he would benefit from a gap year to see something of the world, but he has hardly seen anything beyond the confines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> Janey (17) is into boys, fashion labels (expensive ones), and getting her own way. Michael (14) is the brightest of the trio. He is seriously into computers and not so seriously (yet) into girls.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{noted that}} the {{majority}} of the film was shot indoors, where oblong sets, corridors, and small spaces manifest constriction and tightness, in contrast to the usual emphasis on sweep and majesty in historical dramas. Hooper used wide shots to capture the actors' body language, particularly Geoffrey Rush, who trained at L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris and [...] "is consequently brilliant in the way he carries his body". Hooper widened his scope first to capture Rush's gestures, then full body movements and silhouettes. The approach carried over to Firth as well. In the first consultation scene, the Duke is squeezed against the end of a long couch framed against a large wall, [...] "as if to use the arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> as a kind of friend, as a security blanket?" [...] Martin Filler praised the [...] "low-wattage" [...] cinematography of Danny Cohen, as making everything look like it has been [...] "steeped in strong tea".|$|E

40|$|Component {{software}} {{construction has}} been a very intensively researched branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nowadays software engineering discipline because {{it seems to be the}} best answer to the increasing demands on complexity, reliability, maintainability and configurability of software systems which is due to its ability to integrate all these otherwise contradictory requirements. Therefore, a lot of component frameworks have emerged recently, often as results of theoretical studies in this field. SOFA/DCUP component model that has been founded and developed by the Distributed Systems Research Group at Charles University in Prague belongs to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most promising ones. This thesis contributes to this project by analyzing <b>the</b> assets <b>of</b> incorporating inheritance into each of three main abstractions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SOFA's</b> component specification language CDL, analyzing various inheritance mechanisms how they suit needs of each of those three abstractions and proposing and elaborating the particular inheritance mechanisms that suit best. Also, some other issues concerning SOFA/DCUP, inheritance, programming languages and component software have been discussed in this work...|$|R
500|$|Kogen {{commented that}} Lisa and Marge episodes [...] "tend {{to be the}} better episodes", {{because they are more}} {{thought-out}} and have more emotional depth to them. However, they are harder to write than other episodes because they are [...] "less jokey." [...] The writers therefore made the decision to replace Marge's role with Homer, who tends to be funnier than Marge. Jean commented that because he has a daughter, Homer–Lisa episodes are easier for him to write and he [...] "always want to work on them." [...] Moore said they are his favorite episodes to direct, because [...] "the two most opposite characters in the cast finding some kind of common ground [...] That was always interesting." [...] In one scene, Homer makes Lisa sit on the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> so that she will not interrupt the game. Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa, recalls that many people at the table-read thought Homer was [...] "too harsh" [...] in the scene, but it ended up being included in the episode anyway.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of the {{apartment}} that Lewis and Haynes shared. Books and a vase lay strewn across the floor, while Lewis weeps in the corner and Haynes watches from a distance teary-eyed. The video switches to several other shots of Lewis singing the first verse, looking morose. In a third shot, Lewis is seen standing on a rooftop against the Los Angeles skyline dressed in a dark red crop top. Then the video switches to Lewis standing in front of projected images of the memorable times of her relationship with Haynes. Lewis and Haynes are seen sat at opposite ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> looking into the distance, spliced with more scenes of Lewis on the rooftop. The couple are seen during an awkward dinner before switching to images of the couple in bed together, seemingly happy. As the chorus kicks in for the first time, the couple are seen arriving at a party, with Lewis wearing an aqua-coloured dress with a portion of her midriff revealed, meanwhile Haynes wears a plaid shirt and jeans. Initially the couple are content, embracing guests but socialising separately and avoiding contact with each other. The camera switches between these and the earlier scenes of Lewis in front of projected images and the LA skyline throughout the chorus. As Lewis sings [...] "I'm a whole lot of trouble/ We're in a whole lot of trouble", she glances over to see Haynes flirting with another girl.|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying {{on the table in front}} of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E

40|$|Background The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II {{scoring system}} and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring system are widely used for {{critically}} ill patients. We evaluated whether APACHE II score and <b>SOFA</b> score predict <b>the</b> outcome for trauma patients {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU). Methods We retrospectively analyzed trauma patients admitted to the ICU in a single trauma center between January 2014 and December 2015. The APACHE II score was figured out based on the data acquired from the first 24 hours <b>of</b> admission; <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> score was evaluated based on the first 3 days in the ICU. A total of 241 patients were available for analysis. Injury Severity score, APACHE II score, and SOFA score were evaluated. Results The overall survival rate was 83. 4 %. The non-survival group had a significantly high APACHE II score (24. 1 ± 8. 1 vs. 12. 3 ± 7. 2, P < 0. 001) and SOFA score (7. 7 ± 1. 7 vs. 4. 3 ± 1. 9, P < 0. 001) at admission. <b>SOFA</b> score had <b>the</b> highest areas under the curve (0. 904). During the first 3 days, SOFA score remained high in the non-survival group. In the non-survival group, cardiovascular system, neurological system, renal system, and coagulation system scores were significantly higher. Conclusions In ICU trauma patients, both SOFA and APACHE II scores were good predictors <b>of</b> outcome, with <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> score being <b>the</b> most effective. In trauma ICU patients, the trauma scoring system should be complemented, recognizing that multi-organ failure is an important factor for mortality...|$|R

At its peak, it operated {{in three different}} zones (South-East, Central, and Baghdad). They performed {{a wide range of}} missions—prisoner interrogation at Camp Cropper and Camp Bucca in the American sector, reconnaissance and surveillance missions (Often involving Romanian Air Force RQ-7 Shadow UAVs) in the Polish sector, and training, peacekeeping missions, and base protection missions in the British sector. Romania also temporarily deployed a force of 130 soldiers to support UNAMI, a Coalition force in Iraq working under the authority of the United Nations. The force was deployed in March 2005, and withdrawn after six months. Romania reduced it, first to 501 by November 2008, and by early 2009, Romania had reduced its contingent to 350. They were stationed in Nasiriyah and Al-Kut. In an agreement signed with Iraqi Defense Minister Abdul Qader al-Ubeidi and the Romanian ambassador, Romania promised to withdraw its troops on July 31, 2009. It had been previously announced on November 6, 2008 that Romania would withdraw its then 501-strong contingent {{by the end of the}} year and leave a small group of advisers to assist the Iraqi authorities. In 2008, the president announced that the troops would stay until 2011. However, under the terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> agreement between the United States and Iraq, all non-US forces must leave Iraq prior to July 31, 2009. As a result, Romania decided to withdraw. Romania formally terminated its mission in Iraq on June 4, 2009, and pulled out its troops. On July 23, 2009 the last Romanian soldiers left Iraq. Three Romanian soldiers had been killed during their mission, and at least eight were wounded.|$|E

40|$|Experiences of {{participatory}} {{design with}} full-scale modelling in three case studies form <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> this work. When {{the participants in}} these studies visualised their dwellings {{there was a strong}} focus on <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> This piece <b>of</b> furniture is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most common in Swedish homes. It also requires much space. Additionally, the lay-people focused on different kinds of functional needs while sitting in <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> such as <b>the</b> possibility to watch the children play, {{to be able to see}} the television-screen, and to have a good view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outdoor environment. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> is <b>the</b> bearer <b>of</b> important aesthetic values and for some people even sentimental value. These findings raised the question what could be learned about different people’s relationship to their homes. The intention has been to improve professional practice of today concerning house design. In seven narratives individual “home-builders” describe <b>the</b> processes <b>of</b> developing their homes and especially <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> their <b>sofas.</b> Each story is reflected, using scientific theories and/or comparative studies. The approach is phenomenological. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> childhood <b>sofa</b> when arranging <b>the</b> home for the adult person is analysed from a psychoanalytical point of view. Another topic for discussion is what the effects are when <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> is considered both as a stage and a place for the audience. This affects <b>the</b> arrangements <b>of</b> every single space and practical living function. Being surrounded by old and dear objects, including sofas that require a special environment and treatment, gives rise to a discussion concerning which considerations that should be made in order to make room for aspects of sentimental value. During a lifetime people also experience different cultures and environments that have an impact on their priorities and way of living. Therefore life-styles and ways of life are dealt with in one chapter. People are not always, however, attached to <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> they already possess. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> moving to a new dwelling with new wallpaper and floor surfaces also raises the need to replace pieces of furniture such as <b>sofas.</b> <b>The</b> theme <b>of</b> replacement can thus be compared to <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> having a career. But <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> also has a career of its own. Very rarely used in the living-rooms less than fifty years ago it today seems to be the place where contemporary everyday life, including all kinds of activities, goes on. Finally, gender aspects could have been integrated in every single story. As a topic for discussion gender considerations are focused on in order to understand how requirements on house design change with a shift in sex roles. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis is to offer professional designers, i. e. architects, further means to reflect on what the demands and expectations are for contemporary Swedish house design...|$|R
