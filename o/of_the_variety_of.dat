5|$|A {{language}} {{which was}} the ancestor of Pochutec split from Proto-Nahuan (or Proto-Aztecan) possibly as early as AD 400, arriving in Mesoamerica a few centuries earlier than the main bulk of speakers of Nahuan languages. Some Nahuan groups migrated south along the Central American isthmus, reaching as far as Nicaragua. The critically endangered Pipil language of El Salvador is the only living descendant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> Nahuatl once spoken south of present-day Mexico.|$|E

The {{area around the}} pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes Scots pine, Cedar, Larch, Spruce, Oak, Beech, Chestnut, Willow, Lime, Holly and Maple. A variety of orchids including green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio) and southern marsh-orchids {{can be seen on}} the borders of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond {{the basic elements of}} his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} above the eastern cloister and was built between 1430 and 1508. Its {{collection}} is in three parts: early documents, housed in the Muniment Room; the collection predating 1800, housed in the Chained Library; and the post-1800 collection, housed in the Reading Room. The chapter's earlier collection was destroyed during the Reformation, so that the present library consists chiefly of early printed books, rather than medieval manuscripts. The earlier books, in the Chained Library, number 2,800 volumes and give an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> interests {{of the members of}} the cathedral chapter from the Reformation until 1800. The focus of the collection is predominantly theology but there are volumes on science, medicine, exploration, and languages. Books of particular interest include Pliny's Natural History printed in 1472, an Atlas of the World by Abraham Ortelius, printed in 1606 and a set of the works of Aristotle that once belonged to Erasmus. The library is open to the public at appointed times during summer and presents a small exhibition of documents and books.|$|E

25|$|Tourists often enjoy visiting {{and walking}} around shophouse districts because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> colours {{used in their}} facade decoration. Traditionally, many shophouses would have been {{plastered}} an off-white colour. Other popular early colours were indigo and ochre, given the range of available pigments. By the mid-20th century, pastel colours (rose pink, baby blue, light yellow, etc.) became popular, and they remain the colours that most people most strongly associate with these buildings. However, many contemporary or restored shophouses have now taken to using very bold colours, including deep reds, black, silver, gold, purple, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{area which}} {{is now known as}} Arno Bay was opened up by pastoralists in 1863, with the area being named 'Salt Creek Cove' in these early days. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> ventures that {{occurred}} before the town was built, the sinking of 'The Arno Bay Mine' was possibly the least successful, with water halting all operations. The small town was initially proclaimed in 1882 by G. H. Ayliffe under the name of 'Bligh', after Captain William Bligh, although locals resisted the name change, continually referring to the town as 'Arno Bay' until the official name change.|$|E
25|$|Despite these categorizations, miscellanies {{attempted}} {{to appeal to}} a wide audience by containing a variety of material for different tastes. Although an editor might orient the miscellany towards an intended audience, by nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> verse a much wider readership would have been possible. One-off, occasional miscellanies might prove popular and warrant further volumes or editions, such as political pamphlets (Poems on Affairs of State, 1689-1705), resort-based works (Tunbrigalia: or the Tunbridge Miscellany, 1712–40), local productions (The Yorkshire Garland, 1788), and courtly, coterie or collegiate collections (Thomas Warton’s The Oxford Sausage: or select poetical pieces written by the most celebrated wits of the University of Oxford, 1764-80).|$|E

25|$|The modern {{field of}} {{statistics}} {{emerged in the}} late 19th and early 20th century in three stages. The first wave, {{at the turn of}} the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> human characteristics – height, weight, eyelash length among others. Pearson developed the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, defined as a product-moment, the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution, among many other things. Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London.|$|E
25|$|Fragmented {{habitats}} due to urbanization, {{as well as}} disturbances to {{the environment}} from humans and introduced species, are harmful to most butterflies. Additionally, threats occur to local vegetation such as recreation, trampling of vegetation, fire regimes, and introduction of plant pathogens, which bring about changes to local plant community. Distribution of butterflies depends heavily on the site characteristics and the density of that species' host plants. Changing plant composition changes the distribution of most butterflies' range, isolating them to pockets where the vegetation is ideal. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> host plants used by Australian painted ladies, {{it has not been}} significantly affected by these changes. It has been found to use some species of carduine thistles, which are invasive to Australia, as host plants in New South Wales. Australian painted ladies use the plants as hosts during their larval stage, and as food sources. However, they inflict little damage to the plant.|$|E
500|$|Dickinson left {{no formal}} {{statement}} of her aesthetic intentions and, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> her themes, her work {{does not fit}} conveniently into any one genre. She has been regarded, alongside Emerson (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a Transcendentalist. However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson's [...] "relentlessly measuring mind ... deflates the airy elevation of the Transcendental". Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson's poetry frequently uses humor, puns, irony and satire.|$|E

Edge commented that [...] "laying, camouflaged, in short grass inches away from a patrolling enemy is a gripping twist on stealth," [...] while GameSpy criticized it as [...] "just a number to monitor and not a terribly interesting one." [...] Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> new features, GameSpot called it [...] "the most important and best implemented." [...] The game has also been criticized for its low frame rate, which {{has been reduced to}} 30 frame/s (compared with 60 frame/s in Sons of Liberty).|$|E
500|$|Rutgers-Newark English {{professor}} and poet Rachel Hadas described the poem as being [...] "rather slight" [...] although it [...] "is free of irony and self consciousness, except that little reference to fools like {{me at the}} end, which I find kind of charming". [...] Scholar Mark Royden Winchell points out that Kilmer's depiction of the tree indicates {{the possibility that he}} had several different people in mind because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> anthropomorphic descriptions. [...] Winchell posits that if the tree described were to be a single human being it would be [...] "an anatomically deformed one".|$|E
500|$|The Hippocratic Corpus (Latin: Corpus Hippocraticum) is a {{collection}} of around seventy early medical works from Alexandrian Greece. It is written in Ionic Greek. The question of whether Hippocrates himself was the author of any of the treatises in the corpus has not been conclusively answered, but current debate revolves around {{only a few of the}} treatises seen as potentially by him. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> subjects, writing styles and apparent date of construction, the Hippocratic Corpus could not have been written by one person (Ermerins numbers the authors at nineteen). The corpus came to be known by his name because of his fame, possibly all medical works were classified under 'Hippocrates' by a librarian in Alexandria. [...] The volumes were probably produced by his students and followers.|$|E
