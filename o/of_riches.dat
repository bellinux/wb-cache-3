5|$|A {{centre of}} {{religious}} discussions called Anubhava Mantapa ("Hall of experience") in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered {{to discuss their}} mystic experiences. Here, they expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called Vachanas. These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical and satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness <b>of</b> <b>riches,</b> rituals and book learning. Many of these poems are anonymous, but the authors are identifiable by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is invoked in the poem.|$|E
5|$|Grijalva's return aroused great {{interest}} in Cuba, and Yucatán {{was believed to be}} a land <b>of</b> <b>riches</b> waiting to be plundered. A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses. Hernán Cortés was placed in command, and his crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including Pedro de Alvarado, Cristóbal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz. Also aboard were Francisco de Montejo and Bernal Díaz del Castillo, veterans of the Grijalva expedition.|$|E
5|$|Margaery Tyrell {{is brought}} to meet the High Sparrow, who warns her {{to stay away from}} her life <b>of</b> <b>riches</b> and sin, and recounts his past of how, as a proud cobbler, he learned his wealth-guided pursuits were lies and that the shoeless poor were closer to the truth than anyone. He then takes Margaery to see Loras, who is {{breaking}} under the Sparrows' torture, and is willing to do anything to make it stop. Margaery realises that the High Sparrow is trying to use Loras to break her, and tells him to remain strong.|$|E

5|$|Although now 67 {{years old}} and in {{indifferent}} health, Bottomley tried to resurrect his business career. He raised sufficient capital {{to start a new}} magazine, John Blunt, as a rival to John Bull, but the new venture lasted {{little more than a year}} before closing, having lost money from the start. In September 1929 he began an overseas lecture tour, which failed utterly, as did an attempt at a British tour during which he was received with indifference or hostility. By 1930 he was again bankrupt; his wife Eliza died that year, after which Bottomley's former son-in-law Jefferson Cohn evicted him from The Dicker. For the remaining years of his life he lived with his long-time mistress, the actress Peggy Primrose, whom Bottomley, in his years <b>of</b> <b>riches,</b> had vainly tried to promote to stardom.|$|E
5|$|The {{center of}} the {{political}} power of the Tang was the capital city of Chang'an (modern Xi'an), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, acrobatic stunts, poetry, paintings, and dramatic theater performances. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts <b>of</b> <b>riches</b> and resources to spare. When the Chinese prefectural government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of municipal construction to build every visiting official his own private mansion in the capital.|$|E

25|$|Thirdly, covetousness is {{the third}} worldly evil, which {{is also known as}} lust. Colet calls this a plague that has {{overtaken}} many priests and blinded many. Many take part in the Church only for the hope <b>of</b> <b>riches</b> and promotions. Priests forget that they should be interested in the good they can do more than the amount <b>of</b> <b>riches</b> that they stand to gain. Paul called covetousness the root of all evils. From it, benefices stack up, including pensions and tithes. Colet states that: “every corruption, all the ruin of the Church, all the scandals of the world, come from the covetousness of priests”.|$|E

25|$|While local {{commerce}} was common, {{long range}} interchanges—generally maintained by Hebrew merchants—were rare and appreciated. Monetary circulation was scarce, composed mainly of old Suebi and Visigothic coinage {{known locally as}} solidos gallicianos. War and pillaging against the thriving Al-Andalus was also a very important source for the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>riches,</b> exotic items, and Muslim serfs. Later, pilgrimage of Christians from all over Europe to Santiago de Compostela brought not only riches, but also a range of continental innovations and trends, from shipbuilding, to new architectural styles such as Romanesque art.|$|E
25|$|During the Florida land {{boom of the}} 1920s, {{real estate}} sales took off as Americans {{discovered}} their automobiles and the paved Dixie Highway, which through no coincidence led {{to the foot of}} the Collins Bridge. There were less than 1,000year-round residents of Miami Beach in 1920. In the next five years, the resident population of the Miami Beach area grew 440%. People from all over the country flocked to South Florida in hopes of getting rich buying and selling real estate.

25|$|In {{the late}} 12th century, the Kalachuris {{successfully}} rebelled against their overlords, the Western Chalukyas, and annexed the capital Kalyani. During this turbulent period, a new religious faith called Veerashaivism (or Lingayatism) {{developed as a}} revolt against the existing social order of Hindu society. Some of the followers of this faith wrote literature called Vachana Sahitya ("Vachana literature") or Sharana Sahitya ("literature of the devotees") consisting of a unique and native form of poetry in free verse called Vachana. Basavanna (or Basava, 1134–1196), {{the prime minister of}} Kalachuri King Bijjala II, is generally regarded as the inspiration for this movement. Devotees gathered to discuss their mystic experiences at a centre for religious discussion called Anubhava Mantapa ("hall of experience") in Kalyani. Here, they expressed their devotion to God Shiva in simple vachana poems. These poems were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical, satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness <b>of</b> <b>riches,</b> rituals and book learning, displaying a dramatic quality reminiscent of the dialogues of Plato.|$|E
25|$|Prose was {{the medium}} {{chosen by the}} Virashaiva poets (also known as Lingayat) to write devotional poetry called Vachana Sahitya in the 12th century. They were led by such great saints as Basavanna (a {{minister}} {{in the court of}} Southern Kalachuri King Bijjala II), Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu. Over 200 Vachana poets (Vachanakara) have been recorded from this period, more than 30 of whom were woman poets. Vachanas are characterized as brief disconnected passages, each ending with one or more names of Shiva. The style was epigrammatical, parallelistic and elusive, dwelling on the vanity <b>of</b> <b>riches</b> and spiritual benefits of the worship of Shiva. These poems are still recited by Lingayat acharyas (priests). The poems have a section called Kalanjnana with a messianic forecast of the future mentioning the arrival of the ideal King Vira Vasanta Raya who would rebuild Kalyani, the geographical centre of the Lingayat movement and restore the Lingayat sect to its full glory. Other famous teachers were Sivalenka, Sripati Pandita, Mallikarjuna Paditaradhya. The five famous acharyas were Revanna Siddha, Marula Siddha, Panditaradhya, Ekorami Tande and Visvesvaracharya. Well-known vachana writers of the time were Chennabasava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, Kondaguli Kesiraja etc.|$|E
25|$|In 1741, {{the city}} {{received}} {{the title of}} “The Most Noble and Loyal City of Santa Fe de Minas de Guanajuato” and became an “intendencia” (province) in 1790 because of the abundance <b>of</b> <b>riches</b> coming from its mines. In the 18th century, it was the world’s leading silver extraction center, making it the richest city in Mexico {{for much of the}} early colonial period. The production of the La Valenciana mine alone affected the world economy, and made the counts of Valencianas {{one of the most powerful}} families in New Spain. The city was one of the richest and most opulent in New Spain in the 18th century. This wealth is manifested in its civil and religious architecture. The colonial architecture includes some of the best Baroque and Churrigueresque examples in the New Worldsuch as the Valenciana, Cata, and La Compañia (Jesuit) Churches, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guanajuato. Most constructions from this time are of pink or green sandstone. In the churches, the Baroque altars were gilded with gold from local mines. These structures have influence later buildings throughout central Mexico. According to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the La Compañia and La Valenciana churches are considered among the most beautiful examples of Baroque architecture in Central and South America.|$|E
