40|$|Biscuits are {{a popular}} baked cereal food much {{appreciated}} by consumers. In {{the last few}} years, cellulose derivatives have been successfully used as fat replacers in biscuits. In this way, not only is <b>the</b> total amount <b>of</b> fat reduced but also the saturated fatty acids and the trans fatty acids are eliminated. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} increase understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> functionality <b>of</b> different cellulose ether emulsions used as fat replacers in biscuits. For this purpose, three emulsions with different cellulose ethers were designed: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, methylcellulose and methylcellulose with greater methoxyl substitution (MCH). The microstructure and textural properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doughs</b> and biscuits prepared with these emulsions were studied and <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> cellulose types and glycerol as textural improver were also analysed. The results showed that <b>the</b> incorporation <b>of</b> glycerol in <b>the</b> <b>doughs</b> made with methylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose cellulose emulsions seems to make <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> softer, bringing <b>the</b> values closer to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control dough; however, this effect disappears once <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> is baked. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> glycerol {{does not seem to have}} an effect on <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doughs</b> and biscuits made using the methylcellulose with greater methoxyl substitution (MCH) emulsion.

25|$|According to the Talmud, the {{requirement}} to separate Challah from the dough was imposed on the owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dough,</b> not on the person who kneaded it; hence if the owner was not Jewish, even if the kneader was, Hafrashat Challah was not mandatory. The requirement {{does not apply to}} quantities of less than one omer, neither to bread prepared as animal feed nor to dough prepared from a flour derived from other cereal grains, excepting wheat, barley, oat (var. goatgrass), spelt, or rye (var. wild barley), which grains are obligated. Although the Biblical expression when you eat of the bread of the land might be understood as applying only to bread eaten in the Land of Israel, Rabbinic sources interpret that Hafrashat Challah should be observed in the Diaspora as well.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the minimum measure of challah is one twenty-fourth part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> (or {{in the case}} if the minimum amount subject to challah, about 2¼ ounces). If one makes dough for oneself or for a wedding banquet, the minimum is still one twenty-fourth (and no {{distinction}} is made based on volume of dough intended for private consumption). If one makes dough to sell in the market, the minimum is one forty-eighth. If dough is rendered unclean either unwittingly or by force of unavoidable circumstances, it is one forty-eighth, {{but if it was}} rendered unclean deliberately, it is one twenty-fourth, so that one who sins shall not profit from sin. The Mishnah taught that one cannot designate all of one's dough as challah, but must leave some that is not challah.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> model food {{systems is}} essential for designing new products with desired functionality. In order to address this issue, {{the present study was}} focused on mixtures consisting of 85 % potato starch and 15 % powdered eggs, gluten or soy protein concentrates. <b>The</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proteins used in admixture with starch had a decisive role on <b>the</b> rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batters and thermo-mechanical behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doughs.</b> <b>The</b> fundamental rheology tests indicated a solid like behavior with a strong cross-linked network for admixtures of starch with either gluten or soy, while starch - powdered egg batter showed a weak liquid like behavior. Observations made on gelling process highlighted the narrowed gelling temperatures domains for starch when mixed with proteins.

2500|$|Another major {{component}} of durum wheat is protein which plays {{a large role in}} pasta dough rheology. [...] Gluten proteins, which include monomeric gliadins and polymeric glutenin, make up the major protein component of durum wheat (about 7580%). As more water is added and shear stress is applied, gluten proteins take on an elastic characteristic and begin to form strands and sheets. The gluten matrix that results during forming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> becomes irreversibly associated during drying as the moisture content is lowered to form the dried pasta product.|$|E
2500|$|According to some Mishnaic contributors, the {{kneading}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> {{was done}} outside the sanctuary, but the baking was done inside, but others state {{that all the}} preparations were {{carried out in the}} Temple courtyard, and others in the house of Pagi, which according to Maimonides was very close to the Temple courtyard; no reason is given for these geographic distinctions, but the Gemara argues that the House of Garmu were responsible for baking the shewbread, and kept their methods and reasoning secret. [...] The Mishnah states that to replace the bread, two priests would enter the sanctuary ahead of another four priests carrying the replacement bread; the two priests without the bread would go to {{the southern end of the}} table, while those with the new bread would go to the northern end, and while the priests at the south removed the old bread from the table, it would be replaced with the new bread by the priests at the northern side, so that the bread would always be present.|$|E

6000|$|Bread I {{at first}} made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes, which I baked before my fire {{out of doors}} on a shingle {{or the end of}} a stick of timber sawed off in {{building}} my house; but it was wont to get smoked and to have a piny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last found a mixture of rye and Indian meal most convenient and agreeable. In cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession, tending and turning them as carefully as an Egyptian his hatching eggs. They were a real cereal fruit which I ripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths. I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making, consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive days and first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness of nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet, and travelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> which, it is supposed, taught the leavening process, and through the various fermentations thereafter, till I came to [...] "good, sweet, wholesome bread," [...] the staff of life. Leaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the spiritus which fills its cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved like the vestal fire--some precious bottleful, I suppose, first brought over in the Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still rising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land--this seed I regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at length one morning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which accident I discovered that even this was not indispensable--for my discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process--and I have gladly omitted it since, though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be, and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces. Yet I find it not to be an essential ingredient, and after going without it for a year am still {{in the land of the}} living; and I am glad to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottleful in my pocket, which would sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is simpler and more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than any other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances. Neither did I put any sal-soda, or other acid or alkali, into my bread. It would seem that I made it according to the recipe which Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ. [...] "Panem depsticium sic facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in mortarium indito, aquae paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene subegeris, defingito, coquitoque sub testu." [...] Which I take to mean,--"Make kneaded bread thus. Wash your hands and trough well. Put the meal into the trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly. When you have kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover," [...] that is, in a baking kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this staff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw none of it for more than a month.|$|E
