5|$|On 24 September, Souchon {{was made}} vice admiral and {{commander-in-chief}} of the Ottoman Navy. Two days later Enver ordered {{the closing of}} the Dardanelles to foreign shipping without the consultation of his advisers. This had an immediate effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> economy, as nearly half of the country's exports traveled through the straits.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Czar switched to service from Archangel to New York, but ran only sporadically through 1916. After the Russian Revolution, the East Asiatic Company suspended service <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> American Line, and transferred several ships, including Czar, to British registry. The British shipping controller initially placed the liner under the management of John Ellerman's Wilson Line, but Czar {{was transferred to the}} Cunard Line management by the end of 1917.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{elections}} to the First Duma (legislative assembly in the late Russian Empire), which were boycotted by the PPS, the National Democrats won 34 of the 55 seats allotted to Poland. Dmowski himself was elected a deputy to the Second and Third Dumas (beginning on 27 February 1907) and was president of the Polish caucus within it. He was seen as a conservative, and despite being a Polish caucus leader, he often had more influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> than the Polish deputies.|$|E

50|$|Unable to reorganise {{into their}} former formation, {{the army was}} ordered to charge. As they {{struggled}} up the slope a densely packed mass of Russian infantry approached them. The British troops halted and fired. The precision of British fire equipped with the Minié ball, forced <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> back. <b>The</b> Crimean War was the first war in which the Minié ball was employed which most British regiments had been equipped with. Here at the Battle of the Alma, the Minié ball {{was to have a}} devastating impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Russians</b> had to be within 300 paces of the British to attain any kind of accuracy with their smooth bore muskets, while the British began firing their rifled Minié balls accurately <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> at a distance of 1200 paces.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Russo-Japanese War, Azuma was {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six-inch guns inflicted little damage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged.|$|E

500|$|When Barclay {{brought up}} troops against an attacking French brigade, he {{described}} it as [...] "a walk into Hell". During {{the height of the}} battle, Kutuzov's subordinates were making all of the decisions for him; according to Colonel Karl von Clausewitz, famous for his work <b>On</b> War, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> commander [...] "seemed to be in a trance." [...] With the death of General Kutaisov, Chief of Artillery, most of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> cannon sat useless <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heights to the rear and were never ordered into battle, while the French artillery wreaked havoc <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hemmemas {{served in}} the Finnish squadrons during the war of 1788–1790. They {{supported}} amphibious operations and conducted raids <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> archipelago fleet, {{while at the same}} time acting as sea-borne flank support for the Swedish army on the Finnish mainland. Hemmemas fought in the first and second battles of Svensksund. During the first battle in 1789, one hemmema complemented the similar turumas, and in the second battle in July 1790, two hemmemas made up the defensive center and provided a considerable percentage of the firepower.|$|E
5|$|His dispositions for {{the battle}} are {{described}} as a clear mistake leaving the right far too strong and the left much too weak. Only the fact that Bagration and Barclay were to cooperate fully saved the Russian army and did much to mitigate the bad positioning.

5000|$|The {{war began}} as a Russian-Turkish conflict. <b>The</b> <b>Russian</b> Empire, headed by Catherine the Great, had been {{involved}} in previous wars of aggression and conquest against the Ottomans, and the two nations were openly hostile. In August 1787, after [...] "numerous Russian provocations" [...] (Hochedlinger), the Ottoman Empire declared war <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians.</b> <b>The</b> Austrian Emperor Joseph II had concluded an alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> in 1781, which (Hochedlinger) [...] "obliged him to assist <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> with his full might ...

5|$|Lariboisière's {{direction}} of artillery {{fire at the}} Battle of Austerlitz resulted {{in the destruction of}} the ice covering the lake over which Russian army forces retreated. His placement of artillery at the Battle of Borodino gave the French a tactical advantage in fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> lines. Lariboisière's artillery also provided the rear guard coverage of the French withdrawal from Beresina. One of his sons survived the wars and the family founded the Lariboisière Hospital in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Still, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, {{as well as}} {{a number}} of other pro-Soviet Russian {{politicians}} and commentators, continue to deny all Soviet guilt, call the released documents fakes, insist that the original Soviet version—Polish prisoners were shot by Germans in August 1941—is the correct one, and call <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> government to start a new investigation that would revise the findings of the one concluded in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} 12 October, when Moltke, Bayern, and the Königs began firing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> shore batteries at Tagga Bay.

Both Grosser Kurfürst and Bayern struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions; damage to the former was minimal, but Bayern was severely wounded; the ship had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs.|$|E

25|$|Although the mid–19th {{century were}} {{not a good time}} for Russians in Alaska, {{conditions}} improved for the coastal Alaska Natives who had survived contact.

5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and {{the morale of the}} crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Russo-Japanese War the sisters were assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet, although Asama was attached to the 4th Division of Rear Admiral Uryū Sotokichi for operations near Seoul, Korea.

Tokiwa participated in the Battle of Port Arthur that same day, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected the earlier surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack.|$|E
5|$|Colony Ross, {{known as}} Fort Ross today, {{was built in}} California just north of San Francisco Bay.

The Ross Colony included a number of settlements spread out over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay. The administrative center was Port Rumianstev at Bodega Harbor, off Bodega Bay. An artel hunting camp was located on the Farallon Islands. Three ranches were established: the Kostromitinov Ranch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> River near the mouth of Willow Creek, the Khlebnikov Ranch in the Salmon Creek valley about a mile (1.6km) north of the present day Bodega, and the Chernykh Ranch near present-day Graton. Fort Ross employed native Alaskans to hunt seals and sea otters on the California coast. By 1840 California's sea otter population had been severely depleted.|$|E
