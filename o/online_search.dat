The project, involving responses from library media specialists (LMSs) from 24 DeKalb secondary schools (5 junior high schools and 19 high school), sought answers to the following research questions: (1) Is the amount budgeted per school for CLASSMATE <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> adequate? (2) How is <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> being used in each school and with what results? (3) What is the general feeling or perception of the LMSs toward its use? (4) Are more inservices or staff development programs needed in this area for LMSs and/or teachers? and (5) What can be done at the district level to enhance the use of <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> for the students? Overall, the report reveals that LMSs had a positive attitude toward <b>online</b> <b>searching.</b> Responses to the questionnaire, however, indicate improvements are needed in training LMSs and teachers in online service usage.

The group's foray into the Japanese market was another landmark in their career—their debut Japanese album marked the highest sales of a non-Japanese artist's first album. Ian Martin of The Japan Times noted that the group's popularity was still strong even after the Korean Wave appeal has died down in Japan in 2011–12. The group became the main feature in the K-pop section of Japanese textbooks. During 2009–2011, the group generated ₩68.8 billion ($62 million), raking in $20 million in profits and becoming the highest profit earner for their label SM Entertainment. During the first half of 2014, they raked in ₩30.3 billion ($28 million) in profit. In Japan, the group consistently ranked among K-pop's highest-grossing acts, generating ₩12, ₩71 and ₩55 billion ($11, $65.5 and $48 million) in revenue in 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively.|$|E

40|$|The broad {{subject of}} this article is how <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> (as a special form of {{information}} retrieval) can usefully be viewed as a problem-solving process. This is not an especially new idea. Several writers have taken this general position including Linda Smith (1976, 1980), Marcia Bates (1979 a, 1979 b), Don Swanson (1977, 1979, 1986), and the author (Harter 1984 a, 1984 b, 1986). However, this discussion will focus on a particular aspect of the identification of useful classes of heuristics for <b>online</b> <b>searching.</b> These ideas are not only interesting and significant from a theoretical point of view, but also because of their implications for education and training, for how librarians view end user <b>searching</b> of <b>online</b> catalogs and other in-house systems, and for the design of expert systems for <b>online</b> <b>searching.</b> published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of online bibliographic retrieval on the librarian's professional self-image. The question of <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> and professional status is raised primarily in response to Brian Nielsen's work in 1980 and 1982, and also motivated by the relatively low volume of work on this topic since Nielsen. A major {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether Nielsen's predictions about <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> deprofessionalizing librarianship were beginning to be realized. The study consisted of 8 interviews, lasting from 45 minutes to 3 hours, with librarians who do and supervise <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> in a variety of disciplines and settings. Thirty-three questions were asked under conditions of privacy to establish the basic background facts of each respondent's situation, and to elicit their perceptions of the effect of <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> on: (1) their image; (2) their role as teacher or as intermediary; (3) their interaction with patrons and end users; (4) their careers; and (5) their own personal attitudes toward <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> and its impact on their professional status. It was concluded that, although automation has made many tasks more routine, its effects have been an enhancement. In most situations where searches were being negotiated, librarians felt that they gave patrons more individualized attention. Furthermore, librarians generally felt that the addition of a computer had a professionalizing effect on librarianship. Copies of the interview questions and privacy statement are appended.

40|$|The {{original}} aim of {{this paper}} was to review the development of education and training for <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> in Britain during the last ten years. The literature is fairly comprehensive in its coverage of the evolution of <b>online</b> <b>searching,</b> and of new developments such as OPACs (Online Public Access Catalogues), CD-ROM systems, expert systems, and image storage systems. It would have been possible to write a book on these topics but that task has already been completed by the authors of no less than three books which have appeared in Britain. 1, 2, 3 The different approaches which have been taken to aspects of education and training, including the development of simulations and the place of <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> in the curriculum have also been thoroughly considered. After completing an initial review of this extensive literature, it became apparent that it would probably be most useful to draw attention to a number of issues which do not appear to have been widely discussed. Certain aspects of the British experience could be of particular significance for future development in those countries where <b>online</b> <b>searching</b> is not yet as widely practiced. These relate particularly to the impact of assistance and encouragement for experimental research; the impact of end-users' appreciation of the potential of online information services; and the implications of teaching online systems (and other forms of library automation) for curriculum development, student recruitment, funding, and the position of the Schools of Librarianship within their parent institution. These issues are not fully discussed in the existing literature, but have a long-term significance far greater than the solution of the technical problems associated with <b>online</b> <b>searching.</b> The paper therefore attempts to highlight some of those issues, drawing upon the literature and the author's observations of developments in Britain in the last ten years...|$|R
