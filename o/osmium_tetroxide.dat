5|$|<b>Osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> {{is highly}} {{volatile}} and penetrates skin readily, {{and is very}} toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. Airborne low concentrations of <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage, and should therefore {{be used in a}} fume hood. <b>Osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as corn oil.|$|E
5|$|Finely divided {{metallic}} osmium is pyrophoric and {{reacts with}} oxygen at room temperature, forming volatile <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> Some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present. This makes <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> {{the main source}} of contact with the environment.|$|E
5|$|Only two osmium {{compounds}} {{have major}} applications: <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> for staining tissue in electron microscopy {{and for the}} oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis, and the non-volatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions.|$|E
5|$|After it is dissolved, osmium is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{clinical}} use of osmium {{appears to be}} for synovectomy in arthritic patients in Scandinavia. It involves the local administration of <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> (OsO4), which is a highly toxic compound. The lack of reports of long-term side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible, although this depends on the osmium compound administered. In 2011, osmium(VI) and osmium(II) compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo, it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
5|$|The {{measured}} deposition temperature {{indicated that}} hassium(VIII) oxide is less volatile than <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> OsO4, and places hassium firmly in group 8. However, the enthalpy of adsorption for HsO4 measured, (−46 ± 2) kJ/mol, {{was significantly lower}} than what was predicted, (−36.7 ± 1.5) kJ/mol, indicating that OsO4 was more volatile than HsO4, contradicting earlier calculations, which implied {{that they should have}} very similar volatilities. For comparison, the value for OsO4 is (−39 ± 1) kJ/mol. It is possible that hassium tetroxide interacts differently with the different chemicals (silicon nitride and silicon dioxide) used for the detector; further research is required, including more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of 269Hs and comparisons with RuO4 in addition to OsO4.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} non-essential heavy metals {{have one or}} more toxic forms. Kidney failure and {{fatalities}} have been recorded arising from the ingestion of germanium dietary supplements (~15 to 300g in total consumed {{over a period of}} two months to three years). Exposure to <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> (OsO4) may cause permanent eye damage and can lead to respiratory failure and death. Indium salts are toxic if more than few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys, liver, and heart. Cisplatin (PtCl2(NH3)2), which is an important drug used to kill cancer cells, is also a kidney and nerve poison. Bismuth compounds can cause liver damage if taken in excess; insoluble uranium compounds, as well as the dangerous radiation they emit, can cause permanent kidney damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{oxidation}} can {{be stopped}} at the vicinal diol rather than full cleavage of the alkene by using milder (dilute,lower temperature) KMnO4 or with <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> or other oxidants.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{fixation}} – {{for biological}} specimens aims {{to stabilize the}} specimen's mobile macromolecular structure by chemical crosslinking of proteins with aldehydes such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, and lipids with <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cortisone {{was first}} {{produced}} commercially by Merck & Co. in 1948 or 1949. On September 30, 1949, Percy Julian announced {{an improvement in}} the process of producing cortisone from bile acids. This eliminated the need to use <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> a rare, expensive, and dangerous chemical. In the UK in the early 1950s, John Cornforth and Kenneth Callow at the National Institute for Medical Research collaborated with Glaxo to produce cortisone from hecogenin from sisal plants.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{that have}} {{dimensions}} {{small enough to}} be electron transparent, such as powdered substances, small organisms, viruses, or nanotubes, can be quickly prepared by the deposition of a dilute sample containing the specimen onto films on support grids. Biological specimens may be embedded in resin to withstand the high vacuum in the sample chamber and to enable cutting tissue into electron transparent thin sections. The biological sample can be stained using either a negative staining material such as uranyl acetate for bacteria and viruses, or, {{in the case of}} embedded sections, the specimen may be stained with heavy metals, including <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> Alternately samples may be held at liquid nitrogen temperatures after embedding in vitreous ice. In material science and metallurgy the specimens can usually withstand the high vacuum, but still must be prepared as a thin foil, or etched so some portion of the specimen is thin enough for the beam to penetrate. Constraints on the thickness of the material may be limited by the scattering cross-section of the atoms from which the material is comprised.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{compound}} exhibiting the +8 oxidation state is <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> This toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium {{is exposed to}} air.

500|$|Ruthenium can be {{oxidized}} to ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2, {{oxidation state}} +4) which can in turn be oxidized by sodium metaperiodate to the volatile yellow tetrahedral ruthenium tetroxide, RuO4, an aggressive, strong oxidizing agent with structure and properties analogous to <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> Like <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> ruthenium tetroxide {{is a potent}} fixative and stain for electron microscopy of organic materials, and is mostly used to reveal the structure of polymer samples. [...] Dipotassium ruthenate (K2RuO4, +6), and potassium perruthenate (KRuO4, +7) are also known. Unlike <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> ruthenium tetroxide is less stable and is strong enough as an oxidising agent to oxidise dilute hydrochloric acid and organic solvents like ethanol at room temperature, and is easily reduced to ruthenate (...) in aqueous alkaline solutions; it decomposes to form the dioxide above 100°C. Unlike iron but like osmium, ruthenium does not form oxides in its lower +2 and +3 oxidation states. Ruthenium forms dichalcogenides only when reacted directly with the chalcogens, which are diamagnetic semiconductors crystallizing in the pyrite structure and thus must contain ruthenium(II).|$|E
500|$|In 1803, Smithson Tennant {{analyzed}} the insoluble residue {{and concluded that}} it must contain a new metal. Vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide, which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ptene, from the Greek word [...] (ptènos) for winged. However, Tennant, who {{had the advantage of}} a much larger amount of residue, continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue, iridium and osmium. He obtained a yellow solution (probably of cis–2−) by reactions with sodium hydroxide at red heat. After acidification he was able to distill the formed OsO4. He named it osmium after Greek osme meaning [...] "a smell", because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> Discovery of the new elements was documented {{in a letter to the}} Royal Society on June 21, 1804.|$|E
500|$|An {{experiment}} {{determining the}} chemical properties of a transactinide {{would need to}} compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds {{of some of its}} lighter homologues: for example, in the chemical characterization of hassium, hassium tetroxide (HsO4) was compared with the analogous osmium compound, <b>osmium</b> <b>tetroxide</b> (OsO4). In a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of meitnerium, the GSI attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium(III) oxide (Rh2O3) and rhodium(III) chloride (RhCl3). However, macroscopic amounts of the oxide would not sublimate until 1000°C and the chloride would not until 780°C, and then only in the presence of carbon aerosol particles: these temperatures are far too high for such procedures to be used on meitnerium, as most of the current methods used for the investigation of the chemistry of superheavy elements do not work above 500°C.Rh with different carrier gases |author=Haenssler, F.

500|$|On April 13, 1949, {{rheumatologist}} Philip Hench at the Mayo Clinic {{announced the}} dramatic effectiveness of cortisone in treating rheumatoid arthritis.

[...] By 1950, Glidden could begin producing closely related compounds which might have partial cortisone activity. Julian also announced the synthesis, starting with the cheap and readily available pregnenolone (synthesized from the soybean oil sterol stigmasterol) of the steroid cortexolone (also known as Reichstein's Substance S), a molecule that differed from cortisone by a single missing oxygen atom; [...] and possibly 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenetriolone, which he hoped might also be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but unfortunately they were not.|$|E
500|$|Ruthenium, {{like the}} other {{platinum}} group metals, is obtained commercially as a by-product from nickel, and copper, and platinum metals ore processing.

The metals are converted to ionized solutes by any of several methods, depending on {{the composition of the}} feedstock. [...] One representative method is fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and solution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid. Osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, and iridium are insoluble in aqua regia and readily precipitate, leaving the other metals in solution.

The insoluble residue, containing Ru, Os, and Ir is treated with sodium oxide, in which Ir is insoluble, producing dissolved Ru and Os salts.
