50|$|The <b>orange-cheeked</b> <b>waxbill</b> (Estrilda melpoda) is {{a common}} species of estrildid finch native to western and central Africa, with an {{estimated}} global extent of occurrence of 3,600,000 km2.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>orange-cheeked</b> <b>waxbill</b> {{lives in}} small family parties or flocks of thirty of more individuals. Their high-pitched peeps {{are the best}} clue of their presence. Like most estridids, they are very acrobatic in their {{movements}} on twigs and grass stems, [...] "climbing" [...] up and down verticals and hanging upside down while feeding. Males usually have brighter orange patches on the abdomen.|$|E
50|$|No {{wildlife}} {{was introduced}} to the park but the introduction of the naturalised river into the park has seen the park’s biodiversity increase by 30%.Singapore lies within the East Asian - Australasian Flyway so the park can expect to receive some special migratory bird visitors. A few surprise visitors have been spotted including the Zanzibar red bishop, a native to Africa, the spotted wood owl, native to the jungle forest in Indonesia, long-tailed parakeet, native in the Andaman Islands and the <b>orange-cheeked</b> <b>waxbill,</b> native to western and central Africa. Birds such as the purple heron, scaly-breasted munia and white-breasted waterhen that are seldom seen in a high-dense urban neighbourhood have also been spotted roosting among the vegetation. The Park was also the home of the Bishan otter family. The Malay Archipelago is one of the world’s greatest biodiversity hotspots, second only to the Amazon, and the tropical rainforest climate is home to an abundance of lush vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Of the {{introduced}} birds, the European starling, house sparrow, great kiskadee, rock dove, American crow {{and chicken}} {{are all very}} numerous and considered to be pests. Other introduced species include the mallard, northern cardinal, European goldfinch and small numbers of <b>orange-cheeked</b> and common <b>waxbills.</b> The yellow-crowned night heron {{was introduced in the}} 1970s to replace the extinct native heron.|$|R
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. A survey of the internal parasites present in 21 species of birds in the Diamond Head area on Oahu was conducted during 1972 - 1973. A total of 121 birds were examined for protozoa and helminth infections. Twenty individuals were infected with protozoa and 40 with helminths. Forty of these birds were also examined for internal mites; seven were infected. Each type of parasite is discussed and its history in Hawaii. First records of parasites in Hawaii include Syngamus trachea taken from a Red-crested Cardinal, Capillaria sp. from a Cordon-bleu, <b>Orange-cheeked</b> <b>Waxbill,</b> and two Cardinals: Plagiorhynchus charadrii from a Golden Plover; Mediorhynchus orientalis from a Common Mynah, Cardinal, and two Red-crested Cardinals; and Sternostoma tracheacol from a Cordon-bleu and Red-eared Waxbill.
