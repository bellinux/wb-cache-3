50|$|Claude Desgots {{was born}} in Paris, the son of Pierre II Desgots (1630-1688) and Martine Servelle, who were married in 1654. Pierre II was a {{landscape}} designer and draughtsman, who worked closely with André Le Nôtre <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> at <b>the</b> Château de Chantilly. He {{was the son of}} Le Nôtre's sister, Elisabeth (who {{was born in}} 1616 and died sometime before 1640) and Pierre I Desgots (c. 1600 - 1675), who had succeeded his brother Jean Desgots as the gardener of the Tuileries in 1624. In 1675 Claude Desgots was sent on a bursary to the French Academy in Rome, and from c. 1679 he collaborated with his father and Le Nôtre <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> at Chantilly. He also worked for a while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> at Versailles and succeeded his father as the gardener of the Tuileries upon the latter's death in 1688.|$|R
5|$|The roadway {{that carried}} Highway55 {{continued}} south of this intersection as Taylor Road (Niagara Regional Road70). Continuing north, the highway passed beneath the QEW, which ascends over the Welland Canal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> City Skyway. The highway entered Homer, then curved northeast and entered farmland. From here to its northern terminus, the highway was completely straight. It passed {{south of the}} St. Catharines/Niagara District Airport and later intersected Niagara Regional Road106.|$|E

5|$|The Town and County War Memorial {{does not}} contain a list of casualties. The local branch of the Royal British Legion {{launched}} a campaign for a memorial dedicated to the town and containing a list of names. A garden of remembrance was built in Abington Square, {{the location of the}} original temporary cenotaph, and unveiled by Major General Sir John Brown in 1937; the names of the fallen were inscribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> walls. The memorial to Edgar Mobbs—a professional rugby player from Northampton who was killed in the First World War in 1917—was moved into the garden.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the prince}} wanted a {{strictly}} Classical design, {{and plans for}} such a design were executed, in Chester by architect Thomas Harrison and modified, on site, by Odessa architect Francesco Boffo. The two architects had previously worked together on the design for Vorontsov's official residence in Odessa. Harrison's plans for he palace at Alupka show a classical villa {{on the site of}} the present palace's corps de logis with bedroom floors below, on what are now the lower terraces of the present palace. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> front, facing the sea, the plans show a large double height classical exedra; Vorontsov must have approved of this concept as it was the only feature (albeit transformed to an Islamic style), to be incorporated from Harrison's plans into the new plans.|$|E
5|$|Repair work {{commenced}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> and undercroft {{in early}} 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and {{was scheduled to}} take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration {{and work on the}} memorial itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project would be complete by Armistice Day 2010. During the repair work the memorial itself was rotated to face the city hall, in accordance with the wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration work. Its place in the memorial garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: Breath by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. The memorial and garden was re-dedicated after three years on Armistice Day, 11 November 2011; the repair work had cost £2.6million.|$|E

25|$|In 1909 Schechtel {{turned to}} Neoclassical Revival, {{building}} his own (third) residence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> Ring in strict Doric style.

25|$|Le Nôtre and his {{hundreds}} of masons, gardeners and earth-movers worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> from 1666 to 1672. In 1682, however, the King, furious with the Parisians for resisting his authority, abandoned Paris {{and moved to}} Versailles.|$|R
50|$|In 1542 the Tate family {{purchased}} the Abbey grounds from the Crown; they started work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gardens.</b> Zouch Tate is recorded as having {{laid out a}} typical Elizabethan-style garden.

50|$|The Second World War {{took its}} toll <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gardens.</b> Although some of the Malay staff {{remained}} with <b>the</b> <b>Gardens</b> during <b>the</b> Japanese occupation, lack of funds and direction, together with the accumulation of war debris, left <b>the</b> <b>Gardens</b> in a very bad state. The Japanese excavated tunnels near the lily ponds and turned them into ammunition works and storage facilities, and a torpedo assembly station.|$|R
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> {{side of the}} palace, which {{faced the}} River Tiber, Michelangelo {{proposed}} the innovatory design of a bridge which, if completed, would have linked the palace with the gardens of the Vigna Farnese, Alessandro's holding on the opposite bank, that later became incorporated into the adjacent villa belonging to the Chigi family, which the Farnese purchased in 1584 and renamed the Villa Farnesina. While the practicalities of achieving this bridge remain dubious, the idea was a bold and expansive one.|$|E
25|$|At first, some of {{the younger}} Livingstons' estates {{followed}} the British colonial patterns of Clermont. Rhinebeck House, today known as Grasmere, is the best-preserved example. Later on the houses began to show the influence of contemporary French tastes, abandoning the large central hall in favor of smaller rooms and passageways inside and focusing more attention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> side of the house, which usually faced the river and mountains as well. Montgomery Place, built by Janet Livingston Montgomery after the death of her husband Richard, is the only example from this period that remains largely as it was when first built.|$|E
25|$|Although Corzine was unpopular among {{independents and}} Republicans, he polled much more highly among {{registered}} Democrats. His three opponents were former Glen Ridge mayor Carl Bergmanson, who ran {{on a platform}} of fiscal discipline, governmental reform, and removing the tolls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway; perennial candidate Jeff Boss; and businessman and former Congressional candidate Roger Bacon. A Quinnipiac poll conducted shortly before the primary and released on May 20, 2009, indicated that 65% of Democratic primary voters would vote for Corzine, with the other three candidates each receiving 4%–5%. Also, 62% of Democrats approved of him while 24% didn't.|$|E
