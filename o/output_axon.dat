40|$|SummaryNeuronal {{processing}} is classically conceptualized as dendritic input, somatic integration, and axonal <b>output.</b> The <b>axon</b> initial segment, {{the proposed}} {{site of action}} potential generation, usually emanates directly from the soma. However, we found that axons of hippocampal pyramidal cells frequently derive from a basal dendrite {{rather than from the}} soma. This morphology is particularly enriched in central CA 1, the principal hippocampal output area. Multiphoton glutamate uncaging revealed that input onto the axon-carrying dendrites (AcDs) was more efficient in eliciting action potential output than input onto regular basal dendrites. First, synaptic input onto AcDs generates action potentials with lower activation thresholds compared with regular dendrites. Second, AcDs are intrinsically more excitable, generating dendritic spikes with higher probability and greater strength. Thus, axon-carrying dendrites constitute a privileged channel for excitatory synaptic input in a subset of cortical pyramidal cells. Video Abstrac...|$|R
40|$|The central {{nucleus of}} the {{inferior}} colliculus (IC) is organized {{into a series of}} fibro-dendritic laminae, orthogonal to the tonotopic progression. Many neurones have their dendrites confined to one lamina while others have dendrites that cross over a number of laminae. Here, we have used juxtacellular labelling in urethane anaesthetised guinea pigs to visualise the cells with biocytin and have analysed their response properties, in order to try and link their structure and function. Out of a sample of 38 filled cells, 15 had dendrites confined within the fibrodendritic laminae and in 13 we were also able to reconstruct their local axonal tree. Based on dendritic morphology they were subdivided into flat or less-flat; small, medium or large; elongated or disc-shaped cells. Two of the elongated cells had many dendritic spines while the other cells had few or none. Twelve of the cells had their local axonal tree restricted to the same lamina as their dendrites while one cell had its dendrites in a separate lamina from the axon. The axonal plexus was more extensive (width 0. 7 – 1. 4 mm) within the lamina than the dendrites (width generally 0. 07 – 0. 53 mm). The intrinsic axons were largely confined to a single lamina within the central nucleus, but at least half the cells also had <b>output</b> <b>axons</b> with two heading for the commissure and 5 heading into the brachium. We were able to identify similarities in the physiological response profiles of small groups of our filled cells but none appeared to represent a homogeneous morphological cell type. The only common feature of our sample was one of exclusion in that the onset response, a response commonly recorded from IC cells, was never seen in laminar cells, but was in cells with a stellate morphology. Thus cells with laminar dendrites have a wide variety of physiological responses and morphological subtypes, but over 90 % have an extensive local axonal tree within their local lamina...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIn commissural neurons of Drosophila, the conserved Frazzled (Fra) /Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) {{receptor}} promotes midline axon crossing by signaling locally {{in response}} to Netrin and by inducing transcription of commissureless (comm), an antagonist of Slit-Roundabout midline repulsion, through an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Fra is cleaved to release its intracellular domain (ICD), which shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional activator. Rescue and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that the Fra ICD is sufficient to regulate comm expression and that both γ-secretase proteolysis of Fra and Fra’s function as a transcriptional activator are required {{for its ability to}} regulate comm in vivo. Our data uncover an unexpected role for the Fra ICD as a transcription factor whose activity regulates the responsiveness of commissural axons at the midline and raise the possibility that nuclear signaling may be a common <b>output</b> of <b>axon</b> guidance receptors...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in the ﬁeld of neuroscience is to understand the biological basis of emotion, cognition, and, ultimately, consciousness. Exploring the science of the mind involves studying the brain. The brain {{is part of the}} nervous system, which is a communication network that allows an organism to interact with its environment. The environment includes both the external environment (theworld outside the body) and the internal environment (the contents of the body) (Willes, 1993). The human nervous system can be subdivided into a peripheral and a cen-tral part. The peripheral nervous system controls voluntary muscle movement (somatic part) and involuntary muscle movement (autonomic part). The central nervous system (CNS) contains the spinal cord and the brain. The CNS is a mech-anism that ensures the coordination of the actions {{in a part of the}} body with the actions in all other parts of the body. The CNS integrates internal and external environmental information to enable human behavior (Kalat, 1999 a;Willes, 1993). The brain consists of billions of neurons. Neurons transmit information from one location, e. g. brain area, to another location in the shape of electrochemical impulses. These impulses, the so-called action potentials, are transmitted by the neuron via dendrites (taking care of the information input) and axons (taking care of the information <b>output).</b> <b>Axons</b> are usually covered with a myelin sheath to quicken the information transmission (Kalat, 1999 b). An action potential may in-volve one single neuron; however,more often clusters of neurons ﬁre. Information from ﬁring clusters is propagated through neuronal networks to establish a brain function. Neurons in the brain need to function both locally (interactions between neighboring neurons) and globally (interactions among distant brain areas) to make human behavior possible. Neuronal activity can be investigated using direct measurement, indirect mea-surement or a combination of both (Horwitz and Poeppel, 2002; Momjian et al., 2003). Directmeasurement involves single cell recordings that are performed only chieﬂy in animal experiments. In humans, this is only possible during neuro-surgery. Therefore, non-invasive procedures, i. e. indirect methods, are employed in man. These indirect methods comprise electromagnetic source imaging and measurements of metabolic changes. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magne-toencephalography (MEG) measure the electromagnetic signal caused by neuronal ﬁring, whereas positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic res-onance imaging (fMRI) measure physiologic or metabolic changes that are due to neuronal activity in the brain. To summarize, a broad spectrum of techniques is available tomeasure human brain activity (Horwitz et al., 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|Neurons {{are highly}} {{polarized}} cells with some regions specified for information input — typically the dendrites— and others specialized for information <b>output</b> — the <b>axons.</b> By extending {{to a specific}} location and branching in a specific manner, the processes of neurons determine at a fundamental level how the nervous system is wired to produce behavior. Recent studies suggest that relatively small changes in neuronal morphology could conceivably contribute to striking behavioral distinctions between invertebrate species. We review recent data that begin {{to shed light on}} how neurons extend dendrites to their targets and acquire their particular branching morphologies, drawing primarily on data from genetic model organisms. We speculate about how and why the actions of these genes might facilitate the diversification of dendritic morphology...|$|R
40|$|Neurons {{may serve}} {{different}} functions {{over the course}} of an organism’s life. Recent evidence suggests that cortical subplate neurons including those that reside in the white matter may perform longitudinal multi-tasking at different stages of development. These cells {{play a key role in}} early cortical development in coordinating thalamocortical reciprocal innervation. At later stages of development, they become integrated within the cortical microcircuitry. This type of longitudinal multi-tasking can enhance the capacity for information processing by populations of cells serving different functions over the lifespan. Subplate cells are initially derived when cells from the ventricular zone underlying the cortex migrate to the cortical preplate that is subsequently split by the differentiating neurons of the cortical plate with some neurons locating in the marginal zone and others settling below in the subplate (SP). While the cortical plate neurons form most of the cortical layers (layers 2 - 6), the marginal zone neurons form layer 1 and the SP neurons become interstitial cells of the white matter as well as forming a compact sublayer along the bottom of layer 6. After serving as transient innervation targets for thalamocortical axons, most of these cells die and layer 4 neurons become innervated by thalamic axons. However, 10 - 20 % survives, remaining into adulthood along the bottom of layer 6 and as a scattered population of interstitial neurons in the white matter. Surviving subplate cells’ axons project throughout the overlying laminae, reaching layer 1 and issuing axon collaterals within white matter and in lower layer 6. This suggests that they participate in local synaptic networks, as well. Moreover, they receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, potentially monitoring <b>outputs</b> from <b>axon</b> collaterals of cortical efferents, from cortical afferents and/or from each other. We explore our understanding of the functional connectivity of these cells at different stages of development...|$|R
40|$|In {{mammalian}} neurons, the axon initial segment (AIS) electrically {{connects the}} somatodendritic compartment with the axon and converts the incoming synaptic voltage changes into a temporally precise action potential (AP) <b>output</b> code. Although <b>axons</b> often emanate {{directly from the}} soma, they may also originate more distally from a dendrite, the implications of which are not well-understood. Here, we show that one-third of the thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurons have an axon originating from a dendrite and are characterized by a reduced dendritic complexity and thinner main apical dendrite. Unexpectedly, the rising phase of somatic APs is electrically indistinguishable between neurons with a somatic or a dendritic axon origin. Cable analysis of the neurons indicated that the axonal axial current is inversely proportional to the AIS distance, denoting the path length between the soma {{and the start of}} the AIS, and to produce invariant somatic APs, it must scale with the local somatodendritic capacitance. In agreement, AIS distance inversely correlates with the apical dendrite diameter, and model simulations confirmed that the covariation suffices to normalize the somatic AP waveform. Therefore, in pyramidal neurons, the AIS location is finely tuned with the somatodendritic capacitive load, serving as a homeostatic regulation of the somatic AP in the face of diverse neuronal morphologie...|$|R
40|$|Context: 7 million athletes {{participate}} {{in high school}} sports annually. Approximately 1 million of these athletes {{participate in}} football, which is associated with repetitive head impacts. Concussion literature suggests sub-concussive impacts may lead to declines in brain function across a season of football. Furthermore, recent research suggests following clinical concussion recovery, metabolic and neurophysiological recovery may not be complete. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to monitor head impacts and cognitive function during (72 hour, asymptomatic) and after concussion and longer term over a full football season (pre-season, mid-season, post-season). Participants: 106 male adolescent (46 football-athletes, 42 controls for football-athletes, 9 concussed-athletes, 9 controls for concussed-athletes). Outcome measures: The Head Impact Telemetry System encoder was used to track the location and magnitude of head impacts during football participation. Psychophysiology was measured using Electroencephalography and was quantified using a 256 channel system to record brain activity during an auditory oddball task. All Participants completed Axon neurocognitive testing, clinical reaction time task (CRT), symptom inventory and two Health Related Quality of Life Surveys (Health Behavior Inventory, Satisfaction with Life) throughout the above testing time-points. Results: Football-athletes sustained a mean of 482 head impacts during all practices and games. Mixed measures ANOVA indicated a significant decrement on one BNA output score, Target amplitude, with lower post-season scores (p 0. 05). Furthermore, P 3 a amplitudes were significantly larger and N 2 latency was longer during post-season testing. Mixed measured ANOVAs indicated no significant deficits in BNA <b>output</b> scores, <b>Axon</b> performance, CRT, and HRQOL, for concussed and matched controls across post-injury time points. Additionally, there was a significantly longer P 3 a latency post-season latencies across groups and smaller P 3 a amplitudes at post-season for concussed compared to controls (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Overall, these findings suggest electrophysiology changes between pre and post-season testing among football athletes and control participants without concussion, with the majority demonstrating improved cognitive function. Therefore, no negative effects may be associated with repeated head impacts in one season of football. Furthermore, no cognitive deficits were present during asymptomatic testing following concussion...|$|R
40|$|Pyramidal neurons in the {{cerebral}} cortex characteristically {{give rise to}} an apical dendrite, whose distal dendritic branches in layer I are covered with spines. These spines {{are known to be}} sites of synaptic connections, but the physiological properties of the spines and the functional significance of their responses are still largely unknown. The main function attributed thus far to these synaptic responses, situated at a great distance from the neuronal cell body, is slow background modulation of impulse <b>output</b> in the <b>axon.</b> In pursuing computer simulation analysis of electrical properties of dendrites, we have obtained results suggesting interactions between distal dendritic spines. If the heads of dendritic spines have excitable membrane properties, the spread of current from one or several spines could bring adjacent spines to their thresholds for impulse generation. This could give rise to a sequence of spine head action potentials, representing a saltatory propagation, from one or more excitable spine heads to nearby excitable spine heads, in the distal dendritic branches. Both the amplification due to several spine action potentials and the possibility of propagation into more proximal branches would increase the efficacy of distal synaptic inputs. Because of nonlinear dependence upon several modifiable parameters (such as spine stem resistance and membrane excitability) and upon the spatio-temporal pattern of synaptic input, such contingent synaptic enhancement would be particularly relevant to cortical functions underlying information processing and to plasticity underlying learning and memory...|$|R
