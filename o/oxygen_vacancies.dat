When an electric field is applied, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>vacancies</b> drift (see Fast ion conductor), changing {{the boundary between the}} high-resistance and low-resistance layers.

Under generic growth conditions, multiple mechanisms can coexist. A systematic study [...] across a wide growth parameter space demonstrated different roles played by oxygen vacancy formation and the polar gating at different interfaces. An obvious difference between <b>oxygen</b> <b>vacancies</b> and polar gating in creating the interface conductivity is that the carriers from <b>oxygen</b> <b>vacancies</b> are thermally activated as the donor level of <b>oxygen</b> <b>vacancies</b> is usually separated from the SrTiO3 conduction band, consequently exhibiting the carrier freeze-out effect at low temperatures; in contrast, the carriers originating from the polar gating are transferred into the SrTiO3 conduction band (Ti 3d orbitals) and are therefore degenerate.|$|E

In this paper the property of point defects in anatase TiO 2 is investigated and the character of hand structure and density of states is analyzed by using first-principle pseudopotential calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT). It is discovered that the crystal structure was changed due to pulling into vacancy; the nearby oxygen atom has the trend of closing to the <b>oxygen</b> <b>vacancy</b> and keeping off the titanium vacancy, whereas the nearby titanium atom has the trend of closing to the titanium vacancy and keeping off the <b>oxygen</b> <b>vacancy.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> <b>vacancy</b> makes Fermi energy rise about 2. 6 eV and titanium vacancy makes Fermi energy go down. A defect level appeares in the gap about 0. 25 eV above the top of valence hand due to titanium vacancy. Theoretical results show that <b>oxygen</b> <b>vacancy</b> causing conduction hand wider is n-type impurity and titanium vacancy causing conduction hand narrower is p-type impurity; the redundant electrons nearby <b>oxygen</b> <b>vacancy</b> contributed to valence band, which causes the change of the electric populations and alters the local motional property of electrons...|$|R
