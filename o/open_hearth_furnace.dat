25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Bessemer process, enabling steel to be made inexpensively, led to the era of great expansion of railways {{that began in the}} late 1860s. Steel rails lasted several times longer than iron. Steel rails made heavier locomotives possible, allowing for longer trains and improving the productivity of railroads. The Bessemer process introduced nitrogen into the steel, which caused the steel to become brittle with age. The <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> began to replace the Bessemer process near the end of 19th century, improving the quality of steel and further reducing costs. Thus steel completely replaced the use of iron in rails, thus becoming standard for all railways.|$|E
2500|$|Bessemer steel became brittle {{with age}} because {{nitrogen}} was introduced when air was blown in. [...] The Bessemer process was also restricted to certain ores (low phosphate hematite). [...] By {{the end of}} the 19th century the Bessemer process was displaced by the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> (OHF). [...] After World War II the OHF was displaced by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), which used oxygen instead of air and required about 35–40 minutes to produce a batch of steel compared to 8 to 9 hours for the OHF. The BOF also was more energy efficient.|$|E

2500|$|Steel {{is often}} cited as {{the first of several}} new areas for {{industrial}} mass-production, which are said to characterise a [...] "Second Industrial Revolution", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of steel was not invented until the 1860s, when Sir Henry Bessemer invented a new furnace which could convert molten pig iron into steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality. [...] Bessemer steel was being displaced by the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> {{near the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Production {{of steel}} and other metals was {{hampered}} by the difficulty in producing sufficiently high temperatures for melting. [...] An understanding of thermodynamic principles such as recapturing heat from flue gas by preheating combustion air, known as hot blast, resulted in much higher energy efficiency and higher temperatures. [...] Preheated combustion air was used in iron production and in the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace.</b> [...] In 1780, before the introduction of hot blast in 1829, it required seven times as much coke as {{the weight of the}} product pig iron. [...] The hundredweight of coke per short ton of pig iron was 35 in 1900, falling to 13 in 1950. [...] By 1970 the most efficient blast furnaces used 10 hundredweight of coke per short ton of pig iron.|$|E

2500|$|Recovery of {{heat for}} {{industrial}} processes was first widely used as hot blast in blast furnaces to make pig iron in 1828. [...] Later heat reuse included the Siemens-Martin process which {{was first used}} for making glass and later for steel with the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace.</b> (See: Iron and steel below). [...] Today heat is reused in many basic industries such as chemicals, oil refining and pulp and paper, {{using a variety of}} methods such as heat exchangers in many processes. [...] Multiple-effect evaporators use vapor from a high temperature effect to evaporate a lower temperature boiling fluid. [...] In the recovery of kraft pulping chemicals the spent black liquor can be evaporated five or six times by reusing the vapor from one effect to boil the liquor in the preceding effect. Cogeneration is a process that uses high pressure steam to generate electricity and then uses the resulting low pressure steam for process or building heat.|$|E

The new works included an open hearth Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous open hearth Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. A [...] stationary blast furnace and four [...] rolling open hearth furnaces were also built. A boiler plate mill, sheet metal mill, and wire mill were in operation by 1870. Another [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace was erected in 1872. By the end of 1872, the combined Newburgh plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state. A second <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was constructed in 1876, and the company leased the works and the Proton Furnace of the Cleveland Iron Co. in 1878.

In 1918 they merged with Samuel Fox and Company, based in Stocksbridge and Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company in Scunthorpe creating United Steel Companies (USC). The Templeborough steelworks was reputed to be a mile long. At its height in the mid-20th century, the company employed 10,000 people. In the 1950s as Templeborough's <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> had become outdated USC set up “Operation SPEAR” (Steel Peech Electric Arc Reorganization), to inroduce six modern electric arc furnaces to replace the 14 <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> This resulted in Templeborough Melting Shop becoming the largest electric arc steel making plant in the world: they were capable of producing 1.8 million tons per year.

Changes were based on withdrawals of economically unprofitable technologies, including <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> through expansion of electrical and converter technologies of steel manufacturing up to activities which were connected with changing the profile of manufactured assortment...|$|R
50|$|The {{steel making}} plant was changed in 1897 when the Bessemer {{converters}} {{were replaced by}} three <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> and the processing plant increased {{with the addition of}} cogging mills, rail mills and specialist plant for the manufacture of steel springs and railway axles. In 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War many iron and steel companies began producing munitions. In this case the work was added to the normal production, which included many component orders for the military. The Ickles site was proving too small to handle the production, and with steel in such demand, the company extended their works towards the Sheffield boundary, to occupy a site between the main Sheffield to Rotherham road and the Great Central Railway line. The new Melting Shop and Rolling Mills were built over the site of the old Roman fort at Templeborough. The Templeborough Melting Shop, when opened, was the largest melting shop of its type in Europe and contained 14 <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> where steel scrap was melted down.|$|R
