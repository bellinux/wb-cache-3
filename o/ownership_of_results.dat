40|$|When {{faced with}} the need for change, {{businesses}} struggle with issues such as project speed, complexity, deliverable quality, and <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> within the organization. Incorporating facilitated work sessions into the project lifecycle to produce specific deliverables accelerates creation of the deliverable, contributes to process and deliverable quality, and ensures early <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> Facilitation skills are not typically emphasized within the core training of a Project Manager (PM). It is expected that most PMs have the ability to facilitate project team meetings. But it takes a higher skill level to structure and facilitate a cross-functional 2 -or- 3 -day working session of 12 - 20 people in order to build a specific project deliverable. And, even if you’re a skilled facilitator, you may not know where in the project lifecycle to introduce facilitated work sessions to best influence quality and accelerate the project.

30|$|Overall, {{processes}} such as CIMULACT may {{mitigate the}} much stressed shortcoming of public engagement to not provide real impacts on policy making. A large actor basis, as built in CIMULACT, supports creating <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> among the actors themselves and building trust in them outside of the immediate participants. Yet, it is established that impacts of policy advice in general, and the ones produced by public engagement activities in particular, are hard to measure [102], especially when considering a forward looking long term perspective and an emphasis on system level [14]. Nevertheless {{that does not mean}} that impacts do not exist. An evaluation of the projects’ methodology as well as an impact assessment will be available by mid- 2017. With regard to CIMULACT, real interest by the European Commission can be observed, proofed by first soliciting such a project and secondly by actively being interested the projects’ progress and intermediate results. Yet, gate keepers power over the flow of knowledge become once again obvious, as it needs single interested and dedicated persons in the right positions who actively seek integration of such socially robust co-created knowledge to further sustainable and responsible innovation agendas.|$|E
40|$|Health {{research}} provides {{new knowledge}} {{to improve the}} population's health. There are limited resources to fund this research so many organisations have developed research priorities to guide commissioning. These studies often involve the use of consensus methods. The POTTER project, commissioned by the College of Occupational Therapists, {{is used as a}} case study to explore the question, 'Does there need to be less emphasis on consensus in research priority setting to ensure better investment in health?' This is because the POTTER project identified the effectiveness of occupational therapy as the top research priority for UK-based occupational therapists. This result is too broad to be useful for commissioners because any topic could potentially attract funding under this heading. So, while consensus methods may promote <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>results,</b> criteria-based methods, ie demographic trends, burden of disease, potential benefits and policy, are likely to promote better investment in health. Managers have not traditionally played a role in research priority setting but they should be more involved. The nature of their involvement in service delivery inevitably requires them to have different concerns to clinicians and so they are not necessarily focused on specific interventions. Generally this means they consider the wider healthcare context when research priorities are being shaped...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of {{intellectual}} property (IP) in structuring and governing innovative ventures between independent firms. The issue is particularly important given the tendency towards vertical disintegration in business firms whereby once integrated firms focus on core activities, while devolving residual aspects to independent suppliers and collaborators. In a world of fast changing technology, this also means that innovation takes place across firm boundaries and raises issues about the <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>resulting</b> intellectual property. This paper examines the routes available to firms for allocating such intellectual property to suggest that neither the default rules of US patent law, nor the types of agreements firms have struck as between each other provide adequate protections from appropriation while at the same encouraging seamless cooperation and sharing. This would suggest some caution about the appropriateness of the IP regime for the current innovation environment even in industries such as the pharmaceutical industry where patents are thought to be appropriate to recoup R&D investments and where the risk of standard patent hold up is thought to be low...|$|R

The study found that 62% of patients who received the intervention initiated conversation regarding benzodiazepine therapy discontinuation with physicians and/or pharmacists. After six months, 27% of the intervention group had stopped taking benzodiazepines, compared with 5% of the patients who did not receive the educational intervention.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{developing}} a scale with which to measure farmers’ attitude towards complete <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> farmland. The research started by identifying 50 different statements based on review of the empirical literature and information obtained from stakeholders and experts. Of these statements, 30 items were selected and ultimately only 12 consistent and reliable statements were retained for inclusion in a five point Likert type scale. The 12 statements’ scale was administered on 335 randomly selected sample farmers to measure their attitude towards complete <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> farmland. The <b>result</b> shows that about 85 % and 9 % of the respondents were favoring and disfavoring complete <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> farmland, respectively. Only 6 % of the sample respondents were undecided in terms of their preference for the complete <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> farmland. This detailed study together with strict follow-up of data collection from the sample respondents has been extremely useful in developing a relatively consistent tool to measure farmers’ attitude.

40|$|The soft budget {{constraint}} refers to the phenomenon that a firm expects {{to survive in the}} future when it is financially insolvent. This is widely {{recognized as one of the}} important reasons for the inefficiency and, eventually, the collapse of contemporary socialist economies. The purpose of this paper is to explore the cause of the soft {{budget constraint}} in a formal way. Using a comparative setting which includes botht he socialist system and the market system, I show that public <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> capital is a sufficient condition for the {{soft budget constraint}}. the intuition is that under public <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> capital, the firm (which consists of labor and management) retains its control right regarding the disposition of the capital. thus, the ex post termination decision of the firm's investment project is socially efficient, which means that so long as the financial loss is not as big as the potential loss of human capital due to the termination of the firm, the firm should survive. This gives rise to the soft budget constraint. Similarly, the "hard" budget constraint occurs under private ownership, where the firm can be excluded from the termination decision. Next, I show that ex ante, the soft budget constraint is inefficint while the "hard" budget constraint can be efficient, since given limited liability, the only way to discourage the firm from proposing bad projects is by threatening to incur losses to the human capital when the project indeed is bad. Furthermore, it is shown that public <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> capital causes excessive (relative to the socially optimal level) demand for investment in socialist economies, while private <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>results</b> in under-investment in market economies. Such phenomena have been widely recognized in comparative economics...|$|R
