This study aims to estimate economic damages to the Social Security Organization caused by occupational accidents in Yazd, 2008 - 2009 Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study in which the total 990 occupational accidents registered in 1387 and 2008 in Yazd were investigated to determine costs of insurance and medical care. The data were collected through interview {{as well as the}} information from the Head Office and Department for Clinical Affairs of Social Security in Yazd.

Results: According to the results of this study, the total costs of insurance and medical care for the 990 occupational accidents were calculated to be 54 billion Rials, while the total premium received from the accident victims has been 9. 37 billion Rials in the two years.

40|$|Abstract Background As a {{consequence}} of the disintegration of the state systems and the expansion of the European Union, there have been marked changes in the political and social affiliations of the countries of Eastern Europe. Of the 22 countries in Northeastern, Centraleastern, Southeastern and Eastern Europe, 12 are now members and 10 are "new" neighbours of the European Union. The <b>accident</b> <b>insurance</b> systems and changes in <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> and <b>occupational</b> diseases in eastern European countries are described. Changes since EU and visible differences from non-EU countries are analysed. Special emphasis is given to occupational skin diseases. Methods The available data from the European Union (MISSOC and MISSCEEC Studies on the Social Protection Systems), the database "Social Security Worldwide" (SSW) of the International Social Security Association (ISSA), the International Labour Office Database (LABORSTA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the annual statistical reports of the different countries were analysed with respect to changes in <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> and <b>occupational</b> diseases. To find missing data, 128 ministries and authorities in the 22 countries in eastern Europe were researched and 165 persons contacted. Results The social insurance systems were very different in the different countries and some were better established than others. Moreover, not all data were available. For these reasons, detailed comparison was not always possible. The <b>occupational</b> <b>accident</b> rates are decreasing in more than half the countries. In contrast, the fatal accident rates have increased in half the countries. The number of newly registered occupational diseases is decreasing in more than half the countries. The rates for occupational skin diseases in 2006 were particularly high in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. In half the countries (four out of eight), the number of occupational skin diseases is decreasing. A reliable analysis of any correlation between EU membership and the rates of <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> and <b>occupational</b> diseases was not possible, because of missing current data. Conclusion Comparison of the social insurance systems and changes in <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> and <b>occupational</b> diseases in 22 countries in eastern Europe makes it clear that further effort is needed to develop registration and notification procedures. Only then will it be possible to analyse changes, to map successes and problems and perhaps to initiate necessary improvements. Standardisation of the documents must also be improved, to allow international comparisons between the systems. </p...|$|R

Methods: This study selected industrial accident victims, who died or received more than 4 days of medical care benefits, due to <b>occupational</b> <b>accidents</b> and diseases occurring at workplaces, subject to the Industrial <b>Accident</b> Compensation <b>Insurance</b> Act, as the study population. Results: According to the trends of four major indexes by workplace characteristics, the whole industry has shown a decreasing tendency in all four major indexes since the base year (2003); as of 2012, the index of industrial accident rate was 67, while the index of occupational injury fatality rate per 10, 000 people was 59.
