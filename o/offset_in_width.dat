40|$|We {{propose a}} new diagram, the Kinematic-Excitation diagram (KEx diagram), which uses the [OIII]/Hβ line ratio and the [OIII] 5007 {{emission}} line width (σ_[OIII]) to diagnose the ionization source and physical {{properties of the}} Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and the star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The KEx diagram is a suitable tool to classify emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at intermediate redshift because it uses only the [OIII] 5007 and Hβ emission lines. We use the SDSS DR 7 main galaxy sample and the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagnostic to calibrate the diagram at low redshift. We find that the diagram {{can be divided into}} 3 regions: one occupied mainly by the pure AGNs (KEx-AGN region), one dominated by composite galaxies (KEx-composite region), and one contains mostly SFGs (KEx-SFG region). AGNs are separated from SFGs in this diagram mainly because they preferentially reside in luminous and massive galaxies and have high [OIII]/Hβ. The separation of AGN from star-forming galaxies is even cleaner thanks to the additional 0. 15 / 0. 12 dex <b>offset</b> <b>in</b> [OIII] line <b>width</b> at fixed luminosity/stellar mass. We apply the KEx diagram to 7, 866 galaxies at 0. 3 < z < 1 in the DEEP 2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, and compare it to an independent X-ray classification scheme using Chandra observation. X-ray AGNs are mostly located in the KEx-AGN region while X-ray SFGs are mostly located in the KEx-SFG region. Almost all of Type 1 AGNs lie in the KEx-AGN region. These confirm the reliability of this classification diagram for emission line galaxies at intermediate redshift. At z 2, the demarcation line between star-forming galaxies and AGNs should shift 0. 3 dex higher in σ_[OIII] to account for evolution. Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, 1 table. ApJ submitte...|$|R
