5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and concluded {{that it must have}} been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these.|$|E

5|$|Salih's wazīr was a Christian named Tadrus ibn al-Hasan, who wielded {{significant}} influence over him, according to Ibn al-'Adim, and accompanied Salih <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his military campaigns.

Their major role in the emirate indicated Salih's reliance on local Christian support, the existence of a large Christian minority in Aleppo and an effort to establish friendly ties with the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} {{familiar with}} their new shadows, the party travels to Talta village, befriending Marumaro on the way, who also possesses a magical shadow. Finding that the villagers from Talta have started to head towards {{the capital city of}} Jibral, the party takes off after them. Just outside Jibral, the party finds the villagers attacked by Steel-Eating Tigers. They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces, including Zola. Once the villagers are brought to Jibral, the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola. Together, the party works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene's Mechat base. After the base is destroyed, the party heads north in search of Nene. Nene captures Kluke, and places a collar around her neck which Nene alleges will explode. After reaching Nene, Zola separates from the party to buy them time to attack Nene. When the party attempts to remove Kluke's collar, Nene absorbs the party's shadows by placing collars <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them. After taking their powers and placing them in himself, he removes their collars and attempts to kill them before they recover. Shu, despite being drained of magical ability, unconsciously teleports the party to the distant Devour village.|$|E
