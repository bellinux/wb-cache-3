40|$|Ezetimibe is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of cholesterol absorption by enterocytes. Although ezetimibe minimally affects the absorption of triglyceride, it is unknown whether ezetimibe affects the secretion of the incretin hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1). It {{has been shown that}} ezetimibe-treated mice are protected from diet-induced insulin resistance. Since GIP and GLP- 1 promote the actions of insulin, we hypothesized that ezetimibe may affect the secretion of GIP and GLP- 1 by enteroendocrine cells into lymph in response to the intestinal absorption of a mixed meal (Ensure). To test this hypothesis, we used the lymph fistula rat model to determine GIP and GLP- 1 concentrations in lymph during the 2 h after the infusion <b>of</b> <b>Ensure.</b> Ezetimibe significantly reduced lymphatic cholesterol output during fasting, without coincident decreases in glucose, protein, and triglyceride outputs. However, ezetimibe did not influence cholesterol output after infusion <b>of</b> <b>Ensure.</b> Interestingly, ezetimibe significantly reduced the secretion of both GIP and GLP- 1 into lymph after the infusion <b>of</b> <b>Ensure.</b> Therefore, the inhibitory effect of ezetimibe on GIP and GLP- 1 secretion by enteroendocrine cells occurs outside of the effects of glucose, protein, or triglyceride secretion by the intestine...|$|R

5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign {{the average length of}} detention was only two months. Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on their release, promising not to talk about the Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E

5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while he still could. In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down.

5|$|However, David's successes were in {{many ways}} {{balanced}} by his failures.

Between 1141 and 1143, Comyn was the de facto bishop, and had control of the bishop's castle; but he was resented by the chapter. Despite controlling the town of Durham, David's only hope <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> his election and consecration was gaining the support of the Papal legate, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen.

5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v.

Such withholding of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their statutory duty <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> that unsuitable persons were not granted licences to run gaming establishments. Lord Reid stated that the requirement for natural justice in that case was clearly outweighed by the public interest.|$|E
5|$|Julian was now {{faced with}} a finely-balanced {{judgement}} call. The safer option was to ignore Chnodomar's challenge and to keep his forces in their fortified bases and request and await reinforcements, if necessary until the following year's campaign season. But the performance of Barbatio and the imperial comitatus in the recent campaign cast doubt on whether such reinforcements would be supplied and on their value if they were. Such a course would also expose Gaul to a massive Germanic invasion just when the harvest was due. Alternatively, he could fight Chnodomar alone. This offered {{the prospect of a}} decisive victory, since the Alamanni forces were now, unusually, concentrated and not divided into many disparate bands. This argument was strongly made by Florentius, the praefectus praetorio Galliarum (governor-general of Gaul), who had the crucial job <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> the army's recruits, pay and supplies. The Romans almost always won pitched battles with barbarians, because of their superior equipment, organisation and training. But in this case it was clearly a high-risk option because of the Germans' massive superiority in numbers.|$|E

5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint <b>of</b> <b>ensuring</b> a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} paternalism.|$|E

40|$|Engineered Surety Using the Risk Equation (EnSURE) {{is a new}} {{approach}} being developed by Sandia National Laboratories for determining and mitigating risk. The EnSURE approach {{is based on the}} risk equation, which can be defined by the following equation: R = (Pa) (1 -Pe) (C). Where R is risk, Pa is the likelihood of attack, Pe is the system effectiveness and C is the consequence. <b>EnSURE</b> considers each <b>of</b> the components of risk to help in assessing surety (e. g. security, safety, environmental) and providing for the most cost-effective ways to reduce risk. EnSURE is intended to help in evaluating and reducing the risk from either man-caused or natural events. It will help the decision-makers identify possible targets, evaluate the consequences of an event, assess the risk based on the threat and the existing conditions and then help in the application <b>of</b> mitigating measures. <b>EnSURE</b> is in the development stages.
