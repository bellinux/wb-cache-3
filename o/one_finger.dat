25|$|One of {{a number}} of {{different}} grips is illustrated to the right. Essentially {{the only difference is that}} the middle and index fingers are split and come down on each side of the seam. This causes more drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, slowing down the delivery. Slower balls are also bowled by using the off break grip and finger action used by off spinners. A slower delivery may also be achieved – less commonly – by using a leg spin grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper aspect of the ball with only <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> or with the knuckles.|$|E

25|$|Competitors race either {{individually}} or in {{teams in the}} manner of a relay race. If the egg falls from the spoon then competitors may be required to stop, retrieve, and reposition their egg; or to start again; or may even be disqualified. Due to the lesser penalty imposed for dropping the egg, and consequent encouragement of greater risk-taking, the first penalty scenario may result in a race that is faster overall. Common methods of cheating include sticking the egg to the spoon, or holding onto the egg with <b>one</b> <b>finger.</b> For an extra challenge, contestants might carry the spoon with both hands, with their teeth, or have their hands tied behind their backs.|$|E
25|$|Removing {{contact lenses}} {{incorrectly}} {{could result in}} damage to the lens and injury to the eye so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops out. With <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral canthus, the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins {{against the edge of}} lens allows the blink to break the capillary action that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable.|$|E

The only recurring criminal organization he fought was the Hand (The Hand, Murder for Sale, Chicago Crime, Crime Rides the Sea, and Realm of Doom), where he defeated <b>one</b> <b>Finger</b> of the organization in each book. In addition, the villain King Kauger from the Shadow story Wizard of Crime is also the unseen mastermind behind the events of Intimidation, Inc.|$|E
50|$|Snapping (or clicking) <b>one's</b> <b>fingers</b> is {{the act of}} {{creating}} a snapping or clicking sound with <b>one's</b> <b>fingers.</b> Primarily this is done by building tension between the thumb and another (middle, index, or ring) finger and then moving the other finger forcefully downward so it hits the palm of the same hand at a high speed. Alternatively, one can press the middle finger and thumb together and then fling the middle finger onto your palm.|$|R
5000|$|To cross <b>one's</b> <b>fingers</b> is a hand gesture {{commonly}} used to wish for luck. Occasionally it is interpreted {{as an attempt to}} implore God for protection.

25|$|Marilyn taught Genie to {{take her}} {{frustration}} out on inanimate objects in their yard and worked to verbally deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language she began to gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By {{the end of her}} stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> or loosely waving her hand depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated. In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to people talking even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as a Rifleman with Company F, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 28 November 1950. When all the other members of his fire team became casualties, creating a gap in the lines, during the initial phase of a vicious attack launched by a fanatical enemy of regimental strength against his company's hill position, Private CAFFERATA waged a lone battle with grenades and rifle fire as the attack gained momentum and the enemy threatened penetration through the gap and endangered the integrity of the entire defensive perimeter. Making a target of himself under the devastating fire from automatic weapons, rifles, grenades and mortars, he maneuvered up and down the line and delivered accurate and effective fire against the onrushing force, killing fifteen, wounding many more and forcing the others to withdraw so that reinforcements could move up and consolidate the position. Again fighting desperately against a renewed onslaught later that same morning when a hostile grenade landed in a shallow entrenchment occupied by wounded Marines, Private CAFFERATA rushed into the gully under heavy fire, seized the deadly missile in his right hand and hurled it free of his comrades before it detonated, severing part of <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> and seriously wounding him in the right hand and arm. Courageously ignoring the intense pain, he staunchly fought on until he was struck by a sniper's bullet and forced to submit to evacuation for medical treatment. Stouthearted and indomitable, Private CAFFERATA, by his fortitude, great personal valor and dauntless perseverance in the face of almost certain death, saved the lives of several of his fellow Marines and contributed essentially to the success achieved by his company in maintaining its defensive position against tremendous odds. His extraordinary heroism throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

Chebotareva described how Tatiana sometimes sat beside [...] "Volodia" [...] at the piano as he played a tune with <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> and talked {{to her in a}} low voice, wearing a mysterious expression on his face. Chebotareva also described how Tatiana and her sister Olga made excuses to come to the hospital to see Volodia.

Siddhartha was the first child born to Suddhodana and Queen Maya in twenty years of marriage and much interest surrounded the infant from royal society and the public alike.

500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.'

At one point, the singer picked and played up a black Gibson Flying V guitar. Larry Carroll for MTV wrote that the extent of Rihanna's ability to play the guitar was limited to playing it with <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> {{on one of the}} strings. However, he complimented Rihanna's overall performance, writing that her shoulder pads were [...] "nearly as huge as her presence". He went on to write that she [...] "half-sung, half-spoke" [...] the song. A reviewer for MTV UK agreed with Carroll, writing that [...] "halfway through the performance [...] donned a 'black flying v guitar' although we're not sure you could say she 'played' it!" [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone praised Rihanna's performance, writing [...] "if the introductory rules of rock stardom are 'teach thyself to pick slide,' 'tight clothes' and 'pyro!' then Rihanna has been paying attention in her 'Rockstar 101' classes after all".|$|E
500|$|Garran {{developed}} {{a strong relationship}} with Hughes, giving him legal advice on the World War I conscription plebiscites and on the range of regulations which were made under the War Precautions Act 1914. The War Precautions Regulations had a broad scope, and were generally supported by the High Court, which adopted a much more flexible approach to {{the reach of the}} Commonwealth's defence power during wartime. A substantial amount of Garran's work during the war involved preparing and carrying out the regulations. Many of them were directed at maximising the economic aspect of the war effort and ensuring supplies of goods to Australian troops; others were directed at controlling citizens or former citizens of the enemy Central Powers living in Australia. On one occasion, when Hughes had been informed that at a party hosted by a German man, the band had played [...] "Das Lied der Deutschen", Hughes asked Garran [...] "By the way, what is this tune?" [...] to which Garran replied that it was Haydn's melody to [...] "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser", and as it was used as the tune to several hymns [...] "it was probably sung in half a dozen churches in Sydney last Sunday." [...] Hughes then said [...] "Good Heavens! I have played that thing with <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> hundreds of times." ...|$|E
