5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> in the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E
5|$|After {{some years}} spent in Kent, perhaps in 625, Paulinus was consecrated a bishop. He {{accompanied}} Æthelburg of Kent, sister of King Eadbald of Kent, on her journey to Northumbria to marry King Edwin of Northumbria, and eventually succeeded in converting Edwin to Christianity. Paulinus also converted many of Edwin's subjects and built some churches. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> Paulinus baptised was a future saint, Hilda of Whitby. Following Edwin's death in 633, Paulinus and Æthelburg fled Northumbria, {{leaving behind a}} member of Paulinus' clergy, James the Deacon. Paulinus returned to Kent, where he became Bishop of Rochester. He received a pallium from the pope, symbolizing his appointment as Archbishop of York, but too late to be effective. After his death in 644, Paulinus was canonized as a saint and is now venerated in the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Anglican Churches.|$|E

She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that she was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying {{to get in touch with}} her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> {{who worked there}} had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon {{who had just been}} {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, most of {{the women}} and {{children}} had gathered in the sacristy of the church. As Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, thought to be the son of defender Anthony Wolf, stood up to rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, at least <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, were hiding in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they meant no harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be relatively safe. All of the women and children were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E

5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while Pete was {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} do better with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) {{and a couple of}} other people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete to loosen up, and asks <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him. Pete finally loosens up and begins to give in to Vicki's temptations, but NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) sets him straight, telling him to recall the day that he got married.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his difficult relationship with Price, Reeves {{had to deal with}} a few production problems during the shooting. On the first day, Price was thrown from his horse and sent back to his hotel to recover. The actor returned to work the following day. Towards the end of filming, a strike was called when the British technicians union learned the production company was not hiring a large enough crew as required by union rules. After an extra man was hired, the crew resumed working. On two occasions, Reeves was short of actors. Waddilove replaced an absent actor as a Roundhead officer during Wymark's one-day scene.

During his first few days as coach he benches several players who refuse to follow his rules—including Bindia Naik (Shilpa Shukla), his most experienced player. In response, Bindia repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonald's. During the lunch, local boys make a pass at Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they are acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> from behind with a cricket bat, telling him {{that there are no}} cowards in hockey. In an about-face, after the fight the women ask Khan to remain as their coach.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was at Chappaquiddick Island on {{the eastern end of}} Martha's Vineyard. He was hosting a party that he gave for the Boiler Room Girls, a group of young women who had worked on his brother Robert's ill-fated presidential {{campaign}} the year before. Kennedy left the party with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne. Driving a 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88, he attempted to cross the Dike Bridge (which did not have a guardrail at that time). Kennedy lost control of his vehicle and crashed in the Poucha Pond inlet, which was a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach and rescue Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene, with Kopechne still trapped inside the vehicle. He contacted authorities the next morning, but Kopechne's body had already been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E
