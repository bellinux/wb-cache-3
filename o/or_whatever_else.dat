500|$|A large grasshopper, {{such as a}} locust, {{can jump}} about a metre (twenty body lengths) without using its wings; the {{acceleration}} peaks at about 20g. Grasshoppers jump by extending their large back legs and pushing against the substrate (the ground, a twig, a blade of grass <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>else</b> they are standing on); the reaction force propels them into the air. They jump for several reasons; to escape from a predator, to launch themselves into flight, or simply to move from place to place. For the escape jump in particular there is strong selective pressure to maximize take-off velocity, since this determines the range. This means that the legs must thrust against the ground with both high force and a high velocity of movement. [...] However, a fundamental property of muscle is that it cannot contract with both high force and high velocity at the same time. Grasshoppers overcome this apparent contradiction by using a catapult mechanism to amplify the mechanical power produced by their muscles.|$|E
500|$|When Louis IX {{made his}} {{decision}} on 23 January 1264, {{it was entirely}} in favour of Henry III. The settlement starts out by reiterating the declarations of the two parties, where they place the decision fully {{in the hands of}} the French king. Louis invoked the difficulties England had suffered over the previous years, and stressed the importance of a resolution. Since the pope had already invalidated the provisions, Louis decided to [...] "...quash and invalidate all these provisions, ordinances, and obligations, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>else</b> they may be called...", and absolved the king from any adherence to them. Castles that were handed over to the barons as part of the agreement were to be given back to the king, and Henry should be free to appoint his own ministers. The only concession made to the barons was a general pardon extended to those involved in the conflict. The financial demands of King Henry were not mentioned. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, and was never likely to embrace the precedents set by the barons' infringement of Henry's authority. There was also the papal annulment to take into account, which the deeply pious Louis was not going to ignore. At the same time, Henry's wife Eleanor of Provencewho was Louis' sister-in-lawhad worked hard to procure a favourable decision for her husband. It was clear from the start though, that the French king had gone too far in his partisan decision, and that the settlement was little more than a dead letter.|$|E

A couple of them had been arrested with false prescriptions attempting to collect drugs for Elvis, quite a few had taken physical hits in the service of protecting Elvis and none were paid more than $500 a week.

2500|$|Final Fantasy All the Bravest was [...] {{critically}} panned.

[...] Pocketgamer strongly criticized the gameplay and in-app purchase system stating, [...] "There's hardly a game here to begin with - it's more a series of flashing lights to try and entice you to throw some cash down, cross your fingers, and hope {{you end up with a}} character you like." [...] Slide to Play criticized the game for having [...] "No rhyme, reason, or strategy to gameplay; the game is a thinly-disguised piggy bank for in-app purchases." [...] Digital Spy echoed the criticisms on the method of in-app purchases and poor gameplay, stating that it was [...] "almost a parody of the worst examples of free-to-play games" [...] and criticizing [...] "its reliance on predatory in-app purchases that exist solely to make loyal fans waste their money. As a free-to-play cash grab it would have still held some appeal, but the core gameplay is just too shallow without significant rewards to make it even worth the price of admission." [...] 1UP.com also stated, [...] "ATB is essentially a narrow tunnel you blindly run down, and where games typically have choices for you to make -- whether it be what skill to choose, what weapon to pick up, what player to substitute in, what kind of unit to build, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>else</b> -- there is nothing here." [...] In a rare move, IGN issued a public service announcement not to buy the game, and later cited the game for making money despite bad reviews and high prices. Pocket Tactics also gave a similar public service announcement to not buy the game stating, [...] "I have been an apologist in the past for Square Enix’s unusually high price points for its Final Fantasy iOS ports. [...] Developers have to make money, and no one should begrudge that. But the way that All The Bravest goes about it is so gauche, so ill-mannered, that it can only be interpreted as a measure of Square Enix’s disdain for its own fans." [...] Kotaku stated that the game is emblematic of Square Enix's lack of respect for fans, and a desire to milk the franchise for money. GamesRadar ranked it as the 44th worst game ever made. The staff accused its developers of cashing in on the Final Fantasy brand. US Gamer cited the game as being the most notable misstep Square Enix had done since CEO Yosuke Matsuda took over, though it also noted that the project had begun under the previous CEO Yoichi Wada.|$|E

Sugg stated: “I’d do my share of the work. I’d get up early and feed the stock <b>or</b> do <b>whatever</b> <b>else</b> I was told.

25|$|While seen as {{an enemy}} of the United States and Colombian governments, Escobar was a hero to many in Medellín (especially the poor people).

A lifelong sports fan, he was credited with building football fields and multi-sports courts, as well as sponsoring children's football teams. Escobar was also responsible for the construction of houses and football fields in western Colombia, which gained him popularity among the poor. He worked hard to cultivate his Robin Hood image, and frequently distributed money through housing projects and other civic activities, which gained him notable popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. Some people from Medellín often helped Escobar avoid police capture by serving as lookouts, hiding information from authorities, <b>or</b> doing <b>whatever</b> <b>else</b> they could to protect him.

50|$|The {{term has}} hence {{referred}} to a beadle in a university, a pursuivant or herald; particularly, in Roman Catholic canon law, which was largely inspired by Roman law.

This was done in countries where the ecclesiastical forum, in its substantial integrity, is recognized. He thus acts as constable and sheriff. His guarantee of his delivery of the summons is evidence of the knowledge of his obligation to appear, either to stand trial, to give testimony, <b>or</b> to do <b>whatever</b> <b>else</b> may be legally enjoined by the judge; his statement becomes the basis of a charge of contumacy against anyone refusing to obey summons.|$|R

40|$|Moss (2013) {{argues that}} degrees of belief or credences can amount to {{knowledge}} {{in much the}} way that full beliefs can. This paper explores {{a new kind of}} objective Bayesianism designed to take us some way toward securing such knowledge-constituting credences, <b>or</b> 'probabilistic knowledge'. <b>Whatever</b> <b>else</b> it takes for an agent’s credences to amount to knowledge, their success, or accuracy must be the product of cognitive ability or skill. The brand of Bayesianism developed here helps ensure this ability condition is satisfied. Cognitive ability, in turn, helps make credences valuable in other ways: it helps mitigate their dependence on epistemic luck, for example. What we end up with, {{at the end of the}} day, are credences that are particularly good candidates for constituting probabilistic knowledge. What’s more, examining the character of these credences teaches us something important about what the pursuit of probabilistic knowledge demands from us. It does not demand that we give hypotheses equal treatment, by affording them equal credence. Rather, it demands that we give them equal consideration, by affording them an equal chance of being discovered...|$|R

Day met and went on to marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sabrina met an apothecary, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an acrostic poem. She contacted Day for advice, and he told her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens.
