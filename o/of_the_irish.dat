5|$|It is {{believed}} that some Irish MacIntyres descend from native Irish stock whose ancestors {{were living in the}} same areas in which Scottish MacIntyres settled and who assumed the Scottish surname, rather than Macateer, as an anglicization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> name Mac an tSoir.|$|E
5|$|Partly due to Maurice's pro-treaty activity, Moore Hall was burnt by anti-treaty {{forces in}} 1923, {{during the final}} months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Civil War. Moore {{eventually}} received compensation of £7,000 from the government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Free State. By this time George and Maurice had become estranged, mainly because of an unflattering portrait of the latter which appeared in Hail and Farewell. Tension also arose {{as a result of}} religious differences: Maurice frequently made donations to the Roman Catholic Church from estate funds. Moore later sold {{a large part of the}} estate to the Irish Land Commission for £25,000.|$|E

5|$|The Easter Rising was a {{rebellion}} staged in Ireland during Easter Week, 1916. It was mounted by Irish republicans with {{the aims of}} ending British rule in Ireland and establishing an Irish Republic. Organised by the Military Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Republican Brotherhood, the rising lasted from 24–30 April 1916. Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Volunteers, joined by the smaller Irish Citizen Army, along with 200 members of Cumann na mBan, seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic independent of Britain.|$|E

5|$|Brendan Finucane {{was born}} on 16 October 1920, the first child of Thomas and Florence Finucane of 13 Rathmines Road, Rathmines, Dublin, Ireland. His mother was English, {{originally}} from Leicester. Her mother had travelled across Canada {{at a young age}} and Florence moved to Dublin to seek her own adventure. She accepted the risks associated with living in the city. In 1919, she met Thomas Andrew Finucane, who had been involved in the Irish Rebellion. Thomas Finucane had been taught mathematics at college by Éamon de Valera, leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> opposition. As a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Volunteers, he served under de Valera's command in the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. Thomas' father—Brendan Finucane's grandfather— was an Englishman who had served in the King's Own Scottish Borderers on the North-West Frontier Province. Thomas Finucane had ceased his political activism shortly before the couple married in October 1919, and after Florence had converted to Catholicism.|$|E

5|$|Edward Martyn was a {{neighbour}} of Lady Gregory, and it {{was during}} a visit to his home, Tullira Castle, in 1896 that she first met W. B. Yeats. Discussions between the three of them, over the following year or so, led to the founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Literary Theatre in 1899. Lady Gregory undertook fundraising, and the first programme consisted of Martyn's The Heather Field and Yeats's The Countess Cathleen.|$|E
5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate {{and from the}} social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.|$|E
5|$|From 1865 to 1867, British {{authorities}} {{rounded up}} supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Republican Brotherhood, or Fenians, an Irish independence movement, and transported sixty-two {{of them to}} Western Australia. In 1869, John Boyle O'Reilly escaped on the American whaling ship Gazelle and settled in Boston. Later that year, pardons were issued {{to many of the}} imprisoned Fenians, after which only eight militant Fenians remained in Western Australia's penal system.|$|E

5|$|In Ireland, the {{population}} was split into three main socio-political groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and were also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. He had trained up a large Catholic army {{in support of the}} king and had weakened the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Parliament, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement {{at the same time as}} promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to Presbyterians. As a result, all three groups had become disaffected. Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him. In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared {{in the latter part of}} this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> parliament.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of his}} life, Yeats was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> Republican Brotherhood.
