40|$|Method of {{optimizing}} {{the optical}} network transmission in access network {{has been investigated}} in many years. Unidirectional optical transmission system is the earliest method of delivering the information. In recent years, bidirectional optical transmission system {{is the most popular}} network and shall be the first right of refusal to deploy nowadays. It is justify enough by the massive deployment of the popular state-of-the-art network named Passive Optical Network (PON) in Fiber To The Home (FTTH) technologies. Combining 3 wavelengths includes (1) 1310 nm, (2) 1490 nm, and (3) 1550 nm within a fiber is the method used on Gigabit Capable Passive Optical Network (GPON) or Gigabit Ethernet Passive Optical Network (GEPON/EPON). Combining 2 different wavelengths for uplink and downlink on Small Form Pluggable (SFP) lasers also has been a method used to optimized and saved the fiber infrastructure. Compared those techniques, the research optimization focusing on introducing a passive <b>optical</b> <b>duplexer</b> that combined the same wavelength from both end with the element of monitoring via different wavelength to confirm the network availability. In the design, a unidirectional converter able to operate at a nominal 1310 nm or 1550 nm windows shall be demonstrated up to 10 Gbps Ethernet signal...|$|E
