5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E

White became the English department chair in 1955 and once again in 1961. As chair, White recruited faculty members from established universities, fought for the recognition of her staff, and worked with the faculty members individually, as she would with her students. She wrote in the summers, often while she traveled. Aided by Guggenheim Fellowships, White visited most of Europe. On her first fellowship, she traveled in Italy and studied at Oxford University and the British Museum between 1928 and 1929 for a year. While abroad, White wrote English Devotional Literature, 1600–1640 and was inspired to start her first novel, A Watch in the Night. In mid-1930, she received her second fellowship to verify her work in England. She received {{a grant from the}} university to finish her 1935 The Metaphysical Poets in London. White was a visiting scholar at the California Huntington Library between 1939 and 1940, where she worked on Social Criticism in Popular Religious Literature of the Sixteenth Century. She returned to the library in mid-1941. White was a visiting professor at Barnard College between 1943 and 1944, and a visiting professor at Columbia University during the summer of 1948. She also had a strong interest in poetry, though she didn't think highly of her own.|$|E

The implication is that bisphosphonates may not be the initiating cause of ONJ and that other pre-existing or concurrent systemic and/or local dental factors are involved.|$|E

Because Kershaw's medical certificate (produced by her local physician Dr Walter Scott Joss) recorded the diagnosis as [...] "asbestos poisoning" [...] she was ineligible for National Health Insurance sickness benefits. As the illness was linked to her occupation, the insurers advised her that she should instead seek sickness benefits from her employers, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and wrote to Turner Brothers on her behalf on several occasions. However, Turner Brothers refused to pay any benefits because asbestos-related illness was not a recognised <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> at that time, and instructed their insurance company to [...] "repudiate the claim" [...] as it would be [...] "exceedingly dangerous" [...] to accept [...] "any liability whatever in such a case."

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the annual}} {{analysis}} of the incidence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in Poland is to evaluate {{the extent of the}} incidence and to identify its causes as well as activities involving factors that are harmful or annoying {{to such an extent that}} they result in <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases.</b> Material and Methods: <b>Occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> reporting forms supplied to the Central Register of <b>Occupational</b> <b>Diseases</b> were used as the study material. Results: In 2014, there were 2351 cases of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> recorded, i. e., 16. 5 cases per 100 thousand of employees. The most numerous categories comprised infectious or parasitic diseases (borreliosis), pneumoconiosis, voice disorders and hearing loss (in total 79. 7 % of cases). The main causative factors of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> were as follows: industrial dust containing free silica, tick-transmitted Borrelia spirochete, and the way the work is done, including excessive vocal effort, and noise. The highest incidence per 100 thousand workers were recorded in mining and quarrying (296), manufacturing (24. 9), education (24. 6), agriculture and forestry (24. 2) sectors. Conclusions: Compared with the previous year, there was a slight increase in the number of cases of certified <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> (6. 2 %), primarily due to the increased incidence of Lyme disease. The incidence of voice disorders among teachers continues to vary considerably in individual provinces (0 – 11. 3 / 10 000), reflecting the use of non-uniform diagnostic and certification methods.

40|$|Registries of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> {{in various}} European {{countries}} differ considerably in criteria for notification and recognition, statistical data provided {{and the legal}} and social security context. Therefore, figures on <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> are not comparable between countries and are often regarded as not reliable even within a country. Still, registries of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> are an important source for policy on occupational safety and health. To evaluate registries of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in European (EU) countries {{for their ability to}} provide appropriate information for preventive policy. Contact persons of national registries for <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in six countries were sent a questionnaire on the objectives of their registry and on the quality of monitoring time trends and alerting to new risks. An auditor then visited each contact person, discussed the completed questionnaire and sent a draft audit report to the contact person for verification. Two reviewers then established a quality score based on the verified audit report. The results of the audit were sent to each contact person, who was asked to evaluate the usefulness of the audit instrument for future quality improvement of the registry. The objectives of the registries assessed in the six countries were compensation, provision of statistics, prevention and research. The average quality was rated 3. 2 (SD 2. 2) out of 10 for monitoring <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> and 5. 3 (SD 1. 4) out of 10 for alerting to new risks. The main reasons for the low scores were inadequate education and training of physicians and poor participation of notifying physicians.
