40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the dynamic}} process <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> welding for large-sized plates is studied by {{numerical}} simulation. Folding deformation {{could be found}} during the process <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> welding based on the studies on the morphological changes of the flyer plate at different time. The calculation results are in good agreement with the practical projects. The study shows that folding deformation is a crucial problem which should be noticed in the process <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> welding, {{and the reasons for}} folding deformation are discussed in the paper. The conclusion can give reference for the development <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> welding technology...|$|R
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. With the use <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and airbags reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.|$|E
5|$|At 3:00a.m., the paramilitaries {{demolished}} the Roman Catholic {{church of}} the Pilgrimage to the Blessed Virgin Mary in Voćin. They used the 550-year-old structure as an ammunition depot. In {{the wake of the}} explosion, a single wall of the structure remained standing. It is estimated that several tons <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> were used for the purpose. At the same time, approximately 20 other Croat inhabitants of villages of Bokane, Krašković, Miokovićevo and Zvečevo, further to the south, were reportedly killed.|$|E
5|$|Bani Na'im grew {{considerably}} in population {{during the early}} 20th century. In 1936, the town participated in the Arab revolt against the British authorities. In December 1937, British forces ordered the demolition of a house whose owners were accused of involvement in an anti-British incident near the town. They fined Bani Na'im's mukhtars (town chiefs) 50 British pounds and ordered the residents to carry 200 kilograms <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> to the building for its demolition and watch the explosion as a deterrent measure.|$|E

5|$|By September 1943, Neddermeyer's {{team had}} grown from five people to fifty. That month, John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer's request. Von Neumann was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use <b>of</b> <b>explosives,</b> be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E
5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons <b>of</b> <b>explosives,</b> gasoline, and trucks as deck cargo. A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, {{and asked if they}} had enough food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, {{to the extent}} that half of global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|ISEE {{was founded}} in Pittsburgh in 1974, when a small group <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> {{engineers}} came together to discuss how to advance the science and art <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> engineering. Since then the ISEE has grown to over 4000 members with 43 local chapters.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> welding and the influences <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> welding parameters on the welding quality, this paper presents numerical simulation <b>of</b> the <b>explosive</b> welding <b>of</b> Al-Mg plates using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. The multi-physical phenomena <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> welding, including acceleration of the flyer plate driven by explosive detonation, oblique collision of the flyer and base plates, jetting phenomenon {{and the formation of}} wavy interface can be reproduced in the simulation. The characteristics <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> welding are analyzed based on the simulation results. The mechanism of wavy interface formation is mainly due to oscillation of the collision point on the bonding surfaces. In addition, the impact velocity and collision angle increase with the increase of the welding parameters, such as explosive thickness and standoff distance, resulting in enlargement of the interfacial waves...|$|R

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1942, when there were fears of a German victory in the Middle East, Mishmar HaEmek {{was used as a}} {{training}} camp by the British army. 160 Jewish volunteers, who would later become members of the Palmach branch of the Haganah, were trained by Royal Engineers in sabotage and wireless operation. Several tons <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> were hidden in caches in case the area came under German occupation. This program was terminated immediately upon the training of the volunteers, and orders issued for the collection of all equipment and explosives to be returned to the British.|$|E
5|$|Kistiakowsky {{brought with}} him to Los Alamos a {{detailed}} knowledge of all the studies into shaped charges, <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> like Composition B, and of the procedures used at the ERL in 1942 and 1943. Increasingly, the ERL itself would be drawn into the implosion effort; its deputy director Duncan MacDougall also {{took charge of the}} Manhattan Project's Project Q. Kistiakowsky replaced Neddermeyer as head of E (for explosives) Division in February 1944.|$|E
5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E

5|$|On August 19, Alberto Matxain Beraza {{was arrested}} in the French town of Le Corbier in Savoy, next to the French Alps. He was held along with fellow ETA members Aitzol Etxaburu and Andoni Sarasola. They were {{responsible}} for ETA’s logistics operation, and had the job of supplying weapons and explosives to the ETA cells operating in Spanish soil. The arrest led {{to the discovery of}} almost a tone <b>of</b> <b>explosives,</b> hidden by ETA in 12 small caches around France. On October 11, Joanes Larretxea {{was arrested in}} Rivières, Gard along with top ETA member Iurgi Mendinueta Mintegi.|$|E

Lieutenant Colonel Radenko Radojčić was tasked with the storage of a substantial quantity <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> in Zagreb and its surrounding areas and the subsequent planting of explosive devices in designated locations. The explosives and other munitions were stored across several sites.|$|E

5|$|The Special Operations Executive were {{approached}} {{to see if}} its agents could destroy the dock gates. They decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> required would have needed too many agents to carry them. The Royal Navy was also unable to mount an operation, as St Nazaire is 8km (5 miles) up the Loire estuary. Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range.|$|E
5|$|The first World War I {{air raid}} on London, Operation Turkenkreuz, {{took place on}} 13 June 1917, when 20 Gotha G.IV bombers {{attacked}} the capital. The raid struck a number of sites including Liverpool Street. Seven tons <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> were dropped on the station, killing 162 people and injuring 432. Three bombs hit the station, of which two exploded, having fallen through the train shed roof, near to two trains, causing multiple fatalities. It was the deadliest single raid on Britain during the war.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions in}} exploration {{of problems in}} numerical hydrodynamics. For example, with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics. Other contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model <b>of</b> <b>explosives.</b> During the 1930s, Von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.|$|E
