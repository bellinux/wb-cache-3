5|$|A {{total of}} 65 ABC affiliates—28% of the network—did not clear the {{available}} timeslot for the film, {{even with the}} offer of The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent, to pay all fines for language to the Federal Communications Commission. In the end, however, no complaints were lodged against ABC affiliates who showed Ryan, perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the unedited rebroadcast of the film. Additionally, some ABC affiliates in other markets that were near affected markets, such as Youngstown, Ohio, ABC affiliate WYTV (which is viewable {{in parts of the}} Columbus, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh markets, none of which aired the film) and Gainesville, Florida, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV (which is viewable in parts of the <b>Orlando</b> <b>and</b> Tampa markets), still aired the film and gave those nearby markets the option of viewing the film. TNT and Turner Classic Movies have also broadcast the film.|$|E

5|$|While over land, {{a surface}} {{circulation}} developed near <b>Orlando,</b> <b>and</b> the National Hurricane Center designated {{the system as}} Subtropical Depression One. The subtropical designation was because the convection was far-removed from the center. Additionally, an upper-level trough provided outflow, instead of an anticyclone as found in tropical cyclones. The subtropical depression moved to the east-northeast, and steadily organized as deep convection developed closer to the center. Initially, the strongest winds were 175mi (280km) from the center, but by the morning of October5, the distance decreased to 85mi (135km). Based on its organization and winds of 40mph (65km/h), the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Leslie.|$|E
