5|$|Plutonium also {{exhibits}} valence states {{between 3 and 7}} inclusive, {{and thus}} is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraction}} of beryllium from its compounds {{is a difficult}} process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, {{and its ability to}} reduce water when its <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> is removed. The United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale {{extraction of}} beryllium. Beryllium production technology is in early stages of development in Russia after a 20-year hiatus.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium alloys often {{undergo a}} surface treatment. Electrochemical {{conditions}} in the bath are carefully adjusted so that uniform pores, several nanometers wide, appear in the metal's <b>oxide</b> <b>film.</b> These pores allow the oxide to grow much thicker than passivating conditions would allow. At {{the end of the}} treatment, the pores are allowed to seal, forming a harder-than-usual surface layer. If this coating is scratched, normal passivation processes take over to protect the damaged area.|$|E

40|$|Reactive {{ion beam}} sputter {{deposition}} of aluminum simultaneous with low energy arrival of oxygen ions at the deposition surface enables {{the formation of}} highly transparent aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>films.</b> Thick (12 200 A), adherent, low stress, reactively deposited aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> were found to provide some abrasion resistance to polycarbonate substrates. The reactively deposited aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> are also slightly more hydrophobic and more transmitting in the UV than aluminum oxide deposited from an aluminum oxide target. Simultaneous reactive sputter deposition of aluminum along with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE Teflon) produces fluoropolymer-filled aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> which are lower in stress, about the same in transmittance, but more wetting than reactively deposited aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>films.</b> Deposition properties, processes and potential applications for these coatings will be discussed...|$|R

25|$|The {{aluminum}} oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the metallic aluminum against aggressive chemical reactions from the electrolyte. However, the converted layer of {{aluminum oxide}} {{is usually not}} homogeneous. It forms a complex multilayer structured laminate of amorphous, crystalline and porous crystalline aluminum oxide mostly covered with small residual parts of unconverted aluminum hydroxide. For this reason, {{in the formation of}} the anode foil, the <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> is structured by a special chemical treatment so that either an amorphous oxide or a crystalline oxide is formed. The amorphous oxide variety yields higher mechanical and physical stability and fewer defects, thus increasing the long term stability and lowering the leakage current.|$|E
25|$|Architectural copper is, however, {{susceptible}} to corrosive attack under certain conditions. Oxidizing acids, oxidizing heavy-metal salts, alkalis, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and some sulfur and ammonium compounds can expedite copper corrosion. Precipitation {{in areas with}} a pH less than 5.5 may corrode copper, possibly before a patina or protective <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> has the time to form. Acidic precipitation, known as acid rain, is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing, or other processes that release sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Erosion corrosion may occur when acidic water from a non-copper roof that does not neutralise the acidity, such as tile, slate, wood, or asphalt, falls on a small area of copper. Line corrosion can occur if the drip edge of an inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper. Proper water-shedding design and detailing, which reduces the dwell time of acidic water on metal surfaces, can prevent the majority of atmospheric corrosion problems.|$|E
25|$|Certain conditions, such as low {{concentrations}} of oxygen or high {{concentrations of}} species such as chloride which complete as anions, can interfere with a given alloy's ability to re-form a passivating film. In the worst case, {{almost all of the}} surface will remain protected, but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> in a few critical points. Corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified, and can cause corrosion pits of several types, depending upon conditions. While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances, they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal, since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process. In extreme cases, the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view. These problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails. Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys, but it can be prevented by control of the alloy's environment.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to deposit {{zirconium}} <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> by magnetron sputtering process at different argon partial pressure values of 45 %, 55 %, 62 % and 67 %. The effect of argon partial pressure on structural, optical and wettability properties of zirconium <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> is investigated in this research work. The increase in argon partial pressure leads to increase in intensity of (111) peak for zirconium <b>oxide</b> thin <b>films</b> as observed by X-ray Diffraction. The average crystallite size of zirconium <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> increases from 19 nm to 25 nm with increase in argon partial pressure.

500|$|The pure {{element is}} {{relatively}} stable in air in bulk form, due to passivation of a protective <b>oxide</b> (...) <b>film</b> that forms on the surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10µm when yttrium is heated to 750°C in water vapor. When finely divided, however, yttrium is very unstable in air; shavings or turnings {{of the metal}} can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding 400°C. Yttrium nitride (YN) is formed when the metal is heated to 1000°C in nitrogen.|$|E
500|$|Cobalt is a weakly {{reducing}} {{metal that}} is protected from oxidation by a passivating <b>oxide</b> <b>film.</b> It is attacked by halogens and sulfur. Heating in oxygen produces Co3O4 which loses oxygen at [...] {{to give the}} monoxide CoO. The metal reacts with fluorine (F2) at 520K to give CoF3; with chlorine (Cl2), bromine (Br2) and iodine (I2), producing equivalent binary halides. It does not react with hydrogen gas (H2) or nitrogen gas (N2) even when heated, but it does react with boron, carbon, phosphorus, arsenic and sulfur. At ordinary temperatures, it reacts slowly with mineral acids, and very slowly with moist, but not with dry, air.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extremely}} thin <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> of a tantalum electrolytic capacitor, {{the dielectric}} layer, must be formed in an amorphous structure. Changing the amorphous structure into a crystallized structure {{is reported to}} increase the conductivity by 1000 times, combined with an enlargement of the oxide volume. The field crystallization followed by a dielectric breakdown {{is characterized by a}} sudden rise in leakage current within a few milliseconds, from nanoamp magnitude to amp magnitude in low-impedance circuits. Increasing current flow can accelerate in an [...] "avalanche effect" [...] and rapidly spread through the metal/oxide. This can result in various degrees of destruction from rather small, burned areas on the oxide to zigzag burned streaks covering large areas of the pellet or complete oxidation of the metal. If the current source is unlimited a field crystallization may cause a capacitor short circuit. [...] In this circumstance, the failure can be catastrophic if there is nothing to limit the available current, as the series resistance of the capacitor can become very low.|$|E
