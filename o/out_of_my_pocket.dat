60|$|Then I took {{a little}} book <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> it was my {{favourite}} copy of the Ingoldsby Legends--and began to read.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her, {{and she looked}} at me. Then I took the double-barrelled pistol <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> and gave it to her.|$|E
60|$|I took ten cents <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> {{and held}} it where the light could glitter from every point of its surface full in his face.|$|E
60|$|I {{have only}} once in my life picked a pocket, and then (perhaps through some absent-mindedness) I picked my own. My act can really with some reason be so described. For in taking things <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket</b> I {{had at least one}} of the more tense and quivering {{emotions}} of the thief; I had a complete ignorance and a profound curiosity as to what I should find there. Perhaps it would be the exaggeration of eulogy to call me a tidy person. But I can always pretty satisfactorily account for all my possessions. I can always tell where they are, and what I have done with them, so long as I can keep them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> If once anything slips into those unknown abysses, I wave it a sad Virgilian farewell. I suppose that the things that I have dropped into <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> are still there; the same presumption applies to the things that I have dropped into the sea. But I regard the riches stored in both these bottomless chasms with the same reverent ignorance. They tell us that on the last day the sea will give up its dead; and I suppose that on the same occasion long strings of extraordinary things will come running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> But I have quite forgotten what any of them are; and there is really nothing (excepting the money) that I shall be at all surprised at finding among them.|$|R
60|$|MANGAN. Not a penny <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket.</b> The {{syndicate}} {{found the}} money: {{they knew how}} useful I should be {{to them in the}} Government.|$|R
60|$|To {{keep up the}} circulation, I {{ran around}} the island a dozen times or so, and clambered across its rocky {{backbone}} as many times more-- all of which was of greater service to me, as I afterward discovered, than merely to warm me up. In {{the midst of this}} exercise I wondered if I had lost anything <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> while rolling over and over in the sand. A search showed the absence <b>of</b> <b>my</b> revolver and pocket-knife. The first Yellow Handkerchief had taken; but the knife had been lost in the sand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' {{said the}} doctor, {{leaning back in}} his chair, 'I always take 'em <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> before I eat. My pockets are rather tight. Ha, ha, ha!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Perhaps {{you will}} first read the document.' I drew it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> {{gave it to}} him, and retired. He should be alone while he read it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take the {{handcuffs}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b> This side. Go over to Gorsech with them. Gorsech, snap those irons on Snell's wrists. Now, Snell, {{back here to}} the right of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{vice-consul}} {{was against}} it. [...] "I would rather lend {{him the money}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket.</b> How {{are you going to}} get along yourself, if you let him have so much?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{runs around}} to {{the light of the}} big blaze, and pulls the Handbook <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> inside <b>pocket.</b> I kind of laughed when I felt it in my hands --I reckon I was some daffy with the {{sensation}} of excitement.|$|R
60|$|MITCHENER. Ive {{subscribed to}} the {{regiment}}al band all my life. I bought two sarrusophones for it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket.</b> When I sang Tosti's Goodbye for Ever at Knightsbridge in 1880, the whole regiment wept. You {{are too young}} to remember that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Must {{have slipped}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> in the smash-up," [...] he thought. [...] "Well, I'll {{have to make}} the best of it, only I don't want to carry off another person's property." ...|$|E
60|$|Instinctively I {{let go of}} the pistol, {{snatched}} {{my right}} hand <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> and brought it up in a belated parry, and then let out with my left full in his chest.|$|E
60|$|To wait, {{listening}} again, in {{the darkness}} of that unknown region, was more than I had courage for. The moment I was down on the floor, I pulled the lantern <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> and raised the shade.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{have been}} willin' {{to give a}} good deal more'n that right <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket,</b> poor as trade has been, than to lose the snuggest lodgin'-place in this town. We'll never find anythin' that {{will come up with}} that shed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Leslie. [...] "I {{gave him}} a round sum, part <b>of</b> it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket,</b> for I couldn't in the {{meantime}} think of a suitable entry--all the directors don't agree with you. I know he started, but he has never come back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Larks and {{starlings}} chiefly, {{but there}} were other kinds amongst 'em. Why, sir, they flew about my head and round the lantern like clouds of snowflakes. I was sittin' on the lantern just as Shales is sittin' now, and the birds came so thick that I had to pull my sou'-wester down over my eyes, and hold up my hands sometimes before my face to protect myself, for they hit me all over. I snapped at 'em, and caught 'em as fast as I could use my hands--gave their heads a screw, and crammed 'em into <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> In a short time the pockets were all as full as they could hold--coat, vest, and trousers. I had to do it so fast that many of 'em wasn't properly killed, and some came alive agin, hopped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> and flew away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take them lil' silver bottle <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> {{and pull}} the top off him," [...] he said very slowly; and when Amadu had done so he gulped down a draught of lukewarm brandy before he spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, girls," [...] said I, {{pulling a}} paper <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> [...] "you {{must know that}} your father is getting to be famous by means of these 'House and Home Papers.' Here is a letter I have just received:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is another}} thing to consider," [...] {{continued}} Dave. [...] "It wouldn't be right to let Doctor Clay stand for the expense of that broken window. I think I'll send him {{the price of the}} glass <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> money." ...|$|E
6000|$|I took it, trembling, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{waistcoat}} <b>pocket</b> {{and handed}} it across to him without a word. The superintendent gazed {{at it for a}} moment in silence; then, in a tone of the profoundest commiseration, he said slowly, [...] "Mr. Tait, I grieve to be obliged to contradict you. This is our own specimen of the gold Wulfric!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} could. I never checked him, {{no matter how}} extravagant he was, an' yet I've seen him spend his whole week's wages at this very stand in one afternoon. And even after his money had all gone that way, I've paid for {{peppermint}} and ginger <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket</b> just to cure his stomach ache." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} Mr. Parr's motion to take from Mr. Hodder his living will go through. And still I urge him not to resign. I am not a rich man, even when such {{property}} as I have is compared to moderate fortunes of these days, but I would pay his salary willingly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket</b> rather than see him go....|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] said Mr. Deane, {{glancing at}} the reward of merit in the decanter. [...] "But what do you want?" [...] he added, {{pinching}} the dimpled chin fondly,--"to coax some more sovereigns <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> for your bazaar? Eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|The blowing of the coach-horn in {{the yard}} was a seasonable diversion, which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire, in the mingled pride and diffidence of having a purse (which I took <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket),</b> if there were {{anything}} to pay.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{having nothing}} to meet a balance of some twenty or thirty {{thousand}} dollars of unpaid debt is what you call low water, the tide is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> certainly. But, I shall not despair; I am young, and have a noble, manly profession." ...|$|E
6000|$|Snow was {{beginning}} to fall. A cold night was coming on. After dark I hunted around in the railroad yards until I found an empty refrigerator car. In I climbed--not into the ice-boxes, but into the car itself. I swung the heavy doors shut, and their edges, covered with strips of rubber, sealed the car air-tight. The walls were thick. There was no way for the outside cold to get in. But the inside was just as cold as the outside. How to raise the temperature was the problem. But trust a [...] "profesh" [...] for that. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> I dug up three or four newspapers. These I burned, one at a time, {{on the floor of}} the car. The smoke rose to the top. Not a bit of the heat could escape, and, comfortable and warm, I passed a beautiful night. I didn't wake up once.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Waiting to {{take our}} luggage off upon a truck,' said Mark. 'He'd have come for it by-and-bye, but I engaged him for a very {{reasonable}} charge (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket)</b> to sit along with me and make me jolly; and I am jolly; and if I was rich enough to contract with him to wait upon me once a day, to be looked at, I'd never be anything else.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Brian Hayes {{discussed}} a Travesty algorithm in Scientific American in November 1983. The article provided a garbled William Faulkner passage: When {{he got on}} the table, he come in. He never come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket</b> as a measure of protecting the company against riot and bloodshed. And when he said. [...] "You tell me a bus ticket, let alone write out no case histories. Then the law come back with a knife!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why, I'll {{tell you}} what I say,' says I. 'I say let's settle this thing right here now. I don't see any use of wasting any more time.' I took a {{nickel-plated}} [...] .38 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> and clicked the cylinder around a few times.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've lost my note book," [...] replied Burton; [...] "it {{must have}} dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> when I jumped the fence. Just {{wait a minute}} while I go look for it," [...] and he {{returned}} to the fence, vaulted it and disappeared behind the bushes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right you are!" [...] Mr. Coulson declared, falling {{a little}} over on one side. [...] "Take it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b> Be careful of it now. There's five hundred francs there, and the plans of a loom which I wouldn't sell for a good many thousands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't s'pose," [...] said old Peter, [...] "that I'm goin' to say anythin' to keep money <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> neighbor's <b>pockets.</b> We don't do {{that way}} in these parts. But I've told the gals they're not to speak another word about it, so you needn't give your mind no worry on that score. And now let's go in to supper. If you're as hungry as I am, there won't be many of them fish left fur breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Part of it, perhaps. But {{the bulk}} of the money you've taken from the Champions of Irish Liberty, most <b>of</b> which came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father's own <b>pocket,</b> and {{practically}} all the money he gave you to invest for him, you have withheld for your own use." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{go to that}} woman of Marmaduke's," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Lind, [...] "and try whether she can persuade her brother to commute {{his interest in the}} company, and go back to America, or to the devil. I will take care that he gets good terms, even if I have to make them up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket.</b> If the worst comes, she must be persuaded to leave Marmaduke. Offer her money. Women of that sort drive a hard bargain; but they have their price." ...|$|R
