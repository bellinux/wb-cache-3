Dixie Carter was upset at Joe's comments prior to the main event, believing Joe tried to go [...] "into business for himself."

Jim Foster, who had by then {{been active in}} gay politics for 10 years, resented the newcomer's asking for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, [...] "There's an <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> in the Democratic Party. You don't get to dance unless you put up the chairs. I've never seen you put up the chairs." [...] Milk was furious at the patronizing snub, and the conversation {{marked the beginning of}} an antagonistic relationship between the [...] "Alice" [...] Club and Harvey Milk. Some gay bar owners, still battling police harassment and unhappy with what they saw as a timid approach by Alice to established authority in the city, decided to endorse him.|$|E

500|$|Nelson's fleet reached Syracuse in Sicily on 19 July {{and took}} on {{essential}} supplies. There the admiral wrote letters describing {{the events of}} the previous months: [...] "It is an <b>old</b> <b>saying,</b> 'the Devil's children have the Devil's luck.' I cannot find, or at this moment learn, beyond vague conjecture where the French fleet are gone to. All my ill fortune, hitherto, has proceeded from want of frigates." [...] Meanwhile, the French were securing Egypt by the Battle of the Pyramids. By 24 July, the British fleet was resupplied and, having determined that the French must be somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, Nelson sailed again {{in the direction of the}} Morea. [...] On 28 July, at Coron, Nelson finally obtained intelligence describing the French attack on Egypt and turned south across the Mediterranean. His scouts, HMS Alexander and HMS Swiftsure, sighted the French transport fleet at Alexandria on the afternoon of 1 August.|$|E
500|$|Food was eaten from wooden or pewter trenchers with two-tined forks, large spoons, {{and hunting}} knives. Dishware was not popular {{since it was}} easily {{breakable}} and tended to dull knives quickly. Unlike the Quakers and Puritans, feasting {{with an abundance of}} food and drink was never discouraged and practiced as often as was feasible. Generally, backcountry cuisine did not share the religious austerity of the North nor the refinement of the South and was therefore denigrated by outsiders. An apparent lack of fastidiousness in preparing the food provoked further criticism from many sources. The Anglican Woodmason characterized backcountry cooking as [...] "exceedingly filthy and most execrable". Others told of matrons washing their feet in the cook pot, that it was considered unlucky to wash a milk churn and that human hairs in butter were considered a sign of quality. [...] These descriptions seem to be confirmed by an <b>old</b> <b>saying</b> attributed to Appalachian housewives: [...] "The mair [...] dirt the less hurt". Another expression of backcountry hardiness was the lack of appreciation of coffee and tea. Both were described as mere [...] "slops" [...] and were deemed appropriate only for those who were sick or unfit for labor.|$|E
500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened. Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film [...] "probably 20 times," [...] which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving. As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years <b>old,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I always loved Disney animation, {{but there was something about}} the females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward.

500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the <b>old</b> <b>saying,</b> if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
