5|$|Because of {{its great}} depth, {{for a long}} time Davidson Seamount had been preceded only by a sparse few investigations. Davidson is {{interesting}} to volcanologists because of its unique geology, and to biologists for its unique ecology. In 2002 the NOAA sponsored the first modern in-depth study of the seamount. The team included scientists, educators, and resource managers, with the goal of documenting species, taking geologic samples, and describing the <b>ocean</b> <b>environment.</b> The expedition documented many rare, previously undiscovered species that exist nowhere else, not even on nearby seamounts, including ancient coral gardens that are vulnerable to human activity.|$|E

25|$|The solute {{content of}} water {{is perhaps the most}} {{important}} aspect of water conditions, as total dissolved solids and other constituents dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms interact with their environment. Salt content, or salinity, is the most basic measure of water conditions. An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 500parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 500 to 30,000PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000PPM), simulating an <b>ocean</b> <b>environment.</b> Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.|$|E
25|$|Pacific green turtles' {{foraging}} habitats {{are poorly}} understood and mostly unknown. These foraging grounds {{are most likely}} {{along the coast of}} Baja California, Mexico and southern California, in which these turtleâ€™s have a high risk of incidental capture by coastal fisheries. The main mortality factor for these turtles is the shrimp trawlers in Mexico, in which many of these turtles go undocumented. The only foraging area that has been identified is the San Diego Bay, but it is heavily polluted with metals and PCBs. These contaminants {{have a negative effect on}} the <b>ocean</b> <b>environment,</b> and have been shown to cause lesions and sometimes mortality. Green turtles also are threatened by entanglement and ingestion of plastic. In San Diego Bay, an adult green turtle was found dead with monofilament netting tightly packed in its esophagus.|$|E

40|$|Our {{long-term}} {{goal is to}} provide a more complete understanding of the forward propagation of acoustic pulses in range dependent deep <b>ocean</b> <b>environments</b> at multi-megameter range scales. OBJECTIVES The objective is to understand the limits of wavefield predictability in <b>ocean</b> <b>environments</b> where refractive scattering is the dominant physical process controlling the dynamics of the wavefield. The canonical scenario is long range acoustic transmissions along the ocean waveguide which has sound speed fluctuations due to oceanic processes characterized by linear Rossby waves and internal waves. The work on this project to date has focused on <b>ocean</b> <b>environments</b> that include the former. APPROACH The technical approach involved the development of a three dimensional ocean acoustic ray trace numerical model associated with the solution of the one-way Helmoltz equation. The boundary conditions are specular reflection at the surface, open in the horizontal, and open on the bottom. A Cartesian coordinate system is used, and no account is taken for the sphericity of the Earth. A Hamiltonian prescription is facilitated, and besides the standard ray quantities (i. e. depth, crossrange, vertical momentum, horizontal momentum, and travel time), the model also solves for the elements o...|$|R

2500|$|While {{the full}} {{implications}} of elevated CO2 on marine ecosystems {{are still being}} documented, {{there is a substantial}} body of research showing that a combination of ocean acidification and elevated ocean temperature, driven mainly by CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, have a compounded effect on marine life and the <b>ocean</b> <b>environment.</b> [...] This effect far exceeds the individual harmful impact of either. [...] In addition, ocean warming exacerbates ocean deoxygenation, which is an additional stressor on marine organisms, by increasing ocean stratification, through density and solubility effects, thus limiting nutrients, {{while at the same time}} increasing metabolic demand.|$|E

He is recognized both in the United States and internationally for many significant contributions he made to marine fisheries research and for his leadership in the maturation of fisheries science to encompass fisheries oceanography, defined as the [...] "appraisal or exploitation of any kind of [...] organism useful to Man" [...] and [...] "the study of oceanic processes affecting the abundance and availability of commercial fishes."
