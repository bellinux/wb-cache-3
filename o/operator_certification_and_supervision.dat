Knowledge, attitude and behavior of an experimental group (n= 22) was assessed before and after 3 -hour food safety training and compared with a control group (n= 10) that received no food safety training. We hypothesized that those who received food safety training would have improved knowledge, attitude and behavior towards food safety issues compared to those who did not receive training. Results showed that food safety training significantly increased (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) the knowledge of foodservice employees compared to those who didn’t receive the training.

In these circumstances, our study analyses the main four national parenting education programmes carried out in Romania by various non-governmental organisations and their features in terms of contents/curriculum, form of organisation, methods used, and categories of participants. Our research highlights the need to build a national integrated and coherent system of parental education for parents in Romania.

Based on a specific operation risk assessment, this category enables new aircraft system architectures and mission designs. The concept allows for operational restrictions, defined {{in the concept of}} operations, to maintain overall operation safety. Therefore, the description of the concept of operations {{is one of the key}} elements for the approval of a UAS operation. This description will be used by pilots, <b>operators,</b> <b>certification</b> authorities <b>and</b> possibly additional stakeholders, e. g., for publishing operation into databases. Standardization of this document seems mandatory. In addition to this, we discuss the formalization of this document for easy distribution amongst stakeholders and establishment of tool support. To support this, we use recent developments regarding standardization of simulation modeling. The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Modeling and Simulation Technical Committee recently launched a working group towards the development of a standard scenario definition language for aviation. In this paper, we extend this language specification in order to define specific operation safety boundaries of a system. Thereby, we aim at creating a dialect of the simulation scenario definition language that can be used to describe safe scenarios for a particular system of interest. We further discuss the challenges and benefits of such a formalization of the concept of operations by adapting the simulation scenario definition language...|$|R

40|$|Supplying {{water to}} {{communities}} {{is one of}} the primary services of many local governments in the United States. Local governments use a variety of means for developing community water systems. The major goal of municipal water suppliers is to provide safe and affordable water for residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial uses. In rural localities, provision of safe public drinking water can pose a significant challenge, especially given financial and economic constraints inherent in small communities where economies of scale are limited. In an effort to ensure that public water systems meet minimum standards for safe drinking water, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974. The act requires all community water systems to meet minimum standards for drinking water quality. Community water systems cannot meet minimum water quality standards without strong financial, managerial, and technical capacity. The 1996 Amendments to SDWA address small systems through the new Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, Capacity Development, source water protection, <b>operator</b> <b>certification,</b> consumer confidence, <b>and</b> variances and exemptions.

Increasingly complex adaptive control theories and designs are emerging, but only make testing challenges more difficult. A potential first step toward the acceptance of adaptive flight controllers by aircraft manufacturers, <b>operators,</b> <b>and</b> <b>certification</b> authorities is a very simple design that operates as an augmentation to a non-adaptive baseline controller. Three such controllers were developed as part of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration flight research experiment to determine the appropriate level of complexity required to restore acceptable handling qualities to an aircraft that has suffered failures or damage. The controllers consist of the same basic design, but incorporate incrementally-increasing levels of complexity.
