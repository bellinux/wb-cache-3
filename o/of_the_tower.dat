They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the LED lights at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED lights on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the lights at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> come on again.
