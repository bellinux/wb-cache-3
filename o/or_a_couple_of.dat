25|$|There {{are also}} 19 {{harpsichord}} suites and several variation sets. The suites follow {{the standard model}} (Allemande – Sarabande – Courante – Gigue), sometimes excluding a movement and sometimes adding a second sarabande <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> doubles. Like Froberger's, all dances except the gigues employ the French lute style brisé, sarabandes and courantes frequently being variations on the allemande. The gigues employ basic imitative counterpoint but never {{go as far as}} the gigue fugues in the chorale fantasias or the fugal writing seen in organ preludes. It may be that the more developed harpsichord writing by Buxtehude simply did not survive: in his writings, Johann Mattheson mentioned a cycle of seven suites by Buxtehude, depicting the nature of planets, but these pieces are lost.|$|E
500|$|Oosterbaan {{believed}} {{success was}} fleeting. [...] He once {{was quoted in}} Time Magazine as saying, [...] "I'm on top now, {{and there is a}} lot of backslapping. But what of seasons to come? Let me lose the opener <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> other games next fall, and then watch how I'm blasted." [...] As coach, he had a reputation as a mild-mannered man who aspired to live by the maxims of his own college football coach, Fielding Yost.|$|E

2500|$|Truss {{derives from}} the Old French word trousse, from around 1200, which means [...] "collection of things bound together". The term truss has often been used to {{describe}} any assembly of members such as a cruck frame <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> rafters.

2500|$|Soon after, Reavis and {{his agents}} began selling quitclaims to gullible and frightened {{settlers}} {{located within the}} claim boundaries. [...] The prices charged for the quitclaims varied greatly and showed little relation {{to the value of}} a property or the current occupants ability to pay. [...] Some residents received demands for as much as US$1,000 while others obtained a release for free or in exchange for a meal <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> drinks.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{like other}} black jazz artists {{of that time}} such as Billy Eckstine and Nat King Cole, it was {{particularly}} difficult for Matthews to break prejudice and color barriers. [...] He said at the time: [...] "They said the band was too mixed, a couple of whites <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Negroes would be O.K. but not 50/50." [...] He was confronted by an agent who hired an all-white group for a Las Vegas show rather than Matthews' mixed band. [...] His frustration extended to A representatives for Decca, Columbia, and Capitol, who liked {{the sound of the}} band and his music but expressed concern after seeing the racially mixed band in person.|$|E

2500|$|On January 27, Federal {{prosecutors}} played four recordings {{from among}} the thousands of intercepted calls from Blagojevich's home and campaign offices. Although lawmakers trying to build an impeachment case wanted to hear more, the prosecutors feared further collaboration could jeopardize the criminal case against the governor. The recordings played at the impeachment trial were taped in November and December and revealed efforts by Blagojevich to collect money from a horse track owner in exchange for signing legislation benefiting the racing industry, prosecutors said. State Senator Dan Cronin said hearing the recordings [...] "hits me {{right here in the}} stomach. It sort of reminds me of some Hollywood movie <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> thugs in a car driving around." [...] Daniel Cain, an FBI agent who investigated Blagojevich for years, also testified on January 27 and answered questions that did not extend to information not presented in the affidavit.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Lyle Jeffs' {{estranged wife}} Charlene Jeffs claimed in a custody dispute {{that the group}} {{currently}} enforces a doctrine allowing sex with women only by men of the group appointed as [...] "seed bearers", defined as [...] "elect" [...] men of a [...] "worthy blood line chosen by the Priesthood to impregnate" [...] women. Under this doctrine, men no longer are allowed to have children with their wives. Charlene Jeffs wrote in her custody petition: [...] "It is the husband's responsibility to hold {{the hands of their}} wives while the seed bearer 'spreads his seed'. In layman terms, the husband is required to sit in the room while the chosen seed bearer, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> them, rape his wife or wives." [...] She also described the [...] "Law of Sarah," [...] in which FLDS women perform sex acts on each other to prepare for a sexual encounter with a man in the FLDS leadership. Lorin Holm, who claimed to have been part of Jeffs' [...] "inner circle" [...] before he was excommunicated from the group in 2011, later described the [...] "Law of Sarah" [...] practice in Jeffs' community as akin to a lesbian sex show with Jeffs participating and sermonizing. Holm also said that mothers who would not take part were sent away to [...] "redeem themselves", and their children given to other women.|$|E

2500|$|Temporary {{marriage}} was widespread in Xinjiang under Chinese rule {{prior to the}} Dungan Revolt. It allowed a man to marry a woman for <b>a</b> week <b>or</b> even <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, with [...] "the mulla who performs the ceremony arranging for the divorce at the same time".

Fifth, I was a traveller and a writer, eager to see things and to gather material into my note-books.

60|$|Towards sunset {{the fair}} itself became quiescent. It was the {{hour for the}} dancing to begin. At {{one side of the}} village of tents a space had been roped off. Acetylene lamps, hung round it on posts, cast a {{piercing}} white light. In one corner sat the band, and, obedient to its scraping and blowing, two or three hundred dancers trampled across the dry ground, wearing away the grass with their booted feet. Round this patch of all but daylight, alive with motion and noise, the night seemed preternaturally dark. Bars of light reached out into it, {{and every now and then}} a lonely figure <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> lovers, interlaced, would cross the bright shaft, flashing for a moment into visible existence, to disappear again as quickly and surprisingly as they had come.|$|E
