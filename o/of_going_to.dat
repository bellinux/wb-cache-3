5|$|Ongoing {{negotiations}} through March yielded {{an agreement}} on March 7, 1999, {{over the objections of}} the State Department. The proceeds of the series were a major sticking point in negotiations, as it violated the United States embargo against Cuba. Instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Cuban Government, it was agreed that proceeds would fund baseball programs in Cuba.|$|E

5|$|There were {{restrictions}} in Slovakia on Jews' education, housing and travel, {{and they were}} required to wear a yellow badge. Available jobs went first to non-Jews. Because of this, Vrba was excluded, at age 15, from attending the gymnasium (high school) in Bratislava. Instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school he found work as a labourer in Trnava.|$|E
5|$|Torres was {{initially}} {{sent to the}} minors to begin 2004 but was recalled on April 7 without playing a game for Toledo when Dmitri Young broke his leg.

Instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the minors, Torres requested his release. He was granted free agency on April 22.|$|E

5|$|Because he {{was unable}} to afford {{university}} tuition, Truman had thought <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the costless United States Military Academy at West Point, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight. He enlisted in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillery battery and attaining the rank of corporal. At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness). The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's mother Julia Domna was {{initially}} left in peace when Macrinus became emperor. This changed when Macrinus {{discovered that she}} was conspiring against him and had her placed under house arrest in Antioch. By this time Julia Domna was suffering from an advanced stage of breast cancer and soon died in Antioch, possibly by starving herself. Afterwards, Macrinus sent Domna's sister Julia Maesa and her children back to Emesa in Syria, from where Maesa set in motion her plans to have Macrinus overthrown. Macrinus remained in Antioch instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Rome upon being declared emperor, a step which furthered his unpopularity in Rome and contributed to his eventual downfall.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} in Amherst, Beecher had his first taste of public {{speaking}} and, setting aside his early dream <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sea, resolved to join the ministry. He met his future wife, Eunice Bullard, {{the daughter of a}} well-known physician, and on January 2, 1832, became engaged to her. During his Amherst years, he also developed an interest in the new pseudoscience of phrenology—an attempt to link personality traits with features of the human skull—and befriended Orson Squire Fowler, who later became the theory's best-known American exponent.|$|E

Egypt and Syria agreed to coordinate military action via negotiations, and the respective Ministers of War formulated a common military strategy. Egypt enlisted the political support of several more Arab countries, some producers of oil. Sadat discussed {{the possibility of}} using oil as an economic weapon to pressure Western governments into adopting more pro-Arab policies. During the war, oil-producing Arab nations, primarily Libya and Saudi Arabia, initiated an oil embargo, and several sent token forces to the front lines.|$|E

In August 1963 Geraty graduated with a Masters of Arts in Religion and completed his Bachelor of Divinity in May 1965, both at Andrews University.|$|E

She {{telephones}} her father Carter, who tells her she doesn't have a brother and quickly terminates the call, but she persists: she breaks into her parents' house. She finally learns that her brother Patrick has been shut away in a mental hospital for decades, ever since he suffered a nervous breakdown as a young child, upon walking in on his mother {{having an affair with}} Jackie Gleason.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E

Randazza wrote that Beck was attempting to evade the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by filing the legal process with an agency of the United Nations instead of in a U.S. court. In the legal brief, Randazza pointed out that Beck's action <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the WIPO in an attempt to get the website taken down was in contradiction to his prior statements saying he preferred United States law over international law.|$|E

5|$|Tensions run {{high among}} the band members, as Joey begins seducing Imelda, Natalie and Bernie, and Deco grows {{increasingly}} obnoxious and unruly. The band performs at another venue where, {{at the end}} of one song, Billy accidentally knocks over his hi-hat cymbals, leading to a heated argument between him and Deco. Billy leaves the band in fear <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> jail if he beats up Deco—much to Jimmy's frustration—and Mickah replaces him as the band's drummer. During the band's next performance at a roller disco, Jimmy is confronted by Duffy, who demands payment for the equipment he provided the band. Mickah intervenes and violently attacks Duffy, who is escorted out. Jimmy then goes on stage and introduces the band, which elicits boisterous cheers from the audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
