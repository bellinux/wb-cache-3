Recently, the effects of globalization have been increasing in many areas.

In Japan, educational policy and methods of childcare have been altered as a result of these broader changes. For these reasons, <b>the</b> Committee <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of <b>the</b> Child has developed new recommendations for reconstructing the current system in order to protect <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of children which may be threatened by the global social changes produced by this highly competitive environment.

5|$|It is now {{agreed that}} spiders (Araneae) are {{monophyletic}} (i.e., {{members of a}} group of organisms that form a clade, consisting of a last common ancestor and all of its descendants).

The cladogram <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> is based on J. W. Shultz' analysis (2007).
