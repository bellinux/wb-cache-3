40|$|Classic {{models on}} opinion {{dynamics}} usually {{focus on a}} group of agents forming their opinions interactively <b>over</b> single <b>issue.</b> Yet generally consensus can not be achieved <b>over</b> single <b>issue</b> when agents are not completely open to interpersonal influence. In this paper, opinion consensus in social networks with stubborn agents is considered <b>over</b> <b>issue</b> sequences. The social network with stubborn agents is described by the Friedkin-Johnsen (F-J) model where agents are stubborn to their initial opinions. Firstly, we propose some sufficient and necessary conditions both in terms of network topology and system matrix for convergence of the F-J model <b>over</b> single <b>issue.</b> Secondly, opinion consensus of the F-J model is investigated <b>over</b> <b>issue</b> sequences. Our analysis establishes connections between the interpersonal influence network and the network describing the relationship of agents' initial opinions for successive issues. Taking advantage of these connections, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for the F-J model to achieve opinion consensus <b>over</b> <b>issue</b> sequences. Finally, we consider a more general scenario where each agent has bounded confidence in forming its initial opinion for every issue. By analyzing the evolution of agents' ultimate opinions for each <b>issue</b> <b>over</b> <b>issue</b> sequences, we prove that the connectivity of the state-dependent network is preserved in this setting. Then the conditions for agents to achieve opinion consensus <b>over</b> <b>issue</b> sequences are proposed. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results...|$|R

5|$|Henry VIII {{broke from}} communion with the Catholic Church, <b>over</b> <b>issues</b> {{relating}} to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch {{head of the}} Church of England.

He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism.|$|E

5|$|As {{professional}} baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners <b>over</b> <b>issues</b> {{of control and}} equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal {{led to the formation}} of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, two Michigan businessmen, John Rudzewicz and Brian MacShara, {{entered into}} a {{franchise}} agreement with Burger King to run a restaurant in Detroit, Michigan. After MacShara attended four months of training courses at the regional Burger King training facilities in Michigan and in the Florida headquarters on how to operate and administer a Burger King franchise, {{it was agreed that}} the partners would take over operation of an existing Burger King location in Drayton Plains, Michigan. However, during this time disagreements arose between the partners and Burger King <b>over</b> <b>issues</b> of rent, construction fees, building designs and the assignment of legal liabilities. MacShara and Ruzewicz finally signed their franchise agreement after gaining limited concessions over the issues, with Rudzewicz assuming a 20-year, $1,000,000 financial obligation {{over the life of the}} contract.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{during the}} {{contract}} {{negotiations between the}} city the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise {{could not be reached}} <b>over</b> <b>issues</b> like health insurance increases, teacher evaluations, and seniority pay increases. On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent President Rutherford B. Hayes did {{not seek}} re-election, keeping a promise made during the 1876 campaign. After the longest {{convention}} in the party's history, the divided Republicans chose another Ohioan, Representative James A. Garfield, as their standard-bearer. The Democratic Party chose General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania as their nominee. The dominance {{of the two major}} parties began to fray as an upstart left-wing party, the Greenback Party, nominated another Civil War general for president, Iowa Congressman James B. Weaver. In a campaign fought mainly <b>over</b> <b>issues</b> of Civil War loyalties, tariffs, and Chinese immigration, Garfield and Hancock each took just over 48 percent of the popular vote. Weaver and two other minor candidates, Neal Dow and John W. Phelps, together made up the remaining percentage. The election of 1880 was the sixth consecutive presidential election won by the Republicans, the second longest winning streak in American history after the Democratic-Republican Party during the period 1800–1824.|$|E
5|$|Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing {{was written}} by A. S. Neill and {{published}} by Hart Publishing Company in 1960. In a letter to Neill, New York publisher Harold Hart suggested a book specific for America devised of parts from four of Neill's previous works: The Problem Child, The Problem Parent, The Free Child, and That Dreadful School. Neill liked his idea and gave the publisher wide liberties in the manuscript's preparation, preferring to write a preface or appendix in reflection on the writings. In rereading his work, he realized he disagreed with his earlier statements on Freudian child analysis. Neill later regretted the liberties he afforded the publisher, particularly his removal of Wilheim Reich's name from the book and index, since Neill saw Reich as an influential figure. They also struggled <b>over</b> <b>issues</b> of copyrights. Neill did not contest his disagreements, as {{he was eager to}} see the book published.|$|E

5|$|Even as {{the growth}} of the {{technology}} sector transformed the region's economy, progressive politics continued to guide the region's political environment. By the turn of the millennium, Non-Hispanic whites, the largest ethnic group in the United States, were only half of the population in the Bay Area as immigration among minority groups accelerated. During this time, the Bay Area {{was the center of the}} LGBT rights movement: in 2004, San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, a first in the United States, and four years later, a majority of voters in the Bay Area rejected California Proposition 8, which sought to constitutionally restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples but ultimately passed statewide. The Bay Area was also the center of contentious protests concerning racial and economic inequality. In 2009, an African American man named Oscar Grant was fatally shot by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officers, precipitating widespread protests across the region and even riots in Oakland, and whose name was symbolically tied to the Occupy Oakland protests two years later that sought to fight against social and economic inequality. Following the Inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2017, the Bay Area became a center of resistance to his administration, beginning with widespread protests in concert with the nationwide Women's March a day later, followed by frequent public feuds between Trump and various Bay Area political, cultural, and business figures <b>over</b> <b>issues</b> of race and immigration, among others.|$|E
5|$|Norway Airlines {{applied in}} 1990 for {{permission}} to operate a charter route from Oslo to Penang, Malaysia, using a Boeing 757. The application was dismissed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to protect SAS' route from Copenhagen to Singapore. The Penang route was necessary for Norway Airlines to procure a third aircraft, which {{according to the company}} was necessary to generate a profit, and would have created 100 new jobs. In the mean time, Tjæreborg Reiser sent their charter passengers with scheduled flights to London and onwards with British carriers to Malaysia. The dismissal was appealed to Minister of Transport and Communications, Lars Gunnar Lie of the Christian Democratic Party. The issue became a political issue within Syse's Cabinet, as the Conservative Party and the Progress Party were both in favor of increased deregulation of the airline industry. The issue was complicated by the common aviation policy of the three Scandinavian counties, which had largely been established to protect SAS' interest on international services. The cabinet therefore opened for discussion a further deregulation with the governments of Sweden and Denmark. The Conservative Party stated that this was in part a response to Danish and Swedish authorities allowing charter services to Phuket, Thailand, which could be seen as competing to SAS' route to Bangkok. Syse's Cabiet resigned on 3 November <b>over</b> <b>issues</b> regarding Norway and the European Union, before a reply to the application could be made.|$|E
