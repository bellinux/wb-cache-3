5|$|Napoleon's set {{of civil}} laws, the Code Civil—now often {{known as the}} Napoleonic Code—was {{prepared}} by committees of legal experts {{under the supervision of}} Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, the Second Consul. Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts. The development of the code was a fundamental change {{in the nature of the}} civil law legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law. <b>Other</b> <b>codes</b> ("Les cinq codes") were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules of due process.|$|E
25|$|As mentioned, {{the term}} civil law in France refers to private law, {{and should be}} {{distinguished}} from the group of legal systems descended from Roman Law known as civil law, as opposed to common law. The main body of statutes and laws governing civil law and procedure are {{set out in the}} Civil Code of France. Other private law statutes are also located in <b>other</b> <b>codes</b> such as commercial code in the Code of Commerce, or copyright law in the Intellectual Property Code.|$|E
25|$|By the 1880s, Australian {{football}} {{had become}} the prevailing football code in Australia's southern and western colonies, and experienced a period of dominance in Queensland, where, like in areas of New South Wales, it struggled to thrive, {{largely due to the}} spread of rugby football, regional rivalries and the lack of strong local governing bodies. In the case of Sydney, denial of access to grounds, the influence of university headmasters from Britain who favoured rugby, and the loss of players to <b>other</b> <b>codes</b> inhibited the game's growth.|$|E

25|$|Of the 45 {{national}} FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) affiliates {{in which}} English is an official or primary language, 43 use football in their organisations' official names (Canada and the United States use soccer).

In 2005, Australia's association football governing body {{changed its name}} from soccer to football to align with the general international usage of the term.

Other important markings in the history of Medical Ethics include Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the development of Hemodialysis in the 1960s. As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking. Medical ethics encompasses a practical application in clinical settings as well as scholarly work on its history, philosophy, and sociology.|$|E

25|$|While the Queensland rugby league team's players mostly {{come from}} Queensland, up until 1980 when {{residential}} selection criteria were still used, some of New South Wales' most prominent footballers, such as Dally Messenger and Clive Churchill, also {{played for the}} Maroons. Queensland's players {{are some of the}} most famous athletes Australia produces, with goal-kicking centre Mal Meninga being named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1990, the first rugby league player to ever do so. Since the turn of the century Maroons players have become big name footballers not only in rugby league but in <b>other</b> <b>codes</b> as well. Rugby union's 2003 World Cup Final alone featured four former Queensland players: Brad Thorn playing for the All Blacks, and Mat Rogers, Lote Tuqiri and Wendell Sailor playing for the Wallabies. Former Maroons Karmichael Hunt and Israel Folau were both recruited by the AFL to play Australian rules football (and both also currently play professional rugby union).|$|E
25|$|This decade was a boom {{period for}} {{immigration}} in the colony: Between 1881 and 1891 metropolitan Brisbane's population grew from 37,000 to 100,000. The first reported soccer matches were {{played by a}} group who originally practised at Queen's Park (now part of the Brisbane City Botanic Gardens), on the flat area near the Brisbane River, adjacent to Alice Street and between Edward and Albert Streets, around 1883 (see {{the far end of}} the park in the adjacent photograph). These players were presumably mostly recent Scottish migrants, given they were referred to as 'Scotch rulers' by players of the <b>other</b> <b>codes,</b> as well as the team names they eventually adopted. After disagreements over ground-sharing with cricketers and the Rugby Union and Melbourne Rules players, they moved to vacant land in Melbourne Street South Brisbane, between Grey and Stanley Streets (the site now occupied by the Queensland Performing Arts Centre). Eventually, they received permission from the publican of the Pineapple Hotel, almost directly across the river at Kangaroo Point, to play at his 'Pineapple Sportsground' behind the hotel. This ground is now the western portion of Raymond Park).|$|E
25|$|Like many <b>other</b> <b>codes</b> of football, the way {{to score}} points is to score goals. In Australian Football, {{there are two types}} of scores: a goal and a behind. There are four posts at each end of the ground; the two middle (and taller) posts are the goal posts, and the two outer (and shorter) posts are the behind posts. The area between the goal posts is the goal; kicking the ball between these posts scores a goal which is worth six points. Kicking the ball between a goal and a behind post scores a behind, which {{constitutes}} a single point. A behind is also scored if the ball passes between the goal posts but has not been kicked by the attacking team (e.g., it comes off the hands of either team, or is kicked by the defending team), or if the ball hits or passes directly above the goal post. (If the ball hits the behind post, the ball is considered to have gone out of bounds.) A rushed behind (also worth one point) is scored when the defending team deliberately forces the ball between any of the posts. This may occur in pressure situations where a defender decides that it is safer to concede one point to the opposing team rather than risk a goal being scored.|$|E

500|$|<b>Other</b> <b>codes</b> of {{football}} {{share a common}} history with American football. Canadian football {{is a form of}} the game that evolved parallel to American football. While both games share a common history, there are some important differences between the two. [...] A more modern sport that derives from American football is Arena football, designed to be played indoors inside of hockey or basketball arenas. The game was invented in 1981 by Jim Foster and the Arena Football League was founded in 1987 as the first major professional league to play the sport. Several other indoor football leagues have since been founded and continue to play today.|$|E

500|$|Between 1955 and 1969 over 2,000 {{books were}} {{published}} using lesbianism as a topic, {{and they were}} sold in corner drugstores, train stations, bus stops, and newsstands all over the U.S. and Canada. Most were written by, and almost all were marketed to heterosexual men. Coded words and images were used on the covers. Instead of [...] "lesbian", terms such as [...] "strange", [...] "twilight", [...] "queer", and [...] "third sex", {{were used in the}} titles, and cover art was invariably salacious. A handful of lesbian pulp fiction authors were women writing for lesbians, including Ann Bannon, Valerie Taylor, Paula Christian, and Vin Packer/Ann Aldrich. Bannon, who also purchased lesbian pulp fiction, later stated that women identified the material iconically by the cover art. Many of the books used cultural references: naming places, terms, describing modes of dress and <b>other</b> <b>codes</b> to isolated women. As a result, pulp fiction helped to proliferate a lesbian identity simultaneously to lesbians and heterosexual readers.|$|E
