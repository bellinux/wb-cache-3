5|$|Aarhus is the {{principal}} centre for education in the Jutland region. It draws students from a large area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities.

5|$|After briefly reading {{law with}} former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury, a family friend, in Portsmouth, {{he spent a}} {{semester}} at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts, followed by a period <b>of</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst, New Hampshire. He {{was admitted to the}} New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his first case, but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as did his personal charm and deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{advancement}} of his legal career had been hindered by his marriage to Jane, Hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance. This was not an immediate option because the Whig party was in opposition, but {{in the summer of}} 1827 Henry Brougham promised Hogg a future position as a professor of civil law at the newly created University College London. Hogg embarked on a course <b>of</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> preparation, but the professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds. This setback upset Hogg greatly, and he became very bitter about it. A lecture that he had intended to give at his inauguration was published in 1831.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor {{conversion}} of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours <b>of</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat {{to rise to the}} refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey's charters, records and title deeds, {{as well as those of}} local lords, were kept.|$|E

5|$|Having {{served in}} both houses of the state legislature, Johnson saw {{election}} to Congress as the next step in his political career. He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated Jonesborough lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892. In Washington, he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti-abolitionist stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs. With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor <b>of</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> the Library of Congress. Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, James K. Polk, was elected president in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the two men had difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centuries}} that {{followed}} the Reformation, many religious denominations came to Glastonbury to establish chapels and meeting houses. For such a relatively small town, Glastonbury has a remarkably diverse history of Christian places of worship, further enriched {{by the fact that}} several of these movements saw break-away factions, typically setting up new meeting places as a result of doctrinal disagreements, leaving behind them a legacy which would require a highly specialized degree <b>of</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> order to chart their respective histories and places of practice. Amongst their number have been Puritans/Undetermined Protestants, Quakers, Independents, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Salvationists, Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostals.|$|E
5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period <b>of</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E

5|$|Meyerbeer's birthname was Jacob Liebmann Beer; he {{was born}} in Tasdorf (now a part of Rüdersdorf), near Berlin, then the capital of Prussia, to a Jewish family. His father was the {{enormously}} wealthy financier Judah Herz Beer (1769–1825) and his mother, Amalia (Malka) Wulff (1767–1854), to whom he was particularly devoted, also came from the moneyed elite. Their other children included the astronomer Wilhelm Beer and the poet Michael Beer. He was to adopt the surname Meyerbeer on the death of his grandfather Liebmann Meyer Wulff (1811) and the first name Giacomo during his period <b>of</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> Italy, around 1817.|$|E

5|$|Undergraduate {{students}} are expected to fulfill most of the core requirements prior to the completion of their sophomore year; a wide variety of courses can be applied to this endeavor.

One option is the personalized interdisciplinary major, which allows students to create their own course of study across various disciplines.

5|$|The {{contract}} for Hiei {{was awarded to}} Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 24 September 1875 {{for the price of}} £119,600, exclusive of armament. Japanese sources universally give the date for Hieis keel-laying as 24 September 1875—the same as that for the awarding of the contract—but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. She was launched on 12 June 1877; Reed's daughter smashed a bottle of champagne on the ship's bow in the traditional Western style. The ship was named for Mount Hiei. Completed in February 1878, Hiei sailed for Japan on 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. One of the passengers aboard her was the future admiral Togo Heihachiro, who had just completed six years <b>of</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom. She arrived in Yokohama on 22 May and was assigned to the Tokai Naval District a month later. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. On 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E
