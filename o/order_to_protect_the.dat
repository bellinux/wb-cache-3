The 8th Division was subsequently dispatched to Singapore in February 1941, while plans were made for a Militia battalion to be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island. An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul, and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to Timor and Ambon. Meanwhile, in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> airfield, while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka Passage in Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese had {{captured}} Bougainville in early 1942, and had subsequently built {{it into a}} significant base {{with large numbers of}} aircraft and troops, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> fortress at Rabaul.

Heavy fighting followed the landing, but after a large-scale Japanese counter-attack was defeated in March 1944, the Japanese withdrew from the US lodgement and subsequently a period of relative quiet followed as the US forces limited themselves to patrolling and establishing outposts, rather than large-scale operations.|$|E
