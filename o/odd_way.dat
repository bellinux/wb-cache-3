For what she has really suffered, there is never a sober night that I do not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and in an <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> he looks forward {{to it as the}} only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E

His strong point is a disdain for Common Sense... His vocation is Art... matter of Uncommon Sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{reviewer}}s {{commented that}} the dark tone of the final episode {{was typical of the}} series. A reviewer for BBC Comedy said that it [...] "was a characteristically dark end to a show which was never afraid to explore the flip side of the comedy coin." [...] UKTV Gold's website says [...] "it was a suitably downbeat end to an equally downbeat man." [...] Commenting that killing off the protagonist [...] "might seem an <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> for a sitcom to end," [...] the British Film Institute's ScreenOnline says that in a series [...] "where comedy and tragedy are so intertwined, it seems entirely appropriate." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, Daniel Handler {{said that}} [...] "a sequel {{does seem to}} be in the works. Paramount has had quite a few {{corporate}} shakeups, which has led to many a delay. Of course, many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I'm assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps." [...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. [...] "In an <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> the best thing you could do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors.

500|$|Jim Shelley of The Daily Mirror {{was also}} {{negative}} about the episode, especially towards Alex Kingston, {{who appeared to}} be acting while [...] "the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly naturally". The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller said that Moffat [...] "delivered a pacy romp" [...] and praised the concept of the Teselecta, but was disappointed with the [...] "wasted opportunity" [...] of the setting. He thought that the setting offered [...] "great dramatic potential" [...] but was [...] "little more than window dressing for the story". He also felt using Hitler as a comic relief [...] "struck a wrong note given the nature of the man and the regime he led" [...] and that it was [...] "an <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> to treat such an historically significant character". He was also critical of Moffat's [...] "seeming keenness to kill the regular cast in some way, shape or form". However, Entertainment Weekly Tucker thought that it [...] "didn't need Hitler to be an excellent [...] episode".|$|E
500|$|The 17-year-old PedroII was, for his part, {{clearly and}} greatly disappointed. His first {{impressions}} were only of her physical flaws—and {{of how much}} her appearance differed from the portrait which {{had been sent to}} him. Physically, she had dark brown hair and brown eyes, was short, slightly overweight, walked with a pronounced limp and, while not ugly, neither was she pretty. According to historian Pedro Calmon, Teresa Cristina had no true limp, but her <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> of walking was instead the result of bowed legs causing her to lean alternately right and left as she walked. PedroII's high expectations were crushed, and he allowed his feelings of revulsion and rejection to show. After a short interval, he left the ship. Perceiving his disillusionment, she burst into tears, lamenting that [...] "the emperor did not like me!" [...] Although a proxy marriage had already been performed, an extravagant state wedding was held on 4 September at the cathedral in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} ranged from mixed to negative. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw noted that Broyles [...] "is surely {{one of the}} most intense guys on TV", and also enjoyed Walter's scenes. Josie Kafka from Open Salon thought the fringe cases each week were [...] "an <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> to build a mythology: the Big Secret seems to be that people in {{positions}} of power are evil and do evil things, often for money. But if Peter's right, and all these stand-alones are also detailing a series of steps taken by the Big Bads in preparation for something... well, that's an exciting idea." [...] She gave it [...] "two out of four Expendable Gerbils." [...] io9's Annalee Newitz praised the episode, declaring it made her [...] "officially a watcher of Fringe, rather than a sampler". She continued, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the show really gelled... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove: human experimentation. That's what links all the scooby gang's investigations together into the Pattern, and that's what makes this show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity." ...|$|E

Mizanin was also a contestant in the [...] "Reality Stars" [...] episode of Fear Factor. His partner was his former girlfriend and castmate, Trishelle Cannatella, and the two won the competition. In April 2007, {{he appeared}} on the game show Identity, where he appeared as a stranger, and contestant John Kim correctly identified his identity as a professional wrestler by the <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> he added [...] "Miz-" [...] before most words. In 2008, Mizanin appeared on the Sci Fi reality series Ghost Hunters Live as a guest investigator. In 2009, Mizanin appeared on two episodes of Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?, which were both aired on September 29. He appeared on an episode of Destroy Build Destroy on March 3, 2010. On October 5, 2011, Miz starred in an episode of H8R. He also appeared as a guest star in a March 2012 episode of Psych. On March 31, Miz appeared in the first ever Slime Wrestling World Championship at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, losing to the Big Show which resulted in him being thrown into a tub of slime. In 2012, Miz appeared on the Disney XD show Pair of Kings as a guest star. In 2013, Miz along with Francia Raisa were in a movie together called Christmas Bounty.|$|E
500|$|On September 6, 1956, Raymond {{was killed}} in an {{automobile}} accident in Westport, Connecticut. Driving fellow cartoonist Stan Drake's 1956 Corvette at twice the [...] speed limit, he hit a tree and was killed. Roberts describes in his biography the circumstances {{as a result of the}} weather. Driving in the convertible with its top down, Raymond decided to reach his destination quicker rather than stop to put the top back up when rain started to fall. Drake was thrown clear of the crash, but Raymond, with his seat belt buckled, died instantly. Speculation surrounds the nature of his death, with some, Drake included, believing Raymond was suicidal. Raymond had been involved in four automobile accidents in the month prior to his death, which led Drake to say Raymond [...] "had been trying to kill himself". Author Arlen Schumer ascribes the motive for suicide as being related to Raymond's personal life. Schumer alleges that Raymond had been having affairs, and that his wife was refusing to grant him a divorce. R. C. Harvey is dismissive of this motivation: [...] "Committing suicide strikes me as an <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> for a man of Raymond's sophistication to react to his disappointment in romance". Harvey also notes that no mention of any alleged affairs is made in Tom Robert's biography, [...] "probably out of consideration to Raymond's surviving family". Drake has also been quoted as speculating that Raymond [...] "hit the accelerator by mistake" [...] instead of the brake. Raymond is buried in St. John's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Darien, Connecticut.|$|E

2500|$|Claudia Setzer, who {{believes}} in the authenticity of a kernel in the Testimonium, states that while [...] "tribe is an <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> to describe Christians" [...] {{it does not necessarily}} have negative connotations. Setzer argues for the existence of an authentic kernel because [...] "the style and vocabulary are Josephan" [...] and specific parts (e.g. the use of [...] "wise man") are not what one would expect from a Christian forger. Setzer argues that the Testimonium indicates that Josephus had heard of Jesus and the basic elements surrounding his death, and that he saw Jesus as primarily a miracle worker. Van Voorst also states that calling Christians a [...] "tribe" [...] would have been very out of character for a Christian scribe, while Josephus has used it to refer both to Jewish and Christian groups.|$|E
