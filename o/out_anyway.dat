Peter cringes {{at the idea}} and heads off to school. There, it is announced football practices will be held that day and Harry wants to try out. Peter passes on joining him as he feels it will reveal his abilities. When he hears Flash Thompson planning on specifically going after Harry during tryouts, he decides to keep him safe and try <b>out</b> <b>anyway.</b> They each do good at tryout - Harry impresses the coach and the other player, while Peter does the same using his extra abilities.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, Armstrong was {{involved}} in a second incident, when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their job, flying a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying <b>out</b> <b>anyway.</b> As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. Armstrong tells a different version of events, where Yeager never tried {{to talk him out of}} it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck and according to Armstrong, Yeager was in fits of laughter.|$|E

Juin also opposed the attack on Royan in April 1945, but it was carried <b>out</b> <b>anyway</b> over his objections.|$|E

50|$|According to the History of Yuan, {{he died of}} alcoholism. However, it may {{not have}} been as simple as merely {{drinking}} too much. It also states that shortly before his death, some ministers of the court wanted to propose that Kublai Khan abdicate his throne to Zhenjin on account of old age and because Prince Zhenjin was highly respected throughout the empire. However, Prince Zhenjin tried to prevent this from happening. Unfortunately, Kublai Khan found <b>out</b> <b>anyways</b> and was furious, which terrified Zhenjin and may have led him to overdrink. Distressed by his death, Kublai Khan made Zhenjin's son Temür the new Crown Prince, and Temür succeeded Kublai Khan in 1294 and became the Temür Khan or Emperor Chengzong.|$|R

25|$|There was {{speculation}} that the fielder was over the boundary rope {{when he took the}} catch to dismiss Alletson: if this was the case then according to the laws of cricket Alletson should have been credited with six more runs rather than being given <b>out.</b> <b>Anyway,</b> Alletson had done enough to save the match: it ended in a draw, with Sussex, who needed 237 to win, making 213 for eight. Alletson was rewarded for his achievement by the Duke of Portland, who awarded him a gold watch. It was later revealed that Alletson had batted with an injured wrist.|$|E
25|$|The Reverend John Wilson and the {{minister}} of Hester's church, Arthur Dimmesdale, question the woman, but she refuses to name her lover. After she returns to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Roger Chillingworth, a physician, to calm Hester and her child with his roots and herbs. He and Hester have an open conversation regarding their marriage {{and the fact that}} they were both in the wrong. Her lover, however, is another matter and he demands to know who it is; Hester refuses to divulge such information. He accepts this, stating that he will find <b>out</b> <b>anyway,</b> and forces her to hide that he is her husband. If she ever reveals him, he warns her, he will destroy the child's father. Hester agrees to Chillingworth's terms although she suspects she will regret it.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band <b>out.</b> <b>Anyway,</b> it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
5000|$|The {{movie is}} about a teenage girl who loves horror movies. She watches them all the time, yet is never frightened. Despite never being frightened, she begins to sleepwalk out of her house, {{resulting}} in her parents getting angry. They forbid her to watch any more horror movies {{in an attempt to}} prevent her sleepwalking, however there's a new movie called [...] "The Wisher" [...] out which is a huge hit with all her friends. Her father tells her she's not allowed to see it, but she sneaks <b>out</b> <b>anyways.</b> Before she leaves, she says [...] "I wish he would just go away" [...] and goes and sees the movie. Surprisingly, a scene in the movie is too much for her and she leaves. Her dad goes after her but then dies unexpectedly in a car accident. She then notices one of the characters in the movie following her around and whenever she makes a wish for something bad the wisher grants it.|$|R

25|$|Partly {{because it}} {{may not always be}} the case that a {{wrongdoing}} trustee can be found, or remains solvent, tracing became an important step in restitutionary claims for breach of trust. Tracing means tracking the value of an asset that properly belongs to a trust fund, such as a car, shares, money, or profits made by a trustee through a conflict of interest. If those things are exchanged for other things (i.e. money or assets) then the value residing in the new thing can potentially be claimed by the beneficiaries. For example, in an early case, Taylor v Plumer a dishonest broker, Mr Walsh, was given £22,200 in a banker's draft and was meant to invest in Exchequer Bills (UK government bonds) for Sir Plumer. Instead he bought gold doubloons and was planning a get-away to the Caribbean until he was apprehended at Falmouth. Lord Ellenborough held that the property belonged to Sir Plumer, in whatever form it had become. It may also be that the value of the traced trust money has changed, and possibly risen considerably. In the leading case, Foskett v McKeown an investment manager wrongfully took £20,440 from his clients, paid the last two out of five installments on a life insurance policy, and committed suicide. The insurance company paid out £1,000,000, although under the policy's terms this would have been paid <b>out</b> <b>anyway.</b> The majority of the House of Lords held that clients could trace their money into the payout and claim a proportionate share (£400,000). Theoretically the case was controversial, as the House of Lords rejected that such a tracing claim was founded upon unjust enrichment, as opposed to being the vindication of a property right.|$|E
500|$|Two family {{incidents}} {{during this}} time later surfaced during Romney's political campaigns. [...] A state park ranger in 1981 told Romney his motorboat had an insufficiently visible license number {{and that he would}} face a $50fine if he took the boat onto the lake. Disagreeing about the license and wanting to continue a family outing, Romney took it <b>out</b> <b>anyway,</b> saying he would pay the fine. The ranger arrested him for disorderly conduct. The charges were dropped several days later. In 1983, on a twelve-hour family road trip, he placed the family's dog in a windshield-equipped carrier on the roof of their car, and then washed the car and carrier after the dog suffered a bout of diarrhea. [...] The dog incident in particular later became fodder for Romney's critics and political opponents.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{finds out}} {{that he has been}} left alone, and takes his {{solitude}} to his advantage. When Cleveland and Quagmire arrive, Stewie believes that they are intruders and sprays tear gas all around them to knock them out. Stewie realizes his mistake, however, and he chains them to the Griffins' basement wall of his house and forcing them to watch the DirecTV help channel on a continuous loop. When Stewie consumes all of the food in the house, he applies for a job at fast food restaurant McBurgertown, but is eventually fired for stealing food (despite his insistence it was due to be thrown <b>out</b> <b>anyway).</b> Eventually, Stewie realizes how much he depends on his family and is thrilled to see them return. The episode ends with a scene of Cleveland and Quagmire reciting what is said on TV, and Cleveland eventually tells Quagmire, [...] "Did I tell you I'm getting a spinoff?".|$|E

500|$|During {{the course}} of the production, the {{creative}} styles of Anderson and Parrish came into conflict. Anderson remembered that on several occasions Kanter was called on to mediate: [...] " [...] both knew how important the picture was to our careers, and we both desperately {{wanted to be in the}} big time." [...] During one session, Parrish refused to follow the shooting script, having determined independently that not all the scripted scenes were essential to the plot. When Anderson reminded Parrish of his contractual responsibilities, the director announced to the cast and crew, [...] "Hell, you heard the producer. If I don't shoot these scenes which I don't really want, don't need and will cut <b>out</b> <b>anyway,</b> I'll be in breach of contract. So what we'll do is shoot those scenes next!" [...] Anderson discussed how the production of Doppelgänger presented new challenges, explaining, [...] "I had worked for so many years employing directors to do what I told them... Suddenly I came up against a Hollywood movie director who didn't want to play and we ended up extremely bad friends." [...] In his 2002 biography, Anderson stated that his sole regret about the film [...] " [...] that I hired Bob Parrish in the first place." [...] Sylvia Anderson comments that Parrish's direction was [...] "uninspired. We had a lot of trouble getting what we wanted from him." ...|$|E

Beiste tells them that adult {{relationships}} {{are more complex}} and insists she is fine. Hockey player Rick [...] "The Stick" [...] (Rock Anthony) ridicules Puck for being seen in the dress; they agree to a fight outside the school. Rick gains the upper hand and Puck is thrown into a dumpster, but he emerges brandishing a switchblade. Coach Beiste breaks up the fight; in the locker room, Puck tells her that the knife is a fake stage prop, and she retorts {{that he could have}} gotten expelled. Puck replies that he is flunking <b>out</b> <b>anyway</b> and a failure, telling her that she does not {{know what it feels like}} to be worthless. He breaks down, and Beiste comforts him as he cries. At home, Beiste tells Cooter that she is leaving him, and removes her wedding ring. He asks who else would love her; she answers: [...] "Me". Back at the school auditorium, she joins Puck in singing [...] "Mean", tells him that she has arranged for him to retake a crucial test to graduate, and promises to help him pass.

2500|$|Iranian Jews {{might be}} related to their desire for {{survival}} and led to their overselling of their anti-Israel positions. Their response to the questions regarding Israel have been outright denial of Israel or staying quiet.

2500|$|Potential US {{sanctions}} jeopardized {{access for}} Japanese fisheries to Alaskan waters, {{with an annual}} catch of a million tonnes of fish (...) , worth an estimated $425 million per year. A negotiated settlement was reached, allowing Japan to continue commercial whaling without the threat of US sanctions until 1988, with an agreement to drop Japan's objection to the moratorium in 1985. However, conservation groups sued the United States Secretary of Commerce, claiming that the law did not allow any deals. That claim was defeated by a US Supreme Court decision in 1986, and, as agreed, Japan withdrew its objection to the moratorium and ceased commercial whaling by 1988. Japan's access to Alaskan waters was later phased <b>out</b> <b>anyway,</b> {{due in part to}} pressure from US fishermen and conservationists, and also in response to Japan's subsequent use of research whaling.|$|E
2500|$|Exhibitions {{were often}} {{used during the}} Cold War to {{demonstrate}} culture and progress by both the United States and the Soviet Union.

[...] It featured American consumer goods, cars, boats, RCA color TVs, food, clothing, etc., and samples of American products such as Pepsi. [...] There was a typical American kitchen set up inside in which spectators could watch a Bird's Eye frozen meal be prepared. [...] An IBM RAMAC computer was programmed to answer 3,500 questions about America in Russian. [...] The most popular question was [...] "what {{is the meaning of}} the American Dream?" [...] The Soviets tried to limit the audience by only giving tickets to party members and setting up their own rival exhibition. [...] But ultimately people came, and the souvenir pins that were given out turned up in every corner of the country. [...] The Soviets banned printed material, but the Americans gave it <b>out</b> <b>anyway.</b> [...] The most popular items were the Bible and a Sears catalogue. [...] The guides for the exhibition were American graduate students, including African Americans and women, who spoke Russian. [...] This gave Russians the ability to speak to real Americans and ask difficult questions.

[...] Exhibitions like this were used to display the best a culture had to offer and basically show off in a way that appeared non threatening and even friendly.|$|E
