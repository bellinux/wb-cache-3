40|$|Introduction: Tight glycemic control (TGC) {{has shown}} {{benefits}} {{but has been}} difficult to implement. Model-based methods and computerized protocols offer the opportunity to improve TGC quality and compliance. This research presents an interface design to maximize compliance, minimize real and perceived clinical effort, and minimize error based on simple human factors and end user input. Method: The graphical user interface (GUI) design is presented by construction based on a series of simple, short design criteria based on fundamental human factors engineering and includes the use of user feedback and focus groups comprising nursing staff at Christchurch Hospital. The overall design maximizes ease of use and minimizes (unnecessary) interaction and use. It is coupled to a protocol that allows nurse staff to select measurement intervals and thus self-manage workload. Results: The overall GUI design is presented and requires only one data entry point per intervention cycle. The design and main interface are heavily focused on the nurse end users who are the predominant users, while additional detailed and longitudinal data, which are of interest to doctors guiding overall patient care, are available via tabs. This dichotomy of needs and interests based on the end user’s immediate focus and goals shows how interfaces must adapt to offer different information to multiple types of users. Conclusions: The interface is designed to minimize real and perceived clinical effort, and ongoing pilot trials have reported high levels of acceptance. The <b>overall</b> <b>design</b> <b>principles,</b> approach, and testing methods are based on fundamental human factors principles designed to reduce user effort and error and are readily generalizable...|$|E
40|$|ISBE will {{empower the}} {{experimental}} research community to make modelling {{part of their}} lab routine. Here we discuss how to define and structure ISBE modelling services, building on D 8. 2 's review of the purpose and <b>overall</b> <b>design</b> <b>principles</b> for modelling services. We identify the components of ISBE modelling services and propose an organizational structure to achieve uniform coverage of services from a heterogeneous network of expertises. A roadmap concludes the report, proposing initial low-budget services for selected modelling frameworks, then outlining a strategy for growth and scalability of ISBE modelling services. How to define and structure ISBE modelling services is a many-faceted question. First and foremost, one must identify the purpose of each service (what will it achieve?), which also entails specifying its inputs and outputs. It can be useful to group kinds of services into broader categories, either based on their function, or based on their organizational structure including staffing and funding. Modelling services will include automated analyses of published or user-provided models, fitting of parameters to user data, and refinement and adaptation of existing models. However, it also makes sense to include related services such as stewardship and training in the broad term "modelling services". A coordinating Systems Biology Centre (cSBC) will interconnect national Systems Biology Centres (nSBCs) to make the collective expertise of participating nations easily accessible for all European researchers. Chapter 2. 3 concretizes this with illustrations {{of the variety of}} modelling services that ISBE is likely to offer, and how to route requests from clients to ISBE tools and expertise. Levels of service may range from fully automatic tools to long-term per­sonal involvement, with access to more demanding services prioritized in cooperation with funders. Likewise, there will be several kinds and levels of documentation and user support. We advocate a focus on user needs in prioritizing what ISBE is to offer, in specifying services, and in routing expertise to clients. Clear descriptions of the data requirements for each modelling approach helps clients figure out their options and see what additional data they might require to open more options for modelling. Standardized virtual experiments can form an articulated link between modellers and experimentalists, and can be used to stream­line the confrontation of models with data, e. g. in parameter estimation and model selection. As candidates for pilot services to be offered by the interim "ISBE light", we have identified modelling frameworks that span a wide range of biologically interesting questions within a well-defined set of user inputs. These include ordinary differential equations (where the rates-of-change of state variables {{is a function of the}} current value of those state variables) and constraint-based models (based on stoichiometry in biochemical reaction networks). The demand for modelling services is anticipated to increase sharply once ISBE succeeds in transforming the practice of biological research and application. To meet this demand, we identify five key issues of scalability: Recruitment of providers, routing of clients to providers, strategic focusing of effort, training and education of users, and standardization and curation to streamline knowledge management, each of which is detailed in Chapter 5. 2...|$|E

To urban architectures, the developing mode has to be done from traditional high-consumption developing mode to low-consumption and low-pollution developing mode. Ecological architecture is the essential way for such transformation and also the essential trends to current world development. Ecological architecture refers to minimum affect environment; make full use of environmentally natural resources to realize high-efficiency utilization of resources and energy; satisfy people's demands with healthy, applicable and effective living environment, to achieve harmony between man and architectures; it is a big and complex systematic engineering including nature, society, economy and civilization, etc. Only if in a balanced state, the ecological architectures can be realized in overall significance and realize the object of sustainable development.
