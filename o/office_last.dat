Robinson--that's your senior clerk, isn't it?--seems to have been on the spot trying to save things. He's badly singed about the face and hands. I'm afraid you must go at once." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{extend to}} Mr. P. our sincere sympathy in the {{greatest}} calamity that can befall an unmarriageable man. The inconsolable survivor called at our <b>office</b> <b>last</b> evening, conversed feelingly some moments about {{the virtues of the}} dear departed, and left with the air of a dog that has had his tail abbreviated and is forced to begin life anew. Truly the decrees of Providence appear sometimes absurd.|$|E
60|$|I {{should have}} {{come down to the}} <b>office</b> <b>last</b> evening, but you see I have been moving. My landlady was too filthy dirty for anything! I stood it as long as I could; then I left. I'm coming {{directly}} I get your answer to this; but I want to know, first, if my blotter has been changed and my ink-well refilled. This house is a good way out, but the boy can take the car at the corner of Cobble and Slush streets.|$|E

60|$|For {{the last}} week I have been most perseveringly and ding-dong-doggedly at work, making headway but slowly. The spring always has a restless {{influence}} over me; and I weary, at any season, of this London dining-out beyond expression; and I yearn for the country again. This is my excuse for not having written to you sooner. Besides which, I had a baseless conviction that I should {{see you at the}} <b>office</b> <b>last</b> Thursday. Not having done so, I fear you must be worse, or no better? If you can let me have a report of yourself, pray do.|$|E
60|$|Matty, my dear sister, and Miss Mannahatta, and {{the little}} one (whose name I don't know, and perhaps hasn't got any name yet), I hope you are all well and having good times. I often, often think about you all. Mat, do you go any to the Opera now? They say the new singers are so good--when I come home we'll try to go. Mother, I am very well--have some cold {{in my head and}} my ears stopt up yet, making me {{sometimes}} quite hard of hearing. I am writing this in Major Hapgood's <b>office.</b> <b>Last</b> Sunday I took dinner at my friends the O'Connors--had two roast chickens, stewed tomatoes, potatoes, etc. I took dinner there previous Sunday also.|$|E
6000|$|... (M152) Next {{came the}} autumn cabinets, {{with all their}} embarrassments, so {{numerous}} that one minister tossed a scrap {{across the table to}} another, “We ought to have impeached Dizzy for not taking <b>office</b> <b>last</b> spring.” Disraeli had at least done them one service. An election took place at Bath in October. The conservative leader wrote a violent letter in support of the conservative candidate. “For nearly five years,” said Mr. Disraeli, “the present ministers have harassed every trade, worried every profession and assailed or menaced every class, institution, and species of property in the country. Occasionally they have varied this state of civil warfare by perpetrating some job which outraged public opinion, or by stumbling into mistakes which have been always discreditable and sometimes ruinous. All this they call a policy and seem quite proud of it; but the country has I think made up its mind to close this career of plundering and blundering.”(300) Mr. Gladstone described this curious outburst as “Mr. Disraeli’s incomparable stroke on our behalf,” and in fact its effect on public opinion was to send the liberal candidate {{to the head of the}} poll. But the victory at Bath stood solitary in the midst of reverses.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to glance at Mr. Carlyle's Easter Monday discourse without recalling the oration which his predecessor pronounced on resigning <b>office</b> <b>last</b> autumn. * * * Mr. Carlyle is as simple and practical as his predecessor was dazzling and rhetorical. An ounce of mother wit, quotes the new Lord Rector, is worth a pound of clergy, and while he admires Demosthenes, he prefers the eloquence of Phocion. A little later he repeats his old doctrine on the virtue of silence, laments the fact that 'the finest nations in the world--the English and the American--are going all away into wind and tongue,' and protests that a man {{is not to be}} esteemed wise because he has poured out speech copiously. Mr. Carlyle has so often inculcated these sentiments in his books {{that there can be no}} suspicion of an arrière pensée in their utterance now, but the contrast between him and his predecessor is at the least instructive. Each does, however, in some measure, supply what is deficient in the other. No one would claim for the Chancellor of the Exchequer the intensity of power of his successor, but in his abundant energy, his wide sympathy with popular movement, and his real, if vague and indiscriminating, faith in the activity and progress of modern life, he conveys lessons of trust in the present, and hopefulness in the future, which would be ill-exchanged for the patient and somewhat sad stoicism of Mr. Carlyle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She herself {{will demand}} the parting. She {{is a good}} girl, God help me! and a dutiful. She will not have her father and mother called schemers, and treated with scorn. Your mother knew not, very likely, what she was doing, but 'tis done. You may see the child, and she will tell you as much. Is Theo dressed, Molly? I brought the letter home from my <b>office</b> <b>last</b> evening after you were gone. The women have had a bad night. She knew at once by my face that there was bad news from America. She read the letter quite firmly. She said {{she would like to}} see you and say good-bye. Of course, George, you will give me your word of honour not to try and see her afterwards. As soon as my {{business}} will let me we will get away from this, but mother and I think we are best all together. 'Tis you, perhaps, had best go. But give me your word, at any rate, that you will not try and see her. We must spare her pain, sir! We must spare her pain!" [...] And the good man sate down in such deep anguish himself that I, who was not yet under the full pressure of my own grief, actually felt his, and pitied it. It could not be that the dear lips I had kissed yesterday were to speak to me only once more. We were all here together; loving each other, sitting in the room where we met every day; my drawing on the table by her little workbox; she was in the chamber upstairs; she must come down presently.|$|E
