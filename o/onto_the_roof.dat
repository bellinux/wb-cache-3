5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|On November 27, 1998, King County Metro driver Mark McLaughlin, {{the driver}} of a {{southbound}} route 359 Express articulated bus, {{was shot and killed}} by a passenger, Silas Cool, while driving across the bridge. Cool then shot himself as the bus veered across two lanes of traffic and plunged off the bridge's eastern side <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of an apartment building below. Herman Liebelt, a passenger on the bus, later died of injuries he sustained in the crash.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1934, {{while the}} rest of the team was playing in Omiya, Berg went to Saint Luke's Hospital in Tsukiji, ostensibly to visit the {{daughter}} of American ambassador Joseph Grew. Instead, Berg sneaked <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the hospital, one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, and filmed the city and harbor with his movie camera. He never did see the ambassador's daughter. Back at home, the Indians gave him his unconditional release. Berg continued on to the Philippines, Korea and Moscow.|$|E
50|$|The {{player can}} control an {{individual}} merc {{or group of}} mercs, issuing move, communication and various interaction commands. Mercs can run, walk, swim, crouch or crawl. Mercs may also climb <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of flat-roofed buildings.|$|R
50|$|For centuries Engans have {{constructed}} dwellings {{made from}} locally available bush materials. Roof construction is often of a crude thatch type, waterproofing being obtained by repeated lighting of a heavily smoking fire inside and the accretion of <b>the</b> soot <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> material.|$|R
50|$|Despite having led him there, the {{fiercely}} loyal Flay is {{angered by}} Steerpike's eavesdropping and locks {{him in a}} small room. Steerpike, however, escapes out of a window, risking his life above a sheer drop. He manages to climb up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> and towers of Gormenghast, and from there begins his rise to power.|$|R
5|$|The quatrefoil gunports in {{the lower}} levels {{could have been used}} for both hand cannons and crossbows, with {{overlapping}} fields of fire. The roof was reinforced with large timber joints, and could have supported heavier bombards, possibly on wheeled carriages; the tower's considerable height would have allowed the bombards to reach across the river onto the higher ground overlooking the city. Getting the bombards <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> may have required them to be hoisted up on a winch; one such hoist formed part of the accounts for the tower's construction in 1398 and 1399.|$|E
5|$|According to Kate, Farrar {{had moved}} out of the family home and spurned Green's desire for an amicable separation. Kate {{stressed}} that she loved and respected her mother and that all of the children had had good relationships with her, but that she was angry at her father for upsetting her mother by leaving. Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol. She denied that she had ever seen matches in the house and expressed surprise that Tim had not escaped by the same route she had, which was via a bedroom window <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army {{soldiers}} {{who were in the}} lead train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected by the force of the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train had been thrown <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.|$|E
25|$|The record {{crowd at}} the ground was on 29 April 1967 when 51,455 watched the Second Division title decider against Wolverhampton Wanderers. This was more than 6,000 more than the {{previous}} record set against Aston Villa in 1938. Many people who were at that game suggest the attendance was a lot higher, possibly over 60,000. Supporters climbed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> stands and up the floodlights.|$|R
50|$|When {{the station}} opened in 1941, it was {{intended}} to serve 60,000 passengers a day. It had six departure platforms linked by underground passages and another platform for arrivals. Soon after its opening, it was found to be inadequate and poorly planned. The canopies over the platforms were too narrow to protect passengers from rain and sun, and interfered with loading of baggage <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> buses.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} black cabs entered the stadium, five of which lit up with LED lights, each {{decorated}} with the Spice Girls' individual trademark emblems, (Posh: sparkling black, Sporty: go-faster stripes, Scary: leopard print, Baby: pink and Ginger: The Union Flag). The Spice Girls emerged from the cabs and performed [...] "Wannabe" [...] and [...] "Spice Up Your Life". Halfway through their performance, they ascended <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> cabs and proceeded to race around the stadium whilst singing and dancing from <b>the</b> <b>roofs.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the Imperial City, Mulan {{attempts}} to warn Li Shang about Shan Yu, but {{he refuses to}} listen. The Huns appear and capture the Emperor, locking themselves inside the palace. With Mulan's help, Li Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as concubines {{and are able to}} enter the palace and defeat Shan Yu's men. As Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan's instructions, Mushu fires a bundle of fireworks rockets at Shan Yu on her signal and kills him.|$|E
5|$|Media {{accounts}} {{had reported}} that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear the main house from the ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls {{and then into the}} house. As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the main house, that Osama bin Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
5000|$|One Hama resident, {{a doctor}} {{who did not want}} to be {{identified}} for fear of arrest, told Reuters that tanks were attacking Hama from four different directions and [...] "firing randomly". Another resident said snipers had climbed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> state-owned electricity company and the main prison, and that electricity had been cut in eastern neighbourhoods. [...] Syrian government tanks also fired on mosques where the loudspeakers broadcast, [...] "Allahu Akbar".|$|R
5000|$|Second {{installation}} {{is based}} at BeachClub. This is 2-deck high relaxation oasis, covered with a transparent dome for tropical beach-like experience. At night, this area transforms into a magnificent entertainment arena with several bars and live music. Emotion Media Factory installed 6 High Class Lasers with integrated special effects for projection <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> dome <b>roof</b> and spectacular laser beam shows for the entire BeachClub. 4 High Power video beamers project specially created video films <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> transparent <b>roof</b> top. Emotion Media Factory produced over 120 minutes exclusive video content for <b>the</b> BeachClub <b>Roof</b> and <b>the</b> installed water screen projection.|$|R
25|$|Gunfire was {{exchanged}} {{over the}} next several days. After the initial flurry of shooting, Boone—who reemerged as the natural leader even though as a captain he was outranked by Major Smith and Colonel Richard Callaway—urged the Kentuckians to conserve their gunpowder. At night, Native Americans ran up to the walls and attempted to throw burning torches <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> houses within. This was ineffective, however, because the warriors made easy targets for the Kentucky marksmen.|$|R
5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built on the south side of the home.|$|E
5|$|Nariman House, a Chabad Lubavitch Jewish centre in Colaba {{known as}} the Mumbai Chabad House, {{was taken over by}} two attackers and several {{residents}} were held hostage. Police evacuated adjacent buildings and exchanged fire with the attackers, wounding one. Local residents were told to stay inside. The attackers threw a grenade into a nearby lane, causing no casualties. NSG commandos arrived from Delhi, and a naval helicopter took an aerial survey. During the first day, 9 hostages were rescued from the first floor. The following day, the house was stormed by NSG commandos fast-roping from helicopters <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> covered by snipers positioned in nearby buildings. After a long battle, one NSG commando Havaldar Gajender Singh Bisht and both perpetrators were killed. Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka Holtzberg, who was six months pregnant, were murdered with four other hostages inside the house by the attackers.|$|E
5000|$|Hundreds {{of people}} {{gathered}} outside the pub the next day, and even climbed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of adjoining buildings, {{to see the}} coffin as it was taken for burial to St. Thomas's churchyard in Upholland on Sunday 23 April 1815. George Lyon was buried in his daughter's grave (not, as is traditionally believed, that of his mother or grandmother), the inscription simply reads [...] "Nanny Lyon, Died 17th April 1804". His name is not recorded on the stone.|$|R
50|$|On 7 June 1788, riots {{broke out}} all over the town of Grenoble. Soldiers sent to quell the {{disturbances}} forced the townspeople off the streets. Some sources say that the soldiers were sent to disperse parliamentarians, who were attempting to assemble a parliament. However, <b>the</b> townspeople climbed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of buildings, hurling roof-tiles at the soldiers in the streets below, hence the name. This drove royal troops out of the city in the first outbreak of political violence that became the revolution.|$|R
50|$|Numerous urban legends exist {{about the}} {{creature}}'s origins {{and the methods}} it employs to claim its victims. According to some accounts, the creature uses either hypnosis or voice mimicry to lure trespassers <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> trestle to meet their death before an oncoming train. Other stories claim the monster jumps down from <b>the</b> trestle <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of cars passing beneath it. Yet other legends tell that it attacks its victims with a blood-stained axe and that the very sight of the creature is so unsettling that those who see it while walking across the high trestle are driven to leap off.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a Last Ride match between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy, {{where the only}} way to win was by throwing one's opponent into a hearse and driving it out of the arena. During the beginning of the match, The Undertaker tossed Kennedy into steel steps {{on the side of the}} ring and then onto the commentator's announcing table. The Undertaker then threw Kennedy into the ring apron, which is the apron covering the area under the ring. Kennedy and The Undertaker wrestled inconclusively until The Undertaker tossed Kennedy on top of the roof of the hearse. The Undertaker then delivered a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver, both <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the hearse. As he was still in control of the match, The Undertaker threw Kennedy into the hearse and drove it out of the arena to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Imam Ahmad bin Yahya {{inherited}} the Yemeni throne in 1948. In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against him. A {{group of soldiers}} under his command surrounded the royal palace of Al Urdhi at Taiz, a fortified stronghold where the Imam lived with his harem, the royal treasure, an arsenal of modern weapons, and a 150 strong palace-guard, and demanded Ahmad's abdication. Ahmad agreed, but demanded that his son, Muhammad al-Badr succeed him. Thalaya refused, preferring the king's half brother, the Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48-year-old Foreign Minister. While Abdullah began forming a new government, Ahmad opened the treasury coffers and secretly began buying off the besieging soldiers. After five days, the number of besiegers was reduced from 600 to 40. Ahmad then {{came out of the}} palace, wearing a devil's mask and wielding a long scimitar, terrifying the besiegers. He slashed two sentries dead before exchanging the sword for a sub-machine gun and leading his 150 guards <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the palace to begin a direct attack on the rebels. After 28 hours, 23 rebels and one palace guard were dead and Thalaya gave up. Abdullah was later reported executed, and Thalaya was publicly decapitated.|$|E
5|$|Phil's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) {{is accused}} by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) of {{attempting}} to frame her for the murder. As Janine prepares to flee Walford, Peggy finds Roxy and Ronnie fighting. She tells the girls that she too was present the night Archie was killed, arriving to find him injured but alive, however left without calling for medical help. Outside, Bradley and Stacey are {{about to take a}} taxi to St Pancras railway station when Bradley realises he has forgotten their passports. He tells Stacey to wait and hurries back home to collect them, but is spotted by the police. A chase ensues, and Bradley climbs <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of The Queen Victoria public house in an attempt to escape. He shouts for Stacey to run before losing his footing and falling from the roof. He dies from his injuries as a distressed Stacey reaches him and the residents look on in horror. Stacey is comforted by Max, and confesses that she is the one who killed Archie.|$|E
50|$|Hororata {{sustained}} {{some damage}} in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010. The settlement's most prominent building, the Anglican church of St. John, was badly affected; part of its tower collapsed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> church's <b>roof.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eyewitnesses {{claim they}} saw a {{helicopter}} or airplane pass several times overhead before dropping 'sparks' <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> {{of one of the}} sources of the fires. The investigation found traces of phosphorus at the source of the fire, leading a police chief to claim it was not an accident. The fire started simultaneously in Zone 1 and Zone 4, on opposite ends of the camps, leading some to suspect foul play Additionally, a section leader in the camp reported that two living tents far from camp were simultaneously burned, leading the community to further suspect foul play.|$|R
5000|$|The {{book was}} sought after, {{especially}} in Cambridge itself {{where it was}} {{regarded as one of}} few [...] "guidebooks" [...] to <b>the</b> routes <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> town's ancient buildings. Famous climbs documented in the book are the King's College and St John's College chapels and the [...] "Senate House leap" [...] across Senate House Passage between Gonville and Caius College and the Senate House. The Night Climbers of Cambridge is often credited with inspiring the next generation of urban explorers and spawned many University of Cambridge legends and traditions. Since its publication several climbs of King's College Chapel have been completed.|$|R
25|$|A prank {{played by}} pupils at the School {{attracted}} national press coverage, including from The Sun, and generated online debate in 2009. Pupils moved numerous bricks <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> {{of the main}} building to spell out a rude word in large letters, which was spotted on Google Earth.|$|E
