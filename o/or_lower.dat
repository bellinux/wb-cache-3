5|$|A {{variety of}} pollinators have been {{recorded}} visiting the flower spikes, including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants. The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground <b>or</b> <b>lower</b> leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.|$|E
5|$|Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine: The {{princess of}} Agrabah, who {{is tired of}} life in the royal palace. Larkin was chosen nine months after her audition, and had to adjust (<b>or</b> <b>lower)</b> her high-pitched voice to reach the voice the filmmakers were looking for in the character. Jasmine's supervising {{animator}} was Mark Henn. Lea Salonga provides Jasmine's singing voice.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} in several countries with different health care system models to assess the cost-effectiveness of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as vancomycin or teicoplanin. In most countries, linezolid was more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates <b>or</b> <b>lower</b> overall treatment costs.|$|E
5|$|The canal had a lock at Thorne {{and another}} where it joined the River Trent at Keadby.

5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard <b>or</b> <b>lower</b> class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the third}} {{hour after the}} shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest. Doctors {{said that if the}} bullet had been only one millimeter higher <b>or</b> <b>lower,</b> the wound would have been less severe.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum <b>or</b> <b>lower</b> leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E

50|$|Conscious {{parallelism}} is a {{term used}} in competition law to describe pricing strategies among competitors in an oligopoly that occurs without an actual agreement between the players. Instead, one competitor will {{take the lead in}} raising <b>or</b> <b>lowering</b> prices. The others will then follow suit, raising <b>or</b> <b>lowering</b> their prices by the same amount, with the understanding that greater profits result.|$|R
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into threeparts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th <b>or</b> <b>lower</b> were eliminated. The second qualifying period lasted for 15minutes, {{at the end of}} which the fastest ten cars went into the final period, to determine their grid positions for the race. Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race but those competing in it were not, and so carried more fuel than they had done in the earlier qualifying sessions.|$|E
5|$|The Prana (breath, vital air) of {{the body}} is {{dispersed}} within and outside the body. The first aim of yoga is to become aware and control this vital air, to be equal to <b>or</b> <b>lower</b> than the inner fire within one's body. This inner fire resides in the middle part {{of the body}}, and he calls it the Nabhi (center) and a Chakra. This is the residence of the Jiva, and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive. Just above this Nabhi is the kundalini which normally is dormant. Yoga awakens her, by bringing vital air and heat to her.|$|E
5|$|The lumbar (<b>or</b> <b>lower</b> back) {{region is}} made up of five {{vertebrae}} (L1â€“L5), sometimes including the sacrum. In between these vertebrae are fibrocartilaginous discs, which act as cushions, preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together {{while at the same time}} protecting the spinal cord. Nerves come from and go to the spinal cord through specific openings between the vertebrae, providing the skin with sensations and messages to muscles. Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and abdomen. Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of the spine.|$|E

50|$|The {{underlying}} vowel {{of a word}} remained {{when the}} vowel e formerly followed. For example, in masculine o-stems, the vocative singular form had e in the ending, but the other forms had other vowels which caused either raising <b>or</b> <b>lowering.</b> In neuter o-stems, all forms had raising <b>or</b> <b>lowering</b> endings, none originally contained e. This can {{make it difficult to}} ascertain what the original underlying vowel was.|$|R

5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} Saturday afternoon was split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 18th <b>or</b> <b>lower.</b> During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver {{set a time}} within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 17. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position.|$|E

By raising <b>or</b> <b>lowering</b> a chain <b>or</b> boom, access could be selectively granted rather than simply rendering the stretch of water completely inaccessible. The raising and lowering could be accomplished by a windlass mechanism or a capstan.|$|R

5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials <b>or</b> <b>lower</b> labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of {{the top of the head}} has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{around the}} eye are called circumorbital scales and are named as ocular scales but with {{appropriate}} prefixes. The ocular scale proper is a transparent scale covering the eye {{which is called}} the spectacle, brille or eyecap. The circumorbital scales towards the snout or the front are called preocular scales, those towards the rear are called postocular scales, and those towards the upper or dorsal side are called supraocular scales. Circumorbital scales towards the ventral <b>or</b> <b>lower</b> side, if any, are called subocular scales. Between the preocular and the postnasal scales are one or two scales called loreal scales. Loreal scales are absent in elapids.|$|E
