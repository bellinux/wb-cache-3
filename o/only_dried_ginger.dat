5000|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>ginger</b> ale is {{recognized}} as a Canadian creation by John McLaughlin, a chemist and pharmacist. Having established a soda water bottling plant in 1890, McLaughlin began developing flavour extracts {{to add to the}} water in 1904. That year, he introduced [...] "Pale <b>Dry</b> <b>Ginger</b> Ale", the bubbly libation that would be patented in 1907 as [...] "Canada <b>Dry</b> <b>Ginger</b> Ale". An instant success, Canada Dry products were accepted by appointment to the Vice-Regal Household of the Governor General of Canada. The dry-style also became popular in the United States during the Prohibition era, when it was used as a mixer for alcoholic beverages. <b>Dry</b> <b>ginger</b> ale quickly surpassed golden ginger ale in popularity. Today, golden ginger ale is an uncommon, more regional drink exemplified by Vernors. By contrast, <b>dry</b> <b>ginger</b> ale is produced on a large scale internationally, and is a staple in supermarkets and bars, and on airlines.|$|R

50|$|Fresh ginger can be {{substituted}} for ground ginger {{at a ratio of}} six to one, although the flavors of fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>ginger</b> are somewhat different. Powdered <b>dry</b> <b>ginger</b> root is typically used as a flavoring for recipes such as gingerbread, cookies, crackers and cakes, ginger ale, and ginger beer.|$|R
5000|$|Ginger ales {{generally}} {{come in two}} varieties. Golden ginger ale; {{which is}} dark colored and more strongly flavoured; and <b>dry</b> <b>ginger</b> ale, which is more common today. <b>Dry</b> <b>ginger</b> ale was developed during prohibition when ginger ale {{was used as a}} mixer for alcoholic beverages which made the stronger flavour of the golden variety undesirable. <b>Dry</b> <b>ginger</b> ale quickly became more popular than golden, and today golden ginger ales like Sussex are an uncommon and usually a regional drink. People who visit the Maritime Provinces often bring Sussex Ginger Ale back home for friends and relatives who have connections to the Maritime Provinces.|$|R
40|$|Nine {{different}} Indian spices (red chilli, black pepper, turmeric, coriander, cumin, fennel, caraway, fenugreek, and <b>dry</b> <b>ginger)</b> commonly cultivated {{and highly}} used in India were analysed for natural occurrence of toxigenic mycoflora and aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxin A (OTA), and citrinin (CTN) contamination. Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger {{were the most}} dominant species isolated from all types of spices. Red chilli samples were highly contaminated with aflatoxins (85. 4 %) followed by <b>dry</b> <b>ginger</b> (77. 7 %). 56 % Aspergillus flavus from red chilli and 45 % Aspergillus ochraceus from black pepper were toxigenic and produced aflatoxins and ochratoxin A, respectively. Qualitative detection and quantitative detection of mycotoxins in spices were analyzed by ELISA and further confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Penicillium citrinum produced citrinin in red chilli, black pepper, coriander, cumin, fenugreek, and <b>dry</b> <b>ginger</b> samples. The highest amount of AFs was found in red chilli (219. 6 [*]ng/g), OTA was in black pepper (154. 1 [*]ng/g), and CTN was in <b>dry</b> <b>ginger</b> samples (85. 1 [*]ng/g). The {{results of this study}} suggest that the spices are susceptible substrate for growth of mycotoxigenic fungi and further mycotoxin production. This is the first report of natural occurrence of citrinin in black pepper and <b>dry</b> <b>ginger</b> from India...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{histological}} changes of cell structure in ginger during pre-treatment, steaming under pressure and solvent extraction of the oleoresin. The effects of pre-treatment on ginger were studied using fresh <b>ginger,</b> <b>dried</b> <b>ginger,</b> fresh ginger blanched at three different times (5, 10 and 15 min) at atmospheric pressure. Steaming of <b>dried</b> <b>ginger</b> prior to steam distillation was said to hasten the process. The effects of steaming <b>dried</b> <b>ginger</b> with varied durations (30 min, 1 h and 2 h) and under varied pressures (0. 3, 0. 6 and 0. 9 bar gauge) were also studied. Ginger oleoresin was obtained through solvent extraction. The effects of solvent extraction on <b>ginger</b> tissues, <b>dried</b> and fresh were observed after 3 h of extraction. The tissues were stained with Saffranin and Fast Green. The histological analysis was done using a light microscopy (LM) and had revealed some important information about the changes in the cell's structure. Through LM studies, it was confirmed that drying was a vital procedure for pre-treatment to speed up processing time. The reconstruction of parenchyma cell walls was observed after 30 min of steaming, which prolonged the steam distillation time and 3 h of solvent extraction time was insufficient for the extraction of the oleoresin...|$|R

Title of Diploma Thesis: Development of an HPLC {{method for}} the {{determination}} of 6 -gingerol, capsaicin, 8 -gingerol, 6 -shogaol and 10 -gingerol in Zingiber officinale samples The diploma thesis {{was focused on the}} development of an HPLC method for {{the determination of}} 6 -gingerol, capsaicin, 8 -gingerol, 6 -shogaol and 10 -gingerol in Zingiber officinale samples. At first, freshly prepared rhizome samples of ginger were selected. Afterwards, levels of analytes in model <b>dried</b> <b>ginger</b> powder samples were evaluated. 6 -gingerol had always showed highest response in both fresh rhizome samples of <b>ginger</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>ginger</b> powder samples. Capsaicin has not been found in any sample. 6 -shogaol has only been found in <b>dried</b> <b>ginger</b> powder samples. Extraction of other substances depended on the methodology of preparation of particular samples. During the optimization of this method, various mobile and stationary phases were examined. The suitable mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and water in 50 / 50 (v/v) ratio.
