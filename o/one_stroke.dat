No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented {{invasion of the}} chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege. In <b>one</b> <b>stroke</b> Charles destroyed his supporters' efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.|$|E

25|$|While a {{four-stroke}} {{piston engine}} completes <b>one</b> combustion <b>stroke</b> per cylinder for every two rotations of the crankshaft (that is, one-half power stroke per crankshaft rotation per cylinder), each combustion chamber in the Wankel generates <b>one</b> combustion <b>stroke</b> per driveshaft rotation, i.e. <b>one</b> power <b>stroke</b> per rotor orbital revolution and three power strokes per rotor rotation. Thus, the power output of a Wankel engine is generally {{higher than that}} of a four-stroke piston engine of similar engine displacement in a similar state of tune; and {{higher than that of}} a four-stroke piston engine of similar physical dimensions and weight.|$|R
5|$|Acting on Almond's instruction, Smith {{ordered the}} 5th Marines to attack west toward Mupyong-ni on 27 November. The attack was soon stalled by the PVA 89th Division {{and forced the}} Marines to dig in on the ridges {{surrounding}} Yudam-ni. As night came, three Chinese regiments of the 79th Division attacked the ridges on the north and northwest of Yudam-ni, hoping to annihilate the garrison in <b>one</b> <b>stroke.</b> Close range fighting soon developed as the attackers infiltrated Marine positions, but the 5th and 7th Marines held the line while inflicting heavy casualties to the Chinese. As day broke on 28 November, the Chinese forces and the American defenders were locked in a stalemate around the Yudam-ni perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Gary Player {{became the}} first non-American to win the Masters in 1961, beating Palmer, the {{defending}} champion. In 1974, he won again by two strokes. After not winning a tournament on the U.S. PGA tour for nearly four years, and {{at the age of}} 42, Player won his third and final Masters in 1978 by <b>one</b> <b>stroke</b> over three players. Player currently shares (with Fred Couples) the record of making 23 consecutive cuts, and has played in a record 52 Masters.|$|E
5|$|When Woods was 13 years old, {{he played}} in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major {{national}} junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only <b>one</b> <b>stroke.</b> As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} kinematic templates, end-user drawing {{tools that}} influence the mouse cursor's movement within specific areas of a digital canvas. Two types of kinematic templates influence the cursor's movement: passive and active templates. Passive templates modify existing movement received from a pointing device to change the cursor's speed or direction of <b>one's</b> <b>stroke.</b> Active templates add movement to the cursor without movement from the pointing device. Since templates are provided as user-specified regions, these regions {{can be associated with}} areas of detail and they can be overlapped as a means of function composition. [¶] A kinematic template can be configured to improve upon one's freehand output without producing perfect output. Since templates do not necessarily prescribe geometric output, they constitute a visual composition aid that lies between unaided freehand drawing and drawing aids such as snapping constraints and perfect geometric primitives. [¶] Since kinematic templates can improve upon the consistency of <b>one's</b> <b>strokes,</b> it is beneficial for drawing visual styles such as hatching (an artistic effect that adds depth to a drawing with uniform strokes drawn in close proximity) and repetitive patterns. Since kinematic templates do not prescribe a type of output, one can "fight against" a template's preferred path of movement and discover unexpected, serendipitous outcomes...|$|R

25|$|The arm {{movements}} of the front crawl provide most of the forward motion. The arms alternate from side to side, so while one arm is pulling and pushing under the water, the other arm is recovering above the water. The move can be separated into four parts: the downsweep, the insweep, the upsweep, and the recovery. Each complete arm movement {{is referred to as}} a stroke; <b>one</b> <b>stroke</b> with each arm forms a stroke cycle.|$|E
25|$|McIlroy began 2013 {{with high}} aspirations, but mostly did not fare well in early tournaments. Struggling with the {{equipment}} change having signed a large endorsement deal with Nike in January, he withdrew from the Honda Classic in February, and finished in two over par and in a tie for 25th place at the 2013 Masters Tournament. McIlroy won the 2013 Emirates Australian Open on the 72nd hole. He beat Australian Adam Scott by <b>one</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E
25|$|McIlroy {{missed out}} on {{a chance to win}} the 2010 PGA Championship when he three-putted the 15th green to fall out of a tie for the lead.
