5|$|In 2007, Cameroon {{hosted a}} total {{population}} <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> and asylum seekers of approximately 97,400. Of these, 49,300 {{were from the}} Central African Republic (many driven west by war), 41,600 from Chad, and 2,900 from Nigeria.

5|$|Operation Mistral 2, {{along with}} the near-concurrent Operation Sana, created a large number <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> from the areas {{previously}} controlled by the VRS. Their number was variously reported and the estimates range from 655 killed civilians and 125,000 refugees, reported by Radio-Television Republika Srpska in 2010, to approximately 40,000 refugees reported in 1995—both by Bosnian Serb sources. The latter figure was reported to encompass the entire contemporary populations of the towns of Jajce, Šipovo, Mrkonjić Grad and Donji Vakuf fleeing or being evacuated. At the time, the UN spokesman in Sarajevo estimated the number <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> at 20,000. The refugees fled to VRS-controlled areas around Brčko and Banja Luka, adding to the 50,000 refugees who had been sheltering in Banja Luka since Operation Storm.|$|E
40|$|While {{there is}} {{significant}} research and theoretical literature both within Australia and internationally that relates to social work with people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background, {{there is a lack}} of empirical research about how direct social work practice is understood and experienced by both people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background and social workers. Using a qualitative phenomenological approach informed by critical and anti-oppressive theories, I aimed to address this significant gap in empirical knowledge by capturing the lived experience of social work practice with people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background. My research questioned: how direct social work practice with people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background is understood and experienced. Thirty-one participants within Tasmania were recruited through volunteer and snowball sampling and were interviewed using a semi-structured interview. The participants were people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background, social workers who worked with people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background, and, social workers <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background. The interviews were thematically analysed. The interview data with people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background revealed both negative and positive experiences of social work practice. Experiencing help and change characterised positive encounters in which social workers were encountered as friends and partners who worked with the strengths <b>of</b> people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background. Negative experiences were characterised by the absence of help, change, friendship and a sense of partnership with the practitioner. Social workers commonly described positive practice as being with people through their personal relationships with clients. Negative practice involved being to people. Such negative practice was unreflective, emphasised professional boundaries and involved regarding people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background as powerless. Finally, for social workers <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background, the cultural exchange experience was the focus of what, for them, comprised positive practice. Cultural exchange was characterised by reciprocity and mutual learning between practitioner and client. Additionally, the professionalisation of social work was described as an obstacle to cultural exchange. The study‟s findings highlight the significance for participants of a relational standpoint in direct social work practice with people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background, requiring dialogical practices that were derived from and framed by friendships and partnerships between practitioners and clients. While it is acknowledged that qualitative findings do not easily lend themselves to generalisation, possible implications for practice are that social work needs to contend with how relationships with clients are understood as friendships and developed through reciprocity, dialogue and mutual learning. Further research is warranted to explore how to integrate these findings into the learning and practice of social work with people <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> background...|$|R

5|$|The Gateway Protection Programme {{initially}} had a {{quota of}} 500 refugees per year, which was later increased to 750, {{but the actual}} number <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. Liberian, Congolese, Sudanese, Burmese, Ethiopian, Mauritanian, Iraqi, Bhutanese, Eritrean, Palestinian and Somali refugees are amongst {{those who have been}} resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.|$|E

5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 24 September 1554, Knox {{received}} {{an invitation from}} a congregation of English exiles in Frankfurt {{to become one of}} their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict. The first set <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used {{a modified version of the}} Book of Common Prayer. More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors of the Book of Common Prayer. Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.|$|E
