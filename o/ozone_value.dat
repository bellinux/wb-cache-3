The present background current correction is altitude-dependent, since it is based on an assumed sensitivity of the electrochemical concentration cell to oxygen.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{recently}} re-evaluated time series of daily total ozone values for the period 1979 to 1992 for southern England. The series consists of measurements made at two stations, Bracknell and Camborne. The series shows a steady decline in ozone values in the spring months over the period, and this is consistent with data from an earlier decade that has been published but not re-evaluated. Of exceptional note is the monthly mean for January 1992 which was very significantly reduced from the normal value, and was the lowest so far measured for this month. This winter was also noteworthy for a prolonged period during which a blocking anticyclone dominated the region, and the possibility existed that this was related to the ozone anomaly. It was possible to determine whether the origin of the low <b>ozone</b> <b>value</b> lay in ascending stratospheric motions. A linear regression analysis of <b>ozone</b> <b>value</b> deviation against 100 hPa temperature deviations was used to reduce ozone values to those expected in the absence of high pressure. The assumption was made that the normal regression relation was not affected by atmospheric anomalies during the winter. This showed that vertical motions in the stratosphere only accounted for part of the ozone anomaly and that the main cause of the ozone deficit lay either in a reduced stratospheric circulation to which the anticyclone may be related or in chemical effects in the reduced stratospheric temperatures above the high pressure area. A study of the ozone time series adjusted to remove variations correlated with meteorological quantities, showed that during the period since 1979, one other winter, that of 1982 / 3, showed a similar although less well defined deficit in total ozone values...|$|E

40|$|Total ozone {{observations}} from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments during March 1997 revealed an extensive region of low column densities in the Arctic region centered near the north pole. Values were below 250 Dobson units {{for nearly a}} two week period during this period, and were correlated with {{the position of the}} northern lower stratospheric polar vortex. The March 1997 average total ozone column densities were more than 30 % lower than the average of column densities observed during the 1979 - 1982 March period. Both the northern spring seasons of 1998 and 1999 have shown much higher levels of total ozone. In this presentation, we will discuss the causes of the low total <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> in 1997 and contrast those low values with the higher 1998 and 1999 observations. I will additionally discuss the just completed SOLVE campaign and the March 2000 <b>ozone</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring the Northern {{hemisphere}} winter season, biomass burning {{is widespread}} in West Africa, yet the total tropospheric column <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> (< 30 DU) {{over much of}} the Tropical Atlantic Ocean (15 ° N? 5 ° S) are relatively low. At the same time, the tropospheric column <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> in the Southern Tropical Atlantic are higher than those in the Northern Hemisphere (ozone paradox). We examine the causes for low tropospheric column <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> by considering the horizontal and vertical transport of biomass fire emissions in West Africa during November through March, using observed data which characterizes fires, aerosols, horizontal winds, precipitation, lightning and outgoing longwave radiation. We have found that easterly winds prevail in the lower troposphere but transition to westerly winds at pressure levels lower than 500 hPa. A persistent anticyclone over West Africa at 700 hPa is responsible for strong easterly winds, which causes a net outflow of ozone/ozone precursors from biomass burning in West Africa across the Atlantic Ocean towards South America. The lowest outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and highest precipitation rates are generally found over the central Atlantic, some distance downstream of fires in West Africa making the vertical transport of ozone and ozone precursors less likely and ozone destruction more likely. However, lightning over land areas in Central Africa and South America can lead to enhanced ozone levels in the upper troposphere especially over the Southern tropical Atlantic during the Northern Hemisphere winter season...|$|R
