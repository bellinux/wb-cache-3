5|$|Kentucky Extension specialists suggest {{selecting}} uncommon {{species to}} replace removed ashes in the landscape. Previous generations created monocultures by planting ash trees in an overabundance, {{a factor in}} the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> caused by the emerald ash borer. Favoring instead a diversity in species helps keep urban forests healthy. University of Kentucky scientists suggest choosing monotypic species such as the pawpaw, yellowwood, Franklin tree, Kentucky coffeetree, Osage orange, sourwood, and baldcypress.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at the end}} of the 14th century, {{no doubt}} on account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> caused mid-century by the Black Death, there was a general shift towards less {{expensive}} techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using low quality wool, carding, etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.|$|E

5|$|The Eco Beach {{tourist resort}} was only built to resist wind gusts of Category3 strength. Only about 10 of the 40 {{accommodation}} huts were left standing.

Showing how strong Rosita's winds were, a sea container weighing 2.5 tonnes (5500 lb) and filled with 2 to 3 tonnes (4400 to 6600lb) of equipment was blown 700m (0.4mile) across sand dunes.

5|$|As {{a result}} of all these processes, large numbers of memorials, more than for any other conflict, were built across the world during the inter-war period. It is {{estimated}} that France built around 176,000 war memorials, including around 36,000 in the local communes. Most of the local commune memorials were built by 1922, but those in the towns and cities typically required more protracted negotiations, and their construction stretched into the 1930s. The 1920s were particularly busy for construction of memorials in Britain, although the trend tailed off in 1930s, with the last inter-war memorial unveiled at the town of Mumbles in 1939. The commissioning of Australian war memorials similarly reduced after the mid-1920s. Over 3,500 Romanian memorials were erected. Many German memorials were built during the 1930s. Russia was unusual in building very few war memorials to the events of World War I, mainly as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> of the Civil War and the political views of the subsequent Bolshevik government.|$|E
