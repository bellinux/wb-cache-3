Researchers used purposive sampling because the practice <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study has yet to be a culture in schools in Malaysia, especially in Sabah. A total of 10 teachers and 60 students were selected. A questionnaire used to obtain information on the perceptions of students and teachers on the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study. The questionnaires were distributed to respondents after the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study. SPSS data analysis shows that teachers and students have a positive perception towards the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study. Survey results show that the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study provides a new perspective in the context of pedagogy in schools among teachers.

Heavy bombers would attack Caen on the night preceding the assault, with 15% of the total bomb load being delayed action bombs set to explode when the ground attack was launched. A second wave of light bombers would follow the heavies and a third wave of American bombers would attack on the morning of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Lessons had a {{significant}} effect on the development of children's literature in Britain and the United States. Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Trimmer, Jane Taylor, and Ellenor Fenn, to name a few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because <b>of</b> <b>Lessons</b> and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. Lessons itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male Romantic writers, Barbauld's Lessons has rarely been studied by scholars. In fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{learned to}} swim at Bankstown {{at the age}} of 7. She was {{initially}} slow to learn, and her coach used a long pole attached to a rope and belt to maintain her safety. This allowed him to fish her out of the water if she fell into difficulty. Due to her slow learning, Morgan was given twice the number <b>of</b> <b>lessons</b> as the other students. At the age of eight, she won the district championship, and in 1953, aged 11, she won the New South Wales (NSW) Primary School Championships. In February 1956, aged 13, she was taken for serious training. Her father transferred her to the tutelage of Frank Guthrie in Enfield. At the time, Guthrie was {{regarded as one of the}} best coaches in the state; his students included Gary Chapman, Kevin O'Halloran and Lorraine Crapp. All three (plus Morgan) would win medals at the 1956 Summer Olympics.

Following the war, he held a number of senior commands in India. However, further promotion was checked by his having come into conflict with his commander-in-chief, who regarded him as unsuited for senior command {{in part because of}} his writings; Pilcher was a keen student of the German army and its operational methods, and an active theorist who published a number of controversial books advocating the adoption of new military techniques as well as an anonymous invasion novel.|$|E

These lessons highlighted the need for better protection of the main gun turrets and magazines, as well as thicker deck armor to protect against plunging fire. Existing methods of defense against mines and torpedoes had also proved to be inadequate and needed improvement. Eleven new designs were rejected between October and early 1917 before Captain Yuzuru Hiraga, superintendent of shipbuilding and the naval architect {{in charge of the}} fundamental design of the ships of the Eight-Eight Fleet, presented a heavily modified version of the Nagato design, A-125, to be built in lieu of the second ship of the class, Mutsu, on 12 June 1917, well before she was actually laid down.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – There {{has been}} rapid {{proliferation}} <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Studies and Learning Studies over the world. Do they really help teachers’ {{professional development and}} student learning? The {{purpose of this paper}} is to review studies from 2000 to 2010 on Lesson Study and Learning Study to unravel their benefits on teachers and students. Design/methodology/approach – Relevant studies were screen and extracted on available electronic databases to evaluate outcome <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study and Learning Study. The results were based on nine studies which examined the achievement of Learning Study and Lesson Study. Findings – All reviews identified positive evidence supporting the benefits <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study and Learning Study as powerful tool to help teachers examine their practices and enhance student learning. Although all nine studies showed positive effects <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study and Learning Study on teaching, learning or both, different outcome measures were employed and the study designs varied in qualities. Originality/value – More well-controlled studies with consistent and validated outcome measures were recommended in the future to address the short- and long-term effects <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study on students, teachers, and school level. Efforts should be focused on unveiling the relationship between what is taught and what is learned.

5|$|The chief {{objectives}} of Operation Dragoon were the important French ports of Marseille and Toulon, which were considered essential {{to supply the}} growing Allied forces in France. The Allied planners were cautious, taking heed <b>of</b> <b>lessons</b> learned from the Anzio and Normandy landings. They chose a location without high ground controlled by the Wehrmacht, conditions that had led to heavy casualties after the initial landings {{on one of the}} beaches at Normandy. The choice for the disembarkation site was an area on the Var coast east of Toulon. A preliminary air campaign was planned to isolate the battlefield and cut the Germans off from reinforcement by destroying several key bridges. A large airborne landing was also planned {{in the center of the}} landing zone to quickly seize the high ground overlooking the beaches. Parallel to the invasion, several commando units would take control of the islands off the coast.|$|E
5|$|These fashions {{permeated}} noble households, where resident musicians were employed, including viol and lute players. As {{elsewhere in}} Europe, musical ability {{became one of}} the major achievements expected of a nobleman or woman. Musicians were clearly employed as teachers for the children of the household, both male and female. There is evidence for the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries <b>of</b> <b>lessons</b> being given in a variety of instruments and singing, and of the purchase of sheet music and instruments (including the virginals and harpsichords). In the Highlands clan chiefs continued to employ harpists, and increasingly, pipers as fili and bards, whose prowess and ability to glorify their ancestors was a key element in underlying a clan's status and heritage into the seventeenth century. The earliest printed collection of secular music in Scotland was by publisher John Forbes in Aberdeen in 1662. Songs and Fancies: to Thre, Foure, or Five Partes, both Apt for Voices and Viols, known as Forbes' Cantus, was printed three times in the next twenty years. It contained 77 songs, of which 25 were of Scottish origin.|$|E

5|$|Attendees at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 {{took the}} {{decision}} to launch a cross-Channel invasion within the next year. Churchill favoured making the main Allied thrust into Germany from the Mediterranean theatre, but his American allies, who were providing {{the bulk of the}} men and equipment, over-ruled him. British Lieutenant-General Frederick E. Morgan was appointed Chief of Staff, Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), to begin detailed planning. The initial plans were constrained by the number of available landing-craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific. In part because <b>of</b> <b>lessons</b> learned in the Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942, the Allies decided not to directly assault a heavily defended French seaport in their first landing. The failure at Dieppe also highlighted the need for adequate artillery and air support, particularly close air support, and specialised ships able to travel extremely close to shore. The short operating-range of British aircraft such as the Spitfire and Typhoon greatly limited the number of potential landing-sites, as comprehensive air-support depended upon having planes overhead for as long as possible. Morgan considered four sites for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the Pas de Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, the Germans could have cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>lessons</b> for the Australians, {{not least of}} all was the need for tanks. Although the APCs had been used to support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in the certainty of suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon {{became one of the most}} highly decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression alone could not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly prepare an unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E

For the aspects of differences in the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study program based on different fields, there was no significant difference between the teachers of Science and Social Science. The overall results showed that acceptance and understanding about Lesson Study program was still at a moderate level. The study also found that professional development program through Lesson Study program enables subject teachers to be monitored each other through the concept of collaborative work in improving pedagogical skills. The results showed that the expansion of the teaching process through Lesson Study program can be used as a program for teachers’ professional development. There are significant differences among the perspectives of teachers teaching different subjects about Lesson Study. However, all teachers showed good perception in relation to the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Lesson</b> Study.
