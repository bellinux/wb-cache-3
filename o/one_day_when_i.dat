500|$|In 1968 film {{producer}} Marvin Worth hired novelist James Baldwin {{to write a}} screenplay based on The Autobiography of MalcolmX; Baldwin was joined by screenwriter Arnold Perl, who died in 1971 before the screenplay could be finished. Baldwin developed {{his work on the}} screenplay into the book <b>One</b> <b>Day,</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's [...] "The Autobiography of MalcolmX", published in 1972. Other authors who attempted to draft screenplays include playwright David Mamet, novelist David Bradley, author Charles Fuller, and screenwriter Calder Willingham. Director Spike Lee revised the Baldwin-Perl script for his 1992 film MalcolmX.|$|E

I {{said you}} don't believe that bullshit. He said, 'I damn sure do!' [...] <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel {{a piece of paper}} in his palm… [...] {{he said it was a}} conspiracy and he said … if you will keep your eyes open and your mouth shut, you're gonna learn a lot.

2500|$|Baldwin {{developed}} {{his work on}} the screenplay into the 1972 book <b>One</b> <b>Day,</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's The Autobiography of Malcolm X. In 1976, Baldwin wrote of his experience, [...] "I think that I would rather be horsewhipped, or incarcerated in the forthright bedlam of Bellevue, than repeat the adventure". Baldwin died in 1987. Several authors attempted drafts, including David Mamet, David Bradley, Charles Fuller and Calder Willingham. Once Spike Lee took over as director, he rewrote the Baldwin-Perl script. Due to the revisions, the Baldwin family asked the producer to take his name off the credits. Thus Malcolm X only credits Perl and Lee as the writers and Malcolm X and Alex Haley as the authors of The Autobiography of Malcolm X.|$|E
2500|$|Days {{before the}} decree {{absolute}} of divorce, letters patent were issued with general rules to regulate royal titles after divorce. Diana lost the style Her Royal Highness {{because she was}} no longer married to the Prince of Wales and instead was styled Diana, Princess of Wales. The Queen reportedly wanted to let Diana continue to use the style after her divorce, but Charles had insisted on removing it. As the mother of the prince expected to one day ascend to the throne, she was accorded the same precedence she enjoyed during her marriage. Prince William was reported to have reassured his mother: [...] "Don't worry, Mummy, I will give it back to you <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am King." [...] Almost a year before, according to Tina Brown, the Duke of Edinburgh had warned the Princess of Wales: [...] "If you don't behave, my girl, we'll take your title away." [...] She is said to have replied: [...] "My title is a lot older than yours, Philip." [...] Diana and her mother quarrelled in May 1997 after she told Hello! magazine that Diana was happy to lose her title of Her Royal Highness following her controversial divorce from Prince Charles. They were reportedly not on speaking terms with each other by the time of Diana's death.|$|E
