40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{and reports}} {{on the characteristics of}} writing-triggered peak experience and <b>other</b> <b>positive</b> human experiences and explores some possible factors that can bring about such moments. Three basic questions were explored: Can writing trigger peak experience and <b>other</b> <b>positive</b> human experiences? How are writing-triggered peak experience and <b>other</b> <b>positive</b> human experiences best described? What factors influence the occurrence of writing-triggered peak experience and <b>other</b> <b>positive</b> human experiences? Participants were asked to write about their happiest moment in writing. The sample consisted of 270 students enrolled in undergraduate writing classes at a major southwestern university. Of 270 participants, 119 (44 %) reported having had at least one peak experience or similar positive human experience as a result of writing. Protocols reporting peak experience and <b>other</b> <b>positive</b> human experiences in writing were analyzed for content, yielding a total of 14 descriptive attributes. The participants described their writing experiences as flow of the words, the process of writing is its own reward, peak performance, clarity, disappearance of negative states of mind, and enhanced sense of power and personal worth. Content analysis also yielded 13 possible triggers of peak experience and <b>other</b> <b>positive</b> human experiences including self-expression, realization, free writing, use of writing for introspection, and creative and inspirational writing. In addition, personal orientation was explored as a possible trigger of peak experience and <b>other</b> <b>positive</b> human experiences using a 16 -item questionnaire. Factor analysis results yielded four factors: (1) aesthetic creative expressive writing, (2) writing as a thinking and problem solving tool (3) self-discovery, and (4) not interested in writing. Factor one accounted for the highest variance (37 %). The common elements in this factor were expressive writing, self-related writing and creative poetic writing with poetic and creative writing having the highest loading...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{examined}} the effect of olive oil storage outdoors on a comprehensive series of quality measures. The conditions used were at the extreme of those encountered during the production of bottle oil. Filtered and unfiltered oils were compared as was the influence of inert gas (nitrogen) in the headspace. Increases in K 232, K 270 and peroxides over time were very much reduced by inert headspace gas, which also reduced losses of total phenols and oxidative stability. Headspace nitrogen also reduced the rise in unconjugated phenolics as secoiridoid derivatives declined and minimised losses in polyunsaturated fatty acids. The pattern of volatile compounds detected in olive oils stored indoors or outdoors showed subtle differences. Moreover, when stored with air exposure the levels of some negative sensory components such as penten- 3 -ol and hexanal increased while <b>other</b> <b>positives,</b> like trans- 2 -hexenal were reduced. These changes {{would be expected to}} reduce quality. Finally, Panel tests were used. All oils lost perceived quality on storage and this was accelerated outdoors while headspace nitrogen slowed the deterioration significantly.

40|$|This Critical Review on {{environmental}} concerns of desalination plants suggests that planning and monitoring stages are critical aspects of successful management {{and operation of}} plants. The site for the desalination plants should be selected carefully and should be away from residential areas particularly for forward planning for possible future expansions. The concerning issues identified are noise pollution, visual pollution, reduction in recreational fishing and swimming areas, emission of materials into the atmosphere, the brine discharge and types of disposal methods used are {{the main cause of}} pollution. The reverse osmosis (RO) method is the preferred option in modern times especially when fossil fuels are becoming expensive. The RO has <b>other</b> <b>positives</b> such as better efficiency (30 – 50 %) when compared with distillation type plants (10 – 30 %). However, the RO membranes are susceptible to fouling and scaling and as such they need to be cleaned with chemicals regularly that may be toxic to receiving waters. The input and output water in desalination plants have to be pre and post treated, respectively. This involves treating for pH, coagulants, Cl, Cu, organics, CO 2, H 2 S and hypoxia.

Significant issues have driven movement of people toward much larger cities (seeking better economic, cultural and social outcomes) and more spacious urban fringes (seeking improved environmental outcomes). The Whangarei CBD incorporates both the dying Commercial Centre and a thriving Town Basin which is the centre for Arts and Recreation within the city. The two areas are a juxtaposition. The investigation reveals reasons why two such contrasting areas exist and defines a design solution that seeks to resolve this and leverages {{the success of the}} Town Basin to revive the Commercial Centre. The aim of this thesis is to investigate ways that architecture can be used to invigorate Whangarei’s dying Commercial Centre by creating a place of activity, engagement and informal learning and by re-establishing the important connection Whangarei has with its river as well as <b>other</b> <b>positives</b> within the city. Thesis objectives: •	Identify the reasons for the decline of the Commercial Centre and the success of the Town Basin and how a connection can be established between the two. •	Establish a beating heart within the dying Commercial Centre and provide a life source in the form of people movement into the centre {{from all parts of the}} city. •	Provide dynamic spaces which encourage informal learning, social interaction, playfulness and creativity that will engage the people of Whangarei including youth and children. •	Use the natural environment as a means of engaging people of all ages by weaving together water, a restored ecology and architecture...|$|E

De 155 alunos examinados, encontraram-se 4 casos positivos (2, 6 %) de esquistossomose. Entre 25 familiares destes, encontraram-se outros 4 casos positivos (16 %). Havia na área uma população de Biomphalaria tenagophila (Orbigny, 1835), amplamente distribuída nas valas de irrigação de hortas de agrião, ligadas ao rio das Fumas. A taxa de infecção dos moluscos foi de 7 (0, 29 %) em 2. 400 examinados. Comparando-se estes resultados com dados anteriores, observa-se que a prevalência da esquistossomose se mantém no Alto da Boa Vista há pelo menos 15 anos.

40|$|Background The School of Clinical Sciences {{comprises}} {{a number}} of health disciplines including podiatry, paramedic science, pharmacy, medical imaging and radiation therapy. A new inter-professional unit was introduced in 2014, which covered key introductory learnings applicable for future health practitioners. This study examined teaching staff and student perspectives about their experience with the new unit for first year students. Methods Qualitative interviews with teaching staff (n= 9) and focus group interviews with students (5 groups which ranged in size from 4 - 30) were conducted. Extensive notes were taken during the interviews Issues emerging from the interviews were identified and organised according to themes and subthemes. Results Four major themes were identified namely: Something new; To be {{or not to be}} that is the question; Advantages of the new unit; and Areas for improvement. Previous staff experience with inter-professional learning (IPL) had been ad-hoc, whereas the new unit brought together several disciplines in a planned and deliberate way. There was strong philosophical agreement about the value of IPL but some debate {{about the extent to which}} the unit provided IPL experience. The unit was seen as assisting students’ social and academic adjustment to university and provided opportunity for professional socialisation, exposure to macro and micro aspects of the Australian health care system and various types of communication. For podiatry students it was their first opportunity to formally meet and work with other podiatry students and moved their identity from ‘university student’ to ‘podiatry student’. <b>Other</b> <b>positives</b> included providing the opportunity for staff and students to interact at an early stage with the perceived benefit of reducing attrition. Areas for unit improvement included institutional arrangements, unit administration aspects and assessment. Conclusion The unit was seen as beneficial by staff and students however, students were more polarised in their views than staff. There was a tension between feeling apart of and learning about one's own profession and feeling apart of and learning about the roles of other health professionals in relation to patient care and the health care system...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the article: SMEs play an {{important}} role as producers of new goods and services, as carriers of innovation. They are promoters of intense competition, creating a culture of entrepreneurial energy, and also have the ability to establish and improve relations between enterprises. The remarkable feature is constantly creating new ideas, what innovative companies liquidate stagnant firms during economic cycles. Methodology/methods: In formulating the scientific paper was used scientific methods of research, based on the classification of data from domestic and foreign sources, using conventional scientific methods such as analysis, synthesis and comparison. We also used the statistical method to query and scaling. Scientific aim: The scientific paper is to determine the status of SMEs in the region of Bratislava. The main focus is on strengths and weaknesses of the business through empirical research. The focus of work will consist of a comparison of results in the diapason from 2002 – 2010. In the design of the proposed measures will improve the condition. The aim of our study was to detect the possibility of obtaining external funds for business. Findings: Small and Medium Enterprises provides for the creation of new jobs. In the Slovak Republic, especially in the Bratislava region is business on increase evidenced by what also increase the number of businesses. Bridge financing used sources of business loans are. The most important criterion for obtaining funds from external sources for businesses is the interest rate.

40|$|As human age prolongs, {{also the}} {{retirement}} age limit of employees moves. Today sixty-year-old person if not affected by any serious health handicap is still a person full of energy, power and, yet, mature and experienced enough to handle regular work tasks as well as unpredictable situations not possible to manage only by a routine approach. (Jensik, 2013) Currently, the Age Management Concept, i. e. personnel management considering age and changing skills of employees within organisation, starts to be applied and implemented to some extent within the human resources management area. Thus, the organisation management, with in this concept, should approach to every single employee differently, understand their individual needs, support their continuous growth or development, and, on the other hand, accept their limits or weaknesses. These weaknesses should be minimised or removed completely in the employee organisation management mutual synergy. It is, thus, obvious that each employee shall have <b>other</b> <b>positives</b> and other negatives not only regarding the gender, work performance or position, but also {{with regard to the}} biological age. In this context, Vortelova (2013) presents the research of Manpower conducted in 2007 and focused on individual generations of employees from the perspective of social categories for the area of human resources management. It involves five generations of employees in total where one generation is limited by the duration approximately of 15 years. It concerns the generation of Pre-Boomers: employees born before 1946, and further the generation of Baby Boomers: employees born within the years from 1947 to 1960. The third generation is the X Generation: employees born during the years from 1961 to 1975. Typical for this generation is that the people are willing to work hard, they have distinctive individualistic features, money means value for them, and they strive not to run into debts, they make clear decisions between their family and career, and have rather pessimistic view of the world. The third generation is called Y Generation: employees born during the years from 1976 to 1990. This generation only sees money as a mean and willingly run into debts, requires good remuneration for work, willingly changes working places and, usually, does not seek any sense in the job, and requires more flexible working hours. The fifth generation is indicated as Z Generation: employees born during the years from 1991 to 2005. This youngest generation is highly interconnected and globalised, is constantly online, and uses advanced means of communication and technology. Pillinger (2008) or Polcakova (2011) define the Age Management Concept as a complex approach leading to the solution of demographic changes at the work place, supporting age diversity and management of work processes within the physical and social environment. The article offers a view to some of the partial results of quantitative and qualitative research conducted within the author's doctoral thesis focused on specific aspects of personnel management of employees of the age category 50 + in conditions of Czech and Slovak organisations and, further, of TACR (Technology Agency of the Czech Republic) grant project, OMEGA Programme to support applied social-science research and experimental development, registration No. TD 010129, Performance Potential of Employees 50 +, and specific forms of companies' human resources management. The main purpose of the article is to initiate discussion over the Age Management Concept or philosophy itself. Does, therefore, the personnel management considering the age and changing skills of organisation employees mean an opportunity or, on the contrary, a threat for the complex operation of the whole organisation...|$|E
