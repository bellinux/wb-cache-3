As well as striking photographs by Gullick and others, the magazine made heavy use of illustrators. Despite limited budgets (CTCL was effectively run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>True's</b> house in Brighton), the magazine was printed on heavy matt paper, and production quality was a priority.|$|R

40|$|M. F. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical {{reference}}s. The {{title of}} this thesis exhibition, <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> True: Line and Body, is a direct reference {{to the line of}} the plumb bob and the body of the viewer. This thesis suggests that the obstacles in life, which we have most likely created for ourselves, will continuously push us <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>true.</b> The viewer is responsible for finding and following that one unconditional truth that one sets forth for one's self. A truth for one person can be completely different for another person. That is where the idea for multiple unconditional truths stems from. All of the hanging plumb lines are true even if they do not agree with one another. If multiple plumb lines are next to each other, all pointing {{to the center of the}} earth, they create a pie shape rather than being parallel to one another. This simply proves there are always multiple ways <b>of</b> <b>truing</b> one's self...|$|R
5000|$|<b>True</b> the <b>wheel</b> by {{knocking}} abrasive particles from the wheel's surface {{and making the}} wheel concentric. This minimizes vibration and improves surface finish, eliminating the vibration of the out-of-balance wheel across the workpiece's surface. It {{is not unusual for}} grinding wheels to become <b>out</b> <b>of</b> round with use. This is partially from loaded (clogged) areas of the wheel wearing at different rates from less loaded areas. It can also be exacerbated by grinding when the wheel is not under power, such as using the work to apply braking action to the wheel to stop it from coasting. Dressing restores the roundness. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn <b>out</b> <b>of</b> round and are thus <b>out</b> <b>of</b> balance. <b>Truing</b> them by dressing resolves this problem.|$|R
