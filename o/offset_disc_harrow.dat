O presente trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar a qualidade do processo de colheita mecanizada de cana-de-açúcar crua, utilizando o controle estatístico do processo (CEP), e a capacidade do processo gerar resultados dentro dos limites especificados, por meio da análise de capabilidade, quantificando as perdas e os danos causados às soqueiras pelo mecanismo de corte basal. O experimento foi conduzido em área de ARGISSOLO Amarelo, localizada no município de Arez – RN, sob dois tipos manejos do solo, no sistema convencional de preparo. Os tratamentos foram: AR+GM (arado de aivecas + grade média); GP+GM (grade pesada + grade média) e as perdas determinadas por meio de amostragem. Os atributos do tipo rebolo repicado, toco e totais diferiram estatisticamente entre os tratamentos estudados, sendo os maiores valores de perdas quantificados para o tratamento que utilizou o arado de aivecas seguido de grade média. O processo de colheita apresenta-se fora de controle para os atributos do tipo rebolo repicado, cana inteira, cana-ponta, pedaço fixo, pedaço solto, lasca e estilhaço. O tratamento arado de aivecas seguido de grade média apresenta maiores graus de danos ocasionados às soqueiras, comparado ao tratamento (GP+GM). O tratamento (AR+GM) apresenta maior área de microrrelevo, diferindo estatisticamente do tratamento preparado com grade pesada seguida de grade média. The mechanized {{harvest of}} sugar cane {{is relevant to}} the whole productive process of the crop, including {{the quality of the}} final product that is delivered for processing at the plant.

The experiment was conducted in an area of yellow clay soil located in the municipal of Arez, RN, Brazil, using two methods of managing the soil within the conventional system of preparation. The treatments were: (a) moldboard ploughs followed by average weight <b>offset</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> and; (b) heavy <b>offset</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> followed by average weight <b>offset</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow,</b> with the losses being determined through samples.

The objective of this work was to study, in the specific soil conditions present in Southern Portuguese agriculture, the effect of working with a disc harrow at a reduced gang angle and at a higher forward speed, in terms of work rate, fuel consumption per hectare and distribution of dry soil aggregates. A trailed type medium-weight <b>offset</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> (20 discs of 610 mm diameter) was used, pulled by a four wheel drive tractor.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the dynamics of}} the tractor-implement combination in traction works, in the specific soil conditions present in Southern Portuguese agriculture. The tillage operations are very power demanding and are therefore responsible for significant energy inputs. The inappropriate operation of the tractor, in regarding to engine and gearbox speeds and poor management of ballast and tire inflation pressure, combined with poor regulation of tillage implements can result in significant energetic efficiency losses with impact on the economic returns that can be provided by agriculture to farmers and the viability of agricultural enterprises. The purpose of this project was to study tractor-implement dynamics in tillage operations. A portable computer- based recording system (data acquisition system) was developed and installed on tractors to monitor engine speed, fuel consumption, actual forward speed, wheel slip and draught force required for trailed implements. The field tests were performed under real working conditions. Field trials carried out under different working conditions allowed, firstly, to establish predictive models for traction effort and fuel consumption per unit of area that can be used by farmers as a reference when working with trailed <b>offset</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrows,</b> and secondly, to quantify the actual fuel savings that can be obtained by selecting an engine speed of about 80 % of rated speed, using the highest allowed gear ratio, by adjusting the tire inflation pressure and liquid ballast for each work situation (according to the coefficient of traction and traction-wheel slip) and adjusting the gang angle of the trailed <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> (and the working width and depth) to the soil conditions (soil type and moisture content) ...|$|R
40|$|Soil working {{operations}} in conventional farming systems involving {{the use of}} tractors {{are some of the}} operations which incur the highest energy costs. Sustainability of such systems requires strictly-controlled management of resources which can lead to a significant reduction in crop-production costs, derived from savings in fuel consumption. A novel data acquisition system has been successfully integrated on-board the Massey Ferguson 3000 series agricultural tractors for measuring tractor-implement performance. A commercial load cell was incorporated into the existing system for the needed tractor-implement performance measurements. This system is capable of measuring, displaying and recording, in real-time, the tractor’s theoretical travel speed, the actual travel speed, the engine speed, the fuel consumption rate, and the drawbar pull. Static calibration tests on various associated sensors for the required measurements show excellent linearity with correlation coefficients that are close to 1. The developed system has been extensively and successfully field demonstrated for tractor-implement performance with <b>offset</b> <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> on dry, undisturbed loamy soils. Under these conditions, a ratio of tractor power to implement width is suggested. The data also show the existence of a linear relationship between fuel consumption per hectare and specific draught, for the 4 to 9 kN m- 1 range, which suggests the possibility of extending the ASABE model of draught prediction to forecast fuel consumption. The configuration of the tractor-harrow combination, based on the measurement of the draught required under operational conditions, provides the manufacturers with a reliable indication of the recommended power required for each harrow model. With this type of information farmers can make decisions regarding selection of a suitable tractor-implement combination for their farms. As a consequence, there is improved tractor-harrow productivity and field efficiency...|$|R

The field tests with trailed <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> were performed under real working conditions, in dry medium textured soils, in primary and secondary tillage. The specific objective {{of the study was}} evaluating the liquid ballast and tire inflation pressure effects on tractor performance parameters. Were tested two different static ballasts, with and without tire liquid ballast, and three different inflation pressures: the inflation pressure specified by the manufacturer of tires (100 kPa in front tires and 70 kPa in rear tires); the inflation pressure specified by the tractor manufacturer (140 kPa in the tires of both axles); and the inflation pressure typical of the farmers in region (190 kPa in the tires of both axles).

The instrumentation system to determine energy requirements and efficiencies of tractor-implement, include a portable computer based record system mounted in the tractor, developed to record the information provided by TPM "Datatronic", which also records the information from a load cell based pull measuring system. The evaluation parameters were: the slip, the real distance, the work rate, the overall energy efficiency and the fuel consumption per hectare.

To avoid soil compaction, as well as to permit a more efficient general utilisation of the tractor, the common and indiscriminate use of liquid ballast should be questioned. It was also proved that concerning the situations of tire inflation pressure specified by the tractor manufacturer and the inflation pressure specified by the manufacturer of tires, there were no significant differences, both in work rate and in fuel consumption per hectare. The use of higher tire inflation pressures, showed a light diminution (3 % to 5 %) in the work rate and a great increasing in the fuel consumption per hectare (10 % to 25 %), even in good traction conditions displayed by the interval of slip values (7 % to 15 %).

However, {{the control of}} crop weeds and diseases in no-till (NT) systems has become increasingly difficult for landholders in Australia’s northern grains regions, with occasional strategic tillage (ST) being considered as a potential management option. This study investigated the effects of occasional ST on physical, chemical and biological soil properties, productivity, and weed control on five long-term (7 – 44 years) NT-managed soils. The study area extended from Biloela (Vertosol, 666 mm annual rainfall), Condamine (Sodosol, 624 mm annual rainfall), Moonie (Dermosol, 636 mm annual rainfall) and Warwick (Vertosol, 675 mm annual rainfall) in Queensland to Wee Waa (Vertosol, 582 mm annual rainfall) in New South Wales. Tillage treatments included chisel, <b>offset</b> <b>disc</b> and prickle–disc chain with various timings and frequencies. Soil samples (0 – 0. 3 m) obtained 3 and 12 months after occasional ST were analysed for total and particulate organic carbon (TOC, POC), available phosphorus (P), bulk density, soil water, and microbial enzymatic activity. In-crop weed density was also recorded. One-time tillage, with chisel tines, <b>offset</b> <b>disc</b> or chain <b>harrows,</b> in long-term NT helped to control winter weeds in the first year, with variable results in the second year. Grain yield overall showed no significant impact in either year, except on the Brown Sodosol (P = 0. 08) in the first year. The initial impacts of strategic tillage on soil water were largely restricted to the 0 – 0. 1 m depth range, with slight, non-significant decreases occurring.

This paper reports the results of field tests performed under real working conditions, using four wheel drive tractors and trailed <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> combinations, under different soils conditions. The data show a linear relationship between the drawbar pull per unit of implement width and the fuel consumption ha- 1. The results give evidence {{of the benefits of}} the “gear up, throttle down” approach...|$|R
40|$|When {{a farmer}} tills a {{field with a}} wheel-supported <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> or pulls a loaded wagon through a soft field, the speed and {{efficiency}} of his operation depend {{on the relationship between}} each tire and the soil. This varies with different wheels, changing soil conditions, and other factors. The object of this research was to determine the variables involved and thus give common ground for the study and comparison of the tire-soil relationships causing rolling resistance...|$|R
50|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> is the {{preferred}} method of incorporating both agricultural lime (either dolomitic or calcitic lime) and agricultural gypsum, and disc harrowing achieves a 50/50 mix with the soil when set correctly, thereby reducing acid saturation in the top soil and so promoting strong, healthy root development. Lime does not move in the soil, and this poses a critical challenge to sustainable zero-till farming, especially considering that chemical fertilizers are generally used by farmers around the world.|$|R
