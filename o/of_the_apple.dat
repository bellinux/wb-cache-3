5|$|In 2010, an Italian-led {{consortium}} {{announced they}} had sequenced the complete genome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apple</b> {{in collaboration with}} horticultural genomicists at Washington State University, using 'Golden Delicious'. It had about 57,000 genes, {{the highest number of}} any plant genome studied to date and more genes than the human genome (about 30,000). This new understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apple</b> genome will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The genome sequence also provided proof that Malus sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Apple sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} the Victoria School of Business and Technology in Saanich, British Columbia, {{claiming}} the school's logo infringed Apple's trademark rights and that the school's logo falsely suggested Apple had authorized the school's activities. The logo in question featured the outline of an apple and a leaf, although the design incorporated a mountain, had three bumps on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apple</b> instead of the two used by Apple, and had no bite out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apple,</b> unlike Apple's logo. In April 2011, the school reported it had settled its 3-year dispute with Apple, was launching a new logo under a new name, Q College, and was expanding its operations. The settlement's full terms were undisclosed.|$|E

5|$|Along the coast, large waves damaged 15 to 20boats in Falmouth, Maine harbor. Total boat {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at $250,000. Coastal residents in low-lying beach areas of Cumberland and York counties were evacuated in Maine. Several counties lost power during the storm. In Southwest Harbor, lightning struck the Dirigo Hotel, causing a fire that resulted in $100,000 in damages. Winds caused a lost of telephone and electrical services in the Auburn-Lewiston area due to falling trees or tree branches. Television antennas were damaged, as were several signs, including a Sears sign. In addition, 25% to 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apple</b> crop was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> entourage {{to be invited to}} attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and saw that {{there were only a few}} photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people.

40|$|For {{long-term}} storage <b>of</b> <b>apples,</b> <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal picking time {{of apples}} is very important. In Belgium, the optimal picking time is predicted every year based upon different quality tests. Because {{many of these}} tests are either subjective (for example colour and taste) or time consuming to measure (for example soluble solids and acid determination), there is a demand for an objective, fast and non-destructive assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apples.</b> <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> this contribution was to evaluate <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> NIR reflectance spectroscopy {{as a tool to}} measure quality attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apples</b> such as soluble solid contents, acidity, starch index and firmness in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> optimal picking time determination. Soluble solids, acidity, starch index and firmness were measured on 255 <b>apples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> varieties Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Elstar, Cox's Orange Pippin, and Boskoop at different dates before <b>the</b> picking date. <b>Of</b> each apple, 4 spectra were recorded and averaged. <b>The</b> maturity age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apples</b> was correlated with the spectra and resulted in very high correlations, which indicate that the NIR-technology is very well capable to determine the internal quality differences in time. More precise models, like for soluble solid content, starch content and acidity were also very satisfactory with high validation correlations. At last, a good correlation was obtained between the Streif-index, which is an indication for the picking time, with the spectra. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} use the NIR spectroscopy as a non-destructive technique for measuring internal apple quality. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Carol {{produced}} hurricane and gale force winds across New England. Strong winds from Hurricane Carol destroyed nearly 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apple,</b> corn, peach, {{and tomato}} crops from eastern Connecticut to Cape Cod. Overall crop damage {{was estimated at}} $22.25million. The hurricane destroyed several thousand homes in New England, {{many of which were}} destroyed from the waters or the powerful winds. Overall, 11,785families were directly impacted by the hurricane, including 9,720houses that were damaged and 1,545that were destroyed. High winds left over 150,000people without power in New England, potentially as many as one-third of all of New England, and many residents also lost phone service. The hurricane also destroyed 3,500cars and 3,000boats in the region. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused traffic accidents, but only minor flooding.|$|E

5|$|Pricing {{was central}} to the {{marketing}} strategy, {{as it had been}} through Sinclair's career. The ZX81 had been designed to meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 in the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Cisco Systems and Apple {{negotiated}} over allowing Apple {{rights to}} use Cisco's Linksys iPhone trademark, but the negotiations stalled when Cisco {{pushed for the}} two products to be interoperable. Following the public unveiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> iPhone at the 2007 Macworld Expo, Cisco {{filed a lawsuit against}} Apple in January 2007, alleging Apple's iPhone name infringed on Cisco's iPhone trademark. Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way, while Apple countered {{that there would be no}} likelihood of confusion between the two products, because Apple's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name, while Cisco's iPhone was a VoIP phone. Bloomberg reported Cisco's iPhone as a product marketed for less than $100 and part of the Linksys home routers, enabling internet-based calls through Skype and Yahoo! Messenger, and contrasted it with Apple's iPhone as a mobile phone which sold for around $600. In February 2007, Cisco and Apple announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the iPhone name worldwide.|$|E

5|$|These winds {{resulted}} in widespread agricultural, environmental and structural damage. Hundreds of structures sustained severe damage, mostly consisting of roofs blowing off. The most severe losses {{took place in}} Albany where most homes had partial or complete roof failure. Air-borne debris also damaged buildings during the storm. Nearly 80% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apple</b> crop {{was lost in the}} Donnybrook-Manjimup area. A total of 154,400m3 (5.4million ft3) of timber was lost as well as a potential 200,000m3 (7million ft3) of future growth on established trees. Widespread dust storms also ruined crops and removed topsoil from many areas. Near the coast, the combined effects of strong, onshore winds and little rain led to significant inland sea spray. Numerous power lines and stations failed during the storm due to winds as well as dust and salt accretion. Large portions of the South-West Land Division were without electricity due to Cyclone Alby; Perth nearly sustained a complete breakdown of power services. This led to secondary losses attributable to the storm such as production failure.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} model, {{based on}} discrete element method (DEM), can simulate damage to fruit during handling. A contact force model is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic ingredients <b>of</b> a DEM model. A rheometer device {{was used to}} measure and validate a tangential contact force model for 'Jonagold' <b>apples.</b> <b>The</b> Mindlin and Deresiewicz model for torsion was used to simulate quasi-static torsion and extended to include a viscous term in order to simulate dynamic torsion. The measured parameters were the dynamic friction coefficient, the shear modulus and <b>the</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apples.</b> For model validation purposes, the angular deformation, the torque, the contact surface and the normal force were measured as well.
