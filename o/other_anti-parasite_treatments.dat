40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{detrimental}} effects of anthropogenic pollutants may be worse if organisms are exposed to natural stress. In this study, we examined whether negative effects of organochlorines (OCs) could be influenced by parasites. In two breeding seasons, we administered an anti-helminthic drug to groups of breeding glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), whereas control groups were placebo treated. In all birds, blood residues of the most important OCs in the study population (hexachlorobenzene, oxychlordane, p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and polychlorinated biphenyl), were measured. The relationships between OCs and fitness components (i. e. nesting success and return rate between breeding seasons) were then compared between the birds receiving <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatment</b> and the controls. Among untreated males, higher blood residues of OCs were associated with lowered nesting success, while in males receiving <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatment,</b> there was no detrimental effect of OCs on fitness. Return rate was not affected by treatment or OCs. Our findings suggest that parasites may be an important factor in triggering reproductive effects of such pollutants, and that relatively low levels of OCs may have serious reproductive consequences in natural populations when stress from other sources is high...|$|R
40|$|Parasites are {{important}} drivers of ecological and evolutionary processes in their hosts. However, hosts often differ {{in how they}} are affected by parasitism, which can be important in how parasite effects on individuals scale up to the population level. Hosts may differ intrinsically in their susceptibility to parasitism, and extrinsic factors may impose constraints on how hosts allocate resources between immunity, maintenance and reproduction, thereby further affecting their {{ability to cope with}} infection. These extrinsic factors include the host’s ecological environment, for example food availability or weather, and its social environment, that is its interactions with conspecifics. This is particularly true during a reproductive attempt when individuals interact closely with other family members. Not only might immediate impacts of parasitism differ between and within parents and offspring, but the direct effects of parasitism on a host could have further indirect consequences for other family members through their behavioural interactions with parasitised individuals. The distribution of direct and indirect effects among all family members could affect the outcome of the breeding event and individuals’ future performance. However, teasing apart these various avenues of parasite impacts on families may be difficult if parasite burden or susceptibility is correlated between family members. In this thesis, I explore the consequences of parasitism for different family members of the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis infected with gastrointestinal nematodes, over a range of ecological conditions. In chapter 2, I demonstrate that chicks’ responses to <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatment</b> across four years vary between siblings and with environmental conditions, which may be mediated by resource allocation among siblings. In chapter 3, I explore how costs of parasitism are distributed among the whole family by simultaneously treating chicks and/or parents with an anti-parasite drug and measuring the outcomes for all family members. Treatment has a more marked effect for the non-treated generation than for the treated individuals, suggesting that parasitism may have important indirect costs. In chapter 4, I investigate whether within-brood variability in the effects of <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatment</b> and its cross-generational impacts are mediated by behavioural change, and show that chick treatment but not parent treatment influences several aspects of behaviour in the nest. In chapter 5, I demonstrate that the impact of chick <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatment</b> on parents persists beyond the breeding attempt, with parents of treated chicks foraging less overwinter and breeding earlier the following year, whereas there is no persistent effect of parents’ own <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatment.</b> Lastly, I provide an appendix examining the parasitology of the system in detail, including an assessment of in situ and proxy measures of worm burdens of chicks.

In this report we describe tools and protocols to investigate the genome and genetics of this neglected schistosome. We cultured developmental stages of S. haematobium, and investigated the utility of introducing gene probes into the parasites to silence two model genes.

We observed that both genes could be silenced – a phenomenon known as experimental RNA interference (RNAi).

The {{study was conducted in}} Norway on chicks of two predatory birds: White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla (L., 1758)) and Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis (L., 1758)). Chicks were treated against both endoparasites (internal parasites) and ectoparasites (external parasites). We treated against ectoparasites by spraying nests with pyrethrins. Within nests, chicks were randomly treated with either an antihelminthic medication (fenbendazole) or sterile water (controls). Treatment against either ectoparasites or endoparasites led to higher levels of the bone and liver enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Bilirubin levels were lower when treated against ectoparasites, whereas bile acids were higher. Anti-endoparasite treatment led to higher creatinine levels. In Northern Goshawks, treating against endoparasites led to higher urea levels and lower potassium levels. Treatment against ectoparasites increased uric acid and urea levels and reduced bilirubin levels and protein:creatinine ratios. In conclusion, <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatments</b> led to changes in several BCCVs, suggesting differences in nutrient absorption and physiological state of chicks that are possibly related to the costs of parasitism, but maybe also to the parasite treatment itself...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{bluestriped snapper}} Lutjanus kasmira and the {{blacktail}} snapper L. fulvus were deliberately {{introduced in the}} Hawaiian Archipelago from French Polynesia in the late 1950 s to enhance local fisheries. These species rapidly spread all over the Windward Islands, became extremely abundant and, therefore, caused controversial environmental concerns. A comparison of the whole metazoan parasite community of L. kasmira and L. fulvus was performed between their native ranges in French Polynesia (Moorea Island in the Society Archipelago and Ua Huka in the Marquesas Islands) and their introduced range in O'ahu, Hawaii, USA. We suggest that 8 monogenean species have been introduced with L. kasmira and L. fulvus into the Hawaiian Archipelago from French Polynesia; 2 other species {{as well as one}} nematode should be referred to as cryptogenic. Moreover, experimental mortality conducted on monogeneans found in Polynesia emphasizes the inefficiency of <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatment</b> which was performed 50 yr ago, explaining possible parasite introduction.

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} is a protean disease which may present manifestations that resemble other diseases posing serious problems of differential diagnosis.

Thus, extra attention must be paid to patients with lupus who present with the mentioned symptoms.

40|$|Maternally {{transferred}} immunity {{can have}} a fundamental effect {{on the ability of}} offspring to deal with infection. However, levels of antibodies in adults can vary both quantitatively and qualitatively between individuals and during the course of infection. How infection dynamics and their modification by drug treatment might affect the protection transferred to offspring remains poorly understood. Using the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi, we demonstrate that curing dams part way through infection prior to pregnancy can alter their immune response, with major consequences for offspring health and survival. In untreated maternal infections, maternally transferred protection suppressed parasitaemia and reduced pup mortality by 75 per cent compared with pups from naïve dams. However, when dams were treated with anti-malarial drugs, pups received fewer maternal antibodies, parasitaemia was only marginally suppressed, and mortality risk was 25 per cent higher than for pups from dams with full infections. We observed the same qualitative patterns across three different host strains and two parasite genotypes. This study reveals the role that within-host infection dynamics play in the fitness consequences of maternally transferred immunity. Furthermore, it highlights a potential trade-off between the health of mothers and offspring suggesting that <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatment</b> may significantly affect the outcome of infection in newborns...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : Co-infection with {{multiple}} parasite species is commonly observed {{in nature and}} interspecific interactions are {{likely to occur in}} parasite infracommunities. Such interactions may affect the distribution of parasites among hosts but also the response of infracommunities to perturbations. However, the response of infracommunities to perturbations has not been well studied experimentally for ectoparasite communities of small mammal hosts. METHODS : In the current study we used experimental perturbations of the ectoparasite infracommunity of sengis from Africa. We suppressed tick recruitment by applying an acaride and monitored the effects on the ectoparasite community. RESULTS : Our treatment affected the target as well as two non-target species directly. The experimental removal of the dominant tick (Rhipicephalus spp.) resulted in increases in the abundance of chiggers and lice. However, while these effects were short-lived in chiggers, which are questing from the environment, they were long-lasting for lice which spend their entire life-cycle on the host. In addition, the recruitment rates of some ectoparasite species were high and did not always correspond to total burdens observed. CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that infracommunity interactions may contribute to patterns of parasite burdens. The divergent responses of species with differing life-history traits suggest that perturbation responses may be affected by parasite life-history and that the ectoparasite infracommunity of sengis may lack resilience to perturbations. The latter observation contrasts with the high resilience reported previously for endoparasite communities and also suggests that <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatments</b> can affect the distribution of non-target species.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a {{parasitic}} disease infecting more than 200 {{million people in}} the world. Although chemotherapy targeting on killing schistosomes {{is one of the main}} strategies in the disease control, there are few effective ways of dealing with liver fibrosis caused by the parasite infection in the chronic and advanced stages of schistosomiasis. For this reason, new strategies and prospective drugs, which exert antifibrotic effects, are urgently required. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The antifibrotic effects of praziquantel were assessed in the murine models of schistosomiasis japonica. Murine fibrosis models were established by cutaneous infection with 14 ± 2 Schistosoma japonicum cercariae. Then, the mice of both chronic (8 weeks post-infection) and advanced (15 weeks post-infection) schistosomiasis were treated by gavage of praziquantel (250 mg/kg, once daily for 3 days) to eliminate worms, and followed by praziquantel anti-fibrosis treatment (300 mg/kg, twice daily for 30 days). The fibrosis-related parameters assessed were areas of collagen deposition, content of hydroxyproline and mRNA expressions of Col 1 α 1, Col 3 α 1, α-SMA, TGF-β, MMP 9, TIMP 1, IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 13 and IFN-γ of liver. Spleen weight index, alanine aminotransferase activity and liver portal venous pressure were also measured. The results showed that anti-fibrosis treatment improved liver fibrosis, splenomegaly, hepatic function, as well as liver portal hypertension. In order to confirm the anti-fibrotic properties of praziquantel, we established a CCL(4) -induced model and revealed that CCL(4) -induced liver fibrosis was inhibited by PZQ treatment for 30 days. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of praziquantel on mouse primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). It is indicated that mRNA expressions of Col 1 α 1, Col 3 α 1, α-SMA, TGF-β, MMP 9 and TIMP 1 of HSCs were all inhibited after praziquantel <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatments.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The significant amelioration of hepatic fibrosis by praziquantel treatment validates it as a promising drug of anti-fibrosis and offers potential of a new chemotherapy for hepatic fibrosis resulting from schistosomiasis...|$|R

Hence, we conducted a case control study enrolling PU, GC patients and controls at Pune, India. Methods: Risk factors for PU and H. pylori infection were assessed in participant interview. H. pylori status was assessed from stool by monoclonal antigen detection. To understand treatment effect, we followed 100 H. pylori positive patients. Results: We enrolled 190 PU patients, 125 Controls and 35 GU patients. Prevalence of H. pylori was 61 % among symptomatic patients and 45 % among controls.

Malaria, anemia and intestinal parasitism can co-exist {{in certain}} populations of Colombian children. The effects of retinol supplementation and anti-intestinal parasite treatment {{in children with}} malaria is unknown. Changes after this treatment of with respect to hemoglobin, retinol, ferritin and C reactive protein levels have not been previously monitored. Objective. The effect of simultaneous intervention with antimalarial, retinol supplementation and anti-intestinal parasites treatment will be monitored by examining levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, retinol and C reactive protein in children with malaria. Materials and methods. A non-blind experimental {{study was conducted in}} 93 children with malaria, aged 4 - 10 years. Each was randomly allocated to one of the following groups: (1) treatment with antimalarial and retinol supplement (Group MA); (2) treatment with antimalarial-retinol supplement and anti-parasitic drug (Group MAP); (3) treatment with antimalarial and anti-parasitic drug (Group MP), and (4) treatment only with antimalarials (Group M). The groups were observed for 30 days, with haemoglobin, ferritin, retinol and C reactive protein evaluated on days 0, 8 and 30 after treatment. Results. Mean values for the children at day 0 were as follows: hemoglobin 10. 3 &plusmn; 1. 6 g/dL, retinol 19. 1 &plusmn; 6. 0 &mu;g/dL, C reactive protein 75 &plusmn; 63 mg/L and ferritin 213 &plusmn; 203 &mu;g/L.

40|$|Parasitism {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} life history strategies to have evolved: parasites make up a majority of all named species, and nearly every multicellular organism must contend with a diverse suite of parasites. Characterizing differences in patterns of genome evolution between parasites and free-living species could reveal general evolutionary and physiological strategies underlying the evolution of parasitism, with implications for goals ranging from understanding biodiversity to developing <b>anti-parasite</b> <b>treatments.</b> Dramatic differences in gene content between parasitic and non-parasitic lineages, as well as the absence of parasitic lineages from many higher taxonomic groups (for example, two-thirds of insect orders lack parasites of plants), might indicate that parasitism is difficult to evolve and requires many genome-wide changes. However, inferences of the genomic changes that enable free-living organisms to evolve into parasites have been hindered by the fact that typical patterns of genome evolution are not well characterized in the closest non-parasitic relatives of many well-studied parasitic lineages. A major question therefore remains unanswered: are dramatic genetic innovations (such as the birth of many new genes or dramatic re-organization of genome content) necessary for the evolution of parasitism, or is the modification of pre-existing genes and traits sufficient? The primary aim of this dissertation was to characterize the genetic basis and evolution of traits involved in overcoming major barriers to parasitism. I helped lead the development of a novel genomic model system for host-parasite interactions: leaf-mining (i. e., endo-parasitic) flies in the genus Scaptomyza that feed on mustard plants including the genetic model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, and that are close relatives of the genetic model insect, Drosophila melanogaster. I then used approaches from evolutionary and quantitative genomics, functional genetics, and biochemistry to investigate genomic changes coupled with the evolution of parasitism of plants in this lineage. The availability of functional genetic and comparative genomic resources for many non-parasitic, microbe-feeding Drosophila is a key feature of this model system, which facilitated the identification of derived gene functions and patterns of genome evolution coupled with the transition to parasitism of plants. I found that Scaptomyza overcame some of the major barriers to parasitism through the modification of pre-existing genes and pathways rather than dramatic genetic innovations. Specifically, leaf-mining Scaptomyza evolved the capacity to efficiently detoxify the major defensive chemicals in their host plants through rapid molecular and functional evolution of paralogous genes encoding glutathione S-transferases, which are enzymes involved in detoxification of a broad range of electrophilic compounds across eukaryotes. The few other gene families evolving more rapidly in Scaptomyza than in its non-parasitic relatives also interact with dietary compounds, supporting the prediction that novel exposure to plant-derived toxins and nutrients is a major selective pressure for herbivorous insects. Lastly, I found evidence that a conserved pathway for peripheral sensory organ development is involved in the development of the serrated ovipositor of S. flava, a derived trophic organ associated with feeding and reproduction on plants. These findings challenge the paradigm that dramatic genetic innovations are required to overcome barriers to the evolution of parasitism. In addition to driving divergence among species, host-parasite interactions are also predicted to shape genetic variation within populations. In the second half of this dissertation, I investigated how genetic variation mediates the outcomes of plant-herbivore interactions. Through a genome-wide association study, I discovered that two classes of genes in the Arabidopsis genome control susceptibility to herbivory by S. flava: those affecting production of defensive chemicals and those affecting plant size. These findings, which bridge two competing theories regarding the genetic determinants of herbivory, resulted from an experimental approach that quantified both herbivore foraging behavior and feeding rates. Further, the effect of plant chemical defenses on feeding rate varied among populations of mustard-feeding Scaptomyza, which opens future avenues for dissecting genetic changes in Scaptomyza that determine how plant chemicals shape feeding behavior and performance. I conclude with a conceptual review that outlines key areas of future research required for understanding how interactions between plants and herbivores shape patterns of genetic variation...|$|R
