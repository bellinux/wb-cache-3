5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> number of artillery.|$|E
5|$|In the {{circumstances}} {{it was hardly}} possible for the new king to show adaptability or tolerance or diplomatic skill, which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships. Confronted with a desperate and chaotic situation he met it instead with grim determination and implacable ferocity. Towards {{the end of his}} life, forfeiting the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure, isolated by suspicion and mistrust. But, in spite of all, the name <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> defender of the faith {{is one of the most}} memorable in Ethiopian history.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of the}} Przeworsk culture's {{internal}} {{crisis situation}} came external pressures, namely the massive migration of peoples. At around 370 AD the Huns crossed the Volga River, defeating the Alans and then the Ostrogoths, causing in 375 the fall of their state located in the Black Sea shores region. This unleashed a domino effect, as various Germanic peoples moved west and south to avoid the danger. The Visigoths and others retreated, forcing further migrations, while {{the weakness of the}} Roman Empire encouraged encroachments of its territory, the whole scenario resulting in the fall of its western part. The paths <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>Great</b> Migration of Peoples led in part through the Polish lands, and the Germanic tribes living here joined the movement themselves, with the result of an almost complete, {{in the course of the}} 5th century, depopulation of Poland.|$|E

25|$|Another {{report of}} the disappearing <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> ship, is that 3 Ships of the Dutch Indian Company, saw this Carrack laying on the Harbour of Singapure 1603. After getting {{involved}} in a ferocious Battle, the Dutch captured the Santa Catarina.|$|E
25|$|On September 24, 2016, the PA named {{a school}} in Tulkarem after Salah Khalaf. Tulkarem {{governor}} Issam Abu Bakr said that the school was named after “martyr Salah Khalaf in order to commemorate the memory <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> national fighter”.|$|E
25|$|However {{the first}} {{seeds of the}} {{impending}} troubles were sown in his reign and the downhill roll towards the ultimate demise <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> empire was begun. Kulothunga lost the territories in the island of Lanka and more seriously, the Pandya territories were beginning to slip away from Chola control.|$|E
50|$|When {{the plans}} for the high school campus began, the school started working with the campus neighbors much earlier.The result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>greater</b> {{outreach}} was passing through the first steps of the Zoning process with no neighborhood opposition.|$|R
50|$|A 2014 {{announcement}} {{says that}} the Pavo-Indus Supercluster is just a lobe in a greater supercluster, Laniakea, that is centered on the Great Attractor. The Virgo Supercluster would also be part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>greater</b> supercluster, thus becoming the local supercluster.|$|R
60|$|Again the middy {{was silent}} for a time. He could by no means see his way out <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>greater</b> difficulty, and his heart almost failed him as he thought of the poor girl {{wandering}} in the wilderness without food or shelter.|$|R
25|$|Later {{after getting}} the freedom a school {{was built in}} the place of that ashram as the memory <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> fight. The school is named as Sathyagraha Memorial Sree Narayana Higher Secondary School (S M S N H S S). The school is managed by S N D P.|$|E
25|$|On the Gateshead riverbank, a {{few yards}} {{downstream}} of the old bridge, stood the splendid new mill premises of Messrs. J. Wilson & Sons, worsted manufacturers. This large gaslight-lit building had been erected after a fire which destroyed their previous premises, on the same site, three years before the events <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> fire.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the zenith}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> Donegal team who contested five {{successive}} Ulster Senior Football Championship Finals between 1989 and 1993. The Donegal team of this era also contested {{the final of}} the National Football League three times in a four-year period (1993 v. Dublin, 1995 v. Derry, 1996 v. Derry) without success. McEniff soon stood down as manager.|$|E

40|$|The State Board of Horse Commissioners, {{during the}} season of 1916, was able to cover the State more {{thoroughly}} than has ever been possible before. Because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>greater</b> activity and more complete canvass the number of licensed stallions and jacks in <b>this</b> report is <b>greater</b> than before.

25|$|Out <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> war {{at the end}} of the 16th {{century and}} the Manchu invasions of 1627 and 1636–1637, Koreans emerged with a {{discernible}} sense of themselves as a distinct ethnie united by birth, language, and belief forged by this immense clash of the three great powers of East Asia....Korea arrived at the brink of the seventeenth century as a nation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} small Polynesian {{settlements}} in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Caroline Islands, and in Vanuatu. An island group with strong Polynesian cultural traits outside <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> triangle is Rotuma, situated north of Fiji. The people of Rotuma have many common Polynesian traits but speak a non-Polynesian language. Some of the Lau Islands {{to the southeast}} of Fiji have strong historic and cultural links with Tonga.|$|E
25|$|This {{seniority}} {{ranking system}} does not diminish the importance and the greatness of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem and All the Near East, since its inclusion {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Apostolic Church of Alexandria in early medieval times. It is to be noted that the archiepiscopal status <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> Metropolis is also granted due to the Holy Apostolic Throne that it represents, being the Apostolic and Patriarchal Throne of Jerusalem, although its Metropolitan Archbishop does not claim that title and is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Holy Apostolic Throne of Alexandria.|$|E

50|$|The term also {{refers to}} the {{cooperation}} of Saarland, Lorraine and Luxembourg with the regions of Walloon and Rhineland Palatinate or parts of these two additional regions. One of these combinations, also called SaarLorLux, is Saarland-Lorraine-Luxembourg-Trier-Westpfalz. Trier and Westpfalz are the western parts of Rhineland-Palatinate. For example, there is a SaarLorLux-ticket, {{which can be used}} on all trains <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>greater</b> region.|$|R
5000|$|All of {{the tracks}} on the album were {{selected}} from his various recordings on the RCA Records label between 1983-87.

25|$|At an {{undetermined}} date, a great clearance {{of temple}} offerings {{had been made}} and a modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that show the splendid work of the first dynasty. A vase of Menes with purple hieroglyphs inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures {{are the most important}} pieces found. The noble statuette of Cheops in ivory, found in the stone chamber of the temple, gives the only portrait <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> pharaoh.|$|E
25|$|In November 1914, Casement {{negotiated}} a declaration by Germany which stated:The Imperial Government formally declares that {{under no circumstances}} would Germany invade Ireland {{with a view to}} its conquest or the overthrow of any native institutions in that country. Should the fortune <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>Great</b> War, that was not of Germany's seeking, ever bring in its course German troops to the shores of Ireland, they would land there not as an army of invaders to pillage and destroy but as the forces of a Government that is inspired by goodwill towards a country and people for whom Germany desires only national prosperity and national freedom.|$|E
25|$|Therefore I, Liliuokalani of Hawaii, do hereby {{call upon}} the President of that nation, to whom alone I yielded my {{property}} and my authority, to withdraw said treaty (ceding said Islands) from further consideration. I ask the honorable Senate of the United States to decline to ratify said treaty, and I implore the people <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> and good nation, from whom my ancestors learned the Christian religion, to sustain their representatives in such acts of justice and equity as may be {{in accord with the}} principles of their fathers, and to the Almighty Ruler of the universe, to him who judgeth righteously, I commit my cause.|$|E
40|$|The {{reconciliation}} of experimental and computational data is an on-going challenge in many fields <b>of</b> scientific enquiry. <b>This</b> {{is particularly true}} in chemistry, especially with respect to biologically interesting molecules, given the myriad of problems that now lend themselves to theoretical investigation. This work sampled several areas <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>greater</b> landscape using various computational methods, and compared these results to relevant, experimentally derived data...|$|R

50|$|Given a {{partially}} ordered class P, we can form a category with Ps elements as objects {{and a single}} arrow going from one object (element) to another if the first is {{less than or equal}} to the second. If P has a greatest element, the subobject partial order <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>greatest</b> element will be P itself. This is in part because all arrows in such a category will be monomorphisms.|$|R
25|$|I do {{not know}} how many men I saw, but {{certainly}} during this one march not less than 5,000. <b>Of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> number two only offered insults to the gang of prisoners....But little and petty as it was it galled horribly. The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers looked straight before them. Yet it was a valuable lesson. Only a few days before I had read in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg, saying, 'Where are your passes?' It had seemed a very harmless joke then, but now I understood how a prisoner feels these things.|$|E
25|$|<b>Of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> royal and ecclesiastical centre, {{little is}} yet known archaeologically. Excavations on the Roman {{fortress}} walls {{have shown that}} they may have survived more or less intact for much of their circuit, and the Anglian Tower, a small square tower built to fill a gap in the Roman way, may be a repair of the Anglian period. The survival of the walls and gates shows that the Roman street pattern survived, at least in part, inside the fortress. Certainly excavations beneath York Minster have shown that the great hall of the Roman headquarters building still stood and was used until the 9thcentury.|$|E
25|$|The decade {{also saw}} the birth of several new coin series which used {{innovative}} techniques {{that had never been}} before. These techniques were the use of a gold cameo in the coin. The first set that was part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>great</b> innovation was the Aviation Collection, which debuted in 1990. The Canadian aviation heroes were commemorated on a 20-coin set. Every coin in the collection consisted of a 24-karat, gold-covered oval cameo portrait of an aviation hero--a first for the Royal Canadian Mint. The coin itself featured a different plane ranging from the Gypsy Moth to the legendary Avro Arrow. These were proof coins while the case of issue was an aluminum case {{in the shape of a}} wing.|$|E
