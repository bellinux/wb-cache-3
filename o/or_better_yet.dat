Before the race, the men {{line up with}} their horses before the priest, who will bless them by sprinkling them with green branches that have been dipped into Epiphany holy water. Sometimes people desire to have this blessing for themselves as well. Winning the Epiphany race is a great honor for both horse and rider, while the post-race celebrations, win or not, are highly festive. As in other Orthodox heritage countries, water rites play a special role on this day.

French writers Thomas Narcejac and Pierre Boileau, who wrote several novels that were adapted into films, may also deserve some credit for developing the term “film noir.” Narcejac and Boileau’s novel D'entre les morts was adapted into Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, and their novel Celle qui n'était plus was adapted into the Henri-Georges Clouzot's Diabolique.|$|R

2500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Gârbea's main works is the reliance on intertextuality, as compliments to his predecessors in drama, novel and poetry. Speaking in 2009, Gârbea himself recalled his stylistic discovery of the 1980s: [...] "It still {{seemed to me that}} being a writer meant having visions and struggling to communicate them so that others may have them too. [...] I could not write prose, but I enjoyed writing drama because I had invented something very fun to do: old characters in new situations." [...] Poet and critic Octavian Soviany noted: [...] "Horia Gârbea is a dramatist who builds with a program in mind, placing his stake on the resources of parody and the intertextual play. The parodic here is given birth by the disabused conscience of a postmodern spirit, who knows that all books have been written and therefore only their 'rewriting' [...] is still possible". Commenting on the texts grouped within Cine l-a ucis pe Marx?, literary critic Mircea A. Diaconu placed the intertextual references (which often make a point of transgressing historical reality) in connection with William Shakespeare's phrase [...] "All the world's a stage", since [...] "everything is possible {{at the level of the}} text becoming reality". He praises the author for managing to preserve an [...] "absence that imposes", by not making his own intervention felt in the text. Diaconu admits that such an approach could be read as [...] "gratuitously bookish, [...] a line is more important than an event, a pun more important than a murder", but supports the notion that they all display an [...] "existential bearing", accounting for an [...] "intrinsic value." [...] He speaks of the technique as [...] "a vengeance of the theater" [...] on the traditional historical record: [...] "In essence, Horia Gârbea's theater emerges from the textual inconsistency of the world when faced with the consistency of history, <b>or,</b> <b>better</b> <b>yet,</b> from the inconsistency of history and the textual consistency of the world." ...|$|E

40|$|Can {{the value}} of a Master 2 ̆ 7 s degree be measured? The value of {{education}} is generally thought of in terms of returns to an individual, namely a higher salary, greater promotion opportunity, <b>or</b> a <b>better.</b> <b>Yet,</b> for an organization to be willing to pay higher salaries for people with more education, there must some increase in productivity associated with Master 2 ̆ 7 s level education. This dissertation develops a way to measure that productivity using the United States Navy as a model. A survey that asks people who have observed and supervised people with and without Master 2 ̆ 7 s degrees to distinguish differences in productivity between these two groups is designed. Productivity is defined in terms of the outcomes expected of education. The survey consists of ten scenarios that demonstrate mastery of these expected outcomes and asking supervisors how capable officers are of making the decision or performing the tasks in each scenario. Pairs of officers are then asked to answer the survey about officers in their organization. This provides a measure of the reliability of the survey. This research is largely exploratory in nature. It seeks to provide a better understanding of productivity gains associated with Master 2 ̆ 7 s level education and test the feasibility of undertaking a more extensive study. ...|$|R

60|$|Nothing notable beyond such {{pleasing}} generalities of {{path and}} people lay in our way, till {{we came to}} a place where a steep and perfectly smooth clay bank shot from a spur of the hills directly into the thoroughfare. Three urchins were industriously putting this to its proper use, coasting down it, that is, on the seats of what did them for breeches. An over-grown-up regard for my own trousers alone deterred me from instantly following suit. No such scruples prevented my abetting them, however, to the extent of a trifling bribe for a repetition. For they had stopped abashed as soon as they found they had a public. Regardless of maternal consequences, I thus encouraged the sport. But after all, was it so much a bribe as an entrance fee to the circus, <b>or</b> <b>better</b> <b>yet,</b> a sort of subsidy from an ex-member of the fraternity?

6000|$|But tite is {{the true}} word in this case. After all, what is it but another form of straightway? Cussedness, meaning wickedness, malignity, and cuss, a sneaking, ill-natured fellow, in such phrases as 'He done it out o' pure cussedness,' and 'He is a nateral cuss,' have been {{commonly}} thought Yankeeisms. To vent certain contemptuously indignant moods they are admirable in their rough-and-ready way. But neither is our own. Cursydnesse, {{in the same sense}} of malignant wickedness, occurs in the Coventry Plays, and cuss may perhaps claim to have come in with the Conqueror. At least the term is also French. Saint Simon uses it and confesses its usefulness. Speaking of the Abbé Dubois, he says, 'Qui étoit en plein ce qu'un mauvais françois appelle un sacre, mais qui ne se peut guere exprimer autrement.' 'Not worth a cuss,' though supported by 'not worth a damn,' may be a mere corruption, since 'not worth a cress' is in 'Piers Ploughman.' 'I don't see it,' was the popular slang a year or two ago, and seemed to spring from the soil; but no, it is in Cibber's 'Careless Husband.' Green sauce for vegetables I meet in Beaumont and Fletcher, Gayton, and elsewhere. Our rustic pronunciation sahce (for either the diphthong au was anciently pronounced ah, or else we have followed abundant analogy in changing it to the latter sound, as we have in chance, dance, and so many more) may be the older one, and at least gives some hint at its ancestor salsa. Warn, in the sense of notify, is, I believe, now peculiar to us, but Pecock so employs it. I find primmer (primer, as we pronounce it) in Beaumont and Fletcher, and a 'square eater' too (compare our 'square meal'), heft for weight, and 'muchness' in the 'Mirror for Magistrates,' bankbill in Swift and Fielding, and as for that I might say passim. To cotton to is, I rather think, an Americanism. The nearest approach to it I have found is cotton together, in Congreve's 'Love for Love.' To cotton or cotten, in another sense, is old and common. Our word means to cling, and its origin, possibly, is to be sought in another direction, perhaps in A.S. cvead, which means mud, clay (both proverbially clinging), <b>or</b> <b>better</b> <b>yet,</b> in the Icelandic qvoda (otherwise kód), meaning resin and glue, which are [Greek: kat' exochaen], sticky substances. To spit cotton is, I think, American, and also, perhaps, to flax for to beat. To the halves still survives among us, though apparently obsolete in England. It means either to let or to hire a piece of land, receiving half the profit in money or in kind (partibus locare). I mention it because in a note by some English editor, to which I have lost my reference, I have seen it wrongly explained. The editors of Nares cite Burton.
