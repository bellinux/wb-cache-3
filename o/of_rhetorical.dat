5|$|Josquin's motet style {{varied from}} almost {{strictly}} homophonic settings with block chords and syllabic text declamation to highly ornate contrapuntal fantasias, to the psalm settings which combined these extremes {{with the addition}} <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> figures and text-painting that foreshadowed the later development of the madrigal. He wrote many of his motets for four voices, an ensemble size which had become the compositional norm around 1500, {{and he was also}} a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six voices. No motets of more than six voices have been reliably attributed to Josquin.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used as a form <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{discussion}} <b>of</b> the <b>rhetorical</b> {{situation has}} been dedicated largely {{to questions of}} its ontology and of how it is constituted. Where this ontological orientation has inclined theorists to treat the concept as a theoretical premise, an institutional orientation would instead frame constructivist accounts <b>of</b> the <b>rhetorical</b> situation as a political-pedagogical commitment and treat the ethical obligations that arise from any given situation as bound to specific institutional forms. From an institutional perspective, the rhetorical situation is to conscience as the institution of school is to education. The distinction <b>of</b> both <b>rhetorical</b> situations and schools lies not in their contrivedness per se, but in the inventional capacities their contrived qualities sustain...|$|R

25|$|Vickers' {{analysis}} of {{the issue is the}} most extensive yet undertaken. As well as analysing the distribution of a large number <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> devices throughout the play, he also devised three new authorship tests; an {{analysis of}} polysyllabic words, an {{analysis of the}} distribution of alliteration and an analysis of vocatives. His findings led him to assert, with complete confidence, that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1. Vickers' findings have yet to be challenged.|$|E
25|$|Translated into {{terms of}} ancient criticism, {{he became the}} model of the plain style (: genus tenue or subtile). Greek and then Roman critics {{distinguished}} three styles <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> composition—the grand (or elaborate), the plain and the middle, the plain being nearest to the language of daily life. Greek rhetoric began in the grand style; then Lysias set an exquisite pattern of the plain; and Demosthenes might be considered as having effected an almost ideal compromise.|$|E

50|$|The rhetorical {{situation}} is the context <b>of</b> a <b>rhetorical</b> event {{that consists of}} an issue, an audience, {{and a set of}} constraints. Three leading views <b>of</b> the <b>rhetorical</b> situation exist today. One argues that a situation determines and brings about rhetoric, another proposes that rhetoric creates “situations” by making issues salient, and yet another explores the rhetor as an artist of rhetoric, creating salience through a knowledge of commonplaces.|$|R
25|$|Hymes' {{later work}} focuses on poetics, {{particularly}} the poetic organization of Native American oral narratives. He and Dennis Tedlock defined ethnopoetics {{as a field}} of study within linguistic anthropology and folkloristics. Hymes considers literary critic Kenneth Burke his biggest influence on this latter work, saying, “My sense of what I do probably owes more to KB than to anyone else”. Hymes studied with Burke in the 1950s. Burke's work was theoretically and topically diverse, {{but the idea that}} seems most influential on Hymes is the application <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> criticism to poetry.|$|E
25|$|The Heroides {{markedly}} {{reveal the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> declamation and may derive from Ovid's interest in rhetorical suasoriae, persuasive speeches, and ethopoeia, {{the practice of}} speaking in another character. They also play with generic conventions; most of the letters seem to refer to works in which these characters were significant, such as the Aeneid {{in the case of}} Dido and Catullus 64 for Ariadne, and transfer characters from the genres of epic and tragedy to the elegiac genre of the Heroides. The letters have been admired for their deep psychological portrayals of mythical characters, their rhetoric, and their unique attitude to the classical tradition of mythology.|$|E
25|$|In 1828, de Vatimesnil, {{minister}} {{of public instruction}} in Martignac's ministry, recalled Cousin and Guizot to their professorial positions in the university. The three years which followed were the period of Cousin's greatest triumph as a lecturer. His return to the chair was {{the symbol of the}} triumph of constitutional ideas and was greeted with enthusiasm. The hall of the Sorbonne was crowded as the hall of no philosophical teacher in Paris had been since the days of Pierre Abélard. The lecturer's eloquence mingled with speculative exposition, and he possessed a singular power <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> climax. His philosophy showed strikingly the generalizing tendency of the French intellect, and its logical need of grouping details round central principles.|$|E
40|$|As American presidential rhetoric {{has evolved}} over the last 225 years, presidents have {{increasingly}} sought new instruments to affect policy change and new mechanisms {{to communicate with the}} American people. Over {{the course of the last}} century, many have noted the rise <b>of</b> the <b>rhetorical</b> presidency where the quantity of speeches has dramatically increased and the purpose of presidential rhetoric has changed. In the Presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, their respective post-State of the Union tours have typified a relatively new dynamic <b>of</b> the <b>rhetorical</b> presidency. After a close examination of Bush and Obama’s Post-State of the Union tours in their second terms, one can see the continuing evolution <b>of</b> the <b>rhetorical</b> presidency and a predominantly personal mode of persuasion of the modern presidency...|$|R

25|$|The {{thematic}} {{exploration of}} free will vs. determinism is made clear from the start. In the film's brief prologue, an unseen narrator asks a series <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> questions that prime the audience to view the film through a metaphysical lens touching on traditional philosophical questions involving determinism vs. philosophic libertarianism, as well as epistemology. The theme is reinforced through the repeated appearance of a blind woman who briefly interacts with Manni in each alternative reality, and seems to have supernatural understandings of both the present and potential futures in those realities. The film ultimately seems to favor a compatiblist philosophical view to the free will question {{as evidenced by the}} casino scene and by the final telephone booth scene in which the blind woman redirects Manni's attention to a passerby, which enables him to make an important choice near the film's climax.|$|E
25|$|The social turn in {{composition}} pedagogy witnessed a move for community ideology and a newfound {{acknowledgment of the}} social, economic, and political forces that affect writers and discourse. James Berlin states, “The question of ideology has never been far from discussions of writing instruction in the modern American college,” and {{he notes that the}} writing classroom has always been a place for addressing questions pertaining to ideological subject matter such as class, race, economics, and civil rights. He proposes what is known as a social-epistemic model of writing instruction, in which the socially-constructed nature of knowledge and knowing is recognized. Berlin notes that “social epistemic rhetoric views knowledge as an arena of ideological conflict,” and such a writing pedagogy “offers an explicit critique of economic, political, and social arrangements.” Overall, the social turn {{in composition}} pedagogy represented a move for increased recognition <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> discourse communities, the social, cultural, and political forces that influence the classroom, and the ways that ideology affects writers and the writing classroom.|$|E

500|$|Scholars have {{subjected}} this poem, Narihira's most famous, {{to several}} conflicting interpretations in recent centuries. The Edo-period kokugaku scholar Motoori Norinaga interpreted {{the first part}} of it as a pair <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> questions, marked by the particle ya. He explained away the logical inconsistency with {{the latter part of the}} poem that his reading introduced by reading in an [...] "implied" [...] conclusion that though the poet remains the same as before, everything somehow feels different. The late-Edo period waka poet [...] took a different view, interpreting the [...] as exclamatory: the moon and spring are not those of before, and only the poet himself remains unchanged.|$|E
500|$|The early {{curriculum}} {{taught by}} ETNC reflected Mayo's own personal beliefs about education, focusing on participation and hands-on learning instead of memorization or rote learning. Speaking {{in terms of}} a hypothetical student, Mayo described his philosophy as [...] "instead of lecturing for him, put him to lecturing you." [...] In the words of high school English instructor David Gold, Mayo [...] "ruled his school with unquestioned authority, boxing unruly students about the ears, sending others home for infractions, and insisting upon exacting standards for English instruction". Gold describes Mayo's pedagogy as [...] "complex" [...] and argues that [...] "Mayo complicates and challenges our attempts to create discrete classifications <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> epistemologies and to connect pedagogical practices to political ideologies".|$|E
500|$|Besides his style, Cicero also admired {{other aspects}} of Demosthenes's works, such as the good prose rhythm, {{and the way he}} {{structured}} and arranged the material in his orations. According to the Roman statesman, Demosthenes regarded [...] "delivery" [...] (gestures, voice etc.) as more important than style. Although he lacked Aeschines's charming voice and Demades's skill at improvisation, he made efficient use of his body to accentuate his words. Thus he managed to project his ideas and arguments much more forcefully. However, the use of physical gestures wasn't an integral or developed part <b>of</b> <b>rhetorical</b> training in his day. Moreover, his delivery was not accepted by everybody in antiquity: Demetrius Phalereus and the comedians ridiculed Demosthenes's [...] "theatricality", whilst Aeschines regarded Leodamas of Acharnae as superior to him.|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} {{on the use of}} digital identities in first-year {{composition}} as a tool to help students understand the concept <b>of</b> the <b>rhetorical</b> situation. It examined four students 2 ̆ 7 experiences and how composing {{from the perspective of a}} digital identity impacted their understanding <b>of</b> the <b>rhetorical</b> situation and their own composing processes. The findings indicate that asking students to choose topics based upon their digital identities enabled them to write about a topic they had a personal stake or interest in.

40|$|In {{evaluating}} the constitutive nature {{of language and}} <b>of</b> particular texts, <b>rhetorical</b> analysis focuses attention {{on the nature of}} the community formed by a text, on its points of coherence and on its potential vulnerabilities.
