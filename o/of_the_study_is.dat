25|$|A {{critical}} finding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> {{that many}} of the 'disconnects' between the public's preferences and what actually is taking place are caused by weak or non-existent implementation tools – rather than by inadequate policies, as contained in the City/County Comprehensive Plan and other already adopted legislation.|$|E
25|$|When {{the primary}} {{endpoint}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) {{should not be}} used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.|$|E

25|$|Several African American {{health workers}} and {{educators}} associated with Tuskegee Institute helped the PHS {{to carry out}} its experimentation and {{played a critical role in}} the progress of the study. The extent to which they knew about the full scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> not clear in all cases. Dr. Robert Russa Moton, then president of Tuskegee Institute, and Dr. Eugene Dibble, head of the Institute's John Andrews Hospital, both lent their endorsement and institutional resources to the government study. Registered Nurse Eunice Rivers, who had trained at Tuskegee Institute and worked at its affiliated John Andrew Hospital, was recruited at the start of the study to be the main contact with the participants in the study.|$|E
25|$|Other studies {{concluded}} that the Tuskegee Syphilis trial has played a minor role in the decisions of black Americans to decline participation as research subjects. Of the studies that have investigated the willingness of black Americans to participate in medical studies, they have not drawn consistent conclusions related to the willingness and participation in studies by racial minorities. Some {{of the factors that}} continue to limit the credibility of these few studies is how awareness differs significantly across studies. For instance, it appears that the rates of awareness differ as a function of method of assessment, study participants who reported awareness of the Tuskegee Syphilis Trials are often misinformed about the results and issues, and awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> not reliably associated with unwillingness to participate in scientific research.|$|E

In 2012, the MTA released an analysis of transportation solutions for the North Shore, which included proposals for the reintroduction of heavy rail, light rail, or bus rapid transit using the North Shore line's right-of-way. Other options included transportation systems management which would improve existing bus service, {{and the possibility of}} future ferry and water taxi services. Bus rapid transit was the preferred for its cost and relative ease of implementation, which would require $352 million in capital investment. The project has yet to receive funding.|$|E
