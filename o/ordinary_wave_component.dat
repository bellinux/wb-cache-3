First, the soliton solutions of a 3 -wave system {{consisting of two}} short <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> and one long <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> are found and then the results are generalized to the corresponding integrable ($n+ 1 $) -wave system with $n$ short waves and single long wave.

40|$|An Ionosonde is an HF radar {{used for}} obtaining {{electron}} density {{profiles of the}} ionosphere. It basically works {{on the principle that}} a radio wave will be totally reflected if the radio frequency is equal to the characteristic frequency of the ionosphere which depends on plasma frequency, fp = (80. 5 N) 1 / 2 Hz, where N is the electron density in electrons per m 3. Thus knowing the height of reflection and the radio frequency one has a measurement of the electron density at that height. This simplified principle is somewhat more complex in practice since the group velocity of the radio wave is slower in the ionosphere so the height obtained using the time delay of the echo and assuming that the radio wave travels {{at the speed of light}} is an overestimation of the actual height of reflection. Also, the ionosphere is birefringent for radio waves so that the reflection conditions for one mode, the extraordinary wave, are different from the reflection conditions for the other mode, the <b>ordinary</b> <b>wave.</b> The electric field of the <b>ordinary</b> <b>wave</b> is left hand circularly polarized when viewed along the direction of the terrestrial magnetic field. For <b>ordinary</b> <b>waves</b> the reflection condition is simple in that the wave is reflected at the level where the frequency just equals the plasma frequency as defined above. It is therefore necessary to have a way of separating out the <b>ordinary</b> <b>wave</b> reflections when calculating ionospheric densities from the echoes obtained by an ionosonde.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} retrieving individual <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> in a multi-directional sea wave model. To solve this problem, a currently and commonly used method is three-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (3 D DFT) {{on the radar}} image sequence. However, the uniform frequency and the uniform wavenumber in a wavenumber frequency domain can not always strictly satisfy the dispersion relation, and the spectral leakage in both temporal and spatial domains exists due to the limited analysis area selected from an image sequence. As a result, the DFT method incurs undesirable error performance in retrieving directional <b>wave</b> <b>components.</b> By deeply investigating the data structure of the multi-directional sea wave model, we obtain a new and decomposable matrix representation for processing the <b>wave</b> <b>components.</b> Then, a novel successive cancellation method is proposed to efficiently and effectively extract individual <b>wave</b> <b>components,</b> whose frequency and wavenumber rigorously satisfy the liner dispersion relation. Thus, it avoids spectral leakage in the spatial domain. The algorithm is evaluated by using linear synthetic wave image sequences. The validity of the proposed novel algorithm is verified by comparing the retrieved parameters of amplitude, phase, {{and direction of the}} individual <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> with the simulated parameters as well as those obtained by using the 3 D DFT method. In addition, the reconstructed sea field using the retrieved <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> is also compared with the simulated remote sensing images as well as those attained using the inverse 3 D DFT method. All the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is more effective and has better performance for retrieving individual <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> from the spatio-temporal remote sensing image sequences than the 3 D DFT method...|$|R

The magnitudes of the residual undulations are also investigated for mono-, bi- and multichromatic waves over different time segments. Several sets of wave data are analysed to perceive the energy due to natural frequency of the basin, energy transferred to the side bands and the damping rate of the residual waves in the tank with respect to the chosen incident wave conditions. In the analysis it is observed that the energy damping rate varies with the incident wave condition but seems much faster than that of 20 minutes traditional waiting time in between two runs in the OEB. The energies for tank's natural frequency components and other free waves were found to be very small compare to the incident primary wave energies. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{electron}} correlation {{on different}} pairing symmetries {{are discussed in}} details where the electron correlation has been treated within the slave boson formalism. It is shown that for a pure s or pure d wave pairing symmetry, the electronic correlation suppresses the s wave gap magnitude (as well as the T_c) {{at a faster rate}} than that for the d wave gap. On the otherhand, a complex order parameter of the form (s+id) shows anomalous temperature dependence. For example, if the temperature (T_c^d) at which the d <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> of the complex order parameter vanishes happens to be larger than that for the s <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> (T_c^s) then the growth of the d <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> is arrested with the onset of the s <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> of the order parameter. In this mixed phase however, we find that the suppression in different components of the gap as well as the corresponding T_c due to coulomb correlation are very sensitive to the relative pairing strengths of s and d channels as well as the underlying lattice. Interestingly enough, in such a scenario (for a case of T_c^s > T_c^d) the gap magnitude of the d <b>wave</b> <b>component</b> increases with electron correlation but not T_c^d for certain values of electron correlation. However, this never happens in case of the s <b>wave</b> <b>component.</b> We also calculate the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap along both the high symmetry directions (Γ - M and Γ - X) in a mixed s+id symmetry pairing state and the thermal variation of the gap anisotropy (Δ_Γ - M/Δ_Γ - X) with electron correlation. The results are discussed with reference to experimental observations. Comment: 22 pages, latex, 12 figures (attached in ps /eps) Journal : Accepted for publication in Euro. J. Phys...|$|R

The reason of this investigation is to understand the extent of the natural frequency energy components of the tank of different modes in the measured wave data and also the damping rate of the residual surface undulation components in the tank with time. Results are shown for both monoand bi-chromatic waves.
