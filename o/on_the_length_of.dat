The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E

5|$|Cohen had {{acquired}} reprint {{rights to the}} magazines' back issues, although Wrzos did get Cohen to agree to print one new story every issue. Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as Great Science Fiction and Science Fiction Classics, but no payment was made to authors {{for any of these}} reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), a professional writers' organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for a boycott of Ultimate's magazines until Cohen agreed to make payments. Cohen agreed to pay a flat fee for all stories, and then in August 1967 this was changed to a graduated rate, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the story. Harry Harrison had acted as an intermediary in Cohen's negotiations with SFWA, and when Wrzos left in 1967, Cohen asked Harrison to take over. SF Impulse, which Harrison had been editing, had folded in February 1967, so Harrison was available. He secured Cohen's agreement that the policy of printing almost nothing but reprinted stories would be phased out {{by the end of the}} year, and took over as editor with the September 1967 issue.|$|E
5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a wooden-hulled ship is about 300feet, after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater. The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E

Tolls charged along the A9 motorway toll plazas vary depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> route traveled and range from 3.00 kuna (€0.40) to 26.00 kuna (€3.51) for passenger cars and 15.00 kuna (€2.02) to 185.00 kuna (€25.00) for semi-trailer trucks. Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A user of {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars or up to 205.00 kuna (€27.70) for semi-trailers, depending on vehicle classification in Croatia. Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems. The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is used by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E
