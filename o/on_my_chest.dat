We did the take outside the office and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> pulling my teeth out. And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E

[...] Coined as a [...] "new brand of hood majesty," [...] {{the song is}} accompanied by a simple beat, which includes finger snaps and [...] "xylophone clings." [...] Lean Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Rap's spitfire explores her softer side, sampling Annie Lennox on her honey-tongued ode to a good man." [...] Greenblatt went on to compare the song to Jay-Z's [...] "kindred" [...] "Young Forever." [...] Minaj makes several references in her lines to well known people, which includes Bruce Willis in Die Hard, as well as Adam and Eve. Minaj makes several connections to Superman including in the pre-chorus, [...] "'S' <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> let me get my cape on." [...] The official remix featuring Cash Money labelmate Jay Sean was leaked via-internet on August 2, 2010, and later made available for purchase in Australia via iTunes. American rapper Flo Rida released an unofficial remix to the song, in which he adds a verse. Reggae recording artist Sean Paul also did a remix to the song where he ad-libs his verse throughout the original and later adds his own verse. Other remixes to the song include those done by American rapper Rick Ross and American R singer Chris Brown.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a pretty}} country {{simplicity}} in this that made some laugh, others looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a passion. I believe {{he knew it was}} his duty (his wife having accepted charge of the girl) to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe; nothing would have induced him to have done so, since it must have involved the loss of his conveyance; and I think he made it up to his conscience by the loudness of his voice. At least he broke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying the thing was a disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the ship, and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate. I was thinking something of the same; took the mate upon one side, arranged with him to send <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>chests</b> by track-scoot to an address I had in Leyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers.|$|R

5000|$|At least forty-eight people, {{all but two}} of {{whom were}} Iranian pilgrims, were killed and {{approximately}} sixty-three others were injured when the New Khanaqin restaurant in Muqdadiyah was targeted at 12:45 pm The Iranians had paused for lunch as they embarked on a pilgrimage to a Shi'a Muslim religious site in Baghdad. Sixty-four-year-old pilgrim, Kadhumi Sadiq, said: [...] "While the waiter was serving us food a powerful explosion took place and the restaurant turned black. I suffered burns <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head, <b>chest</b> and hands". The restaurant was left demolished {{in the aftermath of the}} attack.|$|R
2500|$|For {{some time}} the Duke {{and his colleagues}} {{had been looking for}} a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid {{responsibility}} before history. Bazaine stated in his defence [...] "I have graven <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> two words - Honneur et Patrie. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ". Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. [...] "I have read every word of the evidence [...] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry" [...] (New York Times correspondent). A letter which Prince Frederick Charles wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless. [...] Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was [...] "It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death — Ney, by a Bourbon, and Bazaine, by an Orléans. But, as though the judges themselves felt a twinge of conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.|$|E

Those who were at the mortuary or otherwise saw Karoun's body mentioned stab marks around his ear, face, and back, the latter of which must have been the cause of his punctured heart, lungs, and stomach... the murder was planned with military precision.

After he developed the picture in black and white—assuming I didn’t chicken out—he would use Photo-Shop to make three changes: impose a stark measurement grid behind me, black out my eyes with a rectangular band, and blur what my mate, Aron, calls “the naughty bits. ” This picture would then be used for an anthology I was editing about the medical treatment of people born intersexed—the kind of people who used to be called hermaphrodites. I wanted to use this picture to make a point about the difference it makes whether people (including doctors and medical students) see intersexed people primarily the way medical books show them, or the way intersexed people see themselves. The vol-ume, Intersex in the Age of Ethics, includes autobiographies of living inter-sexed people, and accompanying many of the autobiographies are photos of the authors looking like “normal ” people [1].
