40|$|Blends {{of three}} Australian coking coals and polypropylene, polystyrene, {{polyacrylonitrile}} and polyphenylene sulfide were prepared {{and the extent}} to which the blends fused on heating was monitored using proton magnetic resonance thermal analysis in order to identify interactions between them that could affect their fluidity. Different plastics had different effects. Polystyrene strongly reduced <b>the</b> fluidity <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals,</b> confirming previous findings. Polypropylene did not affect <b>the</b> fluidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two coking <b>coals</b> <b>of</b> lower rank. Polyphenylene sulfide reduced <b>the</b> fluidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> at temperatures near <b>the</b> solidification temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals,</b> and polyacrylonitrile appeared to increase <b>the</b> fluidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> at temperatures near <b>the</b> softening temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals.</b> <b>The</b> very different effects different plastics have on coal fluidity show that the interaction between plastics and coals must be carefully examined before plastics are added to coking coal blends...|$|R

40|$|Coal seams {{that are}} prone to strong outbursts have low {{strength}} and cause heavy structural damage to the seam. Their outburst risk is highly related to <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adsorbed <b>coalbed</b> gas, which {{is controlled by the}} gas desorption and diffusion characteristics <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> In <b>the</b> Haizi <b>Coal</b> Mine, China, an extremely high gas outburst risk was detected, and <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> from this area were found to have an unprecedented high degree of fragmentation and were present in the pulverized state. To explain <b>the</b> pulverization characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulverized <b>coal,</b> <b>the</b> related physical parameters were investigated; the gas desorption and diffusion properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulverized <b>coal</b> were analyzed and compared with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unpulverized <b>coal.</b> <b>The</b> results indicated that <b>the</b> pulverized <b>coal</b> could easily reach <b>the</b> required degree <b>of</b> fragmentation for a coal and gas outburst to occur. Furthermore, the pore volume and specific surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulverized <b>coal</b> differed according to <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> particle size.

5|$|Initially, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> {{carried on}} the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they had given up this {{practice}} in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J.

40|$|To {{predict the}} {{combustion}} performance in pulverized coal-fired boilers, this paper examines existing indices and develops a maceral index (MI). These indices {{were compared with}} <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> 68 <b>coals</b> and blends in a range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean vitrinite reflectance from 0. 25 to 1. 63. The {{results showed that the}} fuel ratio and the mean vitrinite reflectance could qualitatively indicate <b>the</b> burnout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> and blends. <b>The</b> new MI, MI = L + V/R- 2 /I- 1. 25 (HV/ 30) (2. 5), provides a useful correlation for <b>the</b> burnout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> and blends. <b>The</b> correlation coefficient (I-) is 0. 982 for the EER data, and 0. 808 for the ACIRL data. The MI also has potential to correlate ignition and flame stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> and blends. <b>The</b> MI predicts the burnout better than the other indices.

5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E
5|$|MD36 {{passes through}} the Georges Creek Valley, which {{has a long history}} of coal mining. In {{recognition}} of this, the MDSHA has designated MD36 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coal</b> Heritage Scenic Byway. Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century, with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley. Deep mining, which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland, declined in use after World WarII, replaced primarily by surface mining. Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production, coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the AES Warrior Run power plant in Cumberland.|$|E

5|$|The {{base of the}} Kilmersdon valley {{consists}} of alluvium deposits. Above these, {{on both sides of}} all of the valleys, is a band of shales and clays from the Penarth group from the Triassic period. Most of the upland in this area is Lias Limestone (white and blue) while the highest part, above 130m, south of Haydon, is an outcrop of Inferior Oolitic Limestone, both are from the Jurassic period. The steepest slopes of both the Kilmersdon and Snail’s Bottom valleys have frequently slipped. Below these rocks are the coal bearing Carboniferous strata. Haydon is an outlying settlement of Radstock built to house miners from the local pit. The disused railway line and inclined railway at Haydon are important elements in the Kilmersdon valley east of Haydon. The modern landscape has a less maintained and ‘rougher’ character and texture than neighbouring agricultural areas caused mainly by the remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> industry and its infrastructure and changes in agricultural management. Disturbance caused by coal mining and the railways and the subsequent end of mining and abandonment of the railways has created valuable habitats for nature conservation.|$|E
