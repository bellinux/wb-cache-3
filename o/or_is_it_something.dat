Is it {{a good thing to}} find out you have been deceived <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> that makes you angry? Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness. Leave it solely to God-after all, he knows best how to take care of everything for one who becomes alone by seeking him." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{outcome of}} the 2000 presidential {{election}} focused unprecedented national attention on apparent inequities in the election process. Before the controversies surrounding that election, few citizens had been aware that {{a substantial portion of}} votes for major offices were regularly not counted because either citizens marked ballots incorrectly or voting equipment recorded them incorrectly. After the election, evidence also emerged that some jurisdictions had miscount rates that were dramatically higher than others. What caused the wide variation in miscount rates? Was it racism, as some have suggested? Was it the machinery itself? <b>Or,</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else?

Raising her eyes to the chancel she studied his head, and found in it still another expression of that race, the history of which had been one of protest, of development of its own character and personality. Her mind went back to her first talk with him, in the garden, and she saw how her intuition had recognized in him then the spirit of a people striving to assert itself.|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Alderling {{went into}} the house and came out with a book in her hand, and her fingers in it at two places. It was that {{impressive}} collection of Christ's words from the New Testament called [...] "The Great Discourse." [...] She put the book before me, first at one place and then at another, and I read, [...] "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die," [...] and then, [...] "Nay, but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." [...] She did not say anything in showing me these passages, and I found something in her action touchingly childlike and elemental, as well as curiously heathenish. It was as if some poor pagan had brought me his fetish to test its effect upon me. [...] "Yes," [...] I said, [...] "those are things that we hardly {{know what to do with}} in our philosophy. They seem to be said as with authority, and yet, somehow, we cannot admit their validity in a philosophical inquiry as to a future life. Aren't they generally taken to mean that we shall be unhappy or happy hereafter, rather than that we shall be or not be at all? And what is believing?

6000|$|If {{there is}} one thing that may be said, in the popular estimation, to {{characterize}} mind, that one thing is [...] "consciousness." [...] We say that we are [...] "conscious" [...] of what we see and hear, of what we remember, and of our own thoughts and feelings. Most of us believe that tables and chairs are not [...] "conscious." [...] We think that when we sit in a chair, we are aware of sitting in it, but it is not aware of being sat in. It cannot for a moment be doubted that we are right in believing that there is SOME difference between us and the chair in this respect: so much may be taken as fact, and as a datum for our inquiry. But as soon as we try to say what exactly the difference is, we become involved in perplexities. Is [...] "consciousness" [...] ultimate and simple, something to be merely accepted and contemplated? <b>Or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> complex, perhaps consisting in our way of behaving in the presence of objects, or, alternatively, in the existence in us of things called [...] "ideas," [...] having a certain relation to objects, though different from them, and only symbolically representative of them? Such questions are not easy to answer; but until they are answered we cannot profess to know what we mean by saying that we are possessed of [...] "consciousness." ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{let me say}} {{something}} at once. If this marvellous creature expected that the revelation of her splendour was going to make me her slave; to cause me {{to fall in love with}} her, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> called, well, she must have <b>been</b> disappointed, for <b>it</b> had no such effect. It frightened and in a sense humbled me, that is all, for I felt myself to be in the presence of something that was not human, something alien to me as a man, which I could fear and even adore as humanity would adore that which is Divine, but with which I had no desire to mix. Moreover, <b>was</b> <b>it</b> divine, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> very different? I did not know, I only knew that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not for me; as soon should I have thought of asking for a star to set within my lantern.|$|R
60|$|<b>Or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> quite {{different}} from either of these, something vast and splendid {{beyond the reach of}} vision, something God-sent, beginning and ending in the Eternal Absolute and at last partaking of His attributes and nature and from aeon to aeon shot through with His light? And how was the truth to be learned? I asked my Eastern friends, and they talked vaguely of long ascetic preparation, of years upon years of learning, from whom I could not quite discover. I <b>was</b> sure <b>it</b> could not <b>be</b> from them, because clearly they did not know; they only passed on what they had heard elsewhere, when or how they either could not or would not explain. So at length I gave it up, having satisfied myself that all this was but an effort of Oriental imagination called into life by the sweet influences of the Eastern stars.|$|R
60|$|For {{the second}} time that morning the Squire looked up with the sharp and searching gaze he {{occasionally}} assumed, and for {{the second time}} his instinct, for he was too heady a man to reason overmuch, came into play and warned him that in making this offer Edward Cossey had other motives than those which he had brought forward. He paused to consider what they might be. Was he anxious to get the estate for himself? Was he put forward by somebody else? Quest, perhaps; <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> to do with Ida? The first alternative seemed the most probable to him. But whatever the lender's object, the result to him <b>was</b> the same, <b>it</b> gave him a respite. For Mr. de la Molle well knew that he had no more chance of raising the money from an ordinary source, than he had of altering the condition of agriculture.|$|R
60|$|Or is it, {{that he sees}} {{and feels}} {{something}} changed in Me? I could scream with vexation and rage against myself. Here is my Oscar--and yet {{he is not the}} Oscar I knew when I was blind. Contradictory as it seems, I used to understand how he looked at me, when I was unable to see it. Now that I can see it, I ask myself, Is this really love that is looking at me in his eyes? <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else? How should I know? I knew when I had only my own fancy to tell me. But now, try as I may, I cannot make the old fancy and the new sight serve me in harmony both together. I am afraid he sees that I don't understand him. Oh, dear! dear! why did I not meet my good old Grosse, and become the new creature that he has made me, before I met Oscar? I should have had no blind memories and prepossessions to get over then. I shall become used to my new self, I hope and believe, with time--and that will accustom me to my new impressions of Oscar--and so it may all come right in the end. It is all wrong enough now. He put his arm round me, and gave me a little tender squeeze, while we were following Miss Batchford down to the dining-room this afternoon. Nothing in me answered to it. I should have felt it all over me a few months since.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} as to which Willie is ‘after’ - Winnie or the revolver - is like the question in All That Fall as to whether Mr Rooney threw the little girl out of the railway-carriage or not. And the answer is the same in both cases - we don’t know, at least I don’t. All that is necessary as far as I’m concerned - technically and otherwise - less too little, more too much - is the ambiguity of motive, established clearly I hope by Winnie, ‘Is it me you’re after, Willie, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else? Is it a kiss you’re after, Willie, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else?’ and by the conspicuousness of revolver requested in the stage-directions at beginning of Act II.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this project {{is based upon the}} Kosovo crisis in the late 90 s.

Furthermore threatened the Kosovo crisis to undermine and ruin the fragile relations between the West, China and Russia as it resulted into fear of a new “Cold War” was about to begin.

60|$|When {{he started}} that {{morning for the}} Temple, he had still a feeling of {{extraordinary}} lightness in his limbs, and he still saw that face--its perfect regularity, its warm pallor, and dark smiling eyes rather wide apart, its fine, small, close-set ears, and the sweep of the black-brown hair across the low brow. <b>Or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> much less definite he saw--an emanation or expression, a trick, a turn, an indwelling grace, a something that appealed, that turned, and touched him? Whatever <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> would not let him be, {{and he did not}} desire that it should. For this was in his character; if he saw a horse that he liked, he put his money on whatever it ran; if charmed by an opera, he went over and over again; if by a poem, he almost learned it by heart. And while he walked along the river--his usual route--he had queer and unaccustomed sensations, now melting, now pugnacious. And he felt happy.|$|R
5000|$|... "Inca Roads" [...] for {{the most}} part explores the {{stereotypes}} of aliens encountering the Incan civilization.

The lyrics [...] "Did a vehicle come from somewhere out there, just to land in the Andes? Was it round and did it have a motor <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> different?" [...] imply that a UFO is landing in the Andes mountains. As the song progresses, the lyrics become sillier and seem to mock the beginning of the song. An example of this is [...] "...or did someone build a place or leave a space for Chester's thing to land (Chester's thing... on Ruth). Did a booger-bear come from somewhere out there..." [...] The non-serious nature of these lyrics and even the music itself seem to be mocking other progressive rock bands and their possibly forced divine depth.|$|R

40|$|The 1998 {{failure of}} Long-Term Capital Management (‘LTCM’), {{a very large}} and {{prominent}} Greenwich, Connecticut based hedge fund, {{is said to have}} nearly brought down the world financial system. Over the years, few financial debacles such as LTCM, have been so often written about or discussed without a firm conclusion on what went wrong. What brought the “genius” managers of LTCM to their knees? Was <b>it</b> hubris, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> more? Various commentators have jumped on LTCM’s significant leverage ratio or engaged in second-guessing of management’s decision in 1997 to return $ 2. 7 billion of investor capital to increase leverage, and thereby, returns. Others have faulted the lack of transparency at LTCM or faulted regulators for a lack of oversight, criticized regulators for arranging the bailout, while others still have pinpointed the debacle on the failure of LTCM’s risk management prowess. This paper avoids the blame and identifies the multiple factors, both management risk management blunders, as well as inherent flaws in the risk metric used by LTCM – Value at Risk (VaR) – a commonly used risk metric in the financial industry today. ...|$|R
