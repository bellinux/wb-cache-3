40|$|Purpose. Cycling {{has been}} shown to be {{associated}} with a high incidence of chronic pathologies. Foot orthoses are frequently used by cyclists in order to reduce the incidence of chronic injuries. The aim of the current investigation was to examine the influence of different varus <b>orthotic</b> inclines on the three-dimensional kinematics of the lower extremities during the pedal cycle. Methods. Kinematic information was obtained from ten male cyclists using an eight-camera optoelectronic 3 -D motion capture system operating at 250 Hz. Participants cycled with and without <b>orthotic</b> intervention at three different cadences (70, 90 and 110 RPM). The <b>orthotic</b> device was adjustable and four different wedge conditions (0 mm - no <b>orthotic,</b> 1. 5 mm, 3. 0 mm and 4. 5 mm) were examined. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare the kinematic parameters obtained as a function of <b>orthotic</b> inclination and cadence. Participants were also asked to subjectively rate their comfort in cycling using each of the four <b>orthotic</b> devices on a 10 -point Likert scale. Results. The kinematic analysis indicated that the <b>orthotic</b> device had no significant influence at any of the three cadences. Analysis of subjective preferences showed a clear preference for the 0 mm, no <b>orthotic,</b> condition. Conclusions. This study suggests that foot orthoses do not provide any protection from skeletal malalignment issues associated with the aetiology of chronic cycling injuries...|$|R

Methods Information about the regulatory framework was derived from an analysis of legal texts and a survey completed by national experts. Results Strategies to keep down prices include public procurement in Sweden, maximum prices in France, and exclusion of expensive braces from reimbursement in the Netherlands. Reimbursement is linked to a medical indication or a chronic condition in France, the Netherlands and Sweden. To gain reimbursement, the cost-effectiveness of <b>orthotic</b> braces needs to be demonstrated in France and the Netherlands. <b>Orthotic</b> braces tend to be initially prescribed by a specialist physician and distributed by orthotists, medical equipment shops and/or community pharmacies.

2500|$|Treatment has {{historically}} centered on removing mechanical {{pressure from the}} joint until the disease has run its course. Options include traction (to separate the femur from the pelvis and reduce wear), braces (often for several months, {{with an average of}} 18 months) to restore range of motion, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention when necessary because of permanent joint damage. To maintain activities of daily living, custom <b>orthotics</b> may be used. [...] Overnight traction may be used in lieu of walking devices or in combination. [...] These devices internally rotate the femoral head and abduct the leg(s) at 45°. [...] Orthoses can start as proximal as the lumbar spine, and extend the length of the limbs to the floor. [...] Most functional bracing is achieved using a waist belt and thigh cuffs derived from the Scottish-Rite orthosis. These devices are typically prescribed by a physician and implemented by an orthotist. Clinical results of the Scottish Rite orthosis have not been good according to some studies, and its use has gone out of favor. Many children, especially those with the onset of the disease before age 6, need no intervention at all and are simply asked to refrain from contact sports or games which impact the hip. [...] For older children (onset of Perthes after age 6), the best treatment option remains unclear. Current treatment options for older children over age 8 include prolonged periods without weight bearing, osteotomy (femoral, pelvic, or shelf), and the hip distraction method using an external fixator which relieves the hip from carrying the body's weight. [...] This allows room for the top of the femur to regrow.

50|$|Aside from surgery, {{there are}} a few options for {{handling}} an accessory navicular bone that has become symptomatic. This includes immobilization, icing, medicating, physical therapy, and <b>orthotic</b> devices. Immobilizing involves placing the foot and ankle in a cast or removable walking boot. This alleviates stressors on the foot and can decrease inflammation. Icing will help reduce swelling and inflammation. Medication involves usage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or steroids (taken orally or injected) to decrease inflammation. Physical therapy can be prescribed in order to strengthen the muscles and help decrease inflammation. Physical therapy can also help prevent the symptoms from returning. <b>Orthotic</b> devices (arch support devices that fit in a shoe) can help prevent future symptoms. Occasionally, the <b>orthotic</b> device will dig into the edge of the accessory navicular and cause discomfort. For this reason, the <b>orthotic</b> devices made for the patient should be carefully constructed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{effectiveness}} of bracing on preventing curve progression in coronal plane for mild and moderate adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients {{has been confirmed}} by previous radiographic researches. However, a hypokyphotic effect on the sagittal plane has been reported by a few studies. A relatively increasing number of AIS patients were noticed to wear {{a new kind of}} elastic <b>orthotic</b> belt for the treatments of scoliosis without doctors' instructions. We postulate the correcting mechanism of this new appliance may cause flattening of the spine. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of this new orthosis on the sagittal profile of AIS patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the effects of elastic <b>orthotic</b> belt and Milwaukee brace on the sagittal alignment in AIS patients. Methods Twenty-eight female AIS patients with mild or moderate thoracic curves were included in this study. Standing full-length lateral radiographs were obtained in three conditions: natural standing posture without any treatment, with elastic <b>orthotic</b> belt and with Milwaukee brace. Thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumber lordosis (LL) and pelvic incidence (PI) were measured and compared between the above three conditions. Results Both elastic <b>orthotic</b> belt and Milwaukee brace can lead to significant decrease of TK, however, the decrease of TK after wearing elastic <b>orthotic</b> belt is significantly larger than that after wearing Milwaukee brace. Compared with no treatment, LL was found to be significantly smaller after wearing Milwaukee brace, however, such significant decrease was not noted after wearing elastic <b>orthotic</b> belt. No significant changes were observed for the PI between 3 conditions. Conclusions The elastic <b>orthotic</b> belt could lead to more severe thoracic hypokyphosis when compared with Milwaukee brace. This belt may not be a suitable conservative method for the treatment of mild and moderate AIS patients. </p...|$|R

Objective : to evaluate the clinical efficiency of <b>orthotic</b> intervention in the rehabilitation of patients with RA. Patients and methods. The investigation enrolled 70 patients with RA (women, 84. 3 %; age, 18 to 64 years; disease duration, 3 months to  4 years) who were divided into 4 groups: 3 <b>orthotic</b> groups (ORLETT knee, ankle, and wrist orthoses of various fixation) and one control group (only drug therapy). The number of tender and swollen joints (TJ and SJ), pain on 100 -mm VAS, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels, DAS 28, HAQ, RAPID 3, and FFI scores, knee joint movement amplitudes, step test values, and hand compression force were estimated during 6 months. The clinical efficacy and comfort of orthoses and adherence to <b>orthotic</b> intervention were evaluated. Results. Six-month knee, ankle, and wrist <b>orthotic</b> intervention caused a {{reduction in the number of}} TJ and SJ, pain VAS, HAQ, RAPID 3, and FFI scores, and step test values and an increase in knee flexion angle and hand compression force; at the same time, there were significant differences in those observed in the control group. The <b>orthotic</b> intervention failed to affect DAS 28 scores and laboratory parameters. This decreased substantially (by more than 50 %) the patients' needs for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Both a physician and a patient appreciated the comfort and clinical efficacy of orthoses greatly and adherence to their use well (86. 7 to 93. 3 %). Conclusion. The 6 -month application of knee, ankle, and wrist orthoses reduces pain syndrome and joint swelling and improves locomotor indicators, functional status, and quality of life in patients with RA, which may recommend including <b>orthotic</b> intervention in a comprehensive rehabilitation program. </p...|$|R
