50|$|Double {{taxation}} is avoided for UK dividends by exempting {{them from}} tax for most companies: only dealers in shares suffer tax on them. Where double taxation arises because of <b>overseas</b> <b>tax</b> suffered, relief is available {{either in the}} form of expense or credit relief. Expense relief allows the <b>overseas</b> <b>tax</b> to be treated as a deductible expense in the tax computation. Credit relief is given as a deduction from the UK tax liability, but is restricted to the amount of UK tax suffered on the foreign income. There is a system of onshore pooling, so that <b>overseas</b> <b>tax</b> suffered in high tax territories may be set off against taxable income arising from low tax territories. From 1 July 2009, new rules were introduced to exempt most non-UK dividends from corporation tax so these double taxation rules in respect of non-UK dividends will be of less common application in practice after that date.|$|E

In drawing any policy implications from observed BTDs, an understanding of the sources of BTDs and their properties is important. In particular, identifying the degree of persistence or representativeness of an observed annual BTD is critical. To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to examine how BTDs and their components e. g. permanent differences, temporary differences and the effect of differences between UK and <b>overseas</b> statutory <b>tax</b> rate behave over time. The necessary data disclosed under IAS 12 Income Taxes (IASB, 2010) has only been systematically publicly disclosed in the UK since 2005. In summary, the results indicate that the degree of persistence is dependent {{on the nature of the}} BTD and that this variation in persistence itself varies by industry group. The most persistence component relates to differences between UK and <b>overseas</b> statutory <b>tax</b> rates with temporary differences being the least persistent, indicative of a non-earnings management motivation.

30|$|In September 2011, China {{decreased}} {{the income tax}} burden for middle- and low-income individuals {{in an attempt to}} promote social equity. However, individuals with high income now have to bear a higher tax burden, especially those individuals who fall within the highest marginal tax rate, 45  %, and those who have to pay monthly taxes of up to 80, 000 yuan. This is harmful to developing China’s international tax competitiveness. In this age of economic globalization, global factors should be taken into consideration when reforming a nation’s tax code. In 1982, China set its highest marginal tax rate bracket at 45  %, relatively low among major nations at the time. In 1986, the US passed major tax reforms, and many other major nations followed suit, making the Chinese 45  % rate exceptionally high. This led to brain drain and also led to some <b>overseas</b> resource <b>taxes</b> going uncollected. In some regions, the government even decided to pay back certain individuals’ individual income taxes in order to keep professionals around.|$|R

Because none of the directors were resident in the United Kingdom, {{and none of the}} acts complained of by the directors had occurred within the jurisdiction (all board meetings had occurred <b>overseas</b> for <b>tax</b> reasons), it was necessary to obtain the leave of the court to serve out.

On this latter point most of the argument was focused.|$|R

His compensation in 2009 totaled $31.4 million, including $1,170,000 in salary and $24,758,827 in stock. According to the Associated Press, within the last decade, Irani has received $857 million.

40|$|This thesis studies firm trading {{behaviour}} in the European Union (EU) {{carbon market}} and investment decision-making in China&# 146;s electricity {{industry in the}} context of policies addressing local and global air pollution. The first two papers derive the lessons learnt from the EU carbon market for policy-makers (such as the Chinese government) introducing such instruments, and the last paper assesses the effects of such policies on investment decisions in the electricity sector. The first paper aims to provide empirical evidence for beyond compliance trading behaviour in the EU carbon market by investigating companies&# 146; characteristics and related volumes. To explore decision-making at the parent company level, a microeconomic choice model is applied to a unique dataset that contains information on the EU carbon registry and firm-specific characteristics. The results suggest that Eastern European state-owned firms are less likely to trade allowances beyond their compliance needs, and that their volumes are significantly lower. However, Western European stateowned firms are more active in terms of beyond compliance trading and related volumes. The second paper uses a bottom-up approach to analyse value-added tax (VAT) fraud across all countries involved in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in phase 2. The results show that the VAT losses for all EU countries are estimated at &# 128; 3, 341 million. The extent of the losses varies for each country, with France having the highest fraudulent volume. The results also reveal that large-scale VAT fraud significantly decreased after 2010, which was the result of anti-fraud policies. In addition, VAT fraud was strongly connected with <b>overseas</b> <b>tax</b> havens, and the Danish registry became a loophole, which resulted in the prevalence of VAT fraud throughout the EU carbon market. The third paper simulates different single and combined policy scenarios to evaluate the effects of air pollutant control and carbon mitigation policies on China&# 146;s future electricity generation portfolio investment. By using a portfolio assessment model that incorporates key uncertainties, the results show that China can achieve significant reductions for both greenhouse gas and local air pollutant emissions through a combination of climate change and air pollution control policies. In addition, the paper identifies co-benefits from the perspectives of both air pollutant control and carbon mitigation, and it discusses the net generation costs of different policy scenarios in the process of policy evaluation...|$|E

The tax is charged whether the transaction takes place in the UK or overseas, and whether either party is resident of the UK or not. Securities issued by companies <b>overseas</b> are not <b>taxed.</b> This means that—just like the standard stamp duty—the tax is paid by foreign and UK-based investors who invest in UK incorporated companies.
