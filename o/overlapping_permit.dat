40|$|ABSTRACT. We study intertemporal {{trading of}} ni-trogen oxides permits in Southern California’s RECLAIM program. We model RECLAIM’s {{distinct}} intertemporal features: two <b>overlapping</b> <b>permit</b> cycles and two overlapping compliance cycles. In the model, competitive equilibrium is cost-effective, and firms {{have an incentive}} to delay abatement. From 1994 to 2006, RECLAIM facilities traded intertemporally by using permits of the opposite cycle. We test two theo-retical propositions—delayed abatement and trading across cycles—with a difference-in-differences esti-mator and show weak, though inconclusive, support of the theory. The theoretical and empirical results are relevant to cap-and-trade programs with potential for <b>overlapping</b> <b>permit</b> cycles. (JEL Q 58) I...|$|E
40|$|Intertemporal tradability allows an {{emissions}} {{market to}} reduce abatement costs. We study intertemporal trading of nitrogen oxides permits in the RECLAIM program in Southern California. A theoretical model captures the program’s key intertemporal features: two <b>overlapping</b> <b>permit</b> cycles, two compliance cycles for facilities, and tradable permits. We characterize the competitive equilibrium; {{show that it}} is cost effective; and demonstrate the firms’ incentive to delay abatement, i. e., to trade intertemporally. Using model extensions to explore market design issues, an arbitrage condition implies that the equilibrium is invariant to overlapping compliance cycles, but depends crucially on <b>overlapping</b> <b>permit</b> cycles. We empirically investigate intertemporal trading of permits using panel data on RECLAIM facilities for 1994 - 2006. Facilities undertake trading by using a considerable proportion of permits of the opposite cycle. We econometrically test two theoretical propositions – delayed abatement and trading across cycles – with a difference-in-differences estimator. The results neither contradict nor provide conclusive support of the theory...|$|E

The time course of item retrieval and movement preparation processes during music performance are considered. Serially ordered stage models of retrieval, in which item retrieval ends before movement preparation begins, are com-pared with interactive cascade models, in which {{the time course of}} both pro-cesses <b>overlap,</b> <b>permitting</b> interaction. Evidence from transfer of learning paradigms, production errors, and anticipatory movements, as measured in motion capture, are described. This early evidence suggests different time courses for item retrieval (slower, earlier) than for movement preparation (faster, later) with significant temporal overlap during music performance...|$|R

Knowledge of optimized scatternet topology is useful when comparing decentralized protocols and the scatternets they produce. This paper introduces the first multiple objective optimization framework for scatternets, which operates by optimizing node sequencings that represent scatternets. Using NSGA-II, the framework is described, tuned and applied to determine the trade-offs between competing optimization objectives. Finally, the results are used to benchmark the performance and characteristics of four existing protocols from the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} some recent enhancements that have been made to the Navier-Stokes code OVERFLOW.

The model is used in combination with an effective feature selection strategy based on a Chi-square test that enhances disambiguation performance. Due to the absence of previous similar work on Greek linguistic data, for comparison we also implement and apply the very popular naïve Bayes classifier to the same data. Comparing the two systems, we find that the Hierarchical Mixtures-of-Experts (HME) model is superior to the naïve Bayes classifier, mainly because of its ability to <b>permit</b> <b>overlapping</b> and the capture of non-linearity among the data.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Of the four {{black and white}} S 190 A camera stations, snowcover is best defined in the two visible spectral bands, {{due in part to}} their better resolution. The overall extent of the snow can be mapped more precisely, and the snow within shadow areas is better defined in the visible bands. Of the two S 190 A color products, the aerial color photography is the better. Because of the contrast in color between snow and snow-free terrain and the better resolution, this product is concluded to be the best overall of the six camera stations for detecting and mapping snow. <b>Overlapping</b> frames <b>permit</b> stereo viewing, which aids in distinguishing clouds from the underlying snow. Because of the greater spatial resolution of the S 190 B earth terrain camera, areal snow extent can be mapped in greater detail than from the S 190 A photographs.

50|$|Commensurability is a concept, in the {{philosophy}} of science, whereby scientific theories are commensurable if scientists can discuss them using a shared nomenclature that allows direct comparison of theories to determine which theory is more valid or useful.

Discussed by Ludwik Fleck in the 1930s, and popularized by Thomas Kuhn in the 1960s, the problem of incommensurability results in scientists talking past each other, as it were, while comparison of theories is muddled by confusions about terms, contexts and consequences.|$|R

These studies have typically been performed using the soft-sphere approach where deformation is assumed elastic and small relative to the characteristic grain scale. Consequently internal stresses and strains are not able to be modelled. As a first step towards addressing these limitations, we introduce a variant of DEM, the Distributed Contact DEM (DCDEM). This method models distributed normal and frictional contacts. In this initial implementation plastic deformation is not simulated and elastic deformation is simulated by <b>permitting</b> <b>overlap</b> as in traditional DEM. The method is compared against traditional DEM for a normal and oblique impact and a granular shear cell in the small deformation limit...|$|R

Expanding mining {{activities on the}} island {{have the potential to}} provide revenue for development and conservation efforts, but also pose a potential threat to conservation efforts on the island due to the spatial distribution and extent of mining concessions and the environmental impacts that mines often cause. By measuring the extent of <b>overlap</b> of <b>permitted</b> mining concessions with protected areas, potential protected areas, and mining - exclusion zones on the island, we assessed potential effects of mining on terrestrial conservation and evaluated the success of the governing institutions in limiting that impact. Permitted mining areas in 2006 overlapped with protected areas, potential protected areas, and mining - exclusion zones on the island. Mining concession areas overlapped with 33 % of surface area planned for protection in 2005, 21 % of surface area planned for protection in 2006, and 12 % of the surface area from which mining was to be legally excluded. Total permitted area and area of overlap with conservation areas increased between 2005 and 2006 despite efforts in 2004 to limit such overlap. Changes in the mining permitting and regulation could improve prospects for limiting the impact of mining on biodiversity conservation on the island...|$|R

Deficiencies at specific loci were detected by screening for marker phenotypes in the F(1). Screening for lethal mutations in the F(1) /F(2) confirmed specific deficiencies and revealed other deficiencies that did not overlap the marker loci.
