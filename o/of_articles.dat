40|$|This {{thesis is}} centred on <b>Article</b> 12 <b>of</b> the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD) - equal {{recognition}} {{before the law}} - and its implementation {{at the national level}} in China. Based on an in-depth understanding <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12 and the empirical research conducted in China regarding the relevant Chinese legal culture, this thesis closely examines the challenges concerning the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12 in China and the symbiotic relationship between the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12 in China and the relevant cultural context. It begins by developing a framework to theorize the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12, a piece of international human rights law, at the national level. Based on this theoretical framework, the full implementation <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12 at the national level necessitates an in-depth understanding <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12 and the relevant cultural context. The meaning, implications, and values <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12 should be fully rendered at the national level in a culturally sensitive way to ensure that they can be fully understood and effectively utilized by local people. By conducting analysis <b>of</b> both <b>Article</b> 12 and relevant Chinese law, this thesis identifies some of the fundamental gaps between the current Chinese law on legal capacity and adult guardianship and Article 12. By conducting and analyzing the empirical research of relevant legal culture in China, this thesis examines the legal culture-related challenges that should be taken into account in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12 in China. Drawing on the analysis <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12 and relevant Chinese law and legal culture, this thesis reflects on reforming the domestic law to transpose Article 12 at the national level in a culturally sensitive way and the potential social changes that could be fostered by the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> 12...|$|R
