5|$|Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives {{to report}} on the festival and is {{determined}} to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the bad press, with <b>one</b> <b>reporter</b> likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, <b>one</b> <b>reporter</b> described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

25|$|Short-story {{writer and}} critic Patrick J. Murphy wrote that Cozzens' {{responses}} {{during the interview}} were verbalizations of his writing style: often using parody and sarcasm, quoting other works without attribution, and punctuated by laughter. As sometimes happened with his prose, this style did not translate well into print, {{and the results were}} further distorted because the information seemed to be gathered by <b>one</b> <b>reporter</b> but the article written by someone different.|$|E
25|$|The show's {{complete}} {{ratings were}} not released, though executives had claimed {{to at least}} <b>one</b> <b>reporter</b> that Dead Like Me had ratings three times Showtime's primetime average. This contrasts with the network's statement that the ratings were not high enough for a third season. The ratings for the series premiere were 1.11 million, a record for a Showtime series premiere that was not beaten until the premiere of Shameless seven years later.|$|E
5000|$|According to <b>one</b> <b>reporter's</b> {{assessment}} in August 2013, despite the foregoing efforts the U.S. federal agencies {{are not working}} in concert {{with respect to the}} implementation of the Windsor ruling. Instead [...] "they are creating a patchwork of regulations affecting gay and lesbian couples — and may be raising questions about discrimination and fairness in the way that federal benefits are distributed." ...|$|R

25|$|The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a {{designated}} scenic road system connecting {{all of the}} Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. <b>One</b> <b>reporter</b> thought the roads on the Canadian side were narrower, sometimes without shoulders, but were less trafficked except for the roads around the Ontario towns of Fort Erie and Port Colborne. Drivers can cross from the United States to the Canadian town of Fort Erie by going over the Peace Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Many older {{students}} {{reacted to the}} event by creating black comedy jokes {{similar to those that}} circulated after the Challenger disaster. A study of the incidence of the jokes showed that they were told only in areas where stations showed uncensored footage of the press conference. At least <b>one</b> <b>reporter</b> present at Dwyer's suicide suffered from being a witness. Tony Romeo, a radio reporter, was standing a few feet from Dwyer. After the suicide, Romeo developed depression and took a break from journalism.|$|E
25|$|The riots sparked intense media {{coverage}} and {{attention on the}} local, national, and international level. Local {{media coverage}} of the riots began almost immediately after the game ended, with the local CBC, CTV and Global BC stations all running news coverage of the riots, with CTV and CBC doing so from studios located in downtown Vancouver itself. CBC News Network started running live coverage in conjunction with its nationally broadcast evening news show The National, with <b>one</b> <b>reporter</b> calling in her reports from inside the riot.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{sketches}} were heavily produced {{to be as}} realistic as possible, {{at the end of}} the mixing process they were then degraded to make them sound as if they were recorded by listeners, or were from a very old archive. Particular attention was paid to, for instance, if the item would have been recorded from <b>one</b> <b>reporters</b> microphone. The sketch respected this and everything was recorded using just one microphone to give the right effect.|$|R

25|$|The Summers fight {{took part}} at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, with a purse of £2,200 and the Lonsdale Belt at stake. Welsh took {{control in the}} first round and never let Summers into the fight. <b>One</b> <b>reporter</b> counted 200 {{successful}} blows to Summers head during the match, and he was bleeding as early as the third round. During the fight, some members of the crowd jeered Welsh's use of the kidney punch, which although not outlawed at the time was seen as unsporting; he was also cautioned by the referee for the use of his head in the fifth. The fight went the distance, with Welsh winning on points; in taking the Lonsdale Belt he was the pride of Wales and America, but many in the boxing fraternity of England saw in Welsh a cynical, cold and cruel fighter.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourists}} {{arrived in}} Fremantle on 7 October and Cowdrey learnt by telegram {{that his father}} had died, but he decided to continue the tour. Four days later played their first match of a long tour against a local Country XI on a small, sandy ground 20 yards from the beach. The A.C.B. liked these games as they encouraged grassroots cricket. They were less popular with the tourists as they involved travelling to distant grounds to play in front of small crowds. However, one or two of these games were useful {{at the beginning of the}} tour to allow the players to warm up and Bunbury was close enough to Fremantle and Perth for hundreds to come and see the game. The Country teams could sometime surprise the opposition, and this team included three first-class players, including spinners Morgan Herbert and Eric James, both players for Tambellup–Cranbrook. Hutton won the toss and the MCC belted 344/5 in less than a day with Hutton (59), Edrich (129), Graveney (58) and Cowdrey (48 not out) entertaining the crowd. A declaration before stumps saw no Country wickets fall and 51 was added for the first wicket, but then Big Jim McConnon's off-spin worked its way through the middle order as he took 5/30 after Peter Loader (4/35) and Tyson (1/35) removed the openers and the home side were all out for 116. Put back in again they survived the day, and the match, at 128/6 with Colin Cowdrey's good natured leg-spin taking 4/35. Tyson ploughed up the sand on his long run up and could not bowl at full pace and was described by <b>one</b> <b>reporter</b> as a zephyr rather than a typhoon.|$|E

500|$|The move {{surprised}} the journalism community, which had expected Munsey {{to purchase the}} Tribune.

500|$|McCain was famously {{accessible}} to the press, using free media to compensate for his lack of funds. [...] As <b>one</b> <b>reporter</b> later recounted, [...] "McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him." [...] Some McCain aides saw the senator as naturally preferring the company of reporters to other politicians.|$|E
500|$|Yet {{another concern}} is that a person may carry out a {{spoofing}} attack by renaming their personal Wi-Fi network to [...] "LinkNYC." [...] This is potentially dangerous since many electronic devices tend to automatically connect to networks with a given name, but do not differentiate between the different networks. <b>One</b> <b>reporter</b> for The Verge suggested that to circumvent this, a person could turn off their mobile device's Wi-Fi while {{in the vicinity of}} a kiosk, or [...] "forget" [...] the LinkNYC network altogether.|$|E

The misunderstanding was mentioned at the end of Milk, Gus Van Sant's 2008 biopic of Harvey Milk.
