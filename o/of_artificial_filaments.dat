Peak current densities are achieved when the pinning center spacing are matched to spacing of the flux line lattice (EL) at field of operation. We {{find that the}} choice of the superconducting alloy as well as the pin material has marked effect on both the characteristic pinning force, F and the critical magnetic field, Hc 2. In addition, the lesign approach or geometry such as the size <b>of</b> the <b>artificial</b> superconducting <b>filament,</b> the area of the pinning material, and the position of the pins can be important factors in determining the strength of the pinning force on the FLL.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} to determine directly the amount <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> viscosity needed for stability using an eigenvalue analysis for a finite difference {{representation of the}} Navier-Stokes equations. The stability and growth of small perturbations about a steady flow over airfoils are analyzed for various amounts <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> viscosity. The eigenvalues were determined for a small time-dependent perturbation about a steady inviscid flow over an NACA 0012 airfoil at a Mach number of 0. 8 and angle of attack of 0 deg. The method {{has been applied to}} inviscid flows here, but as discussed is also applicable to viscous flows. The movement of the eigenvalue constellation with respect to the amount <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> viscosity is studied. The stability boundaries {{as a function of the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> viscosity from both the eigenvalue analysis and the time-marching scheme are also presented.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this paper}} was to present methods <b>of</b> {{placement}} <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> anterior teeth in edentulous individuals. The following review takes account of the majority of papers published during the last 100 years. The review has been divided into sections regarding the method used to determine the position <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> anterior teeth. Geometric aspect Gysi (1895 - 1920) produced the first scientific theory about the position <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> anterior teeth. Physiognomic theory The {{aim of this}} theory is to find the most natural position for artificial anterior teeth for each individual. Camper's "face angle" as a physiognomic criterion, has been introduced in papers of Wehrli (1961), Marxhors (1966), Tanzer (1968), Lombardi (1973). Esthetic aspect Important names in the field of dental esthetics are: Schön and Singer (1961), Arnheim (1965), Krajiček (1969), Tanzer (1968), Lombardi (1973), Goldstein (1976). They have introduced principles of visual aspects for selection of contours, dimension and position <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> anterior teeth. Constitution aspect Flagg (1880), Williams (1913) and Hrauf (1957, 1958), have considered body constitution and individual characteristics regarding position <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> anterior teeth. Physiological theory In 1971, Marxhors pointed {{to the fact that the}} position <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> teeth corresponds with the function of the surrounding soft tissue and from the aspect of physiognomy as well. Phonetic aspect According to Silverman (1962) artificial anterior teeth are nearest when we pronounce the sound "S". Cephalometrical research Rayson (1970), Watson (1989), Strajnić Lj. (1999), Bassi F. (2001) have presented cephalometric radiographic analyses of natural anterior teeth compared with cephalometric radiographic analyses <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> anterior teeth. A review of dental literature shows several factors suggesting modalities which should determine the position <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> anterior teeth. Numerous methods have been designed for evaluation of the position <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> anterior teeth. However, there is no universally reliable method regarding determination of the position <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> anterior teeth...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn 2010, the Venter lab {{announced}} that it had created the first bacterium with an entirely synthetic genome. This {{was reported to be}} the first instance of ‘artificial life,’ and in the ethical and policy discussions that followed it was widely assumed that the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> life is in itself morally significant. We cast doubt on this assumption. First we offer an account of the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> life that distinguishes this from the derivation of organisms from existing life and clarify what we mean in asking whether the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> life has moral significance. We then articulate and evaluate three attempts to establish that the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> life is morally significant. These appeal to (1) the claim that the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> life involves playing God, as expressed in three distinct formulations; (2) the claim that the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> life will encourage reductionist attitudes toward the living world that undermine the special moral value accorded to life; and (3) the worry that artificial organisms will have an uncertain functional status and consequently an uncertain moral status. We argue that all three attempts to ground the moral significance of the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> life fail, because none of them establishes that the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> life is morally problematic {{in a way that the}} derivation of organisms from existing life forms is not. We conclude that the decisive moral consideration is not how life is created but what non-genealogical properties it possesses...|$|R

40|$|Enzymes {{catalyze}} a {{wide variety}} of chemical reactions with high selectivity and activity under mild conditions. The research strategy in the construction <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> metalloenzyme relies on noncovalent attachment of the metal moiety using biotin-(strept) avidin technology. The construction <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> metalloenzyme can be carried out by anchoring a metal moiety within a protein scaffold {{with the help of an}} anchoring group. This chapter presents the results obtained upon applying this strategy toward the generation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> metalloenzymes for various enantioselective transformations. The palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) is a powerful tool for the elaboration of enantiopure high-added value compounds. The current hypothesis is that proteins with a given catalytic function are difficult to use as host for the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> metalloenzymes. Proteins which merely act as transporters (myoglobin, serum albumins, (strept) avidin, etc.) may be more suited for the creation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> metalloenzymes...|$|R

The environment consists of a web application, a simulation server, applications for local simula- tion of matches and sample artificial intelligences based on finite state machines.
