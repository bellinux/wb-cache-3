5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom <b>of</b> <b>Choice.</b> Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
