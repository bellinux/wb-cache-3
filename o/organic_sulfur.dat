50|$|Another major {{finding of}} her {{research}} {{is related to}} cloud formation. In order for a cloud to form, water must condense into droplets. <b>Organic</b> <b>sulfur</b> compounds in the atmosphere create aerosols that serve as cloud condensation nuclei. An <b>organic</b> <b>sulfur</b> compound known as DMSP (dimethylsulfoniopropionate) is produced in large quantities by photosynthetic plankton in ocean. If DMSP is converted to dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the DMS rises into the atmosphere and increases cloud formation. Moran's research group discovered key genes in Roseobacter and Pelagibacteria that breakdown DMSP into methanethiol instead, a chemical compound that does not enter the atmosphere or increase cloud formation. Basically, Moran's research group made a major discovery that explains connections between the marine microbial food web and cloud formation over the oceans. That research also helped in identifying the biochemical pathway that controls how bacteria release methanethiol into the microbial food web, making it available to other bacteria as well.|$|E

40|$|The oceans {{are a key}} {{source of}} a number of atmospherically {{important}} volatile gases. The accurate and robust determination of trace gases in seawater is a significant analytical challenge, requiring reproducible and ideally automated sample handling, a high efficiency of seawater–air transfer, removal of water vapour from the sample stream, and high sensitivity and selectivity of the analysis. Here we describe a system that was developed for the fully automated analysis of dissolved very short-lived halogenated species (VSLS) sampled from an under-way seawater supply. The system can also be used for semi-automated batch sampling from Niskin bottles filled during CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) profiles. The essential components comprise a bespoke, automated purge and trap (AutoP & T) unit coupled to a commercial thermal desorption and gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (TD-GC-MS). The AutoP & T system has completed five research cruises, from the tropics to the poles, and collected over 2500 oceanic samples to date. It is able to quantify > 25 species over a boiling point range of 34 – 180 °C with Henry's law coefficients of 0. 018 and greater (CH 2 2 l, k H cc dimensionless gas/aqueous) and has been used to measure <b>organic</b> <b>sulfurs,</b> hydrocarbons, halocarbons and terpenes.
