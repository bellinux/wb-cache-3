5|$|In various {{applications}} to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms {{the foundation for}} the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental modes of vibration that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, that represent the fundamental modes of vibration in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental modes of vibration of the violin string.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of asking}} about being may {{be traced back}} via Aristotle to Parmenides.

25|$|In 1447, Johannes Mentelin {{gained the}} rights of a Strasbourg citizen. He was first a Goldschreiber (calligrapher and book scribe) by {{profession}} and worked in addition as an episcopal notary. Exactly when and where he learned the technique of book printing is not known. Since {{at the end of}} the 1450s, when Mentelin founded his Strasbourg printery, there was still no other place where printing was done besides Mainz, it is likely that he either got his knowledge directly there or through a middleman. Such a go-between might have been Heinrich Eggestein. It is suspected that he had been introduced to the trade of book printing during his stay in Mainz from Johannes Gutenberg. He did not set up his own Offizin (an old German term for a book printery) until the middle of the 1460s. Due to a lack of sources, the final clarification <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> must unfortunately remain unanswered for now. From the available data, it can however be concluded that Mentelin was the first book printer active in Strasbourg (and thus one of the first anywhere in Europe), even before Eggestein.|$|E

2500|$|In set theory, an {{infinite}} set {{is not considered}} to be created by some mathematical process such as [...] "adding one element" [...] that is then carried out [...] "{{an infinite}} number of times". Instead, a particular infinite set (such as the set of all natural numbers) is said to already exist, [...] "by fiat", as an assumption or an axiom. Given this infinite set, other infinite sets are then proven to exist as well, as a logical consequence. But it is still a natural philosophical question to contemplate some physical action that actually completes after an infinite number of discrete steps; and the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> using set theory gives rise to the paradoxes of the supertask.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the large}} {{collection}} of workshop drawings left by Domenichino passed through the Albani Collection before ending up in the British Royal Collection, bought for George III; there are over 1,750 sheets at Windsor Castle today. [...] These include a sheet with studies of the Edinburgh figures of Joseph {{on one side and}} the bagpiper on the other. [...] Drawings can be regarded by different scholars as either copies of something already existing, sketches where an artist works out something new, or adaptations that are something in between, and this ambiguity has affected discussion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> [...] Hugh Brigstocke, in the National Gallery of Scotland catalogue, sees this sheet as studies by Domenichino for new figures for his version of Carracci's composition, after Domenichino decided to add the bagpiper to strengthen the composition, necessitating a new position for Joseph. Other details, such as the boy with the dove, borrow from other drawings by Annibale Carracci.|$|E
2500|$|As Andrew Ilachinski {{points out}} in his Cellular Automata, many {{scholars}} have {{raised the question of}} whether the universe is a cellular automaton. Ilachinski argues that the importance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> may be better appreciated with a simple observation, which can be stated as follows. Consider the evolution of rule 110: if it were some kind of [...] "alien physics", what would be a reasonable description of the observed patterns? If an observer did not know how the images were generated, that observer might end up conjecturing about the movement of some particle-like objects. Indeed, physicist James Crutchfield has constructed a rigorous mathematical theory out of this idea, proving the statistical emergence of [...] "particles" [...] from cellular automata.], [...] 75, 11–54, 1994. Then, as the argument goes, one might wonder if our world, which is currently well described, at our current level of understanding, by physics with particle-like objects, could be a CA at its most fundamental level with the gaps in information or incomplete understanding of fundamental data appearing as an arbitrary random order that would seem contrary to CA.|$|E
