60|$|Betsy Bobbin had tired {{her feet}} by walking, {{so she was}} now riding upon {{the back of the}} stout little mule, facing {{backward}} and talking to Shaggy and Polychrome, who were just behind. Suddenly Hank pitched forward and began falling and Betsy would have tumbled over his head had she not grabbed the mule's shaggy neck with both arms and held <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|But I {{forgot all}} this, when, nearly at the top, I was thrown {{up the hill}} of the stairs {{as if it had}} {{suddenly}} become downhill. My feet flew from stair to stair to escape falling, and I flew, or fell, apparently upward, until, at the top, I hung <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> while the stern of the Elsinore flung skyward on some mighty surge.|$|E
60|$|For {{the horse}} had {{suddenly}} stopped pivoting and started {{off like a}} streak, not up or down the trail, but across a stretch of prairie grass. On and on he went, the bit between his teeth and gaining speed at every step. In vain Dick yelled at him, kicked him and banged him on the head. It was of no use, {{and he had to}} cling <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|Leaning {{over the}} side, with {{two pairs of}} gloves on, I caught the double line, and as I pulled and Dan reeled the fish came up nearer. But I could not see him. Then I reached the leader and held <b>on</b> as <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R
50|$|Donald and Goofy race {{up a tree}} as the two bulls {{prepare to}} fight. After the moose sharpen their antlers, they clash and the earthshaking body slams after that cause Goofy and Donald to fall off the tree they were hanging <b>on</b> to <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> landing in between the two bulls. After a futile April fool's joke meant to make the antlered beasts forget about the whole costume incident, Donald and Goofy run for their lives while the angry moose chase them. Mickey soon joins them as they run for their lives, going on a boat and racing away, {{concluding}} the cartoon.|$|R
50|$|When Elmer goes to {{wash his}} face again, Bugs keeps the towel at a short {{distance}} with a branch, causing Elmer to blindly follow the towel ("I {{do this kind of}} stuff to him all through the picture", he confides to the audience). He leads Elmer off a cliff edge. Elmer looks at the miraculous view of the Grand Canyon, but then realizes he's in midair. He runs back to safety and holds <b>on</b> to Bugs <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> Bugs then admits he's the one pulling these gags and runs off, with a furious Elmer giving chase after retrieving a gun from his tent. However, he runs into a black bear. The bear starts growling, and so Elmer turns to a wildlife handbook for advice, which directs him to play dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "God {{help the}} boats! It's no gale! It's a typhoon!" [...] the sailing-master shouted to Chris at eleven o'clock. [...] "Too much canvas! Got {{to get two}} more reefs into that mainsail, and {{got to do it}} right away!" [...] He glanced at the old captain, {{shivering}} in oilskins at the binnacle and holding <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> [...] "There's only you and I, Chris--and the cook; but he's next to worthless!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{might have}} been {{half an hour later}} when another sea swept the deck. Jim took shelter under the stump of the mast and held <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> Charlie got inside the coil of the derrick-fall and so was saved, while the others dived into the cabin. When that sea had passed they found no one at the tiller. Poor King had been washed overboard. Nothing {{whatever}} could be done for him, even if he had been seen, but the greedy sea had swallowed him, and he was taken to swell with his tuneful voice the company of those who sing on high the praises of redeeming love.|$|E
6000|$|... "All ready, then!" [...] {{cried the}} Ork, {{and at once}} his {{whirling}} tail began to revolve. Trot felt herself rising into the air; when the creature's legs left the ground Cap'n Bill grasped two of them firmly and held <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> The Ork's body was tipped straight upward, and Trot had to embrace the neck very tightly to keep from sliding off. Even in this position the Ork had trouble in escaping the rough sides of the well. Several times it exclaimed [...] "Wow!" [...] as it bumped its back, or a wing hit against some jagged projection; but the tail kept whirling with remarkable swiftness and the daylight grew brighter and brighter. It was, indeed, a long journey from the bottom to the top, yet almost before Trot realized they had come so far, they popped {{out of the hole}} into the clear air and sunshine and a moment later the Ork alighted gently upon the ground.|$|E
5000|$|A. O. Scott from At the Movies {{stated that}} while the film [...] "hits a few tinny, sentimental notes", he [...] "admires the craft and {{conviction}} of this film, and he was impressed enough by the look and the performances to recommend that you see it." [...] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone calls the film a [...] "haunting portrait of America as no country for old men or young". He states that [...] "Hillcoat -- through the artistry of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee -- carries the fire of our shared humanity and lets it burn bright and true." [...] Joe Morgenstern from the Wall Street Journal states that viewers have to [...] "hang <b>on</b> to yourself <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> resisting belief {{as best you can}} in the face of powerful acting, persuasive filmmaking and the perversely compelling certainty that nothing will turn out all right." ...|$|R
50|$|At school, Hannah meets Lucille {{because of}} her evil {{declaration}} and schemes. Hannah does not know {{is that she is}} befriending one of her family's worst enemies, Lucille. The two were talking but then, Lucille ran away as Andy (Anjo Damiles) almost saw her. Rebecca's hair continues to fall out, in that case, Sara cuts her hair short as well as Kara's in order to make Rebecca feel that she is never alone. Kara becomes more suspicious and decides to meet up with Lucille. Meanwhile, Barbara and the Suarez family are still {{looking for a way to}} find Alex and Lucille. Kara reunites with Lucille but cannot re-accept her as part of her life as she cannot move on what Lucille has done to the Suarez's in the past. Lucille begs for Kara's acceptance. Alex starts to get irritated and threatens that she will put Lucille back into the mental hospital. When Kara and Lucille met up, Alex decided to follow her and find out what Lucille was actually doing. Alex and Kara get into a fight which causes Kara to hang <b>on</b> a balcony <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> Alex pushes Kara's hands off which causes her to die.|$|R
6000|$|All {{that night}} the Virgin roared hoarsely and next morning, over an angry, white-headed sea, Harvey saw the Fleet with {{flickering}} masts waiting for a lead. Not a dory was hove out till ten o'clock, when the two Jeraulds of the Day's Eye, imagining a lull which did not exist, set the example. In a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the cockly swells, but Troop kept the [...] "We're Heres" [...] at work dressing-down. He saw no sense in [...] "dares"; and as the storm grew that evening they {{had the pleasure of}} receiving wet strangers only too glad to make any refuge in the gale. The boys stood by the dory-tackles with lanterns, the men ready to haul, one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that would make them drop everything and hold <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> Out of the dark would come a yell of [...] "Dory, dory!" [...] They would hook up and haul in a drenched man and a half-sunk boat, till their decks were littered down with nests of dories and the bunks were full. Five times in their watch did Harvey, with Dan, jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on the boom, and cling with arms, legs, and teeth to rope and spar and sodden canvas as a big wave filled the decks. One dory was smashed to pieces, and the sea pitched the man head first on to the decks, cutting his forehead open; and about dawn, when the racing seas glimmered white all along their cold edges, another man, blue and ghastly, crawled in with a broken hand, asking news of his brother. Seven extra mouths sat down to breakfast: a Swede; a Chatham skipper; a boy from Hancock, Maine; one Duxbury, and three Provincetown men.|$|R
6000|$|They had {{not very}} far to go, but Moti's little pony, {{weighted}} with a heavy man and two big rocks, soon began to lag behind the cavalry, and would have lagged behind the infantry too, only they were not very anxious to be {{too early in the}} fight, and hung back so as to give Moti plenty of time. The young man jogged along more and more slowly for some time, until at last, getting impatient at the slowness of the pony, he gave him such a tremendous thwack with his staff that the pony completely lost his temper and bolted. First one stone became untied and rolled away in a cloud of dust {{to one side of the}} road, whilst Moti nearly rolled off too, but clasped his steed valiantly by its ragged mane, and, dropping his staff, held <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> Then, fortunately the other rock broke away from his other leg and rolled thunderously down a neighbouring ravine. Meanwhile the advanced cavalry had barely time to draw to one side when Moti came dashing by, yelling bloodthirsty threats to his pony: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About midnight of the 28th the gale {{was at its}} worst. Darkness {{that could}} be felt between the flashes of lightning. Thunder that was nearly drowned by the roaring of the wind an' the {{crashing}} of everything all round. To save their lives the people had to fling themselves into ditches and hollows of the ground. Mr Ross {{and some of his}} people were lying in the shelter of a wall near his house. There had been a schooner lying not far off. When Mr Ross raised his head cautiously above the wall to have a look to wind'ard he saw the schooner comin' straight for him {{on the top of a}} big wave. `Hold on!' he shouted, fell flat down, and laid hold o' the nearest bush. Next moment the wave burst right over the wall, roared on up to the garden, 150 yards above high-water mark, and swept his house clean away! By good fortune the wall stood the shock, and the schooner stuck fast just before reachin' it, but so near that the end of the jib-boom passed right over the place where the household lay holdin' <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> and half drowned. It was a tremendous night," [...] concluded the captain, [...] "an' nearly everything on the islands was wrecked, but they've survived it, as you'll see. Though it's seven years since that cyclone swep' over them, they're all right and goin' ahead again, full swing, as if nothin' had happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|Another sea {{swept over}} them, and the skiff, which {{had long since}} been swamped, dashed itself to pieces against the stern. Then the Reindeer towered above them on a {{mountain}} of water. Joe caught himself half shrinking back, for it seemed she would fall down squarely on top of them; but the next instant she dropped into the gaping trough, and they were looking down upon her far below. It was a striking picture--one Joe was destined never to forget. The Reindeer was wallowing in the snow-white smother, her rails flush with the sea, the water scudding across her deck in foaming cataracts. The air was filled with flying spray, which made the scene appear hazy and unreal. One of the men was clinging to the perilous after-deck and striving to cast off the water-logged skiff. The boy, leaning far over the cockpit-rail and holding <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> was passing him a knife. The second man stood at the wheel, putting it up with flying hands and forcing the sloop to pay off. Beside him, his injured arm in a sling, was Red Nelson, his sou'wester gone and his fair hair plastered in wet, wind-blown ringlets about his face. His whole attitude breathed indomitability, courage, strength. It seemed almost as though the divine were blazing forth from him. Joe looked upon him in sudden awe, and, realizing the enormous possibilities of the man, felt sorrow for {{the way in which}} they had been wasted. A thief and a robber! In that flashing moment Joe caught a glimpse of human truth, grasped at the mystery of success and failure. Life threw back its curtains that he might read it and understand. Of such stuff as Red Nelson were heroes made; but they possessed wherein he lacked--the power of choice, the careful poise of mind, the sober control of soul: in short, the very things his father had so often [...] "preached" [...] to him about.|$|E

5000|$|... "Flyingbolt was hacking {{along with}} Paddy Woods {{on his back}} and a funny look in his eye. Upsides on Arkle, I was {{thinking}} to myself that I would never see a prouder horse than this. Then he turned his head and slowly looked us over. You could almost see the curl of the lip. This was the 'Who are these peasants?' look of his that I was to come to know so well and I suppose I should have been forewarned. Next thing I knew he's taken a strong hold and was away. Not to be outdone, Arkle took an equally strong hold and got up alongside. And so these two young chasers who were then potentially {{the best in the world}} staged their own private race during what was supposed to be a normal session of morning schooling. They took the next four fences, neck and neck, flat out as though their lives depended on the outcome, while Paddy and I held <b>on</b> to them <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> and waited <b>for</b> the fires to die down. Well, they cleared them all right, but it was a bit too close for comfort and Mr. Dreaper never allowed them to be schooled together again. In character, they were the night and the day. A small child could walk into Arkle's box in absolute safety. No child, no man would ever willingly step into Flyingbolt's.... at least, not twice. He'd kick the eye out of your head. But over jumps and on the flat he was a superb machine and a brave one.... For him, the future was limitless.... Certainly he was as good at seven as Arkle was at the same age.... If progress had been maintained, he would have been as good, if not better, than Arkle himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|For Bryan I now got a young {{gentleman from}} Oxford, the Rev. Edmund Lavender, who was {{commissioned}} {{to teach him}} Latin, when the boy was in the humour, and to ground him in history, grammar, and the other qualifications of a gentleman. Lavender was a precious addition to our society at Hackton. He was the means of making a deal of fun there. He was the butt of all our jokes, and bore them with the most admirable and martyrlike patience. He was one {{of that sort of}} men who would rather be kicked by a great man than not be noticed by him; and I have often put his wig into the fire {{in the face of the}} company, when he would laugh at the joke as well as any man there. It was a delight to put him on a high-mettled horse, and send him after the hounds,--pale, sweating, calling on us, for Heaven's sake, to stop, and holding <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> by the mane and the crupper. How it happened that the fellow was never killed I know not; but I suppose hanging is the way in which HIS neck will be broke. He never met with any accident, to speak of, in our hunting-matches: but you were pretty sure to find him at dinner in his place at the bottom of the table making the punch, whence he would be carried off fuddled to bed before the night was over. Many a time have Bryan and I painted his face black on those occasions. We put him into a haunted room, and frightened his soul out of his body with ghosts; we let loose cargoes of rats upon his bed; we cried fire, and filled his boots with water; we cut the legs of his preaching-chair, and filled his sermon-book with snuff. Poor Lavender bore it all with patience; and at our parties, or when we came to London, was amply repaid by being allowed to sit with the gentlefolks, and to fancy himself in the society of men of fashion. It was good to hear the contempt with which he talked about our rector. 'He has a son, sir, who is a servitor: and a servitor at a small college,' he would say. 'How COULD you, my dear sir, think of giving the reversion of Hackton to such a low-bred creature?' ...|$|E
