40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a chemically modified porous adsorbent having a BET {{surface area of}} at least 10 m 2 /g and to a method for the production thereof, which is suitable for removing fluorinated organic compounds from contaminated fluids. A carbohydrate-based starting material is chemically modified by treating the starting material with a modifying reagent. The modifying reagent is selected such that the carbohydrate is at least partially substituted by a substituent that contains a hydrophobic group or a hydrophobic group and a cationic group, the hydrophobic group being selected from alkyl groups which comprise at least one <b>octylene</b> moiety, from aryl groups and from aralkyl groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} removing fluorinated organic compounds from contaminated fluids {{by means of a}} kit that comprises a first and a second adsorbent component, or only by means of the first adsorbent component alone. First, the first and optionally the second adsorbent component are provided. The second adsorbent component is a solid adsorbent; the first adsorbent component is a chemical compound that contains a lipophilic group and a hydrophilic group, or contains such a compound in dissolved form, wherein the hydrophilic group contains at least one cationic group and wherein the lipophilic group is selected from alkyl groups that comprise at least one <b>octylene</b> unit, from aryl groups, and from aralkyl groups. Thereafter, the contaminated fluid is brought in contact with the first adsorbent component, and optionally the fluid is also brought in contact with the second adsorbent component. Finally, the adsorbent component(s) are removed from the fluid together with the adsorbed fluorinated organic compounds. The invention further relates to the kit required for said method...|$|E
40|$|Photochromic cholinesterase inhibitors were {{obtained}} from cis- 1, 2 -α-dithienylethene-based compounds by incorporating one or two aminopolymethylene tacrine groups. All target compounds are potent acetyl- (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors in the nanomolar concentration range. Compound 11 b bearing an <b>octylene</b> linker exhibited interactions with both the catalytic active site (CAS) and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. Yet upon irradiation with light, the mechanism of interaction varied from one photochromic form to another, which was investigated by kinetic studies and proved "photoswitchable". The AChE-induced β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation assay gave further experimental support to this finding: Aβ 1 - 40 aggregation catalyzed by the PAS of AChE might be inhibited by compound 11 b in a concentration-dependent manner and seems to occur only with one photochromic form. Computational docking studies provided potential binding modes of the compound. Docking studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the ring-open and -closed form indicate a difference in binding. Although both forms can interact with the PAS, more stable interactions are observed for the ring-open form based upon stabilization of a water molecule network within the enzyme, whereas the ring-closed form lacks the required conformational flexibility for an analogous binding mode. The photoswitchable inhibitor identified might serve as valuable molecular tool to investigate the different biological properties of AChE {{as well as its}} role in pathogenesis of AD in in vitro assays...|$|E
