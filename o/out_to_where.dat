2500|$|Between 28 April and 4 May Vincejo chased {{several large}} French convoys into the Villaine estuary, the Gulf of Morbihan, Crac, and Lorient. The weak and inconstant winds meant that her efforts {{had little effect}} beyond {{interrupting}} his quarries' journeys. Then {{on the evening of}} 4 May Wright sighted a large ship corvette, of 18 guns, at the entrance to Lorient. Over the next three days he attempted to intercept her and lure her <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> he could engage her. In the meantime, he forced a convoy to take shelter at Le Palais, Belle Île.|$|E
2500|$|The sum of two counter-propagating waves (of equal {{amplitude}} and frequency) {{creates a}} standing wave. [...] Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave, thus causing wave reflection, and therefore introducing a counter-propagating wave. [...] For example, when a violin string is displaced, transverse waves propagate <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> the string {{is held in}} place at the bridge and the nut, where the waves are reflected back. [...] At the bridge and nut, the two opposed waves are in antiphase and cancel each other, producing a node. Halfway between two nodes there is an antinode, where the two counter-propagating waves enhance each other maximally. There is no net propagation of energy over time.|$|E
