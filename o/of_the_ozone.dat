5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer.

5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E

40|$|The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) is {{utilised}} {{to study}} <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle and underlying photochemical and dynamical processes. The analysis {{is focused on}} <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle in <b>the</b> middle stratosphere at 5 hPa where satellite-based trend estimates of stratospheric ozone are most biased by diurnal sampling effects and drifting satellite orbits. <b>The</b> simulated <b>ozone</b> cycle shows a minimum after sunrise and a maximum in the late afternoon. Further, a seasonal variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle in <b>the</b> stratosphere was found. Depending on season and latitude, <b>the</b> peak-to-valley difference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle varies mostly between 3 – 5 % (0. 4 ppmv) with respect to <b>the</b> midnight <b>ozone</b> volume mixing ratio. <b>The</b> maximal variation <b>of</b> 15 % (0. 8 ppmv) is found at the polar circle in summer. <b>The</b> global pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle is mainly governed by the solar zenith angle and the sunshine duration. In addition, we find synoptic scale variations in <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle. These variations are often anti-correlated to regional temperature anomalies and are due to <b>the</b> temperature dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rate coefficients k 2 and k 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chapman cycle reactions. Further, the NO x catalytic cycle counteracts to <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> during daytime and leads to an anti-correlation between anomalies in NO x and <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle. Similarly, ozone recombines with atomic oxygen which leads to an anti-correlation between anomalies in <b>ozone</b> abundance and <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle. At higher latitudes, an increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> westerly (easterly) wind cause a decrease (increase) in <b>the</b> sunshine duration <b>of</b> an air parcel leading to a weaker (stronger) daily ozone cycle...|$|R
5|$|Since the 1970s an {{important}} focus of {{study has been}} the ozone layer in the atmosphere above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at Halley Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered {{the existence of a}} hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> was caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the Montreal Protocol of 1989, climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon {{is known as the}} greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|By 1987, in {{response}} to a dramatic seasonal depletion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer over Antarctica, diplomats in Montreal forged a treaty, the Montreal Protocol, which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs.

25|$|Although {{low levels}} of ozone have been advertised to be of some {{disinfectant}} use in residential homes, the concentration of ozone in dry air required to have a rapid, substantial effect on airborne pathogens exceeds safe levels recommended by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Environmental Protection Agency.

25|$|Ozone (3) is {{generated}} by passing oxygen (2) through a high voltage potential resulting in a third oxygen atom becoming attached and forming 3.
