Health effects on intelligence {{have been described}} as being among the most important factors in the origins of human group differences in IQ test scores and <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> cognitive ability. Several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood–brain barrier of the child is less effective.

25|$|The use {{of tissue}} residue allows an {{investigator}} to: account for multiple routes of exposure, account for toxicokinetic differences between species, account for factors that alter bioavailability and potentially address exposure of an organism to a chemical mixture. Tissue residue {{also has the}} ability to represent temporal and spatial exposure or an organism, as well as clarify the cause-effect relationship of chemicals. These relationships are often distorted by uncertainty in chemical bioavailability. The mechanism of action for a chemical depends on the internal tissue concentration, thus tissue residue gives researchers a more direct estimate of the residue-effect (dose-response) relationship. Tissue residue is also less variable than <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> chemical exposure.|$|E
25|$|PVAs in {{combination}} with sensitivity analysis {{can also be used}} to identify which vital rates has the relative greatest effect on population growth and <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> population viability. For example, a study by Manlik et al. (2016) forecast the viability of two bottlenose dolphin populations in Western Australia and identified reproduction as having the greatest influence on the forecast of these populations. One of the two populations was forecast to be stable, whereas the other population was forecast to decline, if it isolated from other populations and low reproductive rates persist. The difference in viability between the two studies was primarily due to differences in reproduction and not survival. The study also showed that temporal variation in reproduction had a greater effect on population growth than temporal variation in survival.|$|E
