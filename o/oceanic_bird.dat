60|$|I have, {{since this}} period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the hideous {{uncertainty}} which enveloped {{the fate of}} the stranger. Her build and general appearance, as I have before stated, led us to the belief that she was a Dutch trader, and the dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion. We might have easily seen the name upon her stern, and, indeed, taken other observations, which would have guided us in making out her character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to every thing of that nature. From the saffron-like hue of such of the corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever, or some other virulent disease of the same fearful kind. If such were the case (and I know not what else to imagine), death, to judge from the positions of the bodies, must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted. It is possible, indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of their sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster, or that the eating of some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine animal, or <b>oceanic</b> <b>bird,</b> might have induced it--but it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no doubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery.|$|E
40|$|Biological scatterers, {{consisting}} {{of birds and}} insects, may become trapped near the circulation center of tropical cyclones, particularly if a well-developed eyewall is present. These scatterers may be observed using weather radar, where they may appear to the radar operator as areas of light precipitation. Polarimetric radar characteristics of these scatterers, informed by additional observations of known bioscatter, include a combination of very high differential reflectivity (3 – 7. 9 dB) and very low copolar correlation coefficient (0. 3 – 0. 8). Polarimetric radar observations of bioscatter are presented for Hurricane Irene (2011) and Hurricane Sandy (2012). In these storms, the bioscatter signature first appeared at the 0. 58 elevation angle {{at a distance of}} 100 – 120 km from the radar. The signature appeared on successively higher tilts as the circulation center neared the radar, and its areal coverage in constant altitude plan position indicator (CAPPI) slices was primarily governed by the distribution of convection in the eye and by the timing of landfall. The highest altitude at which the signature appears may represent the inversion level within certain tropical cyclone eyes. For Hurricane Irene, inland observations of <b>oceanic</b> <b>bird</b> species support biological transport. Knowledge of the bioscatter signature has value to meteorologists monitoring tropical cyclones within the range of a polarimetric radar, possible value for estimating inversion height changes within the eyes of well-structured tropical cyclones, and value to biologists who wish to estimate the magnitude of biological transport in tropical cyclones...|$|E

40|$|What is a Colonial-Nesting Waterbird? “Colonial-nesting waterbird” is a tongue-twister of a {{collective}} term used by bird biologists {{to refer to a}} large variety of different species that share two common characteristics: (1) they tend to gather in large assemblages, called colonies, during the nesting season, and (2) they obtain all or most of their food (fish and aquatic invertebrates) from the water. Colonial-nesting waterbirds can be further divided into two major groups depending on where they feed. Seabirds (also called marine <b>birds,</b> <b>oceanic</b> <b>birds,</b> or pelagic birds) feed primarily in saltwater. Some seabirds are so marvelously adapted to marine environments that they spend virtually their entire lives at sea, returning to land only to nest; others (especially the gulls and terns) are confined to the narrow coastal interface between land and sea, deeding during the day and loafing and roosting on land. Included among the seabirds are such groups as the albatrosses, shearwaters, storm-petrels, tropicbirds, boobies, pelicans, cormorants, frigate birds, gulls, terns, murres, guillemots, murrelets, auklets and puffins. A few species of cormorants, gulls, and terns also occupy fresh water habitats...|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, how {{remarkable}} {{it is that}} the only small and brightly coloured birds of our own country in which the male and female are alike--the tits and starlings--either build in holes or construct covered nests; while the beautiful hangnests (Icteridae) of South America, which always build covered or purse-shaped nests, are equally showy in both sexes, in striking contrast with the chatterers and tanagers of the same country, whose females are invariably less conspicuous than the males. On a rough estimate, there are about 1200 species of birds in the class of showy males and females, with concealed nidification; while there are probably, from an equally rough estimate, about the same number in the contrasted class of showy males and dull females, with open nests. This will leave the great bulk of known birds in the classes of those which are more or less protectively coloured in both sexes; or which, from their organisation and habits, do not require special protective coloration, such as many of the birds of prey, the larger waders, and the <b>oceanic</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|R

Kittiwakes are surface feeders and thus can compensate for low food availability only by increasing their foraging range and/or devoting more time to foraging.

The development of Global Positioning System (GPS) loggers is advancing rapidly.

Phylogenetic analysis of all the available avian DRB-like sequences showed that, of five penguin species and nine other bird species, the sequences of the Humboldt penguins grouped most closely to the Little penguin and the mallard, respectively.

40|$|Spatial {{relationships}} between predators and prey {{have important implications}} for landscape processes and patterns. Highly mobile <b>oceanic</b> <b>birds</b> and their patchily distributed prey constitute an accessible model sys- tem for studying these relationships. High-frequency echosounders can be used together with simultaneous direct visual observations toquantitatively describe the distributions of seabird consumers and their resources over a wide range of spatial scales, yielding information which is rarely available in terrestrial systems. Recent fine-scale investigations which have used acoustics to study the distribution of foraging marine birds have reported weak or ephemeral spatial associations between the birds and their prey. These results are inconsistent with predictions of optimal foraging, but several considerations suggest that traditional foraging models do not adequately describe resource acquisition in marine environments. Relative to their terrestrial counterparts, oceanic `landscapes' are structurally very simple, but they generally lack visual cues about resource availability. An emerging view assumes that perceptually constrained organisms searching for food in multiscale en- vironments should respond to patterns of resource abundance over a continuum of scales. We explore fractal geometry as a possible tool for quantifying this view and for describing spatial dispersion patterns that result from foraging behavior. Data onan Alaskan seabird (least and its zooplanktonic food resources suggest that fractal approachescan yield new ecological insights intocomplex spatial patterns deriv- ing from animal movements. 1...|$|R

Dispersal of seeds among isolated <b>oceanic</b> islands, by <b>birds,</b> oceans and man, is a well-known phenomenon, and many widespread island plants have traits that facilitate this process. Crucially, however, there have been no mechanistic vector-based models of long-distance dispersal for seeds among isolated oceanic islands based on empirical data. Here, we propose a plan to develop seed analogues, or pseudoseeds, fitted with wireless sensor technology that will enable high-fidelity tracking as they disperse across the ocean.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{documented}} that human activities have elevated the extirpation of natural populations {{as well as}} the successful introduction to new areas of non-native species. These dual processes of introduction and extirpation can change the similarity of communities, but the direction and magnitude these changes take are likely to depend on the manner in which introductions and extirpations occur, the spatial scale at which the changes are measured, and the initial similarity of the communities before the human-induced drivers occurred. Here, we explore patterns of extirpation and introduction and their influence on the similarity of global <b>oceanic</b> island <b>bird</b> assemblages from four different Oceans (Atlantic, Caribbean, Indian, Pacific). We show that different historical patterns of introduction and extirpation have produced varying trends in compositional similarity both between islands within archipelagos and between islands across different archipelagos within the same ocean. Patterns of bird assemblage convergence (i. e. taxonomic homogenization) or divergence (i. e. taxonomic differentiation) among islands depended on the scale of examination, the evolutionary associations among species of the region, and the cultural history of human colonization. These factors are all likely to be leading to a series of multiple interacting processes that are shaping the complex compositional changes observed among global island bird faunas over time.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to earlier navigation hypotheses, based {{as they are}} on theoretical constructs deduced from {{our knowledge of the}} physical world, the notion of olfactory navigation is an unexpected outcome of empirical research. Referring to sceptical articles on the issue in this journal and elsewhere (e. g. Schmidt-Koenig 1985, 1987, 2001, Wiltschko 1996), and in order to fill a gap in a recent review on avian navigation (Wiltschko & Wiltschko 1999), I describe the most instructive experiments providing evidence that birds are able to home by utilizing atmospheric trace gases perceived by the sense of smell. (1) When released in an unfamiliar distant area, homing pigeons with bisected olfactory nerves fly considerable distances, but fail to approach the home site (Fig. 1, 2, 3). Largely analogous treatments in control birds and experimentals make it extremely unlikely that the failures are due to non- olfactory side-effects. (2) Elimination of trace gases from the inhaled air by means of charcoal filters prior to release, combined with nasal anaesthesia upon release, prevents initial homeward orientation, whereas nasal anaesthesia alone (after smelling of natural release-site air) does not (Fig. 5). (3) Pigeons exposed to natural air at one site and released, without access to natural air, at a quite different site, fly in a direction corresponding to homeward from the site of exposure, but not from the current actual position (Fig. 6). (4) Long-term screening from winds in an aviary at home prevents subsequent homeward orientation from distant sites. Deflecting or reversing winds in a home aviary results in accordingly deflected or reversed orientation (Fig. 7). (5) From areas made familiar by previous flights homing is possible also on a non-olfactory basis. This can be explained in terms of the utilisation of visual landscape features. In as far as related experiments were conducted using reliable methods, the results are unequivocal. On the whole, they can be understood only provided that the birds are able to deduce their position relative to the home site from atmospheric trace gases, and that this ability requires previous opportunity to correlate current wind conditions with simultaneous olfactory conditions at the home site over a lengthy period of time. As an attempt to explain the underlying system, a working hypothesis is presented which postulates that (a) long-range gradients exist in the ratios among several airborne trace substances and that (b) their directions can be derived, at the home site, from changes of ratios in dependence on wind direction. Atmospheric hydrocarbons investigated by means of gas chromatography in an area covering 400 km in diameter did in fact include such postulated ratio gradients (Fig. 8). Their directions were fairly stable even under varying conditions of weather and winds. Correlations among gradient directions and changes of ratios according to wind directions were also found, but the long-term angular relationships have not yet been definitely determined. By means of computer simulations using actually measured atmospheric values as inputs, navigational performances could be created corresponding to those observed in homing pigeons (Fig. 9). Experiments with swifts and starlings indicate that olfactory navigation methods are applied also by wild-living species (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11). A schematic model (Fig. 12) illustrates how they might be integrated in the process of long-distance migratory orientation. Also, the question is raised whether long-distance foraging flights of albatrosses (Fig. 13) and other <b>oceanic</b> <b>birds</b> might be controlled by olfactory signals involving long- range ratio gradients of atmospheric trace gases (Fig. 14). A few experiments are suggested for testing the potential application of olfactory navigation in natural bird life...|$|R
