5000|$|The term [...] "cone of silence" [...] {{was also}} used in the Civil Forum on the Presidency on August 16, 2008. Host Rick Warren stated, [...] "Now, Senator <b>Obama</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go first. We flipped a coin, and we have safely placed Senator McCain in a cone of silence." [...] In fact, however, McCain did not even arrive at the church until nearly half an hour later. A minor {{controversy}} arose over {{the question of whether}} McCain had actually been able to hear Obama's answers to Warren's questions.

The amount of deceit she has put forward is really unattractive.Power apologized for the remarks {{on the night of the}} March 6 interview, saying that they [...] "do not reflect my feelings about Sen. Clinton, whose leadership and public service I have long admired", and telling Irish TV reporter Michael Fisher: [...] "Of course I regret them. I can't even believe they came out of my mouth....in every public appearance I've ever made talking about Senator Clinton, I have sung her praises as the leader she has been, the intellect. She's also incredibly warm, funny....I wish I could go back in time." [...] The next day, in the wake of reaction to the remarks, she resigned from the Obama campaign. Soon afterward, the Weekly Standard said that it [...] "might have been the most ill-starred book tour since the invention of movable type." ...|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{questions}} posed {{to the two}} candidates in their separate appearances {{would be the same}} or similar, it was agreed in advance that whichever candidate went second would be sequestered so as not to hear anything asked of his rival. At the beginning of the forum, Warren stated, [...] "Now, Senator <b>Obama</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go first. We flipped a coin, and we have safely placed Senator McCain in a cone of silence." [...] In fact, however, McCain did not even arrive at the church until nearly half an hour later. Andrea Mitchell, on Meet the Press, alluded to the possibility that McCain may have been able to hear {{the questions}} put to Obama, partly because his answers were immediate and, according to Mitchell, he sounded well prepared. Another act that aroused suspicion was when McCain was asked to define marriage - [...] he gave a straightforward answer, and then asked when he would be asked the importance of Supreme Court Justices, even though the question was not to be asked until later. The McCain campaign stated that McCain did not hear or see any of the broadcast. A spokeswoman for McCain said, [...] "The insinuation from the Obama campaign that John McCain, a former prisoner of war, cheated is outrageous." [...] ABC News has reported that, in subsequent inquiries about the incident, the McCain campaign, while continuing to insist that McCain did not hear or see the broadcast himself, [...] "has so far refused to say no one told the senator about the questions Obama was asked." ...|$|E

President Obama is, therefore, coming to India with the economic agenda as his main focus; and {{at the core of}} that is the promise to open up the Indian market in order to create more jobs for Americans.
