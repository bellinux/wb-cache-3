5|$|Meanwhile, in Jakarta, an {{epidemic}} of the flu is underway. Among those who fall ill is President Sukarno, who writes to Chairman Mao Zedong to request some doctors. Mao sends doctors, who give Sukarno poison to paralyze him and aid the 30 September Movement in overthrowing the government. The slow acting poison causes Sukarno to faint after he and his ministers have a large party with haraam events, including the consumption of pork and frog and zina (sex <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage).</b>|$|E

50|$|For black {{high school}} students, the African American family {{structure}} also affects their educational goals and expectations. Studies {{on the topic}} have indicated that children growing up in single-parent homes face disturbances in young childhood, adolescence and young adulthood as well. Although these effects are sometimes minimal and contradictory, it is generally agreed that the family structure a child grows up in is important for their success in the educational sphere. This is particularly important for African American children who have a 50% chance <b>of</b> being born <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> and {{growing up in a}} home with a single-parent.|$|R
50|$|Certain Jewish thinkers, such as Maimonides, {{believed}} that concubines are strictly reserved for kings, and thus that a commoner {{may not have}} a concubine; indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type <b>of</b> sexual relations <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> a <b>marriage.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support themselves and their children <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented {{in a way that}} might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible. All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, {{as long as it was}} clear that they were the exception to the rule.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E

5|$|Born Anna Louise Mohan, as a {{young girl}} she began using the last name of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, instead of her father's name. She grew up in rural Nevada and {{attended}} the University of Nevada in Reno and the University of Oregon in Eugene, graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the Spectator newspaper and freelanced for The Oregonian, both in Portland, Oregon. During her years in Portland (1909–1915), she became active in the women's suffrage movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to Greenwich Village, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as The Masses, or at meetings of a women's group, Heterodoxy, or through work with the Provincetown Players. During a National Woman's Party suffrage rally in Washington, D.C., in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Like Reed, she had lovers <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> and during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) these included playwright Eugene O'Neill and painter Andrew Dasburg.|$|E

25|$|In {{the midst}} of the {{powerful}} and urban changes, cultural change took root as well. Quebec was greatly affected by the baby boom; between 1960 and 1970, more than 1.2 million Quebeckers reached the age of 14. As more young Québécois rejected Catholic teachings, they made life choices that were a complete change from tradition in the province. Cohabitation rates among young couples rose, as the institution of marriage gradually lost its obligatory status. Births <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> began to rise, from 3.7 percent in 1961 to 10 percent in 1976, then 22 percent by 1984.

40|$|The Lord's Resistance Army, {{notorious for}} {{committing}} horrific atrocities against civilians in northern Uganda, presents a puzzle. The LRA systematically abducted girls and forcibly married {{them to the}} rebel commanders and soldiers. Yet rape <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> these <b>marriages</b> was rare, and gang rape of civilians was noticeably absent from the LRA's repertoire of violence. This paper examines the practices of sexual violence employed by the LRA during its rebellion in northern Uganda and analyzes the functional purpose of its violence. It will pose two questions. First, why did the LRA practice forced marriage? Second, why did the LRA not commit more rape <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> forced <b>marriage</b> than was observed? I argue that the LRA's patterns of sexual violence result largely from its operating in an environment with few material resources and no popular support with an army composed almost entirely of abducted youth. Forced marriage and the prohibition of extra-marital rape were instrumental to the rebels' success under these circumstances...|$|R
