After a successful security force counter-campaign during 1973 and 1974, drastic changes in the foreign policy of the Rhodesian government's two main backers, Portugal and South Africa, caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the nationalists' favour. In April 1974, the Portuguese government was overthrown by a military coup and replaced with a leftist administration in favour of ending the unpopular Colonial War in Angola, Mozambique and Portugal's other African territories.|$|E

500|$|Athens is the {{city-state}} that is best documented, both {{in terms}} of epikleroi and in all aspects of legal history.

The historian John Gould notes that the order <b>of</b> <b>relatives</b> that were required to marry the epikleros coincided with the relatives required to avenge a murder. This set <b>of</b> <b>relatives</b> was known as the anchisteia (...) in Athens. The anchisteia was also the group <b>of</b> <b>relatives</b> who would inherit property in the absence of legal heirs. If there was more than one possible spouse in a set <b>of</b> <b>relatives,</b> the right to marry the epikleros went to the eldest one. The property that was inherited could also be in debt, which would not affect the epikleros status.|$|R
