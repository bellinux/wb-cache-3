25|$|The {{struggle}} with the world is framed {{by the idea that}} series of personal and social transformations can increase <b>our</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> attributes associated with the divine and give us a larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting the moral of the mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual love. This orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation.|$|E

500|$|In September 1939, Britain {{entered the}} Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's {{children}} were evacuated {{to avoid the}} frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, [...] "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." [...] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived {{for most of the}} next five years. At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. She stated: [...] "We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear <b>our</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Current union {{president}} Ken Lewenza {{has argued}} that labour is {{not responsible for the}} bankruptcy crisis facing the Big Three automakers, saying that his members would not make concessions part of any taxpayer-funded bailout.

2500|$|Conrad's mother {{refused to}} believe that her son was unintelligent, and she set about finding him a {{suitable}} school. She found Darrow School in New Lebanon, New York. There, Conrad learned how to apply a systems approach to learning, and thus {{found a way to}} work around his dyslexia. Despite having to repeat the 11th grade, Conrad so excelled at Darrow that after his graduation in 1949, he not only was admitted to Princeton University, but he was also awarded a full Navy ROTC scholarship. While at Darrow, although he was only 5'6" [...] and weighed 135 pounds, Conrad started as the center on his football team and became the team captain. [...] "He was a very tough boy, and we won <b>our</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> games," [...] said the school's assistant headmaster.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1708 Eugene successfully evaded calls {{for him to take}} charge in Spain (in the end Guido Starhemberg was sent), thus enabling him to take command of the Imperial army on the Moselle and once again unite with Marlborough in the Spanish Netherlands. Eugene (without his army) arrived at the Allied camp at Assche, west of Brussels, in early July, providing a welcome boost to morale after the early defection of Bruges and Ghent to the French. [...] " [...] … our affairs improved through God's support and Eugene's aid," [...] wrote the Prussian General Natzmer, [...] "whose timely arrival raised the spirits of the army again and consoled us." [...] Heartened by the Prince's confidence the Allied commanders devised a bold plan to engage the French army under Vendôme and the Duke of Burgundy. On 10 July the Anglo-Dutch army made a forced march to surprise the French, reaching the river Scheldt just as the enemy were crossing to the north. The ensuing battle on 11 July—more a contact action rather than a set-piece engagement—ended in a resounding success for the Allies, aided by the dissension of the two French commanders. While Marlborough remained in overall command, Eugene had led the crucial right flank and centre. Once again the Allied commanders had co-operated remarkably well. [...] "Prince Eugene and I," [...] wrote the Duke, [...] "shall never differ about <b>our</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the laurels." ...|$|E
