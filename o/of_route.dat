5|$|The current {{alignment}} <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 57 {{was designated}} {{as a part of}} pre-1927 Route 12 in 1917. In 1927, Route 24 was designated along this route between the Phillipsburg area and Penwell in Mansfield Township while a spur <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 24 called Route S24 replaced pre-1927 Route 12 between Penwell and US46 in Hackettstown. When New Jersey renumbered its state highways in 1953, the portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> S24 between Penwell and CR517 in Hackettstown became a part <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 24 to complete a gap in that route while Route S24 north of there became Route 57. A never-built segment <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 57 running from the intersection <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 24 and Route 57 to US46 east of Hackettstown was legislated in 1965. Around 1970, Route 57 was designated along Route 24 west of Hackettstown while the portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 57 in Hackettstown became Route 182.|$|E
5|$|Between 1927 and 1953, Route 83 {{was a part}} <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 49, which {{originally}} ran {{south of}} Millville along Route 47 between Millville and South Dennis and along the entire length <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 83. In 1953, the route became Route 83 when Route 49 was realigned to follow what was then Route 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe and Route 47 was aligned to follow Route S49 between South Dennis and Wildwood. In 2007, the state completed reconstruction of the intersection with Route 47 to include a traffic signal. A school bus accident has prompted the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) to install a traffic signal at the Y intersection <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 83 and US 9.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the opening}} of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US1-9 and Route 25 were moved to the new bridge. After trucks were banned from the Pulaski Skyway in 1934, the portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 25 between Newark and Route 1 was {{designated}} as Route 25T. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, US1-9 Truck was designated to replace all <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 25T as well as the portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 1 between Route 25T and the Tonnele Circle.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, a spur <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 4, Route S4A, was {{proposed}} as a route running from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through Brigantine to Atlantic City, with the portion south of Little Beach {{to be built}} by Atlantic County. The state of New Jersey took over the proposed extension <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> S4A from Little Beach to Atlantic City in 1938. However, the portion of this route between Brigantine and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County {{was removed from the}} state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 56 (now U.S. Route 30), {{was proposed}} to run north along Brigantine Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from Atlantic City to Brigantine. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> S4A and the proposed Route S56 between U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City and Brigantine. Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 87 in Atlantic City split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following Brigantine Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 87 along Brigantine Boulevard between U.S. Route 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector was completed, linking Route 87, the casinos in the Marina District, and Brigantine with the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E

5|$|The portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> S24 between Penwell and County Route 517 in the {{southern}} part of Hackettstown (Route 57’s current eastern terminus) became part of mainline Route 24 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering in order to complete the gap that existed in that route between Penwell and Long Valley. The portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> S24 from this point north to U.S. Route 46 was designated as Route 57. In 1965, a portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 57 was designated to bypass Hackettstown, running from its intersection with Route 24 to U.S. Route 46 east of Hackettstown; this was never built. Around 1970, Route 24 west of Hackettstown became part <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 57 while the portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 57 that had existed between Route 24 and U.S. Route 46 was designated Route 182.|$|E
5|$|The present-day routing <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 20 {{north of}} Market Street was legislated in 1927 as part <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 3, {{which was to}} run from the New York border at Greenwood Lake to Secaucus. In addition, the present day routing south <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 4 was also legislated {{as part of that}} route, which was to run from the George Washington Bridge to Cape May. In 1929, the western {{terminus}} <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 3 was moved to Paterson as Route S4B (now Route 208) was planned to replace the alignment <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 3 from Paterson to the New York border. McLean Boulevard through Paterson was built by the 1930s. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 20 was legislated to follow the former alignment <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 3 between Paterson and East Rutherford as Route 3 was moved to the Route S3 freeway that was built between East Rutherford and Clifton.|$|E
5|$|The {{road that}} became Route 75 has existed since 1926, as part <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 55 from south of Charleston to east of East Prairie.

5|$|What is modern-day Route 124 was {{designated}} {{as a part of}} pre-1927 Route 5, a route that was legislated in 1916 to run from Delaware in Warren County east to Newark. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of pre-1927 Route 5 became a part <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 24, a road that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. In the 1950s, plans were made to bypass this portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 24 with a freeway running from Interstate 287 in Hanover Township to Interstate 78 in Springfield Township; this was approved of in 1960. This freeway was completed between Interstate 78 and the John F. Kennedy Parkway in 1972. The Route 24 designation was moved to the new freeway and Route 124 {{was designated}} along the former alignment <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 24 east of this point, which included frontage roads built where the new freeway ran along the old alignment of the road. Following the completion of the Route 24 freeway to Interstate 287 in 1992, Route 124 was extended west along the former alignment <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and U.S. Route 202 in Morristown. In 2002, maintenance of the portion <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 124 in Maplewood was transferred to the municipality from the New Jersey Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County Route 507 {{to the south}} <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7 and Bergen County Route 130 to the north <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In {{this portion of the}} route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for about a half mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that point, it meets the southern terminus of State Route 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of Hudson County Route 697 (Kearny Avenue).|$|E
5|$|After the split, US 46 {{turns into}} a limited-access road again and passes under Main Avenue/CR 601 and former Erie Railway tracks before coming to an {{interchange}} with the northern terminus <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 21.

In 1938, a spur <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 6 called Route 6A was legislated to run from Route 6 in Dover north to US 206/Route S31 in Lafayette Township; this became Route 15 in 1953. A realignment at the Passaic River crossing near Pine Brook was built in the 1940s, along with a new road for a short distance west from Pine Brook. Also in the 1940s, the road was widened west into Denville, and a bypass of downtown Denville, including an interchange at Route 5N (now Route 53) was built. The Route 6 designation was dropped in favor of U.S. Route 46 in the 1953 renumbering.|$|E
