5|$|In 1985, Hurricane Gloria blew <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> of the {{monument}}. In 1986, the State of Connecticut spent $6250 to re-mortar the monument. The monument {{was closed}} until 1989 for the repair work. In 2007, Carol Kimball of The Day {{wrote that the}} State of Connecticut has not funding repairs to the historic site, {{but it would be}} required if the monument were to continue to survive. Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond commission has yet to issue the approved $350,000 for its preservation. Other costs including sidewalks surrounding the entrance, and Memorial Gate itself, would require another $150,000 to repair.|$|E
5|$|The Joker is {{alternatively}} {{depicted as}} sexual and asexual. In The Dark Knight Returns and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker is seductive toward Batman; {{it is uncertain}} if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believes that the Joker is capable of a romantic relationship. His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.|$|E

This causes hundreds of ping pong balls to cascade from the ceiling above them. Going on to exclaim the amount of fun he is having, Peter recounts his performance in a Broadway musical version of the 1984 film Red Dawn.|$|E

5|$|At the SSR, Carter learns {{from the}} {{crippled}} war veteran Agent Daniel Sousa that the chauvinistic and promotion-seeking Agent Jack Thompson is following a lead on club owner Spider Raymond, {{who is looking}} to fence Stark's inventions. Raymond indeed sells the formula to the silent Leet Brannis. Infiltrating the club in disguise, Carter breaks into Raymond's safe and discovers that the formula has already {{been turned into a}} weapon.

5|$|In the bathroom, Lawrence finds a box {{containing}} a lighter, two cigarettes, and a one-way cellphone. He then recalls his abduction: {{he was trying}} to use his phone after being trapped in a parking garage, and was suddenly attacked by a pig-masked figure. They try to use a cigarette dipped in the corpse's blood, which is in fact cyanide, to stage Adam's death, but the plan fails when Adam is zapped through his ankle chain. Adam then recalls his own abduction: he was in his photo development room when the power went out and, after finding a puppet, was attacked by a similar pig-masked figure. At gunpoint, Alison calls Lawrence and tells him not to trust Adam, who admits that he was being paid to take photos of Lawrence, many of which were in the hacksaw bag. Adam also reveals his knowledge of Lawrence's affair with one of his medical students; Lawrence had been with her before he was abducted. Lawrence realizes from Adam's description that Tapp was paying him. Adam finds a photo that he didn't take, of a man staring <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> of Lawrence's house, whom Lawrence identifies as Zep. Unfortunately, the clock then strikes six as he realizes this.|$|E
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E
