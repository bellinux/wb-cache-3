40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} impregnation of continuous fiber or cloth with thermosetting resin matrix materials. A model is developed to describe the resin, the volatile content and the coated resin thickness as functions of impregnation velocity for a solvent-type, vertical impregnating process. A power law is employed {{to account for the}} effect of shear rate on the resin velocity in the model. Results are obtained methodically through the separation of variables. A dimensionless number, called the impregnation number, is derived which expresses the relative importance among the viscous, inertial and gravity forces in the impregnation process. It is found that the dimensionless number is important in characterizing the maximum possible resin content for a given condition, and that an increase in the resin viscosity is much more effective than an increase in the impregnation velocity in achieving higher resin content. The volatile content is controlled by a combination of the impregnation velocity and the <b>oven</b> <b>length.</b> The predicted volatile contents agree well with the experimental results for a 177 [deg]C prepreg. The model is valid for predicting volatile content in the practical impregnation process...|$|E

50|$|In the US, {{the first}} use of coke in an iron furnace {{occurred}} around 1817 at Isaac Meason's Plumsock puddling furnace and rolling mill in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. In the late 19th century, the coalfields of western Pennsylvania provided {{a rich source of}} raw material for coking. In 1885, the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company constructed the world's longest string of coke ovens in Walston, Pennsylvania, with 475 <b>ovens</b> over a <b>length</b> of 2 km (1.25 miles). Their output reached 22,000 tons per month. The Minersville Coke Ovens in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.|$|R
50|$|The bars {{were formed}} by {{electroplating}} a 97% iron/3% nickel plate onto beryllium-copper wire 10 thousandth {{of an inch}} in diameter (10 mils), coating it in polyurethane, and curing it in an <b>oven.</b> The long <b>length</b> of coated wire is then wound with thin copper ribbon, 10 mil wide and 2.5 mil thick, coated in urethane again, and then cut into 6-inch long bars. Separately, another machine is fed copper wire and periodically creates small coils of ten windings forming a solenoid. The assembly machinery then left a short section of the wire unbent, before winding another solenoid into the wire, and so on. The result is a string of coils on the wire, which from a distance looked {{like a series of}} knots evenly spaced along a rope. A number of these ropes were then laid parallel to each other and a second set of straight wires run parallel to the ropes so they lay under one end of the solenoids. The assembly is then completed by inserting one of the rods though a series of the solenoids and the potting the entire assembly. The result is a single plane of memory, which is then assembled into a larger frame to form a complete memory with multiple bit planes.|$|R
40|$|The corn protein, zein, is a {{byproduct}} of the ethanol production industry. Recently, zein {{has been used in}} the production of films and food packaging due to its biodegradability, low production cost, and abundance of corn in the United States. To improve overall quality of zein films, the mechanical properties and surface properties should be enhanced. Therefore, in this study, our aim is to improve the properties of zein films with glutaraldehyde (GDA) as a crosslinker. Zein was solubilized and mixed with 70 % ethanol and GDA, then sonicated. Solutions were poured onto different surface materials, including polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polystyrene (PS), and glass petri dishes to create films. Cast solutions were placed in the <b>oven</b> for different <b>length</b> of time (i. e. 0 hour, 1 day, 3 day, etc). Water contact angle and FTIR measurements were conducted to understand the crosslinking mechanism of zein films and surface properties of zein to understand how it will perform. Measurements from water contact angle and FTIR showed changes caused by heating, with 6 % GDA films having less increase in hydrophobicity than films with 0 % GDA and the changes in the ratio of -helices and -sheet structures of zein as the duration of heating was increased. Casting zein films on different surfaces affected the hydrophobicity of films that were not heated, but films that were heated for 3 days in the oven did not have any significant differences...|$|R
