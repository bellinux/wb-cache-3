In today's buses there are high demands on packaging in the engine compartment and the <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> is a large component that is normally placed high in the engine room. The aim of the project was to create a requirements definition for the repositioning of the <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> with respect to height, length and lateral movement relative to the engine. The thesis was carried out with calculations of both pressure drops in pipe circuits and static pressure. Different tests have been carried out in a cooling rig and test buses.

40|$|Role of the <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> in a semi-closed {{two-phase}} {{natural circulation}} loop was examined analytically {{with the emphasis}} placed on the flow instability. Loopwise steady circulation rate was obtained, and conditions for flow instability were examined by using the method of the linear stability analysis with perturbations. The homogeneous two-phase model was adopted for the analysis. As well as the pressure at the <b>expansion</b> <b>tank,</b> the length and the cross-sectional area of the tube connected to the <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> {{appeared to be the}} important parameters determining the flow instability. The system was predicted to be stable with the longer length and the smaller cross-sectional area of the expansion-tank line and also with the higher expansion-tank pressure. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.

This now obsolete style would gradually transfer air from the tank to the highest point in the system, due to air dissolving in the water, and then coming out of solution elsewhere in the system.

40|$|<b>Expansion</b> <b>tank</b> is an {{important}} component of all single-phase natural circulation loops. The tank serves the twin purposes of venting the air out during the loop filling and accommodation of the swells and shrinkages of the loop fluid during the transient. In the present study, experimental investigations have been carried out in a rectangular single-phase natural circulation loop to bring out the role of <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> in loop dynamics. The results on loop stability and transient behavior are discussed. The experimental investigations show that there is significant amount of heat exchange between the main loop fluid and the <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> fluid. First, the results of experimental studies are presented. The different flow regimes observed in these experimental investigations are discussed. Next, a model is presented for taking into account the heat exchange between the main loop fluid and the <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> fluid. Finally, the model is applied to simulate the dynamic behavior of different single-phase natural circulation loops. The investigations carried out in this study have helped in resolving the issue of hysteresis observed in these loops. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|O presente estudo teve por objetivo avaliar a evolução da {{microbiota}} do ovo integral líquido (OIL) armazenado em câmaras de resfriamento e tanques de expansão, verificando a eficiência desses métodos de conservação. Foram obtidas 144 amostras, sendo 72 provenientes de três propriedades com armazenamento de OIL em tanques de expansão e 72 de três propriedades com armazenamento de OIL em câmaras de resfriamento. Foi pesquisada a presença de Salmonella spp. e quantificados os micro-organismos aeróbios mesófilos, psicrotróficos, coliformes totais, Escherichia coli e Staphylococcus aureus, acompanhando a evolução desses micro-organismos entre os intervalos de tempo de 0, 24, 48 e 72 horas, sob temperaturas entre 2 º e 5 ºC. Constatou-se que no OIL estudado, tanto as câmaras de resfriamento quanto os tanques de expansão foram eficientes no controle da evolução dos micro-organismos quantificados, exceto no controle dos psicrotróficos. O OIL avaliado revelou grande contaminação advinda do processo de produção e quebra que antecedem a refrigeração. A presença de Salmonella spp. foi constatada em 36 (75 %) das amostras analisadas. Em ambos os tipos de conservação, observou-se contagens iniciais acima dos padrões estabelecidos pela legislação para micro-organismos aeróbios mesófilos, Escherichia coli e Staphylococcus aureus. As contagens de micro-organismos psicrotróficos e colifiormes totais não possuem parâmetros legais, mas, utilizando-se o padrão para aeróbios mesófilos, também foram elevadas. Quando comparado a população microbiana do OIL nos dois tipos de armazenamento, a contaminação total e a de origem fecal foram mais elevadas em câmaras de resfriamento e em tanques de expansão, respectivamente.

It was observed that in the LWE studied, cooling chambers and <b>expansion</b> <b>tanks</b> were effective in controlling the evolution of the quantified microorganisms, except in the growth of psychrotrophs. The LWE evaluated revealed large contamination originating from the production process and egg breaking that precedes refrigeration. The presence of Salmonella spp. was observed in 36 (75 %) of the samples. In both conservation methods, there were initial counts above the limits established for mesophilic aerobes, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The enumeration of psychrotrophs and total coliforms lack legal parameters, but when confronted with the limits established for mesophilic aerobes, were also elevated. When compared the enumeration differences between the microorganisms studied in the LWE from the cooling chambers and <b>expansion</b> <b>tanks,</b> the results showed greater total contamination in the LWE stored in cooling chambers and greater fecal contamination in this product stored in <b>expansion</b> <b>tanks...</b>|$|R
