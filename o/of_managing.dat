40|$|Newer {{technologies}} to treat many mental illnesses have shown substantial heterogeneity in diffusion rates across states. In this paper, I investigate whether {{variation in the}} level <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> care penetration is associated with changes in state-level diffusion of three newer classes of psychotropic medications in fee-for-service Medicaid programs from 1991 - 2005. Three different types <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> care programs are examined: capitated managed care, any type <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> care and behavioral health carve-outs. A fourth order polynomial fixed effect regression model is used to model the diffusion path of newer antidepressant and antipsychotic medications controlling for time-varying state characteristics. Substantial differences {{are found in the}} diffusion paths by the degree <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> care use in each state Medicaid program. The largest effect is seen through spillover effects <b>of</b> capitated <b>managed</b> care programs; states with greater capitated managed care have greater initial shares of newer psychotropic medications. The influence of carve-outs and of all types <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> care combined on the diffusion path was modest...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBees {{have been}} managed and {{utilised}} for honey production for centuries and, more recently, pollination services.

However, the introduction of unnaturally high densities of bees to areas could have adverse effects. Importation and deployment <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> honey bee and bumblebees may be responsible for parasite introductions or a change in the dynamics of native parasites that ultimately increases disease prevalence in wild bees. Here we review the domestication and deployment <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> bees and explain the evidence for the role <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> bees in causing adverse effects on the health of wild bees.

5|$|After {{several years}} of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks.

In addressing the goals, policies, and methods <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> wildlife in the parks, the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire ecology, and other issues, the report suggested that the National Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference.

Even though Congress had done an effective job <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E

40|$|Background: Healthcare quality {{information}} {{is crucial for}} the system <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> competition. Within a system <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> competition, health insurers can selectively contract care providers and are allowed to channel patients towards contracted providers. The idea is that insurers have a stronger bargaining position compared to care providers when {{they are able to}} channel patients. In the Dutch system <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> competition that was implemented in 2006, channelling patients to preferred providers has not yet been very successful. Empirical knowledge of which sources of hospital {{quality information}} they find important may help us to understand how to channel patients to preferred providers. Objectives: The objective of this survey was to measure how patients rank various sources of information when they compare hospital quality in a system <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> competition. Methods: A written survey was conducted among clients of a large Dutch health insurance company. These clients underwent orthopedic surgery on the hip or knee no longer than 12 months ago. Results: Two major players within a system <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> competition—health insurers and the government—were not seen as important sources of hospital quality information. In contrast, own experience and general practitioners (GPs) were seen as the most important sources of hospital quality information within the Dutch system <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> competition. Conclusions: Health insurers should take the main finding—that GPs are the most important source of hospital quality information—into account when they contract care providers and develop strategies for channeling patients towards preferred providers. A well-functioning system <b>of</b> <b>managed</b> competition will benefit patients, as it involves incentives for care providers to increase healthcare quality and to produce at the lowest cost per unit of quality.
