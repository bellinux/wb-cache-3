40|$|This {{paper is}} about CRYPTOGRAPHY – {{the science of}} {{scrambling}} data to make it unintelligible to all, except the intended person, and its various methods in making the work look more perfect. Cyber crimes have become a common piece of vandalism in the present computerized world. What has changed dramatically {{is the ability to}} tamper with information. In a society where information is mostly stored and transmitted in electronic form, what has become an absolute must is a means to ensure information security that is independent of the actual physical medium responsible for generating or storing it. Today, there is an immediate need to delve into the clutter of material. There are many laws in enforcement and many new devices, which are used to prevent such crimes. Nevertheless, these all devices resemble a seismograph, which records the amount of quake but cannot prevent the same. Here comes the discussion on cryptography, which {{plays a major role in}} this field of security of sending messages? CRYPTOGRAPHY: The science of mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security such as encryption [confidentiality] and authentication [data integrity, non-repudiation, entity authentication, and data origin authentication]. Its primary aim is to render a message incomprehensible to any unauthorized reader. The four main objectives of cryptography are… � Confidentiality: To keep information secret from any unauthorized reader/s. � Data Integrity: To ensure that information has not been altered by unauthorized or unknown means. � Non-repudiation: To prevent the denial of previous Commitments or actions. � Authentication Entity Authentication: To validate the identity of the person. � Data <b>Origin</b> (<b>Message)</b> Authentication: To corroborate the source of information. By all these methods, cryptography helps us and thereby making us go into its details. ...|$|E

40|$|We analyze a {{model of}} relay-augmented {{cellular}} wireless networks. The network users, who move according to a general mobility model based on a Poisson point process of continuous trajectories in a bounded domain, try to communicate with a base station located at the <b>origin.</b> <b>Messages</b> can be sent {{either directly or indirectly}} by relaying over a second user. We show that in a scenario of an increasing number of users, the probability that an atypically high number of users experiences bad quality of service over a certain amount of time, decays at an exponential speed. This speed is characterized via a constrained entropy minimization problem. Further, we provide simulation results indicating that solutions of this problem are potentially non-unique due to symmetry breaking. Also two general sources for bad quality of service can be detected, which we refer to as isolation and screening. Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures; corrected several misprint...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We embed an {{operational}} semantics for security protocols in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and derive two strong protocol-independent invariants.

The two rules form {{the core of a}} theory that is well-suited for interactively constructing natural, human-readable, correctness proofs. Moreover, we develop an algorithm that automatically generates proof scripts based on these invariants. Both interactive and automatic proof con-struction are faster than competing approaches. Moreover, we have strong correctness guarantees since all proofs, including those deriving the underlying theory from the semantics, are machine checked.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explored {{the lives of}} 11 Black men to better understand how Black men who were raised in single Black mother homes build romantic relationships with Black women. One focus group {{and a series of}} individual in-person interviews were conducted with the participants who ranged between 23 and 43 years of age. Participants were asked questions that inquired about their family of <b>origin,</b> <b>messages</b> they received about relationships, how they define masculinity, their perceptions of Black women, and their previous and current experiences building romantic relationships. Guided by a narrative approach, several different coding methods were used to help reveal six core themes related to the study. Some of the more significant themes include: 1) conflicted feelings towards their parents and Black women; 2) male mentorship; and 3) masculinity. Because the study was conducted using a non-deficit approach, the findings were analyzed using Helms’ “Black racial identity development model”, critical race theory, and intersectionality; to conceptualize the participants’ experiences though the lens of White privilege, racism, oppression, and racial identity. The study revealed an inequity of empathy among the group of men related to their feelings towards their mothers and fathers. Additionally, then men’s feelings towards their mothers had a larger impact compared to their fathers on their perceptions of Black woman and how they build romantic relationships. This study is significant because it is the first study to simultaneously explore single Black mother homes and Black men and romantic relationships. Additionally, the study is significant because it provides rich insight about this specific topic and other features of the Black experience along with culturally relevant interventions and implications for counselors and counselor educators...|$|R

[...] There are three types of propaganda which differ depending upon their attribution. White propaganda reveals its origin and generally classified as overt. Covert propaganda includes grey propaganda in which the source is not revealed and black propaganda in which a false origin is claimed (the episode at the 1984 Olympics described below {{is an example of}} [...] "black propaganda"). In the later two types of propaganda the <b>message's</b> <b>origin</b> is concealed in some way. Often the credibility of a propaganda message depends on masking the true <b>origin</b> of the <b>message</b> to ensure the audience accepts it as an unbiased communication. Often propagandists will create a persona that is [...] "reliable, trustworthy and credible" [...] to the target audience which increases the likelihood that the message is believed and influences the audience's actions and perspectives. When counterpropaganda reveals the propaganda's true origin the target audience quickly loses faith in the message as the propagandist was caught lying.|$|R

40|$|We embed an untyped {{security}} protocol {{model in the}} interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and derive a theory for constructing proofs of secrecy and authentication properties. Our theory is based on two key ingredients. The first is an inference rule for enumerating the possible <b>origins</b> of <b>messages</b> known to the intruder. The second is a class of protocol-specific invariants that formalize type assertions about variables in protocol specifications. The resulting theory is well suited for interactively constructing human-readable, protocol security proofs. We additionally give an algorithm that automatically generates Isabelle/HOL proof scripts based on this theory. We provide case studies showing that both interactive and automatic proof construction are efficient. The resulting proofs provide strong correctness guarantees since all proofs, including those deriving our theory from the {{security protocol}} model, are machine-checked. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

These methods are particularly efficient but they are, in certain cases, very power-hungry. As energy is a scarce resource in wireless sensor networks, we propose a new approach that consists in utilising the physical properties of the transmission medium in order to calculate, when receiving a frame, a confidence rating that we attribute to the source of the frame. This information is important in order to decide if it is necessary to authenticate the source using asymmetric cryptography. In the case where sensors are static and communications are slightly perturbed by the environment, the proposed rating can add another layer of control which enables sensors to check the <b>origin</b> of <b>messages.</b> This paper will also study how collaboration between the network's nodes further enhances detection of malicious or third-party nodes...|$|R
