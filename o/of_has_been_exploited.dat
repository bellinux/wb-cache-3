Doping is achieved through addition of Be-acetylacetonate into the parent Zn-acetate precursor solution followed by film deposition through spray pyrolysis. The microstructural properties of as-grown Be-ZnO films with different dopant concentrations are investigated {{using a combination of}} atomic force microscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques, which show the formation of polycrystalline films. Introduction of Be is found to impact the degree of crystallinity of ZnO films where a dramatic decrease in the average grain size is observed with increasing Be concentration. To assess the effects of Be-doping on the electrical properties of ZnO films we have fabricated Be-ZnO based TFTs using different doping concentrations. The average electron mobility calculated from these transistors is on the order of ~ 2 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 with the threshold voltage (VTH) exhibiting a strong dependence on Be concentration.
