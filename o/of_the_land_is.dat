5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents {{in the early twentieth}} century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> now urbanised or designated parkland, leaving little room for further expansion.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Dakota, New Jersey, and Rhode Island (although Kansas and North Dakota have {{national}} grasslands). In addition, Puerto Rico contains El Yunque National Forest. Alaska has {{the most}} national forest land with 21.9 million acres (8.9 million ha), followed by California (20.8 million acres, 8.4 million ha) and Idaho (20.4 million acres, 8.3 million ha). Idaho also has the greatest percent of its land in national forests with 38.2%, followed by Oregon with 24.7% and Colorado with 20.9%. On maps, national forests in the west generally show the true extent of their area, but those in the east often only show purchase districts, within which usually only a minority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> owned by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|Landslides {{encompass}} smaller areas, develop on {{the steep}} cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly {{located in the}} artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardoš, Ćukovac and Kalvarija. However, {{the majority of the}} land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighborhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighborhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> today completely halted.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{watershed}} of Little Fishing Creek upstream {{of the stream}} gauge on it is forest. There is also agricultural land, especially in the northwestern and southern parts of {{the watershed}} and small areas of developed land in the watershed's southern section. 64.5 {{percent of the land}} in the watershed upstream of Eyers Grove is forested land and 34.7 percent is agricultural land. 0.7 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> developed and the remaining 0.2 percent has other uses.|$|E

5|$|The island's {{population}} was recorded as 192 at the 2011 census, {{an increase of}} over 30% since 2001. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The majority of the resident working population are engaged in farming or fishing, and sheep raised on the island {{have a reputation for}} quality. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> owned by the Duke of Argyll, with the farmers being tenants.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend towards}} more {{intensive}} farming {{began to be}} partially reversed {{by the end of}} the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{important}} prehistoric structures, {{many of which}} pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors. The Western Isles {{became part of the}} Norse kingdom of the , which lasted for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs, principal of whom were the MacLeods, MacDonalds, Mackenzies and MacNeils. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> now under local control and commercial activity is based on tourism, crofting, fishing, and weaving.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Brightwood School was {{a two-story}} brick building built around 1897 at Brightwood Avenue (now Georgia Avenue) and Peabody Street. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> acquired from <b>the</b> Emory Chapel, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> condemned from numerous heirs of Betsy Butler. Only white students {{were allowed to}} attend the school. Other children attended the Military Road School nearby.|$|R
50|$|Sale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{responsibility}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> Board.

5|$|Tripura is an agrarian {{state with}} {{more than half of the}} {{population}} dependent on agriculture and allied activities. However, due to hilly terrain and forest cover, only 27 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> available for cultivation. Rice, the major crop of the state, is cultivated in 91 per cent of the cropped area. According to the Directorate of Economics & Statistics, Government of Tripura, in 2009–10, potato, sugarcane, mesta, pulses and jute were the other major crops cultivated in the state. Jackfruit and pineapple top the list of horticultural products. Traditionally, most of the indigenous population practised jhum method (a type of slash-and-burn) of cultivation. The number of people dependent on jhum has declined over the years.|$|E
5|$|Soul Reaver {{takes place}} within the fictional world of Nosgoth, where the health <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> tied to the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, and each pillar in turn is {{represented}} by a guardian. Before the events of Soul Reaver, the guardians became corrupt, and, after Kain killed eight of them, he discovered he was the final one. Refusing to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars, he doomed Nosgoth to eternal decay and proceeded to raise his vampire lieutenants, including Raziel, to besiege the land. By the time of Soul Reavers introduction, the vampires are now the land's dominant species and apex predators, the humans have been decimated, and the vampire tribes have each claimed a region of Nosgoth and {{turned their attention to}} internal matters. Unknown to the vampires, beneath Nosgoth lurks The Elder God, an ancient and powerful entity. The Elder God controls the Wheel of Fate, a cycle of reincarnation of souls that circle the Wheel in a loop of predestination; however, because vampires are immortal, their souls do not spin with the Wheel, causing the land to decay as the Wheel stalls. By the time that Raziel is revived centuries after the game's opening cinematic, Nosgoth is on the brink of collapse, little more than a wasteland wracked with cataclysms and earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> {{significantly}} affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale, {{the distribution of}} gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic plates as well as influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth (gravitropism), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the biomechanics and size of animals. Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves. The cardiovascular systems of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).|$|E

5|$|Finance chair Walter M. Gibson, {{supported}} by Minister of the Interior Samuel G. Wilder, pushed a new currency law through the 1880 legislature. It allowed the kingdom to purchase {{gold and silver}} bullion to be struck into new Hawaiian coins. Having the kingdom issue its own coins was one {{means by which the}} government hoped to improve Native Hawaiian morale, as their numbers and their influence had both been declining over the previous few decades. The king became more interested in coinage bearing his likeness during his world tour of 1881. During this journey, he was contacted by the owner of a New Caledonia nickel mining company hoping to use the metal in coinage, and sample five-cent pieces were sent to the king after his return to Honolulu. They found little favor, possibly because Hawaii's motto was misspelled. No action was taken until 1882, when the king appointed Gibson to lead the government. He moved forward with the coin idea; the currency was to have the king's image on the obverse side, and Hawaii's coat of arms and motto Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono (The Life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>is</b> Perpetuated in Righteousness) on the reverse. The 1880 law specified that the silver coins were to be in denominations of one dollar, fifty cents, twenty-five cents, and twelve and one-half cents. Twelve and one-half cents, or one bit (one Spanish colonial real) was sometimes the day's pay for a laborer.|$|E
