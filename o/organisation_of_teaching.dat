40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential for}} using learning objects and Learning Design as vehicles for staff development in UK Higher Education (HE). To support this approach we propose using Ramsden’s (1991) three theoretical models of teaching in HE to provide a conceptual framework to situate these technologies in. We observe that the introduction of these technologies into HE reveal and highlight underlying obstacles to their adoption by reifying existing pedagogic practice and values. We map these obstacles onto Ramsden’s theoretical framework and propose in outline a staff development strategy to help remedy them. This implies a change both in the institutional and professional <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> activity in HE, we conclude by presenting in outline the kind of changes required which also provide us with an indicator of areas for further investigation...|$|E

A simple method was devised to evaluate {{one section of the}} fetal heart systematically. Examination of this section, the four chamber view, may readily be incorporated into routine obstetric screening. Severe cardiac abnormalities detectable in this view occur in two per 1000 pregnancies. For six years the department of paediatric cardiology at Guy's Hospital, London, served as a referral centre for fetal echocardiography. As teaching became more widespread an increasing proportion of cases of cardiac anomaly were referred because the obstetrician suspected abnormality on examination of the four chamber view.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine how the use of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT) impacted on the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning in the courses developed by the Swiss Virtual Campus programme (SVC; www. virtualcampus. ch’). We will present the results of a series of interviews with the SVC projects which show that the majority of the projects adopted an hybrid approach, integrating presence activities with ICT-. supported distance activities. ELeurning is then mostly used as a support to presence teaching, enriching it or even substituting it for some modules of the course, but presence teaching (especially face-to-jace lectures) still plays a central role. In our view, these results show how the institutional and organisational structure of eLearning programmes largely determines the model of adoption of ICT, as well as their impact on teaching and learning. 1...|$|E

In this situation the need for planning and planning instruments arises. This paper gives {{a brief description of}} the planning model now used within the University of Utrecht. This planning model has a marked preference for the teaching process and does not determine independently the need and the consequent resources required with regard to the other tasks of the University. To describe the teaching programmes the method of curriculum-outlines is developed. A curriculum-outline is a representation <b>of</b> a <b>teaching</b> programme or a part of it, which enables us both to compare the <b>organisations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>teaching</b> programmes <b>of</b> the various fields of study and to determine the <b>teaching</b> load <b>of</b> the academic staff.

40|$|The {{practices}} of students, teachers, educational policymakers and managers are laden with assumptions {{of fact and}} value. Clearly, assumptions of value influence {{the way in which}} individuals and groups construe the nature and purpose of education, but this should not blind us to the existence of assumptions of fact about how to promote learning and improve the conduct and <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching.</b> Many of these assumptions of fact may be false or inadequate, and may therefore limit the success of our educational endeavours. Using the UK's national literacy strategy as its principal illustration, this paper shows how a Popperian approach to science can advance our knowledge of what is the case about learning, teaching, and the organisation and conduct of formal education, and how such a non-positivist science can contribute to the improvement of educational practice...|$|E
40|$|According to our experience, didactics as {{integration}} of method, subject (syllabi or curricula), and <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> {{on the one}} hand and of theory of education and formation (Bildung) on the other hand is most likely to succeed by concentrating on the composition of Lehrstücke in a case-work manner, which mean not only construction but also composition of the regular teaching units of 10 - 25 lessons. These regular teaching units are usually thematically, methodologically, and organisationally coherent and now they are developed and composed in three plus one steps: Firstly, the Lehrkunstdidaktik selects only teaching units concerning culturally and educationally as well as personally central subjects, i. e. epochally important humane subjects. Secondly, the Lehrkunstdidaktik composes these teaching units according to, what Lehrkunst calls, the "triad of exemplary-genetical-dramaturgical method". Thirdly, the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> orients itself towards culturally authentic learning places, learning times and learning forms. Finally fourthly: all subjects, methods and organisations of teaching have to account for the claims of the theory of education and formation (Bildung). Thus they have to stand the question whether such a teaching unit really has succeeded in combining the free development of the personality with a deep understanding of the world. Only then the teaching unit has become a Lehrstück. In the designing of teaching units to Lehrstücke more than thirty Lehrstücke have arisen on the traces of Wagenschein within the last twenty years. In this process the working manner of the Kollegiale Lehrkunstwerkstatt, a collegial working group of teachers, has proven fine. The same goes for the compositional product of casuistic, enlightened subjective teaching reports, nearly "novels of education" as well as for an overall orientation of didactics not only to the sciences, but also to the arts, thus Lehrkunstdidaktik. In a lexicon of theatre plays there are many hundred works described; we are dreaming of a little lexicon of Lehrstücke. Lately the perspective has arisen that the teaching of Lehrstücke, Lehrstückunterricht, can offer a contribution to the educational teaching development...|$|E

40|$|Continuing policy {{initiatives}} at both National and European levels emphasise {{the need to}} increase participation in higher education (HE) through more flexible delivery.

The analysis of documents has shown that the attribution of time value to these categories, generally left to HEIs, can significantly affect an individual 2 ̆ 7 s workload and has financial implications on the level of HEIs.

For this purpose, <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> activities, available information, teaching materials, and other facilities offered to students to make their learning experience more successful, are considered as indicators of teaching efficiency.

A structural equation model with latent variables is estimated by using survey and administrative data of the University of Pisa.
