5|$|In 2002, Holly turned heel on SmackDown! {{and began}} a short feud with Randy Orton. Holly {{suffered}} a broken neck during a 2002 match against Brock Lesnar, when he was powerbombed neck first <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mat.</b> He had a thirteen-month hiatus from wrestling after surgery.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{emerged in}} the New Zealand wrestling {{industry}} during May 2006 in Wellington, when Rip Morgan split from Stirling's company and Kiwi Pro Wrestling was established, {{made up of a}} number of Stirling's former stars. These new promotions also brought back televised wrestling, which had been absent since the days of Rickard's <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mat,</b> with the debut of IPW Ignition and KPW's Off the Ropes.|$|E
5|$|E. Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian was {{originally}} awarded {{a bronze medal}} in the Greco-Roman 84 kg event. However, at the medal ceremony he walked off the podium and dropped his medal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> in protest of the judging in his event. On August 16, 2008, the International Olympic Committee decided to strip him of his medal because they felt it amounted to a political demonstration and was disrespectful to other athletes.|$|E
60|$|As {{they left}} the compound, Peter Gee nudged Grief to look where Tui Tulifau {{reclined}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mats.</b> <b>The</b> supercargo's shirt, stretched and bulged, already encased the royal fat.|$|R

5|$|The last quarterfinal match {{featured}} A.J. Styles and Super Eric against Awesome Kong and B.G. James. Super Eric {{picked up}} Kong and slammed her into B.G., who was {{laying on the}} ring mat. Later, Styles attempted to perform a move by jumping off the ropes, but legitimately tripped, falling face-first <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mat.</b> Then B.G. lifted Styles to perform a suplex, which Styles countered into a small package pin attempt, resulting in a victory at five minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E
5|$|Though the retirements of O'Connor and Garea left a void, talents such as Ox Baker, Tor Kamata, Al Perez, Rip Morgan, Samoan Joe, Johnny Garcia, Bruno Bekkar and A.J. Freely {{remained}} in New Zealand during the 1980s and early 1990s. Likewise, wrestlers from the World Wrestling Federation often toured New Zealand and Australia such as The Bushwhackers (formerly The Sheepherders) and Lanny Poffo. These stars {{continued to be}} seen in New Zealand via <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mat</b> until the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

5|$|André faced Hogan for {{the title}} on the February 5, 1988 {{broadcast}} of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee. André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's shoulders were not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> when the referee made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match, ran to the ring to attack the impostor referee. Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor {{out of the ring}} onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner. In reality, the second referee was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who was making his on-screen debut with the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Michaels {{then began}} a rivalry with Chris Jericho, after Jericho {{claimed that he}} was the next Shawn Michaels. On January 13, 2003, after Jericho won a battle royal to select his entry number for the Royal Rumble, {{choosing}} number two in order to start the match with Michaels, who had already been named number one. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho, with the help of Christian, eliminated Michaels. Michaels defeated Jericho at WrestleMania XIX. Despite this, Michaels was low-blowed after hugging with Chris Jericho. On the final episode of Raw of 2003, Michaels would defeat Triple H after a Sweet Chin Music for the World Heavyweight title in his hometown of San Antonio, Texas with Eric Bischoff as the special guest referee (Earl Hebner originally refereed the match, only to be knocked out by Triple H {{in the middle of the}} match). However, Bischoff reversed the decision due to both men's shoulders being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mat.</b> Angered by this, Michaels attacked Ric Flair and Bischoff. Because of Michaels putting his hands on Bischoff, Bischoff then fired him. However, Michaels would be rehired by Steve Austin.|$|E
5|$|On the November 29 {{episode of}} Raw, both Edge and Benoit competed {{in a number}} one contender's battle royal, but they {{eliminated}} each other simultaneously {{at the conclusion of}} the match, resulting in a draw. As a result, Triple H was forced to defend the title in a triple threat match. In the match, Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface on Edge, who shifted his weight putting Benoit's shoulders <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> for a pin. This match also ended in a draw for Benoit and Edge, as Benoit made Edge submit at the same time the referee counted a pinfall for Edge. As a result, the World Heavyweight title was vacated the following week on Raw. In January 2005, Edge competed in his first Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Shawn Michaels (acting as special guest referee) performed a superkick on Edge, in retaliation for an accidental spear by Edge, causing Edge to be the first eliminated. This led to a match at the Royal Rumble later in the month, in which Edge defeated Michaels.|$|E

50|$|With yoga's {{introduction}} in the West, many practitioners used towels or cotton mats {{on wooden}} floors. Rubber mats were introduced {{as an intermediate}} material to prevent cotton mats from slipping on wooden floors.

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in an Ultimate X match, which {{involved}} A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin, and the champion, Petey Williams, who {{was accompanied by}} Coach D'Amore. D'Amore was banned from ringside in the opening minutes of the contest. Styles at one point was climbing across the cables to retrieve the championship, when Sabin springboarded off the far top rope and performed a dropkick in mid-air to Styles. This caused Styles to perform a front-flip in mid-air and land {{on his back in}} the center of the ring. The finish of the match saw Williams and Sabin both hanging on the ropes, each holding one end of the belt. Styles then springboarded off the far top rope and grabbed the belt in mid-flight. After he landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mat,</b> he was declared the official winner.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, Rickard and Australian wrestling {{promoter}} Jim Barnett {{managed to}} attract foreign stars back to the Pacific. American wrestlers frequently toured New Zealand as well and were well received by the public. In 1972, Big Bad John, Bulldog Brower, Les Wolff, King Curtis Iaukea, Spiros Arion, Mark Lewin, Thunderbolt Patterson, Sweet Daddy Siki, Tarzan Tyler, Dewey Robertson and Haystacks Calhoun all toured New Zealand. Calhoun and his wife in particular made numerous television appearances, press interviews and visited schools. The debut of Rickard's <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mat</b> during this period, a counterpart of Britain's World of Sport, replaced the once popular radio broadcasts and showcased many New Zealand and international stars including Pat Barrett, The Destroyer, Man Mountain Link, Les Thornton, Leo Burke, Ripper Collins, Rick Martel, Tiger Jeet Singh, Ali Vizeri, Abdullah the Butcher, and Siva Afi. Afi's tournament victory over John DaSilva in 1978 marked the first time a Samoan wrestler won a New Zealand championship on New Zealand television, and the first to hold the national title since 1964; An official member of the NWA since 1972, the NWA World title was also defended in Rickard's promotion. Peter Maivia nearly won the NWA World title from then-champion Harley Race in 1979. This title changed hands between Ric Flair and Harley Race in Wellington, New Zealand and Geylang, Singapore in 1984 but these would not be acknowledged by the NWA for several years.|$|E

25|$|The poor New Zealand economy, {{as well as}} {{the decline}} of the NWA {{in the face of the}} {{national}} expansion of the World Wrestling Federation, made importing foreign wrestlers extremely difficult and finally Rickard could no longer afford to produce the show and was forced to cancel <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mat</b> by 1984.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> carrick <b>mat</b> is a flat woven {{decorative}} knot {{which can}} be used as a mat or pad. Its name is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mat's</b> decorative-type carrick bend with the ends connected together, forming an endless knot. A larger form, called the prolong knot, is made by expanding <b>the</b> basic carrick <b>mat</b> by extending, twisting, and overlapping its outer bights, then weaving the free ends through them. This process may be repeated to produce an arbitrarily long mat.|$|R
