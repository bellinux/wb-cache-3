40|$|The {{full-flow}} mechanical safeguard device (FFMSGD) {{has been}} developed under contract to the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) to address problems with the reliability of ceramic candle filter elements installed on high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) Hot Gas Cleanup (HGCU) filters. Although systems candle filters are expected to perform satisfactorily when in good operating condition, the failure of even a single filter element can increase the filter system <b>outlet</b> <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> enough to potentially damage gas turbine blades, contaminate other downstream processes, and limit {{the availability of the}} power system. Filter failure safeguard devices that are installed on each individual candle filter element are envisioned as a guarantee of a candle filter system's ability to withstand some number of element failures and continue operation without these negative consequences. The intention of the FFMSGD is to provide this guarantee without incurring any significant pressure drop penalty or constraining the filter system's reverse-pulse cleaning procedures. The FFMSGD provides a clear flow path for filtered and reverse-flow cleaning gases when its filter element is intact, and activates to provide a positive mechanical seal against gas flow in either direction when its filter element breaks or fails. This activation is induced by the increase in the flow rate of gas through the device in event of filter failure. The FFMSGD is designed to be easily removed and reconditioned when the filter system is taken off line for routine maintenance. This report is intended to be issued with a companion appendix. As instructed in Section J. 12 of Contract No. DE-AC 26 - 99 FT 40678, all the restricted, proprietary, and patentable information (not yet disclosed through the patent application process) related to the FFMSGD and its evaluation under this contract has been included only in the appendix. This Final Report, which is available to the public, contains background information and general descriptions of the operating principles of the FFMSGD. This report also describes the results of various evaluations of the device at room temperature and in HTHP environments. This Final Report also includes discussions of commercialization issues. For clarity and completeness, all of the information contained in this Final Report has also been included in the appendix...|$|E

30|$|From Figure 2, it {{was shown}} that while Johor, Pahang, Perak, Sabah and Sarawak are among the states that have the most {{quantities}} of mills, Sabah has the highest <b>dust</b> <b>load</b> among all states, which has a potential {{impact on the environment}} if not handled well. Due to the high processing rate of FFB, it is expected that more biomass fuel will be burned in boilers, thus resulting in higher <b>dust</b> <b>load</b> if compared with other states. The average <b>dust</b> <b>load</b> of 51.67 g/s from Tables 4 and 5 quantified the pollution source of a palm oil mill in 2009. Since there is no record of dust collector efficiency from palm oil mills in Malaysia, the average <b>dust</b> <b>load</b> can be used to estimate the overall emission from a range of dust collector efficiency. However, there is no limit stipulated by the Malaysia Environmental Quality Act 1974 for <b>dust</b> <b>load,</b> as a bigger mill definitely has higher <b>dust</b> <b>load.</b> Therefore, <b>dust</b> concentration is universally used as standard limit, although information of <b>dust</b> <b>load</b> is useful to track dust volume that has been released to the environment within a certain period of time, regardless of the size of a mill. Considering a case of two palm oil mills, 100 tonnes/h and the other is 50 tonnes/h, both emitting 0.4 g/Nm 3, they fall within the limit of the standard. However, <b>dust</b> <b>load</b> for the 100 tonnes/h mill (approximately 120 g/s) is double the <b>dust</b> <b>load</b> of 50 tonnes/h (approximately 60 g/s). This simply explains the pollution situation in a more direct way when compared to dust concentration.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a radiative transfer model which allows the effects of atmospheric <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> on surface albedo to be investigated. This model incorporates atmospheric dust opacity, the single scattering albedo and particle phase function of atmospheric dust, the bidirectional reflectance of the surface, and variable lighting and viewing geometry. The most recent dust particle properties are utilized. The spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric opacity (Tan) strongly influences the radiative transfer modelling results. We are currently using the approach described to determine Tan for IRTM mapping sequences of selected regions. This approach allows Tan to be determined at the highest spatial and temporal resolution supported by the IRTM data. Applying the radiative transfer modelling and determination of Tan described, IRTM visual brightness observations can be corrected {{for the effects of}} atmospheric <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> a variety of locations and times. This approach allows maps of 'dust-corrected surface albedo' to be constructed for selected regions. Information on the variability of surface albedo and the amount of dust deposition/erosion related to such variability results. To date, this study indicates that atmospheric <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> has a significant effect on observations of surface albedo, amounting to albedo corrections of as much as several tens of percent. This correction is not constant or linear, but depends upon surface albedo, viewing and lighting geometry, the dust and surface phase functions, and the atmospheric opacity. It is clear that the quantitative study of surface albedo, especially where small variations in observed albedo are important (such as photometric analyses), needs to account for the effects of the atmospheric <b>dust</b> <b>loading.</b> Maps of 'dust-corrected surface albedo' will be presented for a number of regions...|$|R

40|$|Natural mineral aerosol (dust) is {{an active}} {{component}} of the climate system and plays multiple roles in mediating physical and biogeochemical exchanges between the atmosphere, land surface and ocean. Changes {{in the amount of}} dust in the atmosphere are caused both by changes in climate (precipitation, wind strength, regional moisture balance) and changes in the extent of dust sources caused by either anthropogenic or climatically induced changes in vegetation cover. Models of the global dust cycle take into account the physical controls on dust deflation from prescribed source areas (based largely on soil wetness and vegetation cover thresholds), dust transport within the atmospheric column, and dust deposition through sedimentation and scavenging by precipitation. These models successfully reproduce the first-order spatial and temporal patterns in atmospheric <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> under modem conditions. Atmospheric <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> was as much as an order-of-magnitude larger than today during the last glacial maximum (LGM). While the observed increase in emissions from northern Africa can be explained solely in terms of climate changes (colder, drier and windier glacial climates), increased emissions from other regions appear to have been largely a response to climatically induced changes in vegetation cover and hence in the extent of dust source areas. Model experiments suggest that the increased <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> in tropical regions had an effect on radiative forcing comparable to that of low glacial CO 2 levels. Changes in land-use are already increasing the <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> of the atmosphere. However, simulations show that anthropogenically forced climate changes substantially reduce the extent and productivity of natural dust sources. Positive feedbacks initiated by a reduction of dust emissions from natural source areas on both radiative forcing and atmospheric CO 2 could substantially mitigate the impacts of land-use changes, and need to be considered in climate change assessments.

40|$|The dust {{cycle is}} an {{important}} component of Mars' current climate system. Airborne dust affects the radiative balance of the atmosphere, thus greatly influencing the thermal and dynamical state of the atmosphere. Dust raising events on Mars occur at spatial scales ranging from meters to planet-wide. Although the occurrence and season of large regional and global dust storms are highly variable from one year to the next, there are many features of the dust cycle that occur year after year. Generally, a low-level dust haze is maintained during northern spring and summer, while elevated levels of atmospheric dust occur during northern autumn and winter. During years without global-scale dust storms, two peaks in total <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> were observed by MGS/TES: one peak occurred before northern winter solstice at Ls 200 - 240, and one peak occurred after northern winter solstice at L(sub s) 305 - 340. These maxima in <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> are thought to be associated with transient eddy activity in the northern hemisphere, which has been observed to maximize pre- and post-solstice. Interactive dust cycle studies with Mars General Circulation Models (MGCMs) have included the lifting, transport, and sedimentation of radiatively active dust. Although the predicted global dust loadings from these simulations capture some aspects of the observed dust cycle, there are marked differences between the simulated and observed dust cycles. Most notably, the maximum <b>dust</b> <b>loading</b> is robustly predicted by models to occur near northern winter solstice and is due to dust lifting associated with down slope flows on the flanks of the Hellas basin. Thus far, models have had difficulty simulating the observed pre- and post- solstice peaks in <b>dust</b> <b>loading.</b> Interactive <b>dust</b> cycle studies typically have not included the formation of water ice clouds or their radiative effects. Water ice clouds can influence the dust cycle by scavenging dust from atmosphere and by interacting with solar and infrared radiation, thereby modifying the thermal structure of the atmosphere and its circulation.
