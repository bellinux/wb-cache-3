5000|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for some Earthlings and inhabitants of the Cités <b>obscures</b> to actually come across each other (among the most notable of these travelers may be noted Jules Verne, a recurring personage in the series). On websites such as Web of the <b>Obscure</b> Cities (which is no longer online but is documented on AltaPlana.be, an online encyclopaedia for <b>Obscure</b> Cities) and Office of the <b>Obscure</b> Passages, Schuiten and Peeters present alleged reports, often illustrated with photos and drawings, from people that shortly crossed over into the world of the <b>Obscure</b> Cities via <b>Obscure</b> Passages by accident, and by so-called Obscurantists who have been seeking for <b>Obscure</b> Passages for years (compare Obscurantist, a term based upon the Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum, aka [...] "Letters of <b>Obscure</b> Men"). These reports on the internet correspond to the pseudorealism of Schuiten and Peeters when enclosing [...] "authentic" [...] documentary or amateur CDs (Le Musée A. Desombres, 1990) or DVDs (Laffaire Desombres, 2002) to their print publications regarding the <b>Obscure</b> Cities.|$|R
5|$|Following {{a report}} by George Ivatt in 1945, smoke {{deflectors}} were introduced due to drifting smoke <b>obscuring</b> the crew's forward vision. The first locomotive to be fitted with smoke deflectors from the outset was No. 6253 City of St. Albans in September 1946. All the following four locomotives included this feature. The first unstreamlined locomotive to be retrofitted was No. 6232 Duchess of Montrose in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|Restricted driver {{visibility}} {{due to the}} air-smoothed casing {{and soft}} steam exhaust from the multiple-jet blastpipe.

5|$|The {{floor of}} the barn was {{originally}} made of hard-packed flint gravel held together with iron panning, excavated from a local gravel deposit, which {{was used as a}} more readily available alternative to stone.

5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, <b>obscuring</b> the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E
5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover <b>obscuring</b> any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Urbicande.be, the {{official}} website of the <b>Obscure</b> Cities went online where Schuiten and Peeters encouraged their fans all over Europe {{to send in}} their own ideas regarding the <b>Obscure</b> Cities and accounts of their own experiences in search for <b>Obscure</b> Passages. The response was so overwhelming that Schuiten and Peeters were able to expand their online activities into a complex network of in-universe sites, mainly branching from the URL ebbs.net of their official <b>Obscure</b> magazine called Obskür, where many amateur reports, illustrated by photos and Schuiten's drawings, and various mysterious <b>Obscure</b> artifacts can be found. Along with these, a number of conspiracy theories are explored, regarding authorities of our world intending {{to prevent the spread}} of knowledge regarding the parallel world and destroy various <b>Obscure</b> Passages. In May 2015, Urbicande.be was taken offline and archived at AltaPlana.be, an official online encyclopaedia of the <b>Obscure</b> Cities universe.|$|R

5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence <b>obscuring</b> {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|After {{exceeding}} the original departure time limit by a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous {{had resulted in}} clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned coal tar, to produce black smoke. The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, <b>obscuring</b> the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By {{the time of the}} third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside {{on into the}} channel mouth, but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially <b>obscuring</b> the entranceway.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane <b>obscuring</b> our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005.

At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, <b>obscuring</b> the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2001, in The New York Times 150th anniversary issue, former {{executive}} editor Max Frankel wrote that {{before and during}} World War II, the NY Times had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on the Holocaust in their news pages. Laurel Leff, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the Third Reich targeting of Jews for genocide. Her 2005 book Buried by the Times documents the paper's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while <b>obscuring</b> in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth {{in part to the}} complex personal and political views of the newspaper's Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, concerning Jewishness, antisemitism, and Zionism.|$|E

5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam <b>obscuring</b> the driver's vision of the line.|$|E

5|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment are important {{in the care of}} TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. Bronchoscopy is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it is usually the only method that allows a definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, is the fastest and most reliable technique. In people with TBI, bronchoscopy may reveal that the airway is torn, or that the airways are blocked by blood, or that a bronchus has collapsed, <b>obscuring</b> more distal (lower) bronchi from view.|$|E
