5|$|Aidoo was {{designated}} as the backup running back out of training camp in 2005, with the Tiger-Cats electing to keep only the trio of Troy Davis, Aidoo, and fullback Julian Radlein on the roster as running backs. In August, Aidoo briefly stepped in for Davis after the latter suffered an injured hamstring. Through the first 11 regular season games, Aidoo made two special teams tackles and rushed for 51 yards on six carries. This led The Hamilton Spectator to speculate he would be dropped from the active roster in favor <b>of</b> <b>recently</b> signed running back Jesse Lumsden. After Troy {{was traded to the}} Eskimos, this never came to pass, and Aidoo started as a fullback for the last few games of the season. The Tiger-Cats did not make the playoffs. Aidoo finished the season with five special teams tackles and 116 rushing yards from 18 carries.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Marge wake on New Year's Day with hangovers {{after the}} family's New Year's Eve celebration.

Taking Moe's suggestion that he bribe a city official to clear up the fines, Homer leaves a sack full of cash on the official's desk but is promptly arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Wiggum takes pity on Homer and tells him to meet with an FBI agent, who offers to reduce the sentence if Homer will go undercover in the prison to investigate Fat Tony, who is also serving time along with his top henchmen.|$|E

5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation <b>of</b> <b>recently</b> ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
5|$|Rupert's naval {{campaign}} formed two phases. The first involved the Royalist fleet sailing from Kinsale in Ireland to Lisbon in Portugal. He took three large ships, , the Convertine and the Swallow, accompanied by four smaller vessels. Rupert sailed to Lisbon taking several prizes on route, {{where he received}} a warm welcome from King John IV, the ruler <b>of</b> <b>recently</b> independent Portugal, who was a supporter of Charles II. Blake arrived shortly afterwards with a Parliamentary fleet, and an armed stand-off ensued. Tensions rose, skirmishes began to break out and King John became increasingly keen for his Royalist guests to leave. In October 1650, Rupert's fleet, now comprising six vessels, broke out and headed into the Mediterranean. Still pursued by Blake, the Royalist fleet manoeuvred up the Spanish coast, steadily losing vessels to their pursuers.|$|E
5|$|The Runcorn area drains {{into the}} River Mersey {{to the north}} and the River Weaver to the south. The bedrock of the western and northeastern parts of the town is made up of rock from the Sherwood {{sandstone}} group; in the other areas the bedrock is from the Mercia mudstone group. In places there are prominent outcrops of sandstone, particularly at Runcorn Hill and Halton Hill. Elsewhere the bedrock is covered by drift. At the northwestern periphery of the town the drift consists <b>of</b> <b>recently</b> blown sand. Farther to the east and bordering the River Mersey is recent alluvium. Elsewhere the drift consists of till.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} its new aircraft, {{the squadron}} was tasked with anti-shipping attacks, and it and No.100 Squadron cooperated {{in an attack}} on a Japanese convoy near Cape St. George on the night of 20 October during which a No.6 Squadron pilot claimed to have damaged a cruiser. No.6 Squadron also bombed Japanese positions in New Britain during October in conjunction with No.100 Squadron. In addition to these offensive operations, the squadron regularly flew anti-submarine patrols to protect Allied shipping. In November the squadron moved to Goodenough Island and became part of No. 71 Wing RAAF alongside No.8 and No.100 Squadrons. From November 1943 to March 1944, No.6 Squadron took part in attacks on the major Japanese base at Rabaul, and also struck other targets in the region to support the naval and ground forces engaged in the New Britain Campaign. From March the squadron mainly undertook convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols, which proved uneventful. No.6 Squadron's operations were hampered by mechanical problems with its Beauforts, which had been issued to the unit after being reconditioned following service with other RAAF squadrons, and this problem continued until October when it received an allocation <b>of</b> <b>recently</b> built aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the worst, the Romans began a major mobilization, all but {{pulling out}} <b>of</b> <b>recently</b> pacified Spain and Gaul. They even {{established}} a major garrison in Sicily {{in case the}} Seleucids ever got to Italy. This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome {{in the years after}} the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again {{for the first time since}} that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier). Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont, which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia. The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of Magnesia, resulting in a complete Roman victory. The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests. Although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the Parthians) and the west (the Greeks). Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by Pontus. Following Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{victory at}} the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 {{proved to be a}} major local set back for the Viet Cong, indefinitely forestalling an {{imminent}} movement against the Australian base at Nui Dat and challenging their previous domination of Phuoc Tuy province. In the months that followed the two infantry battalions of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5 RAR) and 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR)—had conducted a number of search and destroy, village cordon and search, and route security operations in an attempt to further extend their control, and to separate the local people from the influence of the Viet Cong. Such operations usually resulted in contacts between the Australians and small groups of Viet Cong, while during cordon and search operations of Binh Ba and Hoa Long a number of villagers suspected of sympathising with the communists were apprehended and handed over to the South Vietnamese authorities. Several search operations were also conducted by the Australians in areas suspected of containing Viet Cong base camps, and these often resulted in the discovery <b>of</b> <b>recently</b> used and quickly evacuated camps, hospitals and logistic bases which had then been destroyed. Meanwhile, both battalions had also continued an extensive patrolling and ambushing program around the task force base at Nui Dat.|$|E

Kennedy. In the film, she turns to kidnapping models and forcing them to eat their own makeup. Divine kept his involvement with Waters and these early underground films a secret from his conservative parents, believing {{that they would not}} understand them or the reason for his involvement in such controversial and bad-taste films; they would not find out about them for many years. Divine's parents had bought him his own beauty shop in Towson, hoping that the financial responsibility would help him to settle down in life and stop spending so extravagantly. While agreeing to work there, he refused to be involved in owning and managing the establishment, leaving that to his mother. Not long after, in the summer of 1968, he moved out of his parental home, renting his own apartment.|$|E
