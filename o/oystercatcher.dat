5|$|As an {{isolated}} island on major migration routes, Lundy has a rich bird life {{and is a}} popular site for birdwatching. Large numbers of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) nest on the cliffs, as do razorbill (Alca torda), guillemot (Uria aalge), herring gull (Larus argentatus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), <b>oystercatcher</b> (Haematopus ostralegus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), common blackbird (Turdus merula), robin (Erithacus rubecula) and linnet (Carduelis cannabina). There are also smaller populations of peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and raven (Corvus corax).|$|E
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian <b>oystercatcher</b> and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian <b>oystercatcher</b> (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E
50|$|The diet of <b>oystercatchers</b> {{varies with}} location. Species {{occurring}} inland feed upon earthworms and insect larvae. The diet of coastal <b>oystercatchers</b> is more varied, although dependent upon coast type; on estuaries bivalves, gastropods and polychaete worms {{are the most}} important part of the diet, whereas rocky shore <b>oystercatchers</b> prey upon limpets, mussels, gastropods, and chitons. Other prey items include echinoderms, fish, and crabs.|$|R

25|$|Seabirds {{spend most}} of their lives at sea and are adapted to ocean life. Some even sleep in the water, though they must all return to land to lay their eggs. Their diets consist mostly of small fish, squid, shellfish, and crustaceans. Species of seabirds on the Oregon Coast include the common murre, tufted puffin, marbled murrelet, the black <b>oystercatcher,</b> auklets, many {{varieties}} of cormorants, the western gull, and glaucous-winged gull. Many seabird species are endemic and found nowhere else.|$|E

40|$|National Research Council of Canada 2002. Published version {{reproduced}} {{with the}} permission of the publisher. European <b>Oystercatchers</b> (Haematopus ostralegus) were highly selective towards mussels between 35 and 50 mm in length, and fewer than 5 % of mussels taken were below 35 mm or above 50 mm. The <b>oystercatchers</b> selected ventrally thin-shelled mussels, especially if the length was more than 35 mm, regardless of whether they opened the right or left valve of the mussel. The <b>oystercatchers</b> also took mussels that had few barnacles on the ventral surface. Although brown-shelled mussels were rare in the population, <b>oystercatchers</b> showed a strong preference for them. Generally, <b>oystercatchers</b> consumed ventrally flat mussels, especially in the smaller length classes, particularly the most preferred size class, 30 – 45 mm. Ventral shell thickness and colour had independent effects on mussel selection. The other two variables, number of barnacles and shape of the ventral surface (flat or curved), apparently had no influence on selection on their own, only by way of their association with colour or thickness...|$|R

25|$|Smooth Island {{is home to}} a {{wide range}} of native Australian birds. Recorded {{breeding}} seabird species are little penguin (Eudyptula minor), little pied cormorant, black-faced cormorant, great cormorant and short-tailed shearwater (Ardenna tenuirostris). The latter predominantly habitates inland from the western to southern coasts. The following native birds occupy the island: Tasmanian nativehen and forest raven. The Pacific gull also occupies the island. A survey by the Department of the Environment (Australia) in 2010 revealed the presence of the Eurasian skylark (Alauda arvensis), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and common blackbird (Turdus merula) on the island. The presence of sea eagle, wedge-tailed eagle, kelp gull, tern, silver gull, <b>oystercatcher,</b> cormorant and gannet species have also been described. No reptiles have been recorded on the island apart from a small population of blue tongue lizards. The hooded plover (Thinornis cucullatus) is a threatened species which may be present on Smooth Island.|$|E

40|$|Intake rate {{maximization}} {{alone is}} not always sufficient in explaining prey size selection in predators. For example, bivalve-feeding <b>oystercatchers</b> regularly select smaller prey than expected if they aimed to maximize their intake rate. It has been proposed that to these birds large prey are "risky," {{in the sense that}} birds may damage their bills when feeding on large bivalves. Large bivalves yield more energy, but according to this hypothesis this is achieved at the expense of energy yield in the long term when (1) the risk of bill damage increases with prey size and (2) foraging with a damaged bill is less effective. In accordance with this hypothesis, we show that captive <b>oystercatchers</b> feeding on large cockles experienced a high probability of bill tip damage, while bill damage was absent when cockles were small. Moreover, among free-living <b>oystercatchers</b> the prevalence of bill damage was correlated with mean cockle size near the capture site, and the data on captive birds fit in this pattern. Food intake of captive <b>oystercatchers</b> feeding exclusively on cockles was reduced by 23 % after bill damage, and free-living birds with damaged bills had 14 g lower mass. Because lower body mass was associated with higher mortality probability, these results indicate long-term costs associated with feeding on large cockles. We conclude that the risk of bill damage can potentially explain why <b>oystercatchers</b> avoid large bivalves and that <b>oystercatchers</b> may maximize long-term intake rate by selecting prey sizes that are "suboptimal" from a short-term rate-maximizing point of view.
