Parker and Stone were also given a signed photo of Hussein by the American soldiers. In 2011, Time called South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut the sixth greatest animated feature of all-time.|$|E
5|$|According to some later accounts, {{before the}} {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War (431 BC404 BC), Pericles, some of his closest associates (including the philosopher Anaxagoras and sculptor Phidias) and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks. Aspasia, in particular, was reportedly accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. According to Plutarch, she was put <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> impiety, with the comic poet Hermippus as prosecutor. The historical nature of the accounts about these events is disputed, and apparently no harm came to her as a result.|$|E

50|$|The Treason Act 1800 (39 & 40 Geo.3 c.93) was an Act of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Great Britain. It assimilated the {{procedure}} <b>on</b> <b>trials</b> <b>for</b> treason and misprision of treason to {{the procedure}} <b>on</b> <b>trials</b> <b>for</b> murder in certain cases. It was passed {{as a result}} of an attempt on the life of George III by James Hadfield earlier that year. The Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 was passed at the same time.|$|R
5|$|After the {{accession}} of the Roman Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> treason and heresy. Imprisoned {{for over}} two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations and apparently reconciled himself with the Roman Catholic Church. However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} king's uncle, Odo of Bayeux, raised a {{rebellion}} against the king in 1088, St-Calais was implicated in the revolt. William Rufus laid siege to St-Calais in the bishop's stronghold of Durham, and later put him <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> treason. A contemporary record of this trial, the De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi, is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial. Imprisoned briefly, St-Calais was allowed to go into exile after his castle at Durham was surrendered to the king. He went to Normandy, where he became a leading advisor to Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, the elder brother of William Rufus. By 1091, St-Calais had returned to England and regained royal favour.|$|E

When Dr. Gould appears at the Simpson house {{the next day to}} tell Lisa that the tests were inconclusive, Lisa goes on {{television}} to compare the belief in angels to the belief in unicorns and leprechauns. In response, Springfield's religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions. Appalled with the violence, Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton, but finds that it has disappeared. The mob soon converges on the Simpson household and Lisa is arrested and put <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> destroying the skeleton.|$|E

40|$|A new fMRI {{study by}} Heekeren and colleagues {{suggests}} that left {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} (DLPFC) contains a region that integrates sensory evidence supporting perceptual decisions.

5|$|Strafford {{had become}} the {{principal}} target of the Parliamentarians, particularly John Pym, and he went <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> high treason on 22 March 1641. However, the key allegation by Sir Henry Vane that Strafford had threatened to use the Irish army to subdue England was not corroborated and on 10 April Pym's case collapsed. Pym and his allies immediately launched a bill of attainder, which simply declared Strafford guilty and pronounced the sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|The Second Doctor {{was portrayed}} by Patrick Troughton, whose serials were more action-oriented {{than those of}} his predecessor. Additionally, after The Highlanders, stories {{moved away from the}} purely {{historical}} ones that featured during William Hartnell's tenure; instead, any historical tales also included a science fiction element. Patrick Troughton retained the role until the last episode of The War Games when members of the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, put him <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> breaking the laws of time and forced him to regenerate.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the two Eon Productions Bond films {{released}} prior to {{the writing of the}} novel (Dr. No and From Russia with Love) were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used. One of these was the poison gun used in the scene of the attempted assassination of M. The idea was taken from the story of Bohdan Stashynsky, who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961. Stashynsky was put <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison-spray gun to do it.|$|E

5|$|The {{mayor of}} Shuckton, Ontario (population 27,063) is murdered several hours after announcing that the town's {{bid for the}} 2028 Summer Olympics was rejected. A small-time criminal, Crim, is found with blood on him and is put <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> the murder. However, an obese man named Ricky {{suspects}} the real murderer is still at large and, {{with the help of}} his friend Marnie, he investigates the crime. Meanwhile, the mayor's widow takes over mayoral duties, women on a local news team compete for attention, the coroner steals the mayor's body, Crim's lawyer does everything he can to keep his cat alive, and Death waits in a motel room to collect the souls of dead Shuckton citizens.|$|E
5|$|Banza {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who he looked to for support. Mandaba {{went along with the}} plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him into the trunk of a Mercedes and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> appearance's sake.|$|E
5|$|Banza soon {{decided to}} stage a coup d'état. He confided in a few {{military}} officers, who he hoped would support his attempt to gain power. One of his confidants, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacted the president and informed him of {{the date of the}} coup, 9 April 1969. Hours before he was going to execute his bid for power, Banza was ambushed by Mandaba and taken directly to Bokassa. Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented his case to a military tribunal, which quickly sentenced him to death by firing squad. He was reportedly taken to an open field, where he was executed and buried in an unmarked grave. Alternate circumstances of Banza's death have been reported in Time and Le Monde. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Banza's family, mistress and close associates were all arrested and either sent to jail or deported. With Banza eliminated, Bokassa spent extravagantly and surrounded himself with adulators.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Scotland {{probably}} had about {{one quarter of the}} population of England, it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions, at an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 over the entire period. This was about four times the European average. The overwhelming majority were in the Lowlands, where the Kirk had more control, despite the evidence that basic magical beliefs were very widespread in the Highlands. Persecution of witchcraft in Orkney differed from the mainland with most trials taking place before 1650. Large series of trials included those in 1590–91 and the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597, which took place across Scotland from March to October. At least 400 people were put <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> various forms of diabolism. The exact number of those executed {{as a result of these}} trials is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. Later major trials included hunts in 1628–31 and 1649–50. Probably the most intense witch-hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties.|$|E

A Titan later appears and begins fighting the other Titans while ignoring humans; the Titan is revealed to be Eren, who has developed the ability to transform into one. Though he is seen as a threat by some, he helps the military take back Trost District.

5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in 1941, the tide gradually turned against the Nazis, who suffered major military defeats in 1943. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the Axis powers were pushed back in Eastern and Southern Europe. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} France, Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from {{the east and the}} other Allied powers from the west and capitulated within a year. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.|$|E

5|$|Forming an {{alliance}} with Ptolemy, Antigonus, and Lysimachus, Cassander had his officer Nicanor capture the Munichia fortress of Athens' port town Piraeus in defiance of Polyperchon's decree that Greek cities should be free of Macedonian garrisons, sparking the Second War of the Diadochi (319–315 BC). Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon, in 317 BC Philip III, by way of his politically-engaged wife Eurydice II of Macedon, officially replaced him as regent with Cassander. Afterwards Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias, mother of Alexander III who still resided in Epirus. A joint force of Epirotes, Aetolians, and Polyperchon's troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of Philip III and Eurydice's army, allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide. Olympias then had Nicanor killed along with dozens of leading Macedonian nobles, yet {{by the spring of}} 316 BC Cassander defeated her forces, captured her, and placed her <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> murder before sentencing her to death.|$|E

5|$|Lay and Skilling went <b>on</b> <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> {{their part}} in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E
