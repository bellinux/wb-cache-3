25|$|When the {{precipitation}} {{reaches the}} ground without completely evaporating, it is {{designated as the}} feature praecipitatio. This normally occurs with altostratus <b>opacus,</b> which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, upward-growing cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while downward growing nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, {{has the capacity to}} produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.|$|E
2500|$|All cloud {{varieties}} {{fall into}} one of two main groups. [...] One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus (thin translucent), perlucidus (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and <b>opacus</b> (thick opaque). [...] These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. [...] All three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. [...] However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. [...] Opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent, {{or in the case of}} cirrus spissatus, always opaque. [...] Similarly, these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.|$|E

Approximately 46 % of recipients from this group are absolute resistant to immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine A and need tolerization. Discovery of limbal mesenchymal stem cells that resemble phenotype of mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow reveal the prospects of their use like inductors of local immune tolerance in high-risk keratoplasty. It will help to increase percentage of successful engraftment and shorten the period of medical immunosuppression.   </div...|$|R

50|$|It has {{traditionally}} included the more widespread S. <b>opacus</b> as a subspecies, {{but under the}} common name Paramo tapaculo (a name now used exclusively for S. <b>opacus).</b> The two have different voices, leading to them being split into separate species in 2010.|$|E

He and his three fellow-leaders were pro-Romanian unionists, {{fighting}} the PMR authorities who controlled most of Transnistria. Ivanțoc was arrested on 2 June 1992, and sentenced to 15 years of prison in a trial, which the European Court of Human Rights considered to be unfairly conducted by the PMR authorities. On 9 December 1993, the Supreme Court of the PMR found Ivanțoc guilty of murdering {{a representative of the}} State with the aim of spreading terror, unauthorised use and theft of ammunition or explosives, and assault. He was set free on 2 June 2007. He was maltreated and beaten by the [...] "separatist police" [...] in front of the OSCE members at custom.|$|R
40|$|Cell {{therapy is}} an {{emerging}} therapeutic strategy aimed at replacing or repairing severely damaged tissues with cultured cells. Speci fi cally, ocular burns cause depletion of limbal stem cells, {{which leads to}} corneal <b>opaci</b> fi cation and visual loss. Corneal stem cells are segregated in the basal layer of the limbus, which is the transitional zone of the epithelium located between the cornea and the bulbar conjunctiva. Autologous cultured limbal epithelial cells can restore damaged corneas. We sought to establish a culture system that allows preservation of limbal stem cells and preparation of manageable epithelial sheets. We outline some quality criteria, which assure the clinical performance of keratinocyte culture: evaluation {{of the number of}} holoclones within a cultured epithelial graft, proportion of aborting colonies, and percentage of cells expressing high levels of D Np 63 a...|$|R

50|$|Stratus fractus are not {{divided into}} varieties, but stratus {{nebulosus}} {{on the other}} hand, are divided into two. The Stratus <b>opacus</b> variety appears as a nebulous or milky sheet of the nebulosus species, but are opaque enough to block the sun from view. Stratus Translucidus is another variety of the nebulosus species. These clouds are considered more thin than the <b>opacus</b> variety because this cloud is rather translucent, allowing {{the position of the}} sun or moon to be observed from earth's surface.|$|E

50|$|The Paramo tapaculo (Scytalopus <b>opacus)</b> is {{a species}} of bird in the Rhinocryptidae family. It is found at altitudes of 2600 to 4000 m in the Andes of {{northern}} Peru, Ecuador and southern Colombia (Cordillera Central). It has traditionally been treated as a subspecies of S. canus, but the two have different voices, leading to them being split into separate species in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Stratocumulus <b>Opacus</b> {{is a dark}} {{layer of}} clouds {{covering}} entire sky without any break. However, the cloud sheet is not completely uniform, so that separate cloud bases still can be seen. This is the main precipitating type, however any rain is usually light. If the cloud layer becomes grayer to the point when individual clouds can’t be distinguished, stratocumulus turn into stratus clouds.|$|E
50|$|Opacity-based varieties: Altocumulus {{translucidus}} {{is relatively}} thin {{so that the}} sun or moon is always visible as if seen through frosted glass. It is strictly a middle cloud and is coded CM1 in the SYNOP report. The <b>opacus</b> variety is sufficiently thick to obscure the sun or moon and can extend vertically into the high étage. It is therefore sometimes classified as vertical or multi-level, but is still coded CM2 as a middle cloud.|$|E
