5|$|With Justice Scalia {{breathing}} {{down the}} necks {{of anyone who}} peeks into the Congressional Record or Senate reports, {{the other members of}} the Court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs. It is likely for this reason that the percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically. No <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> an unnecessary fight, especially not one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia.|$|E
5|$|As with film, {{the rivalry}} between the clubs' {{hooligan}} firms has been covered in {{books such as}} Congratulations You Have Just Met the ICF by Cass Pennant, leader of the Inter City Firm. No <b>One</b> <b>Likes</b> Us, We Don't Care: True Stories from Millwall, Britain's Most Notorious Football Hooligans by Andrew Woods focuses on the fights between the two firms, {{from the perspective of}} Millwall's Bushwackers. Sunday Mirror columnist Michael Calvin spent the 2009–10 season covering Millwall, writing the book Family: Life, Death and Football. The beginning extensively features the rivalry and the stabbing of a Millwall supporter before the 2009 Upton Park riot game.|$|E

25|$|In Move Mode, {{the player}} may advance or {{backtrack}} (limited) to previous screens. In {{a similar fashion}} to Look Mode, triggers {{will appear on the}} screen and a corresponding directional button must be pressed to move to them, adding a turn to the count. Unlike Look Mode, however, triggers in Move Mode do not require Trigger Points, so one may move as much as <b>one</b> <b>likes,</b> assuming there is no turn limit. Once the player has exited the final screen of a stage, the player will be prompted to save and then {{move on to the next}} stage.|$|E
25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for the {{following}} reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds {{he has a new}} baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.|$|E

Bronfman, who had gained control earlier that year. Aubrey's attorney Gregson E. Bautzer also represented Kerkorian, and Bautzer recommended Aubrey for the MGM post. [...] Aubrey, announced as MGM president on October 21, 1969, was Kerkorian's third choice after Herb Jaffe of United Artists and independent producer Mike Frankovich both declined the post, while producer Ray Stark was also considered. Aubrey replaced the fired Louis F. Polk Jr., who had been MGM president only since January 14, 1969. Aubrey was the studio's third president that year. [...] Polk told The New York Times, [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> to leave a job unfinished," [...] and said he had started much-needed reforms at the studio, which suffered a $35 million loss in the fiscal year ending August 31, 1969.|$|E

500|$|After a {{game against}} Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in September 2010, manager Kenny Jackett said Millwall's {{hooligan}} problems are {{to a certain extent}} exaggerated by media sensationalism. [...] "I see it as unjust. We are an easy club to criticise and in my time , the way we have been reported is unfair", he said. Other examples of this include archive footage of their hooligan element's past bad behaviour being shown, when disorder has occurred at other grounds, not involving them. During a game between Millwall and Huddersfield Town, The Observer reported that a Huddersfield Town fan had thrown a coin at a linesman, and that some Millwall fans had intervened, and handed the culprit over to police. The News of the World, however, bore the headline: [...] "Millwall Thugs Deck Linesman With Concrete". This has led to a siege mentality among supporters of the club, which gave rise to the Millwall fans' famous terrace chant, No <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> us, we don't care, being sung in defiant defence of themselves and their team. In April 2013, Millwall met Wigan Athletic in a semi-final of the FA Cup. Millwall lost the game 2–0. Towards the end of the match, violence broke out in part of the stand allocated to Millwall, with individuals fighting amongst themselves and then against police, resulting in 14 arrests, of which two were Wigan supporters. In January 2014, a Millwall fan ripped a linesman's flag after a corner was not given to his side during {{a game against}} Leicester City; Millwall lost 1–3.|$|E

500|$|Ash Crimson's {{character}} had a mixed {{reception in}} video-game publications. When he was introduced, GameSpy's Christian Nutt {{called him a}} [...] "clone" [...] of Guile from the Street Fighter series because of their similar movesets but Ash's team was praised as new characters with new elements in the series. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN wrote that a major fan complaint was the character's strength in the games, which {{made him one of}} the strongest opponents despite an apparent lack of effort. According to Thomas, Ash is [...] "nothing if not strange" [...] and the writer lamented his many appearances in the KOF 2003 manhua compared with more-popular characters. When playable characters for the arcade version of The King of Fighters XIII were introduced, Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek speculated about Ash's lack of teammates and wondered if he was alone because [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> Ash now." [...] Marissa Meli of UGO Networks ranked Ash sixteenth on a list of [...] "The Most Androgynous Video Game Characters", with Meli jokingly attributing his androgynous appearance to a desire by Japanese designers to confuse Western gamers about their sexuality. Although he called Ash's voice one of [...] "Gaming's Top 10 Deepest Voices", Dan Howdle of Now Gamer referred to him as a female character and writers for Game Informer joked about their surprise at the discovery that Ash is a male character. After UTV Ignition Entertainment polled fans to choose an artbox for console versions of The King of Fighters XII, the company announced that Ash's unpopularity reduced the number of potential covers to two (featuring Kyo and Iori). Den of Geek listed Ash as the 23rd best The King of Fighters with the writer comparing him with Loki based on their antagonistic and tricky behaviour as well as how his heroic traits in KOF XIII gave fans different thoughts. Complex listed him as one of gaming's [...] "douchiest" [...] characters androgynous look as well as how he steals the powers of Chizuru Kagura and Iori Yagami.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, Girtonians {{have become}} {{known for their}} chant of We are Girton – super Girton!

The reference to no <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> us is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison {{to many of the}} other colleges. The college song I love to go a-bicycling, sung with the tune of I love to go a-wandering also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s.
