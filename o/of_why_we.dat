The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E

She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny." [...] A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] will show you everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time." ...|$|E

However, the older Phoenix Wright seen in Apollo Justice has been criticized as [...] "aloof and inscrutable", with [...] "his character's development...lost along the wayside." [...] GameDaily called him the eighth greatest Capcom character, citing how he perseveres {{in the face of}} hardships. They also named him 20th on their [...] "Top 25 Gaming Hunks." [...] They included his hairstyle in the list of [...] "weirdest hairstyles in gaming." [...] Nintendo Power listed Phoenix as their 10th favourite hero, stating that while lawyers get a bad rap, Phoenix is one who defends the innocent. In 2009, GameSpot chose him as one of the characters to compete in their poll for the title of [...] "All Time Greatest Game Hero". His appearance in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was also positively received, with Metro GameCentral describing him as [...] "the star of the show." [...] In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 55th best hero in video games while UGO Networks ranked him as the 57th best hero in entertainment in 2010. GamesRadar also included him in a list of [...] "The 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years", remarking that he has no power, and [...] "isn't even that good of a lawyer when he starts out, but watching him grow is part <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> love him.".|$|E

60|$|Madame Sand's famous Venetian {{year has}} been of late immensely in the air--a tub of soiled linen which the muse of history, rolling her sleeves well up, has not even yet quite ceased energetically and {{publicly}} to wash. The house in question {{must have been the}} house to which the wonderful lady betook herself when, in 1834, after the dramatic exit of Alfred de Musset, she enjoyed that remarkable period of rest and refreshment with the so long silent, the but recently rediscovered, reported, extinguished, Doctor Pagello. As an old Sandist--not exactly indeed of the première heure, but of the fine high noon and golden afternoon of the great career--I had been, though I confess too inactively, curious as to a few points in the topography of the eminent adventure to which I here allude; but had never got beyond the little public fact, in itself always a bit of a thrill to the Sandist, that the present Hotel Danieli had been the scene of its first remarkable stages. I am not sure indeed that the curiosity I speak of has not at last, in my breast, yielded to another form of wonderment--truly to the rather rueful question <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> have so continued to concern ourselves, and why the fond observer of the footprints of genius is likely so to continue, with a body of discussion, neither in itself and in its day, nor in its preserved and attested records, at all positively edifying. The answer to such an inquiry would doubtless reward patience, but I fear we can now glance at its possibilities only long enough to say that interesting persons--so they be of a sufficiently approved and established interest--render in some degree interesting whatever happens to them, and give it an importance even when very little else (as in the case I refer to) may have operated to give it a dignity. Which is where I leave the issue of further identifications.|$|E
