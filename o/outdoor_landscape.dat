6000|$|Yet Swedenborg, {{after his}} mode, pinned his theory to a {{temporary}} form. He exaggerates the circumstance of marriage; and, though he finds false marriages on the earth, fancies a wiser choice in heaven. But of progressive souls, all loves and friendships are momentary. Do you love me? means, Do {{you see the}} same truth? If you do, we are happy with the same happiness; but presently one of us passes into the perception of new truth;--we are divorced, and no tension in nature can hold us to each other. I know how delicious is this cup of love,--I existing for you, you existing for me; {{but it is a}} child's clinging to his toy; an attempt to eternize the fireside and nuptial chamber; to keep the picture-alphabet through which our first lessons are prettily conveyed. The Eden of God is bare and grand: like the <b>outdoor</b> <b>landscape,</b> remembered from the evening fireside, it seems cold and desolate, whilst you cower over the coals; but, once abroad again, we pity those who can forego the magnificence of nature, for candle-light and cards. Perhaps the true subject of the [...] "Conjugal Love" [...] is conversation, whose laws are profoundly eliminated. It is false, if literally applied to marriage. For God is the bride or bridegroom of the soul. Heaven is not the pairing of two, but the communion of all souls. We meet, and dwell an instant under the temple of one thought, and part as though we parted not, to join another thought in other fellowships of joy. So far from there being anything divine in the low and proprietary sense of, Do you love me? it is only when you leave and lose me, by casting yourself on a sentiment which is higher than both of us, that I draw near, and find myself at your side; and I am repelled, if you fix your eye on me, and demand love. In fact, in the spiritual world, we change sexes every moment. You love the worth in me; then I am your husband: but it is not me, but the worth, that fixes the love; and that worth is a drop of the ocean of worth that is beyond me. Meantime, I adore the greater worth in another, and so become his wife. He aspires to a higher worth in another spirit, and is wife of receiver of that influence.|$|E

Obstacles included enemy turrets spread around the map, various fortifications and destructible buildings.

5000|$|Fyt innovated {{the genre}} of the hunting piece by moving the scene in which the dead game was {{displayed}} from an indoor table top to an open landscape.He was the first artist to depict game as a subject of hunting rather than as food displayed in a home or kitchen. He did not place fruit and vegetables in his game pieces but rather dogs forming part of the hunting scene in an <b>outdoor</b> <b>landscape.</b> [...] As the game was no longer shown as food but as a trophy, these works have {{been referred to as}} trophy pieces. This new approach to the display of game as part of the hunt caused Fyt to include hunting equipment and tools in these works. [...] Hounds {{play an important role in}} these pieces and together with the hunting equipment they point to the proximity of the master. Fyt occasionally included portraits of individuals and families in these game pieces. While hunting was at the time still a pastime reserved for the aristocracy, the well-off urban elite were eager to acquire Fyt’s game pieces to decorate their houses with these tokens of a lifestyle only open to aristocrats.|$|E
5000|$|Varnas' {{art works}} {{can be divided}} into 4 periods. First period (1908-1913) {{includes}} his post graduate study works of portraits and landscapes. Second period (1914-18) includes portraits and political caricatures. The post war period was not very rich in numbers, but much richer in quality. Now the artist frees himself from romantic inclinations, concentrating more on the development of color problems. The third period (1918-1940) which coincides with independent Lithuania, shows the artist's intensified colorific aspirations in his portraits and his favorite subject - - landscape. To this period also belongs his graphic works, postage stamps, money projects, political caricatures, theatrical sceneries. In the fourth period from 1944 until present, the artist continues to paint mostly portraits and landscape. In this present period he painted monumental historical composition [...] "The Coronation of King Mindaugas," [...] in which the artist demonstrated a four year painstaking work of art. Artist's portraits represent the human face with all its simplicity, weaknesses and greatness. He tends to include symbolic background in order to represent person's social position in life. He not only paints outward facial features, but he also reveals the personality of the sitter. In his oil paintings he represents realistic objects with somewhat slight touch of impressionism. His most characteristic elements are simplicity and sincerity. It is amazing, that during Varnas' long artistic life, spanning over 60 years, he never was influenced by developing new trends in art, such as expressionism, surrealism, or even abstract. Artist's objects never lost its true realistic form, he always remained faithful to nature. In his open air <b>outdoor</b> <b>landscape</b> scene paintings we see patient detailed study of nature as seen only through the artist's eyes. Therefore, besides historical and portrait paintings, Varnas is probably best known as truly exclusive landscape artist.|$|E

40|$|Through {{collaborative}} work with Cornwall Council, this AHRC funded project has produced an in-depth {{study of the}} design of secondary school <b>outdoor</b> <b>landscapes</b> linking two areas of research – landscape design and cultural geography. It explores the politics underpinning the design, construction, use and function of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>landscapes</b> of secondary schools in Cornwall, focusing {{on the extent of}} active participation of children and young people in these processes. Contemporary research has illustrated that outdoor spaces are essential to the development and wellbeing of young people as they are places in which children can play or have fun whilst they experiment with their identity, learn to socialise and participate in informal education. This thesis examines the role children and young people may have had and their potential in helping to formulate the design and implementation of outdoor spaces, alongside planners, garden designers, teachers and other interested parties. There are three linked aims. •	Exploration of the politics underpinning the design, redesign, use and function of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>landscapes</b> of secondary schools. Here, “politics” refer to the complex negotiations between people, practicalities (policy priorities, management) and school strategic vision and ethos (including the role of student voice). •	Understand more about the local spatialities of childhood of secondary school age children in order to: i) explain the politics of design; and ii) propose a more nuanced approach to understanding the varying needs and expectations of secondary school-age children. By participatory methods, interviews and observations I was able to note the use and functionality of the grounds by and for pupils, teachers and site managers. •	Using an understanding of the politics of design in Cornwall’s secondary schools, and with greater awareness of the spatialities of childhood, develop recommendations for evaluation of secondary school <b>outdoor</b> <b>landscapes</b> via a ‘school’s biography’ approach. While policy-facing literature contemplates the educational function of school spaces in the secondary sector, this research broadens the view of children and young people’s relationship with secondary school outdoor spaces, emphasizing the relationality between groups of children, and children and others. This project proposes work which is attentive to how constructions of childhood are achieved in practice, beyond the contingencies of policy making and educational practices. The extent to which school grounds meet pupils’ needs is a reflection of school ethos and the relative status of children and young people in the decision making process. AHRCCornwall Counci...|$|R

Reactivity allows us to focus on dynamic responses and limit the amount of useless data gathered, as well as improving robustness and network lifetime. The main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate that a reactive sensor network can deliver useful data on soil moisture responses to rainfall.
