5|$|Etty died in 1849, and {{his work}} enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him {{declined}} over time, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century the value of all his paintings had fallen below their original levels. Following his death, nude paintings went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> very rapidly in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th {{century the}} Gallery's late Victorian {{interiors}} fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion.</b> The Crace ceiling decorations {{in the entrance}} hall were not to {{the taste of the}} director Charles Holmes, and were obliterated by white paint.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} work {{depicting}} Elgar is Ken Russell's 1962 BBC television film Elgar, made when the composer was still largely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion.</b> This hour-long film contradicted {{the view of}} Elgar as a jingoistic and bombastic composer, and evoked the more pastoral and melancholy side of his character and music.|$|E

5|$|Etty {{continued}} to produce paintings ranging from still lifes to formal portraits, and to attract both admiration for his technique and criticism for supposed obscenity, {{until his death}} in 1849. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, and his works fetched huge sums on resale. Changing tastes from the 1870s onwards meant history paintings in Etty's style fell rapidly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion,</b> {{and by the end of}} the 19th century, the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices.|$|E
5|$|The large centre canvas has {{not been}} {{positively}} identified. However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged Crucifixion, now in the Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181×153.5cm) is exactly double that of the four wing panels. Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely to Venice. The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works had fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> by the 17th century, and would have had more value as single panels.|$|E
5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion.</b> In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E
25|$|Reboux made an {{art form}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> high <b>fashion</b> hats which were re-emerging in France to {{supplant}} the bonnet in the mid-19th century. She promoted the hat as an essential accessory for women's fashion.|$|R

5|$|As hats go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion,</b> the {{anthropomorphic}} bear Popol the Hatter {{heads into}} the American West with his wife Virginia and blue donkey, Bluebell. Setting up camp {{in the land of}} the Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business there. This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using technology that is more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E
5|$|From around 1840, architects {{started to}} design wooden {{buildings}} {{in a new}} style, the so-called Swiss chalet style. The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in this style, characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> among architects.|$|E
5|$|Holding such {{conservative}} views, Saint-Saëns was out {{of sympathy}} – and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty. It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913. In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} falling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion,</b> the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but rather, to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree took the form of a recommendation from the Senate to the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging from the Senate to ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E
5|$|It is certain, however, that Wood was répétiteur at Carte's Royal English Opera House for Sullivan's grand opera Ivanhoe in late 1890 {{and early}} 1891, and for André Messager's La Basoche in 1891–92. He {{also worked for}} Carte at the Savoy as {{assistant}} to François Cellier on The Nautch Girl in 1891. Wood remained devoted to Sullivan's music and later insisted on programming his concert works when they were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> in musical circles. During this period, he had several compositions of his own performed, including an oratorio, St. Dorothea (1889), a light opera, Daisy (1890), and a one-act comic opera, Returning the Compliment (1890).|$|E
5|$|Mary Watts died in 1938, and {{was buried}} {{alongside}} George Frederic Watts near the Watts Mortuary Chapel, {{which she had}} herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion,</b> the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52of the intended 120spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be {{a symbol of the}} Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Brettingham (1699 – 19 August 1769), {{sometimes}} called Matthew Brettingham the Elder, was an 18th-century Englishman who rose from humble origins {{to supervise the}} construction of Holkham Hall, and {{become one of the}} country's best-known architects of his generation. Much of his principal work has since been demolished, particularly his work in London, where he revolutionised the design of the grand townhouse. As a result, he is often overlooked today, remembered principally for his Palladian remodelling of numerous country houses, many of them situated in the East Anglia area of Britain. As Brettingham neared the pinnacle of his career, Palladianism began to fall <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> and neoclassicism was introduced, championed by the young Robert Adam.|$|E
5|$|Musidora was {{extremely}} well received when first exhibited, and {{considered one of}} the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion.</b> At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity. Etty's Musidora is likely to have influenced The Knight Errant by John Everett Millais, but other than that has had little influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major exhibitions in 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} ambiguous character <b>of</b> the <b>fashion.</b> Change {{is the essential}} <b>of</b> the <b>fashion.</b> But {{for people who are}} now in a fashion movement, fasion is not a faint value. Fashion is a change but a style about which many people are enthusiastic. The difference between a viewpoint in a fashion and a viewpoint <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fashion</b> divides the views on a fashion. This ambiguity has confused a series of attempts to describe a fashion. We are apt to watch one side <b>of</b> a <b>fashion.</b> But we should try to discuss and describe both reliability and unreliability <b>of</b> the <b>fashion...</b>|$|R
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was {{bought at the}} Summer Exhibition by the Marquess of Stafford. It was sold in 1908, long after Etty had fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion,</b> for a substantial loss, and sold again in 1937 for a further substantial loss to the Southampton City Art Gallery, where it remains. Another work by Etty, sold as A Bacchanalian Scene in 1830 and later renamed Landscape with Figures, was identified in 1953 as a preliminary oil sketch for The World Before the Flood and purchased by the York Art Gallery. The two paintings were exhibited together {{as part of a}} major retrospective of Etty's work in 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{extraordinary}} magistrates: the dictator and the magister equitum (literally: master of horse). Dictators were {{selected by the}} consuls to resolve some crisis threatening the republic, for a term of around six months, before {{they were expected to}} resign and return their powers to the ordinary magistrates. The magister equitum, was then appointed by the dictator as his lieutenant. The dictatorship was only used in the early and middle Republic, before falling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fashion</b> {{after the end of the}} Second Punic War, before being revived during the time of Sulla as an extraconstitutional measure, not to defeat some foe or quell unrest, but rather, to bring stability to the political order.|$|E
