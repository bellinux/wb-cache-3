He got a saxophone and joined the music school, where he was exposed to Western Jazz albums of Charlie Parker and others.|$|E

His musical work was {{conducted}} with a rotating ensemble of musicians called the Magic Band (1964–1982), with whom he recorded 13 studio albums. Noted for his powerful singing voice and his wide vocal range, Van Vliet also played the harmonica, saxophone, and numerous <b>other</b> <b>wind</b> <b>instruments.</b> His music integrated blues, rock, psychedelia, and jazz with contemporary experimental composition and the avant-garde. Beefheart was also known for often constructing myths about his life and for exercising an almost dictatorial control over his supporting musicians.|$|E

Ford was the trumpeter, Walter Parazaider played {{saxophone}} and <b>other</b> <b>wind</b> <b>instruments,</b> and Danny Seraphine later became the drummer. Kath became close friends with Seraphine as they formed the rhythm section, {{as well as with}} Parazaider. The three musicians regularly socialized outside of the band. They were fired from the group, which wanted to merge with another band, Little Artie and the Pharaohs, while leader and guitarist Mike Sistack explained that [...] "it's just business." ...|$|E
60|$|Music succeeded this conversation, Eve {{having taken}} the {{precaution}} {{to have the}} piano tuned before quitting port, an expedient we would recommend to all who have a regard for the instrument that extends beyond its outside, or even for their own ears. John Effingham executed brilliantly on the violin; and, as it appeared on inquiry, the two younger gentlemen performed respectably on the flute, flageolet, {{and one or two}} <b>other</b> <b>wind</b> <b>instruments.</b> We shall leave them doing great justice to Beethoven, Rossini, and Mayerbeer, whose compositions Mr. Dodge did not fail to sneer at in the outer cabin, as affected and altogether unworthy of attention, and return on deck to the company of the anxious master.|$|E
60|$|For {{when the}} order came {{to prepare for}} the embarkation, both Spanish and bugling were given up, and the boys entered into the {{pleasure}} of the holiday with immense zest. They had no regimental duties to perform beyond being present at parade. They had no packing to do, and fewer purchases to make. A ball or two of stout string, for, as Peter said, string is always handy, and a large pocket-knife, each with a variety of blades, were the principal items. They had a ring put to the knives, so that they could sling them round the waist. They had, therefore, nothing to do but to amuse themselves, and this they did with a heartiness which astonished the other boys, and proved conclusively that {{they did not want to}} be unsociable. They hired a boat for a sail and took five or six other boys across to Ryde, only just returning in time for tattoo, and they played such a number of small practical jokes, such as putting a handful of peas into the bugles and <b>other</b> <b>wind</b> <b>instruments,</b> that the band-master declared that he thought that they were all bewitched, and he threatened to thrash the boys all round, because he could not find out who had done it.|$|E

60|$|But {{what words}} of mine can {{describe}} the young gentleman's emotion when, {{preceded by a}} band of trumpets, bagpipes, ophicleides, and <b>other</b> <b>wind</b> <b>instruments,</b> the Prince of Cleves appeared with the Princess Helen, his daughter? And ah! what expressions of my humble pen can {{do justice to the}} beauty of that young lady? Fancy every charm which decorates the person, every virtue which ornaments the mind, every accomplishment which renders charming mind and charming person doubly charming, and then you will have but a faint and feeble idea of the beauties of her Highness the Princess Helen. Fancy a complexion such as they say (I know not with what justice) Rowland's Kalydor imparts to the users of that cosmetic; fancy teeth to which orient pearls are like Wallsend coals; eyes, which were so blue, tender, and bright, that while they run you through with their lustre, they healed you with their kindness; a neck and waist, so ravishingly slender and graceful, that the least that is said about them the better; a foot which fell upon the flowers no heavier than a dew-drop--and this charming person set off by the most elegant toilet that ever milliner devised! The lovely Helen's hair (which was as black as the finest varnish for boots) was so long, that it was borne on a cushion several yards behind her by the maidens of her train; and a hat, set off with moss-roses, sunflowers, bugles, birds-of-paradise, gold lace, and pink ribbon, gave her a distingue air, which would have set the editor of the Morning Post mad with love.|$|E

50|$|As with <b>other</b> air-reed <b>wind</b> <b>instruments,</b> {{the sound}} of a bansuri is {{generated}} from resonance of the air column inside it. The length of this column is varied by closing or leaving open, a varying number of holes. Half-holing is employed to play flat or minor notes. The 'sa' (on the Indian sargam scale, or equivalent 'do' on the octave) note is obtained by covering the first three holes from the blowing-hole. Octaves are varied by manipulating one's embouchure and controlling the blowing strength. Either finger tips or finger pads are used by bansuri players to partially or fully cover the tap holes.|$|R

50|$|Horn {{sections}} are {{an integral}} part of musical genres such as jazz, R&B, blues, funk, calypso, ska, soul music and gospel music. Most of these horn sections feature some combination of saxophones, trumpets and trombones. More rarely, <b>other</b> <b>wind</b> or brass <b>instruments</b> such as flute, clarinet or tuba may be added. Other popular musical genres, such as rock and pop, also use horn sections.|$|R

Slightly larger jazz ensembles, such as quintets (five instruments) or sextets (six instruments) typically add other soloing instruments to the basic quartet formation, such as different types of saxophones (e.g., alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, etc.) or an additional chordal instrument.|$|R
50|$|Dutilleux has omitted violins and violas {{from his}} instrumentation. Their absence {{was meant to}} {{translate}} the impression of relative emptiness and immobility conveyed by {{the lower half of}} the painting. On the <b>other</b> hand, the <b>wind</b> <b>instruments</b> and percussions are particularly prominent. Their solos represent the movements of the clouds and the light of the stars and the moon. Space is represented by an unusual distribution of the celli. They are placed at the foreground in a half circle around the conductor. The movement is symbolized by the alternation of static episodes and whirling solos.|$|R

50|$|The {{native peoples}} of the Brazilian {{rainforest}} play instruments including whistles, flutes, horns, drums and rattles.

When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, the first natives they met played an array of reed flutes and <b>other</b> <b>wind</b> and percussion <b>instruments.</b> The Jesuit missionaries introduced songs which used the Tupi language with Christian lyrics, an attempt to convert the people to Christianity, and also introduced Gregorian chant and the flute, bow, and the clavichord.|$|R
5000|$|Praetorius noted: [...] "In sound renaissance racketts {{are quite}} soft, {{almost as if}} one were blowing through a comb.

It is particularly pleasing and fine to hear on bass parts." ...|$|R

50|$|Louis Michel Francois Chabrier de Peloubet (or simply Chabrier Peloubet) {{was born}} in Philadelphia on February 22. 1806. He spent his {{childhood}} and adolescence in New York City, as well as Athens, Hudson, and Catskill, New York. There he learned the trade of making musical instruments, and while quite young he set up business for himself in New York City. He was married April 27, 1829, to Miss Harriet Hanks. Their four elder children were born in New York City. In 1836 they moved to Bloomfield, where Chabrier became a respected and honored citizen. He continued to manufacture flutes and <b>other</b> wood <b>wind</b> <b>instruments</b> till 1849, when he changed his business and commenced the manufacture of cabinet organs, a popular parlor instrument in the Victorian era. He remained in that business with his son Jarvis until his death on Nov. 30, 1885.|$|R
5000|$|Oliver Cromwell {{appointed}} him court organist and keeper of instruments. After the Restoration, he was kept on as a viol {{player in the}} court of Charles II, where he also continued his work as an organ-builder, tuner and keeper of <b>wind</b> <b>instruments</b> until his death. In that capacity he was mentor to his 14-year-old godson, Henry Purcell, who was apprenticed to him by a royal warrant issued on 10 June 1673: [...] "...to swear and admit Henry Purcell in the place of keeper, mender, maker, repairer and tuner of the regals, organs, virginals, flutes and recorders and all <b>other</b> kind of <b>wind</b> <b>instruments</b> whatsoever, in ordinary, without fee, to his Majesty, and assistant to John Hingston, and upon the death or other avoidance of the latter, to come into ordinary with fee." ...|$|R
2500|$|Like {{the trumpet}} and all <b>other</b> modern brass <b>wind</b> <b>instruments,</b> the cornet makes a sound when the player vibrates ("buzzes") the lips in the mouthpiece, {{creating}} a vibrating column of {{air in the}} tubing. The frequency of the air column's vibration can be modified by changing the lip tension and aperture or [...] "embouchure", and by altering the tongue position to change {{the shape of the}} oral cavity, thereby increasing or decreasing the speed of the airstream. In addition, the column of air can be lengthened by engaging one or more valves, thus lowering the pitch. Double and triple tonguing are also possible.|$|R
