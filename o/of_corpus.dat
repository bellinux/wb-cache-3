The {{results show that the}} ability of tones to control the pitch movement is descending in the above listed sequence. With the more intervention of other factors in connected speech, tones play a less important role in controlling pitch movement. It proves that pitch movement in utterance is controlled by various factors and the type of tones is just one of them. 1...|$|R

40|$|URL] The “use” <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> and {{concordancers}} {{in translation}} teaching has grown increasingly attractive {{since the mid}} 1990 s’ with an abundant literature advocating their use and promoting their benefits in the translation classroom.

40|$|Summary. Progesterone {{injected}} into pregnant pigs {{from the time}} of ovulation until Days 10 to 13 of gestation does not prevent formation <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> lutea. Injections <b>of</b> progesterone beyond Days 12 to 16 of pregnancy, i. e. after corpus luteum formation has been completed, results in complete and rapid destruction <b>of</b> the formed <b>corpora</b> lutea. In contrast, progesterone {{injected into}} rats throughout the entire pregnancy or pseudopregnancy has no visible or measurable effect on corpora lutea. Since in both rats and pigs a luteotrophic hormone (lth) is presumed {{to be involved in the}} formation and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> lutea, it appears that progesterone is able to inhibit lth release and hence maintenance <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> lutea during pregnancy, but not during the luteal phase of the cycle. The possible theoretical implications of these findings concerning the role of lth in maintenance <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> lutea and the mechanisms of release of lth in rats and in pigs are discussed...|$|R

5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave accompanied with a {{low pressure}} system moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. The wave crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335miles (540km) east-southeast <b>of</b> <b>Corpus</b> Christi, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{favorable}} environment, Cindy remained disorganized, featuring an asymmetric -wide eye; {{little further}} strengthening {{occurred over the}} course of the night. Upon Cindy's landfall at High Island the following morning, its atmospheric pressure was measured at 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg), and winds reached 75mph (120km/h). Soon after moving ashore, Cindy became nearly stationary for 18hours, maintaining Category1 intensity before weakening to first to a tropical storm at 0600UTC on 18September then a tropical depression six hours later. The remnants of Cindy gradually turned westward-to-southwestward and decreased in strength during 18 and 19September. As a result of its abnormally slow movement and deterioration, extremely heavy rains were recorded over Texas and Louisiana, especially in the storm's northeastern quadrant. Cindy finally dissipated on 20September while situated west <b>of</b> <b>Corpus</b> Christi. It was the first hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1960.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, 4th Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, KG (c. 1310 – 23 March 1361), also Earl of Derby, was {{a member}} of the English nobility in the 14th century, and a {{prominent}} English diplomat, politician, and soldier.

He was a founding member and the second Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348, and in 1351 was created duke.

5|$|Hurricane Cindy was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1960. The third named storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Cindy developed within a trough as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on 16September. The disturbance swiftly intensified to hurricane strength, with a distinct eye becoming visible on satellite imagery as it drifted north-northwestwards toward the Texas coastline. Despite favorable conditions, with high sea surface temperatures, the storm only intensified into a Category1 hurricane. After peaking with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), it made landfall at High Island {{on the morning of}} 17September as a slightly weaker system with an atmospheric pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg).

5|$|In Britain, {{a number}} of {{scientists}} considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it could fall into German hands. Unsure {{as to how to}} go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master <b>of</b> <b>Corpus</b> Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1.|$|E
5|$|On {{the western}} end of the chapel is the narthex, which has entrances on the north, west, and south walls. An {{additional}} door on the chapel's north side opens onto the Hibben Garden, named in recognition of John Grier Hibben's role in the chapel's construction and dedication. The garden of evergreens was designed by H.

The chapel is connected on its eastern side to Dickinson Hall by the Rothschild arch, symbolizing a connection between religion and scholarship. Cram resigned as Princeton's supervising architect over the inclusion of the arch, which he disliked; nonetheless, he participated in the chapel's 1928 dedication ceremony.
