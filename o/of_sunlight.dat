40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{investigate}} the early growth and root development characteristics of Atractylodes japonica container seedling. Experiment was performed by light intensity (100 %, 60 %, 25 % and 10 % <b>of</b> full <b>sunlight).</b> Height was surveyed well under 25 % <b>of</b> full <b>sunlight</b> (overall 11. 013. 0 %). Root collar diameter was the highest in the full sunlight (7. 52 ㎜). It was the highest fresh weight (1. 52 g, 0. 92 g, 0. 90 g and 3. 34 g) under 25 % <b>of</b> full <b>sunlight,</b> root dry weight was getting higher in the higher light level and the highest in the full sunlight (0. 13 g). Total root length, root project area, root surface area and root volume were the highest under 25 % <b>of</b> full <b>sunlight</b> (434. 7 ㎝, 17. 4 ㎠, 54. 7 ㎠, 0. 55 ㎤, respectively) and the lowest under 10 % <b>of</b> full <b>sunlight.</b> As a result of surveying the whole experiment, A. japonica is judged nicely by maintaining 25 % <b>of</b> full <b>sunlight,</b> excepting 10 % <b>of</b> full <b>sunlight.</b> And light levels during the early growt...|$|R

Similar to the case <b>of</b> simulated <b>sunlight,</b> the photo-induction <b>of</b> natural <b>sunlight</b> produced bright colors including red and brownish red on silk fabrics (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1), which reveals that the photo-induced coloration of silk with gold NPs can be realized using natural sunlight.|$|R
5|$|Clouds {{intercept}} both {{heat from}} the sun and heat radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location, and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss, this causes storms and subsequent flood rains and flooding.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.|$|E

5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus {{a large area}} <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E
5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> scattering off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E
5|$|Salkin {{had noted}} that its {{tropical}} position might mean that B.dentata {{was a key}} species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> reaching the mesophyll.|$|E

5|$|Sundews {{generally}} grow in seasonally moist or {{more rarely}} constantly wet habitats with acidic soils {{and high levels}} <b>of</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Common habitats include bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, the tepuis of Venezuela, the wallums of coastal Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, and moist streambanks. Many species grow in association with sphagnum moss, which absorbs much of the soil's nutrient supply and also acidifies the soil, making nutrients less available to plant life. This allows sundews, which do not rely on soil-bound nutrients, to flourish where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them.|$|E
5|$|The ocean can be {{conceptualized}} as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and {{presence or absence}} <b>of</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{name comes}} from a natural spring located along a trail on {{the south end of}} the park. The spring's name is derived from the effect <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> on its surface, which makes the pool appear to shimmer like silver. Even through the winter, the {{bubbling}} spring never freezes, and plants often poke through snow surrounding the watercress-bordered pool in the coldest months. Three miles of the Fox River, which Silver Springs empties into, flows through the park's north end.|$|E

5|$|The shadowed {{portion of}} the crater was imaged with the Terrain Camera of the Japanese SELENE {{spacecraft}} using the illumination <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> reflected off the rim. The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30° slope that leads down to a 6.6km diameter floor. The handful of craters along the interior span {{no more than a}} few hundred meters. The bottom is covered by an uneven mound-like feature that is 300 to 400m thick. The central peak is about 200m in height.|$|E
5|$|A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a {{radius of}} one astronomical unit, {{so that the}} {{interior}} surface would receive the same amount <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> as Earth does per unit solid angle, would have a surface area of approximately , or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 yottawatts (3.846 × 1026 watts) of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's evolution. This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.|$|E
5|$|About 298 {{million years}} ago Permian forests started to cover the continent, and there were tundras as late as 15 {{million years ago}}, but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow {{extensive}} vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor soil quality, lack of moisture, and lack <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes. There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts, but only three species of flowering plants, {{all of which are}} found in the Antarctic Peninsula: Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic hair grass), Colobanthus quitensis (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native Poa annua (annual bluegrass). Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence <b>of</b> <b>sunlight,</b> they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock. Other bacteria can be found in abundance in the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; marine snow drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E
5|$|At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened {{his room}} and focused the rays <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be {{observed}} safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate. On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15pm, and observed {{for half an hour}} until sunset at 3:53pm.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{typically}} cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst {{events have}} been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels <b>of</b> <b>sunlight</b> during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is {{complicated by the fact that}} cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.|$|E
