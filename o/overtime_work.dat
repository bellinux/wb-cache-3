The committee, which arranged for its strike meetings to be translated into 25 different languages, put forward a set of demands: a 15% increase in wages for a 54-hour work week, double time for <b>overtime</b> <b>work,</b> and no discrimination against workers for their strike activity.|$|E
25|$|The initiative, called Postal Transformation, {{has been}} rolled {{out across the}} country from 2010-2017. This {{transformation}} saw {{a fundamental change in}} the work duties of letter carriers. Previously, the delivery of parcels, clearance and transfers to retail postal outlets and collection of mail from street letter boxes was carried out by the separate position of a mail service courier, while letter carriers delivered the mail through walking routes, utilizing public transit and taxis to travel to their work locations. Today, letter carrier routes are motorized and they are responsible for delivering parcels, mail, clearing and transfers at retail postal outlets, and collection of mail from street letter boxes. The additional duties have led to increased <b>overtime,</b> <b>work</b> stress, and injuries to employees who are facing greater fatigue and delivering mail in the dark; with many complaining that regular routes can no longer be completed in 8 hours, resulting in forced overtime and undelivered mail.|$|E

Almost 29 % of workers who <b>work</b> <b>overtime</b> (12 % of all workers) received no overtime pay even though they <b>worked</b> <b>overtime</b> hours. Over 40 % of workers who <b>worked</b> <b>overtime</b> hours (17 % of all workers) received less than 1.5 times the legal minimum wage for their overtime hours. Finally, 69.5 % of workers who <b>work</b> <b>overtime</b> hours (28 % of all workers) earned less than 1.5 times their regular pay for overtime hours. In summary, while we find evidence of broad compliance with legal minimum wage laws in China, we also find evidence of substantial non-compliance with overtime pay regulations in China.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900 s the Everett Mills, {{like all the}} other Lawrence mills were staffed mainly with European {{immigrants}} who were underpaid and overworked. When a law was passed in Massachusetts reducing the maximum number of hours that could be worked weekly by women and children, the mill owners reduced their workers’ pay accordingly and the Bread and Roses strike of 1912 erupted. Believing that a workforce of women and ethnically self-segregated immigrants living paycheck to paycheck could never band together to achieve a common goal, the mill owners were proved wrong with the strike that shut down the mills for two months in the dead of winter. Originating with female Polish weavers at the Everett Mills who revolted upon receiving pay reduced by thirty-two cents, soon 20,000 millworkers were on strike. Helped by the Industrial Workers of the World labor union who organized meetings with representatives from all affected ethnic communities, fundraisers to support the millworkers while they were on strike, and highly visible protests meant to arouse nationwide support and outrage at national labor norms, the workers won pay increases and time-and-a-quarter for <b>overtime</b> <b>work.</b> The strike had far reaching consequences across the country when mill owners in other cities and states voluntarily raised pay in fear of similar uprisings by their own workers.|$|E

Like other Nordic countries, Denmark has adopted the Nordic Model, which combines free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and strong worker protection.

Employers can hire and fire whenever they want (flexibility), and between jobs, unemployment compensation is very high (security).

No restrictions apply regarding <b>overtime</b> <b>work,</b> which allows companies to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Denmark has a competitive corporate tax rate of 24.5% and a special time-limited tax regime for expatriates. The Danish taxation system is broad based, with a 25% value-added tax, in addition to excise taxes, income taxes and other fees. The overall level of taxation (sum of all taxes, as a percentage of GDP) is estimated to be 46% in 2011.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Upon {{reading the}} congressional {{hearing on the}} Overtime Pay Penalty Act of 1964, one cannot fail to be {{impressed}} by the emphasis that management places on absenteeism as a primary cause of overtime. The argument given is basically quite simple: Large firms, it is claimed, attempt to account for absenteeism by hiring standby workers; however because of the stochastic nature of the absentee rate, {{it is impossible for}} them to have replacements always available. Hence <b>overtime</b> must be <b>worked</b> by existing employees in order to meet production schedules. One concludes from this argument that the randomness of absenteeism is the cause of overtime. If the absentee rate were known with certainty, then management could take account of it without recourse to additional overtime. In this note we challenge this conclusion and argue that a rational economic response to a certainty absentee rate involves increasing the amount of <b>overtime</b> <b>worked</b> per man, while the effect on the level of employment is ambiguous. Furthermore we claim that a stochastic absentee rate leads to a larger optimal employment stock and, in at least one special case, on average, to a smaller amount of <b>overtime</b> <b>worked</b> per man than in the certainty absentee rate case. Crucial to our argument is the observation that many of the labor costs which we classify as 2 ̆ 2 fixed 2 ̆ 2 must be paid by the employer even when an employee is absent, but overtime hourly wage payments need not be made to absentees...|$|R
