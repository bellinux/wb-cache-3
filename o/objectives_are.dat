5|$|CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois, a {{non-governmental}} organization, is {{the owner}} and operator of the reserve. The main objective is to maintain the current diversity. To this end, regular management mainly struggles against the afforestation and against invasive species, such as Japanese knot weed. The secondary <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> environmental education, heritage interpretation, improvement of knowledge fauna and flora, and environmental monitoring.|$|E
5|$|The river has a {{long history}} of {{improvements}} to facilitate navigation from Bridgwater to Taunton, and has also been used to power mills along its length. These two <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> often antagonistic, and this has been the case on the River Tone.|$|E
50|$|The Common <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> {{to conquer}} 30 countries; this <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> {{the same for}} all players.|$|R
50|$|Goats' <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to {{encircle}} Pulis so {{that none}} of the Pulis can move. Puli's <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to kill All Goats.|$|R
50|$|Their first {{military}} <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> the gendarmerie post at Aguas Blancas, but {{the location}} was deemed unsuitable and another <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> not chosen.|$|R
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Copper's {{superior}} conductivity {{enhances the}} efficiency of electrical motors. This is important because motors and motor-driven systems account for 43%–46% of all global electricity consumption and 69% of all electricity used by industry. Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases {{the efficiency of}} the motor. Copper motor rotors, a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design <b>objectives,</b> <b>are</b> enabling general-purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) premium efficiency standards.|$|E
5|$|For {{commercial}} use, varieties with {{a minimum}} stem length of 30cm are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only open when they reach the retail outlet. For garden plants the <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, {{and there is a}} particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types. The main species used in breeding are N. bulbocodium, N. cyclamineus, N. jonquilla, N. poeticus, N. pseudonarcissus, N. serotinus and N. tazetta.|$|E
30|$|Feasible State S(1): When an <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> defined with {{sufficient}} information and enough resources {{to achieve the}} <b>objective</b> <b>are</b> available, then the requirement is in ‘feasible state’.|$|R
30|$|Objectives: The primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to {{identify}} {{risk factors for}} VAP related to ESBLE. Secondary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to determine the impact of ESBLE on outcome of VAP patients.|$|R
50|$|Their second <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> {{to secure}} their control of the Hunan-Guangxi and Guangzhou-Hankou railways. A third <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to preemptively disrupt the planned Chinese {{offensive}} in the region.|$|R
5|$|Mad Maxs quest design also {{received}} mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised {{the content and}} activities scattered across the world, calling the activities engaging for most players. However, he disliked the repetition which dragged down their replay value. Hurley found it easy for players to become confused in the game's early stages, since the <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> unclear. Brown criticized the structure of several quests which force players to use a certain method, removing freedom and creativity. Chris Carter of Destructoid wrote that the game brought nothing new to the genre, and its quests and features were too similar to typical Ubisoft open-world design.|$|E
5|$|The Lost Age {{presents}} a similar traditional role-playing video game formula that its first half pioneered. Players guide {{a cast of}} characters as they journey through a fantasy-themed world, interact with other characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful magic spells and equipment, and {{take part in a}} building, predefined narrative. While many actions the player takes are compulsory and central to the story, The Lost Age allows the player to complete many objectives in the order of their choice, visiting previous locations to advance story elements and complete gameplay <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> given a stronger emphasis than in the previous game.|$|E
5|$|The Public Library of Gaza {{is located}} off Wehda Street {{and has a}} {{collection}} of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about , the building consists of two floors and a basement. The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkerque, and the World Bank. The library's primary <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> to provide sources of information that {{meets the needs of}} beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.|$|E
50|$|While {{the concept}} of <b>objectives</b> <b>is</b> central in output orientation, the other four ideas (managerial {{effectiveness}}, effectiveness areas, measurement areas and authority areas) are the foundations of any <b>objectives</b> that <b>are</b> set; and only {{with an understanding of}} these will the <b>objectives</b> <b>be</b> sound.|$|R
30|$|Network client {{data are}} the {{messages}} exchanged in a service session {{and the corresponding}} <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> the violation of the confidentiality of the client whereas meta-data is information related to the client's location and service usage profile and the <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> the violation of {{the privacy of the}} client. Primarily, this <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> related to external adversaries and dishonest network operators.|$|R
50|$|The first Soviet {{atomic bomb}} test {{occurred}} on 29 August 1949 and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) subsequently identified SAC's primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to damage or destroy the Soviet Union's {{ability to deliver}} nuclear weapons. The JCS further defined SAC's secondary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to stop any Soviet advances into Western Europe, and its tertiary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> the previous EWP 1-49 industrial mission.|$|R
5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops have closed. The player has fewer correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts a greater emphasis on hyperbolic fun.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music who {{had gone}} to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is {{independent}} from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its general <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of A Village Romeo and Juliet by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.|$|E
5|$|Power remains {{relatively}} inexpensive along the Columbia, {{and in recent}} years high-tech companies like Google have begun to move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power. Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington public utility districts to ensure flow, flood control, and power generation <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are required to meet standards under the US Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.|$|E
30|$|Objectives: Our primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> {{correlation}} between SIG (strong ion difference) in donor and graft function. Secondary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> comparison between SIG and marginal graft criteria {{as a predictor}} for liver transplantation outcome.|$|R
30|$|The primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> {{to assess}} the gas {{interchange}} improvement with PP. The secondary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to compare the outcomes of these patients {{with those of the}} general population of our LT recipients.|$|R
50|$|A list of <b>objectives</b> <b>was</b> {{included}} in the 2015 Business Case. However, the Business Case and list of <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> written retrospectively, long after state and federal funding for the project was announced.|$|R
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is mostly}} unchanged {{from the previous}} games; the player controls the main character from an overhead perspective, and the controls are largely {{the same as those}} of previous games. As with previous games, the main <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> to catch all of the Pokémon in the games and defeat the Elite Four (a group of Pokémon trainers); also like their predecessors, the games' main subplot involves the main character defeating a criminal organization that attempts to take over the region. New features, such as double battles and Pokémon abilities along with 135 new Pokémon, have been added. As the Game Boy Advance is more powerful than its predecessors, four players may be connected at a time instead of the previous limit of two. Additionally, the games can be connected to an e-Reader or other advanced generation Pokémon games.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{isolated}} {{nature of the}} site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example, herbicides, thought to be generally damaging for the species richness, could get onto the site from the drift of spray from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged. As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable, {{which means that the}} land is being adequately conserved and any conservation <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> being met, but that there is scope for enhancement of the site. The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments. In the future it is hoped that the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority.|$|E
5|$|When all mission <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> completed, {{the player}} {{is given the}} option to make a {{hyperspace}} jump to end the level. This may be postponed in order to gather more resources or build more ships. When the hyperspace jump is initiated, all fighters return to the mothership while larger ships line up next to it, and blue rectangles pass over the ships and teleport them to the next level. The player retains their fleet between levels, {{and the difficulty of}} each mission is adjusted to a small extent based on how many ships are in the player's fleet {{at the beginning of each}} level. In multiplayer games, the objective is typically to destroy the enemy motherships, though other battle-oriented victory conditions are available. The mothership is capable of movement, and as there are no levels, the research done at the research vessel follows a technology tree with each upgrade or ship design taking a set amount of time, rather than also being dependent on a plot point. Multiple maps are available, as are options to turn off the need to research technologies or fuel consumption for smaller ships.|$|E
40|$|The first <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to {{investigate}} if intracellular and extracellular levels of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) within the mouse aorta increase before or after diet-induced lesion formation. The second <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> {{to investigate}} if intracellular and extracellular ROS correlates to cell composition in atherosclerotic lesions. The third <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to investigate if intracellular and extracellular ROS levels within established atherosclerotic lesions can be reduced by lipid lowering by diet or atorvastatin...|$|R
30|$|Our main <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to {{determine}} whether an optimised infusion line for insulin therapy had any impact on glycaemic variability and patient outcome. Secondary <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> to {{study the effects of}} other blood glucose parameters.|$|R
50|$|Commonly, a {{microscope}} <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> {{used to collect}} the object wave front. However, as the microscope <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> only used to collect light and not to form an image, it may {{be replaced by a}} simple lens. If a slightly lower optical resolution is acceptable, the microscope <b>objective</b> may <b>be</b> entirely removed.|$|R
25|$|The <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> to {{preserve}} the area due to its environmental and cultural importance.|$|E
25|$|The basic <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> {{to protect}} the {{livelihoods}} {{and culture of the}} traditional populations, and to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.|$|E
25|$|The <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> {{to ensure}} full {{protection}} of fauna, flora and natural beauty, {{and to support}} education, recreational and scientific activities.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between constraints and <b>objectives</b> <b>is</b> straightforward: a constraint is a design target {{that must be}} met for the design to be successful. For example, a chip {{may be required to}} run at a specific frequency so it can interface with other components in a system. In contrast, an <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> a design target where more(or less) is better. For example, yield <b>is</b> generally an <b>objective,</b> which <b>is</b> maximized to lower manufacturing cost. For the purposes of design closure, the {{distinction between}} constraints and <b>objectives</b> <b>is</b> not important; this article uses the words interchangeably.|$|R
40|$|The first <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to {{evaluate}} current two-equation and second order closure turbulence models using available direct numerical simulations and experiments, {{and to identify}} the models which represent {{the state of the}} art in turbulence modeling. The second <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to study the near-wall behavior of turbulence, and to develop reliable models for an engineering calculation of turbulence and transition. The third <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> to develop a two-scale model for compressible turbulence...|$|R
30|$|The primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to {{evaluate}} the factors independently associated with antifungal de-escalation. Secondary <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> {{to evaluate}} the incidence of de-escalation of antifungal treatment, {{and its impact on}} ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mortality.|$|R
