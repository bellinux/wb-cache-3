40|$|Abstract: The Internet was {{originally}} conceived as an open, loosely linked computer network that would facilitate the free exchange of data.

But over the years security functionalities in Internet Model have evolved much faster than the model itself. Multiple security functionalities are available at each layer offering redundant services. This paper gives {{a brief description of}} all the security issues and available <b>security</b> <b>features</b> at each layer. Also proposes that combining and moving basic data <b>security</b> <b>features</b> to Transport Layer provides efficient end to end security thus to avoid redundancy in security services and to balance trade-off between security and performance.

40|$|Abstract—Usability {{is arguably}} {{one of the}} most {{significant}} social topics and issues within the field of cybersecurity today. Supported by the need for confidentiality, integrity, availability and <b>other</b> concerns, <b>security</b> <b>features</b> have become standard components of the digital environment which pervade our lives requiring use by novices and experts alike. As <b>security</b> <b>features</b> are exposed to wider cross-sections of the society, it is imperative that these functions are highly usable. This is especially because poor usability in this context typically translates into inadequate application of cybersecurity tools and functionality, thereby ultimately limiting their effectiveness. With this goal of highly usable security in mind, there have been a plethora of studies in the literature focused on identifying security usability problems and proposing guidelines and recommendations to address them. Our paper aims to contribute to the field by consolidating a number of existing design guidelines and defining an initial core list for future reference. Whilst investigating this topic, we take the opportunity to provide an up-to-date review of pertinent cybersecurity usability issues and evaluation techniques applied to date. We expect this research paper to be of use to researchers and practitioners with interest in cybersecurity systems which appreciate the human and social elements of design. Index Terms—Cybersecurity; system usability; usable security; guidelines and recommendations; social cybersecurity issues I...|$|R

40|$|A new {{standard}} in network security for industrial control systems {{is about to}} be released by a number of working groups within the ISA 99 organization. ABB has a certification program for network components that may be used together with the control system 800 xA, which is named Industrial IT Certification. ABB now wants to introduce formal testing of network component’s <b>security</b> <b>features</b> according to this standard. The document IEC 62443 - 4 - 2 is the document within this standard that describes how the system requirements should be implemented on network components. This document is still a draft, so the document IEC 62443 - 3 - 3 which describes how the system requirements should be implemented on a whole industrial control system has been used to estimate the content of IEC 62443 - 4 - 2 when it is finished. Out of these two documents the requirements has been broken down into a test description which contains a number of tests to check which <b>security</b> <b>features</b> a switch has and that they work as described. Together with the test description, a test record template has been created to be used for documenting the result from the tests. Finally a comparison was made where the results from a number of different network equipment could be compared against each <b>other</b> regarding their <b>security</b> <b>features.</b> This comparison will in the future make it easier for ABB’s customers when they {{are in the process of}} buying new network equipment. In short the more expensive brands of switches have in general more <b>security</b> <b>features</b> implemented, and desktop switches has more <b>security</b> <b>features</b> implemented than industrial switches, with certain exceptions. The buyer needs to ask himself if he really needs all the <b>security</b> <b>features.</b> The choice of what switch to buy all depends on the placement of the switch and what purpose it should fulfill...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{scholarly}} {{studies have}} examined the effect of the Social Security retirement test on the labor supply of older workers. Virtually all of this research indicates that the effect is probably small and that eliminating the test would have a minor impact on the work activity of older Americans. There are several reasons for this conclusion. First, retirement decisions are known to be influenced by many other factors including private pensions, Social Security benefit levels, health, job opportunities, family circumstances, and personal preferences for work. These other determinants appear to be dominant. Second, <b>other</b> Social <b>Security</b> <b>features,</b> particularly the actuarial adjustment for early retirement, the delayed retirement credit, and the automatic benefit recomputation provision, significantly offset much of the retirement test’s apparent penalty. Third, the test has been substantially Gberalized over the years, permitting beneficiaries to earn more money without loss of benefits. Although earlier, more stringent, forms of the test may have posed significant work disincentives, the current rules are far less restrictive. Fourth, some beneficiaries are undoubtedly sensitive to the retirement test and respond by making important adjustments in their labor-supply plans. Nonetheless, the relatively small size of this group limits any impact that their response can have when the aggregate behavior of millions of people is measured...|$|R
