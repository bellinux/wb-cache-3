However, unless disaster strikes close to home, we easily forget and move <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> own <b>lives.</b> A culture should never be forgotten. Itshould leave a lasting imprint on the world around it. A year after I visited the northern coast of Japan, much of the area was destroyed by an earthquake that triggered a tsunami. An area full of life and culture was decimated {{in only a few}} hours. The places I went, and the monuments I visited, undoubtedly look much different {{in the aftermath of the}} tsunami. However, we should not forget what these places were like before. We should not forget the life that once filled these communities. In a series of woodblock prints, I tried to capture life the way it was prior to the devastation of the tsunami. Each print represents a place in Japan as I remember it, and not what it has become since the earthquake. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

Susan's father, David Renhard, a retired law lecturer, said shortly after the verdict was announced: [...] "It has been a very stressful and emotional week.

5000|$|On 8 March 1999, Ingham {{was bound}} over {{to keep the}} peace at Croydon Magistrates Court after he was accused of causing {{criminal}} damage to a Mercedes car owned by Linda Cripps, a neighbour, in Purley, south London. The charges were dropped when Ingham agreed to accept being bound over for 12 months in the sum of £1,000 {{to keep the peace}} and be of good behaviour. Ingham denied that he had caused any damage to the vehicle. The Court was told that Mrs Cripps told Sir Bernard: [...] "You have damaged my car", to which he replied [...] "Good, I'm glad". Ingham denied he had damaged the car and said, [...] "I did not cause the damage complained of and to resolve the issue I accepted advice that I should agree to be bound over.

But from real experience comes a realisation of beauty in being broken; that in the midst of our hurts comes a healing {{that may or may not}} be expected. Produced by Ben Shive (Andrew Peterson, Sara Groves), this album is able to highlight some of the things that we as listeners may try to cover up, reminding us to unveil what is holding us back, both to our creator and our fellow creation, understanding full well that ‘…at the end of me, that’s where You start…’ (‘At the End of Me’). With a mixture of upbeat and reflective moments, from country style ‘The Broken’, the honest ‘At the End of Me’ and the humble worship piano-driven melody ‘Sing of Your Glory’, this album is certain to assert itself as one of the best albums in October 2012." [...] Andre wrote that overall the album is [...] "...not as musically driven as many other albums released throughout the year (from artists like TobyMac, Luminate, Bellarive, Britt Nicole or MercyMe); Bebo’s acknowledgement of some of the darkest parts of himself, yet equally show us his source of strength and courage throughout his difficult moments is a miracle, bringing testament to Christ as Bebo unveils his most personal album to date. With much of these songs along the vein of previous ones like ‘Pull Me Out’, ‘Sing Over Me’ and ‘Cover Me’, Light of Distant Cities offers us a hope for our souls and the motivation to press <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> when times feel like it’s slipping away, or if there seems to be a circumstance we cannot rid ourselves of. With a myriad of musical genres, from anthems to acoustics and reflective keyboard-prominent songs, these eleven melodies that make up the album are some of the most challenging, confronting and rewarding that Bebo has ever produced, making it one of the most satisfying musical experiences of October 2012. Well done Bebo for such an awe-inspiring and enjoyable album!" ...|$|E

40|$|Both common {{intuition and}} {{findings}} from multiple {{areas of research}} suggest that when faced with distressing experiences, {{it is helpful to}} understand one’s feelings. However, a large body of research also indicates that people’s attempts to make sense of their feelings often backfire, leading them to ruminate and feel worse. In this article, we describe a program of research that focuses on disentangling these seemingly contradictory sets of findings. The research program we describe proposes that psychological distance from the self {{plays a key role in}} determining whether people’s attempts to understand their feelings lead to adaptive or maladaptive self-reflection. It suggests that people’s attempts to understand their feelings often fail because they analyze their feelings from a self-immersed perspective rather than a self-distanced perspective. Empirical evidence from multiple levels of analysis is presented to support this prediction. The basic science and clinical implications of these findings are discussed. Many of us have the intuitive belief that understanding our reactions to negative experiences will empower us, enabling us to gain closure and move <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> (e. g., Smith & Alloy, 2009). However, decades of research examining the implications of selfreflectio...|$|E
40|$|In {{traditional}} logic, {{one feature}} {{of the notion of}} proposition is that it can stand either true or false. A proposition can be tested, confirmed, and verifiedor falsified. In exact and empirical sciences, such an understanding of proposition holds sway. To be meaningful in the empirical or scientific sense, a proposition must have a truth-valuei. e., it should either be true or false. In ordinary life, it is important that our statements should also be capable of being tested and demonstrated as true or false. This is necessary to get on with our day-to-day living. That the statement The train leaves at 9 : 33 A. M.  is verifiable speaks {{a great deal about the}} necessity of having some viable order in the practical realm so that we can get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives.</b> There are, however, statements in our daily existencestatements havinga propositional formthat are meaningful but are not capable of being tested, demonstrated, and verified. God exists, Nature is One, and There is life after death, are such statements. They are called pivot-propositions. But pivot-propositions are actually not propositions. They are presuppositionsthings that we simply take for grantedwhich belong to the sphere of religious beliefs, communal convictions, and artistic intimations. More importantly, they form the world-view of a group of people sharing the same heritage, tradition, and cultural equipment. R. G. Collingwood and Ludwig Wittgenstein are interested in the fascinating and peculiar role that pivot-propositions play in our way of thinking, judging, and coping with things in the practical domain of human existence. The pivot-propositions are essentially the background to our thoughts, the standard of our judgments, and the motivating force of our actions. In a word, they shape the way we relate with the world around us and the way we manage things within our cultural matrix. Despite the differences in philosophical background, temper, and style,Collingwood and Wittgenstein basically articulate the same views on pivot-propositionsexhibiting an intellectual affinity that runs deep. The main burden of this dissertation is to explore this intellectual kinship as gleaned from their convergent construal of pivot-propositions in On Certainty (Wittgenstein) and An Essay on Metaphysics (Collingwood). It also attempts to situate the theme of pivot-propositions within the broader spectrum of their philosophical interests. This dissertation proposes the thesis that Collingwoods and Wittgensteins intellectual bondas exemplified in their notions of pivot-propositionsis forged by their common bent of mind. They are philosophers who think in terms of overlap and family-resemblances. This is underlying reason why their thoughts do not only articulate similar insights on pivot-propositions; they also converge at the crossroads of their discourses on language, ethics, aesthetics, and magic. Given the distinctive turn of mind, Collingwood and Wittgenstein are, at bottom, two thinkers who are mindful to the constantly changing disclosures of being. status: publishe...|$|E
