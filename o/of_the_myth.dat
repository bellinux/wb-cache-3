5|$|Ancient Greek and Roman writers, who {{described}} Egyptian religion late in its history, recorded {{much of the}} Osiris myth. Herodotus, in the 5th century BCE, mentioned parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in his description of Egypt in The Histories, and four centuries later, Diodorus Siculus provided a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in his Bibliotheca historica. In the early 2nd century AD, Plutarch wrote the most complete ancient account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in De Iside et Osiride, an analysis of Egyptian religious beliefs. Plutarch's account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> is the version that modern popular writings most frequently retell. The writings of these classical authors may give a distorted view of Egyptian beliefs. For instance, De Iside et Osiride includes many interpretations of Egyptian belief that are influenced by various Greek philosophies, and its account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> contains portions with no known parallel in Egyptian tradition. Griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from Greek mythology, and that the work {{as a whole was}} not based directly on Egyptian sources. His colleague John Baines, on the other hand, says that temples may have kept written accounts of myths, which later were lost, and that Plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative.|$|E
5|$|Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> {{appear in}} a wide variety of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. Greek and Roman writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E
5|$|While Ovid's retelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> is {{the more}} famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he {{finished}} the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8. Many of these sources were doubtless available to Ovid during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments. In his version, Ovid recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> it {{is the basis for}} many later works.|$|E

5|$|In {{iconographic}} representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> of Shiva vis-à-vis Vishnu, Sharabha form {{has been}} built around Narasimha but substantially embellished with wings to represent Kali and Durga to denote the female powers (shaktis) of Shiva; Sharabha is also shown with a bird head and a serpent in his beak head.|$|E
5|$|In later {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> the intoxicant smearing on Putana's breast {{is replaced}} with poison or the milk itself {{is said to}} be poisoned. Another version of the tale portrays Putana as stealing Krishna at night, when everyone else is asleep.|$|E
5|$|In many {{renditions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> Manasa {{is depicted}} as being quite dependent on Neta (traditionally imagined as a washerwoman) for ideas and moral support. In fact, of the two, Manasa is often the stupider one - a curious instance of anthropomorphism.|$|E
25|$|Old Dutch mythology {{can mean}} <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> told in Old Dutch {{language}} specifically, however many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> in this language are ancient {{and part of}} larger movements across Europe, such as Roman mythology that spread through the Roman Empire, and Continental Germanic mythology.|$|R

50|$|According to {{the ancient}} Greek {{historian}} Plutarch, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> were created {{in order to give}} credits to the Numidian king Juba II who considered himself a descendent of Diodorus and Hercules.|$|R
5|$|Martial also {{suggests}} {{the rape of}} a woman by a bull in a re-creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> of Pasiphaë. Nero had provided a similar entertainment at an event he had staged using an actor dressed in the costume of a bull, though Martial claims that the act performed at the inaugural games was authentic.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{scholarship}} examined Rommel's {{attitude towards}} National Socialism, his {{performance as a}} military commander, {{his role in the}} 20 July plot and his motivations, leading to a more diverse range of interpretations of Rommel and the elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth.</b>|$|E
5|$|A final {{difference}} in Plutarch's account is Horus's birth. The form of Horus that avenges {{his father has}} been conceived and born before Osiris's death. It is a premature and weak second child, Harpocrates, who is born from Osiris's posthumous union with Isis. Here, two of the separate forms of Horus that exist in Egyptian tradition have been given distinct positions within Plutarch's version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth.</b>|$|E

5|$|Basically, the {{parallels}} concern {{the presence of}} first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, the Iliad itself has also been examined in a similar light. The ultimate structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> then, is that the three estates of Proto-Indo-European society were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.|$|E
5|$|James Richard Ellis {{has argued}} that the incest taboo is {{fundamental}} to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid's version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for if she and her father were animals, there would be no bar to their union.|$|E
5|$|Other {{types of}} {{religious}} texts give {{evidence for the}} myth, such as two Middle Kingdom texts: the Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus and the Ikhernofret Stela. The papyrus describes the coronation of Senusret I, whereas the stela alludes to events in the annual festival of Khoiak. Rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of the Osiris myth. The most complete ancient Egyptian account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> is the Great Hymn to Osiris, an inscription from the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550–1292 BCE) that gives the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail. Another important source is the Memphite Theology, a religious narrative that includes an account of Osiris's death {{as well as the}} resolution of the dispute between Horus and Set. This narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus represent with Ptah, the creator deity of Memphis. The text was long thought to date back to the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE) and was treated as a source for information about the early stages in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth.</b> Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates to the New Kingdom at the earliest.|$|E

50|$|Differing interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> divide vampire society. The Sabbat, for example, take <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> quite {{literally}} {{and believe that}} it is their purpose to defend vampires from <b>the</b> depredations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancients. The Camarilla is more dismissive, either claiming that Cain {{is nothing more than a}} myth or metaphor or outright suppressing <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> and their study. Contentions between the different societies surrounding <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> vampires and Gehenna are important in-game motivations for the Jyhad that color <b>the</b> character's understanding <b>of</b> their world. Regardless as to whether or not <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> are true in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> Cain represents important themes presented in the metaplot such as sins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> father coming back upon his children, <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> apocalypse, questions of faith, conspiracies, and war of ages.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> written biographies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian missionaries to the Netherlands, sermonizing against pre-Christian beliefs, are coincidentally some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{earliest}} written accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> {{that existed}} in the region. The missionary texts written by the incoming Christian missionaries in the 7th century and 8th century recorded details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-Christian <b>myths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native culture, although the missionaries showed religious hostility to them as pagan beliefs. <b>The</b> main missionaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands were Willibrord, Bonifatius and Saint Eligius.|$|R
5|$|The most {{familiar}} form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> was recounted in the Metamorphoses of Ovid, {{and the story}} {{was the subject of}} the most famous work (now lost) of the poet Helvius Cinna. Several alternate versions appeared in the Bibliotheca, the Fabulae of Hyginus, and the Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis, with major variations depicting Myrrha's father as the Assyrian king Theias or depicting Aphrodite as having engineered the tragic liaison. Critical interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> has considered Myrrha's refusal of conventional sexual relations to have provoked her incest, with the ensuing transformation to tree as a silencing punishment. It has been suggested that the taboo of incest marks the difference between culture and nature and that Ovid's version of Myrrha showed this. A translation of Ovid's Myrrha, done by English poet John Dryden in 1700, has been interpreted as a critique of the society of that day linking Myrrha to Mary II and Cinyras to James II.|$|E
5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which {{family members or}} hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, the gifts to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.|$|E
5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> can {{be found}} first in Rommel's drive for success as a young officer in World War I, and then in his popular 1937 book Infanterie Greift An (Infantry Attacks) that was written in a style that diverged from the German {{military}} literature of the time. The book became a bestseller, and was supposedly read by Adolf Hitler.|$|E

5|$|The rivalry of Horus and Set {{is portrayed}} in two {{contrasting}} ways. Both perspectives appear {{as early as}} the Pyramid Texts, the earliest source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth.</b> In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Myth</b> of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
