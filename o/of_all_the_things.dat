5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of and <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat {{and the idea of}} Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E

The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes a list <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he wants to do before death.|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} is explicitly {{told that he}} is reacting normally to extreme stress {{and is expected to}} recover and return to full duty in a few hours or days. A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment. <b>Of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> said to a Service member suffering from combat stress, the words of his small-unit leader have the greatest impact due to the positive bonding process that occurs during combat. Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders should tell Service members that their comrades need and expect them to return. When they do return, the unit treats them as every other Service member and expects them to perform well. Service members suffering and recovering from combat stress disorder are no more likely to become overloaded again than are those who have not yet been overloaded. In fact, {{they are less likely to}} become overloaded than inexperienced replacements.|$|E

500|$|Lynch is an {{advocate}} {{for health care reform}} but split with his party on Obama's health care reform efforts. He voted in November 2009 to pass the Affordable Health Care for America Act (AHCAA), the House's health care reform bill. This bill was scrapped by Congressional leaders in favor of the Senate's bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Despite pressure from Obama and Democratic leaders, Lynch stated that he would oppose the PPACA until [...] "they put reform back in the health reform bill." [...] He described the Senate bill as a [...] "surrender" [...] to insurance companies, putting too little pressure on insurance companies to reduce costs, and that did not represent meaningful reform. He explained, [...] "There's a difference between compromise and surrender, right? And this is a complete surrender <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that people thought were important to health care reform." [...] When the PPACA came to a House vote in March 2010, he was the only U.S. representative from New England to vote against it.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} by the moniker KJB {{watched the}} episode for IGN, giving it {{one out of}} five stars. He said it was [...] "like watching a television episode made up <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> from the 'Stuff We've Tried That Doesn't Work on Star Trek list." [...] Criticism was directed at the introduction of the MACOs, which were described as Starship Troopers clones, and at the modification to the theme tune. The Xindi themselves were described as [...] "bad Farscape knock offs", and the reviewer said that they set a poor tone {{for the rest of the}} season. Michelle Erica Green said she was in a [...] "double mind" [...] about [...] "The Xindi" [...] in her review at TrekNation as there were both good and bad elements. She praised the action sequences, the make-up and McHattie as the alien foreman. Green enjoyed the twist at the end with the Xindi homeworld being already destroyed, and felt that the Xindi races would be interesting. On the other hand, she thought that the MACO scenes were too dark and that the T'Pol nude scenes were unnecessary.|$|E

When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either.

500|$|Paine begins The Age of Reason {{by attacking}} revelation. Revelation, he maintains, {{can only be}} {{verified}} by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God's existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles, writing: [...] "it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it". He {{also points out that}} the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time to adjust for changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging and universal evidence of God's existence is the natural world. [...] "The Bible of the Deist", he contends, should not be a human invention such as the Bible, but rather a divine invention—it should be [...] "creation". Paine takes this argument even further, maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of The Age of Reason, he will do just this, pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible. For example Thomas Paine notes, [...] " [...] The most extraordinary <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him {{to the top of a}} high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World. How happened it that he did not discover America, or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest? [...] " ...|$|E

500|$|Guitar {{was viewed}} by Sharrock as the {{culmination}} of a period in his career spent developing his sense of composition. After releasing his first record—Black Woman—in 1969, he experimented with different influences during the 1970s. When he recorded [...] "Dance with Me Montana" [...] in 1982, the song's chord progression changed his perspective on composing and inspired him to pursue more melodic ideas. [...] "You listen to , and it's like a blind man struggling {{to get out of a}} room", Sharrock recalled. [...] "Guitar was a crystallization <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that I had discovered in that song." [...] In the early 1980s, he had also worked on projects with Material, an experimental band fronted by Bill Laswell, who helped Sharrock produce the album.|$|R
