5|$|Article 15 prohibits {{discrimination}} on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them. This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals, with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds. However, the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived {{and in need of}} special protection. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them. It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service, as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion.|$|E

Peirce also interviewed Tisdel's mother and Brandon's friends. However, she was unable to interview Brandon's mother <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his biological family.

5|$|After the battle, Browning {{was awarded}} the Order of Polonia Restituta (II class) by the Polish government-in-exile, but his {{critical}} evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat {{for the failure of}} Market Garden. Montgomery attached no blame to Browning <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his subordinates, or indeed acknowledged failure at all.

5|$|Duane Roger Morrison (July 23, 1953 – September 27, 2006) was {{eventually}} {{identified as the}} perpetrator of the incident. He was unemployed {{at the time of}} the hostage crisis, and had no known connection to Platte Canyon High School <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the hostages. Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35-year-old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt. Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for larceny and possession of marijuana, and was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton, Colorado. Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the FBI. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico, Virginia. In the 14-page letter, Morrison claimed that he was mentally and physically abused by his father as a child, and had suicidal thoughts since he was 21 years old.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E

The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it was wrong to blame the World Wrestling Federation <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E

They develop a friendship in which both Nell and Brooke hold secret admiration and love for the other, but are unable to express it because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> several other women to succumb to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E
5|$|The Cultural and Educational rights, {{given in}} Articles 29 and 30, are {{measures}} {{to protect the rights}} of cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, by enabling them to conserve their heritage and protecting them against discrimination. Article 29 grants any section of citizens having a distinct language, script culture of its own, the right to conserve and develop the same, and thus safeguards the rights of minorities by preventing the State from imposing any external culture on them. It also prohibits discrimination against any citizen for admission into any educational institutions maintained or aided by the State, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, language <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them. However, this is subject to reservation of a reasonable number of seats by the State for socially and educationally backward classes, as well as reservation of up to 50percent of seats in any educational institution run by a minority community for citizens belonging to that community.|$|E
