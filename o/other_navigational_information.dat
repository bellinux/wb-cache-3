40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the participation of}} DAEDALUS team at the WebPS- 3 Task 1, regarding Web People Search. The focus of our research is to evaluate and compare the computational requirements and results achieved by different solutions based on the minimization of cost functions applied to clustering algorithms. Our clustering technique {{is based on an}} implementation of k-Medoids algorithm, run over a sparse term-document matrix built with the terms of the pages that are associated to each of the person names. We define an empty-cluster that holds all the individuals that are not part of any other cluster. Based on the results obtained, we can conclude that although clustering techniques play a very relevant role in the resolution of the problem of name homonymy in a set of web pages, there is a previous challenge still to solve: how to determine which contents are relevant for describing the person in that webpage, thus which {{are not part of the}} <b>other</b> <b>navigational</b> <b>information</b> contained in the webpage...|$|E
40|$|Desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, forage {{for dead}} {{arthropods}} in the Tunisian salt pans. Both the unpredictable food distribution {{and the high}} surface temperatures might account {{for the fact that}} the ants do not use any pheromone trails. However, Cataglyphis has been shown to still use olfactory cues for navigation. For instance, the ants locate sparsely distributed food or pinpoint their inconspicuous nest entrance by following odour plumes. In this study we found that, as well as using odours to pinpoint a target, the ants might use environmental odours as olfactory landmarks when following habitual routes. When analysing odours collected at 100 positions in the desert, we found spatially distinct gradients of a range of different environmental odorants. Furthermore we confirm that individual foragers followed forager-specific routes when leaving the nest. Therefore these ants could potentially learn such olfactory landscape features along their stable routes. We, hence, asked whether ants could learn and use olfactory cues for route guidance. We trained ants to visit a stable feeder and presented them with a sequence of four different odours along the way. Homing ants that had already passed the odour alley on their way back were displaced to a remote test field and released at the starting point of an identical alley. Control ants that experienced the alley only during the test situation focused their search on the release point. Ants that had experienced the odours during training, however, biased their nest search towards the odour alley and performed straight walking segments along the alley. Hence, we found that ants learnt the olfactory cues along their homeward route and used these cues in the absence of <b>other</b> <b>navigational</b> <b>information.</b> Hence, desert ants seem to be able to use odour information to follow routes...|$|E

40|$|Much {{evidence}} has accumulated in recent years, demonstrating {{that the degree}} to which navigating insects rely on path integration or landmark guidance when displaced depends on the <b>navigational</b> <b>information</b> content of their specific habitat. There is thus a need to quantify this information content. Here we present one way of achieving this by constructing 3 D models of natural environments using a laser scanner and purely camera-based methods that allow us to render panoramic views at any location. We provide (1) ground-truthing of such reconstructed views against panoramic images recorded at the same locations; (2) evidence of their potential to map the <b>navigational</b> <b>information</b> content of natural habitats; (3) methods to register these models with GPS or with stereo camera recordings and (4) examples of their use in reconstructing the visual information available to walking and flying insects. We discuss the current limitations of 3 D modelling, including the lack of spectral and polarisation information, but also the opportunities such models offer to map the <b>navigational</b> <b>information</b> content of natural habitats and to test visual navigation algorithms under ‘real-life’ conditions. 22 page(s...|$|R
