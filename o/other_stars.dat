5|$|Canis Major is a {{prominent}} constellation {{because of its}} many bright stars. These include Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris), {{the brightest star in}} the night sky, as well as three <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> above magnitude 2.0. Furthermore, two <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> are thought to have previously outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) shone at -3.99 around 4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam (Beta Canis Majoris) peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million years ago. Another, NR Canis Majoris, will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years' time.|$|E

5|$|On January 6, 2005, {{while the}} Browns were {{still searching for}} a new head coach, the team {{announced}} Phil Savage's appointment as general manager.

5|$|Studies of discs around <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> {{have also}} {{done much to}} {{establish}} a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three million years old have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming.|$|E

5|$|The cosmic {{abundance}} of vanadium {{in the universe}} is 0.0001%, making the element nearly as common as copper or zinc. Vanadium is detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and sometimes {{in the light from}} <b>other</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet telescopes make {{observations}} at ultraviolet wavelengths, i.e. between approximately 10 and 320 nm.

5|$|Lacaille gave six stars Bayer designations, {{labeling}} them Alpha (α) to Zeta (ζ) in 1756, but omitted Epsilon (ε) and designated two adjacent {{stars as}} Gamma (γ).

5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387 was a {{gravitational}} microlensing event {{detected by}} the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics collaboration on July 24, 2009, which searches and documents chance and brief alignments of stars with <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> or objects; such alignments cause a gravitational lens effect, which bends light and causes distorted, but magnified, images {{that can be}} interpreted. The detection of two caustics were logged {{over the next few}} days by the South African Astronomical Observatory, the Perth Observatory, and the Canopus Hill Observatory in Tasmania, with a separation of about seven days between caustic events.|$|E

Francesca Neri played Pazzi's wife, Allegra. Frankie Faison reprised his role as orderly Barney Matthews.|$|E
5|$|Pelé was {{the most}} famous footballer in the world during the 1966 World Cup in England, and Brazil fielded some world champions like Garrincha, Gilmar and Djalma Santos with the {{addition}} of <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> like Jairzinho, Tostão and Gérson, leading to high expectations for them. Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches. The World Cup was marked, among other things, for foulings on Pelé that left him injured by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders.|$|E

5|$|The Hipparcos {{satellite}} also {{measured the}} proper motion of Beta Pictoris: it is traveling eastwards {{at a rate}} of 4.65 milliarcseconds per year, and northwards {{at a rate of}} 83.10 milliarcseconds per year. Measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum reveals it is moving away from Earth at a rate of 20km/s. Several <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> share the same motion through space as Beta Pictoris and likely formed from the same gas cloud at roughly the same time: these comprise the Beta Pictoris moving group.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to <b>other</b> <b>stars,</b> with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to Beta Pictoris and many <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> {{was measured by}} the Hipparcos satellite. This was done by measuring its trigonometric parallax: the slight displacement in its position observed as the Earth moves around the Sun. Beta Pictoris was found to exhibit a parallax of 51.87 milliarcseconds, a value which was later revised to 51.44 milliarcseconds when the data was reanalyzed taking systematic errors more carefully into account. The {{distance to}} Beta Pictoris is therefore 63.4 light years, with an uncertainty of 0.1 light years.|$|E

5000|$|A {{few million}} years ago, Adhara was {{much closer to}} the Sun than it is at present, causing it to be a much {{brighter}} star in the night sky. About 4,700,000 years ago, Adhara was 34 light years from the Sun, and was the brightest star in the sky with a magnitude of [...] - 3.99. No <b>other</b> <b>star</b> has attained this brightness since, nor will any <b>other</b> <b>star</b> attain this brightness for at least five million years.|$|R
5|$|The {{interaction}} {{of stars in}} the collapsed core region causes tight binary systems to form. As <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> interact with these tight binaries, they increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand. As the mean time for a core collapse is typically less than {{the age of the}} galaxy, many of a galaxy's globular clusters may have passed through a core collapse stage, then re-expanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> {{appear to have a}} sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was {{the first}} serious attempt by a {{biologist}} to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet {{in the solar system}} that could possibly support life, mainly {{because it was the only}} one in which water could exist in the liquid phase. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that <b>other</b> <b>stars</b> in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E
