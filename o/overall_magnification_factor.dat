40|$|Summary. The <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> (M) of {{the retina}} is the linear extent of visual striate cortex {{to which each}} degree of the retina projects. It has been {{suggested}} that <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> is directly proportional to visual acuity, but <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> measured in monkeys was compared with visual acuity in man. Here we first describe calculation of the <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> in man, and then compare it to human visual acuity. We calculated 3 / [for the first 30 degrees of the lower visual field by using infor mation provided by Brindley and Lewin (1968), who plotted the distribution of phosphenes evoked by stimulation of visual cortex in a human patient with electrodes implanted on the visual cortex. Since the inter-electrode distance was specified it was possible to calculate M for each of many pairs of electrodes by measuring the angular separation and mean eccentricity of the corresponding pairs of phosphenes. For the lower visual field, M was approximately 4 ram/degree at 2 degrees eccentricity and declined monotonically to 0. 5 ram/degree at 25 degrees eccentricity. The results indicated that the reciprocal of M is directly proportional to the minimum angle of resolution and, correspondingly, that the <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> is directly proportional to visual acuity in man. By extrapolating this function for the whole of the visual field it was possible to estimate the area of striate cortex. The total extent of striate cortex estimated in this way agreed closely with previous direct measurements, suggesting that the measurements of M are accurate.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} super-resolution {{reconstruction}} constraints. In particular, we derive {{a sequence of}} results which all show that the constraints provide far less useful information as the <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> increases. It is well established {{that the use of}} a smoothness prior may help somewhat, however for large enough <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> any smoothness prior leads to overly smooth results. We therefore propose an algorithm that learns recognition-based priors for specific classes of scenes, the use of which gives far better super-resolution results for both faces and text. 1 Introduction Super-resolution is the process of combining multiple low resolution images to form a higher resolution one. Numerous algorithms have been proposed for it, dating back to the frequency domain approach of Huang and Tsai [1984]. In practice, however, the results obtained are mixed.

The sizes of femoral head components in the digital radiographs were estimated using the two scaling methods. The estimated values were then compared to the true values stated in operation records.

40|$|Even when {{provided}} with feedback after every movement, adaptation levels off before biases are completely removed. Incomplete adaptation {{has recently been}} attributed to forgetting: the adaptation is already partially forgotten {{by the time the}} next movement is made. Here we test whether this idea is correct. If so, the final level of adaptation is determined by a balance between learning and forgetting. Because we learn from perceived errors, scaling these errors by a <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> has the same effect as subjects increasing the amount by which they learn from each error. In contrast, {{there is no reason to}} expect scaling the errors to affect forgetting. The <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> should therefore influence the balance between learning and forgetting, and thereby the final level of adaptation.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{discovery}} and a detailed multi-wavelength {{study of a}} strongly-lensed luminous infrared galaxy at z= 0. 816. Unlike most known lensed galaxies discovered at optical or near-infrared wavelengths this lensed source is red, r-Ks = 3. 9 [AB], which the data presented here demonstrate is due to ongoing dusty star formation. The <b>overall</b> lensing <b>magnification</b> (a <b>factor</b> of 17) facilitates observations from the blue optical through to 500 micron, fully capturing both the stellar photospheric emission {{as well as the}} re-processed thermal dust emission. We also present optical and near-IR spectroscopy. These extensive data show that this lensed galaxy is in many ways typical of IR-detected sources at z~ 1, with both a total luminosity and size in accordance with other (albeit much less detailed) measurements in samples of galaxies observed in deep fields with the Spitzer telescope. Its far-infrared spectral energy distribution is well-fit by local templates that are an order of magnitude less luminous than the lensed galaxy; local templates of comparable luminosity are too hot to fit. Its size (D~ 7 kpc) is much larger than local luminous infrared galaxies, but in line with sizes observed for such galaxies at z~ 1. The star formation appears uniform across this spatial scale. In this source, the luminosity of which is typical of sources that dominate the cosmic infrared background, we find that star formation is spatially extended and well organised, quite unlike the compact merger-driven starbursts which are typical for sources of this luminosity at z~ 0.

40|$|Weld toe <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{evaluation}} of stress intensity factors for cracks in welded structures. Traditionally, the weld <b>magnification</b> <b>factor</b> has been determined from 2 -D plane strain models containing edge cracks. However, it has long been recognised that a semi-elliptical weld toe crack cannot be accurately represented by a 2 -D approximation due to the 3 -D nature of the geometry. As a consequence, some recent research has been carried out using 3 -D numerical modelling, which highlights the limitations of the 2 -D approach. Nevertheless, 3 -D solutions are still scarce and are of limited validity due to the difficulties associated with creating the numerical models. This paper reports the most extensive 3 -D numerical investigation of semi-elliptical cracks in T-butt geometries to date. Based on the numerical results, new and accurate equations for weld <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> were derived, which quantify the 3 -D effects present and emphasise the importance of the attachment.
