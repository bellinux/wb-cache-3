At the time, Kenyatta was willing to make concessions to KADU <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> regional authority, aware that he would amend these aspects of the constitution when in office.

5|$|After {{not being}} {{selected}} to become Labour's {{candidate in the}} 2000 London mayoral election, Livingstone successfully contested the election as an independent candidate. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the congestion charge, Oyster card, and articulated buses, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of London Underground. Despite his opposition to Blair's government <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> the Iraq War, Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was re-elected in 2004, expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's East End, his leadership after the 7 July 2005 London bombings was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of 2008 and 2012, losing both to the Conservative candidate Boris Johnson. In 2016, accused of bringing the party into disrepute, he was suspended from Labour.|$|E

That was followed by the launching of United Left Front on 12 August, the tenth anniversary of the 1953 Hartal. ULF launched agitations <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> bring down the prices of essential commodities.

Pope Pius XII often reconsidered previously accepted truth, thus he was first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.|$|E

Zeppelin heard of the success in Russia of Igor Sikorsky's pioneering 4-engined Le Grand and Ilya Muromets aircraft. From the outbreak of war in 1914 the 4-engined Ilya Muromets class of aircraft were used as heavy bombers. The German government saw the potential for large strategic bombers and issued a design standard which was used by several manufacturers to produce Riesenflugzeuge ("Giant Aircraft") or R-Planes. The most successful design and manufacturing company of R-Planes was Zeppelin which was also the only company to manufacture them in series production, the R-VI.|$|E

25|$|The Reformed Churches (Liberated) are {{conservative}} in doctrine and practice. They {{do not allow}} women to hold special offices (elders, deacons, pastors), but in the 1990s they did approve women voting in church elections. They reject so-called Higher Criticism of the Bible. Liturgically, they favour {{the use of the}} Genevan Psalter in their worship services, although in the last decade a number of classical hymns has also been approved for use in the worship service. In recent years evangelical influences have become stronger (e.g. a more contemporary style of the worship, including new songs and hymns and the use of a praise band). A minority of the members and ministers are questioning some traditional doctrines, and are asking for a different approach <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> the ordination of women, homosexual relationships, etc. A large middle group, however, wants to hold on to classical Calvinism.|$|E
25|$|While WASPs {{have been}} {{major players in}} every major American {{political}} party, an exceptionally strong association has existed between WASPs and the Republican Party, both in political activity and popular consciousness. Politicians such as Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts, Prescott Bush of Connecticut and Nelson Rockefeller of New York exemplified the pro-business liberal Republicanism of their social stratum, espousing internationalist views on foreign policy, supporting social programs, and holding liberal views <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> racial integration. A famous confrontation was the 1952 Senate election in Massachusetts where John F. Kennedy, a Catholic of Irish descent, defeated WASP Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.. However the challenge by Barry Goldwater in 1964 to the Eastern Republican establishment helped undermine the WASP dominance. Goldwater himself had solid WASP credentials through his mother, but was instead {{seen as part of}} the Jewish community (despite having little association with it). By the 1980s, the liberal Rockefeller Republican wing of the party was marginalized, overwhelmed by the dominance of the Southern and Western conservative Republicans.|$|E

In May 1993, they married at Horsham, Sussex, and Wheeler gave birth to a daughter soon after. Johnson and his new wife settled in Islington, North London, an area known for its left-liberal intelligentsia. Under the influence of this milieu and his wife, Johnson moved in a more liberal direction <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> climate change, LGBT rights, and race relations. There, the couple had three further children, each given the joint surname of Johnson-Wheeler, who were sent to the local Canonbury Primary School and then private secondary schools. Devoting much time to his children, Johnson authored a book of verse, Perils of the Pushy Parents– A Cautionary Tale, which was published to largely poor reviews.|$|E

He began his career in journalism at The Times but was sacked for falsifying a quotation. He later became The Daily Telegraphs Brussels correspondent, with his articles exerting a strong influence on growing Eurosceptic sentiment among the British right-wing. He was assistant editor from 1994 to 1999 before taking the editorship of The Spectator from 1999 to 2005. Joining the Conservatives, he was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and under party leaders Michael Howard and David Cameron he was in the Shadow Cabinet.

We share the political power with the Chinese. When they need to increase their political support from their community it is very important for them to serve the main concerns of the Chinese. So, why shouldn't we allow that? We can... achieve a win-win situation. This is a purely political move.... Similarly we UMNO Youth have to be often seen as a very racialist political group fighting for the Malay interests.... However, those finished agendas that we have done, such as Islam, Bahasa Melayu [...] and the special status of the Malays, should not be questioned in any circumstance because these are very sensitive issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{has been}} a campaigner on {{equality}} issues and violence against women throughout her political career. Following the SNP Government's announcement of a referendum on Scottish independence she was {{a key figure in}} Better Together, the cross-party movement that sought to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom. Lamont believes that Labour lost the 2011 election because it had lost its direction, and initiated a review of Scottish Labour policy <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> devolution and the party's commitment to free universal public services. Her work won her accolades at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards, for Political Impact of the Year in 2012 and Debater of the Year in 2013. In Parliamentary debates she was perceived by commentators such as The Scotsmans Andrew Whitaker as being an effective opponent to First Minister Alex Salmond, but others, including Richard Seymour of The Guardian, criticised her for clumsiness during television interviews. Lamont resigned as Labour leader in October 2014, making the announcement in a Daily Record interview in which she claimed that senior figures within the UK Labour Party had undermined her attempts to reform the Scottish party, and treated it [...] "like a branch office of London".|$|E

[...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was termed a [...] "mystery" [...] as the singer never mentions who her object of desire in the song is. Lynskey Dorian from The Guardian suggested that Minogue refers to either [...] "a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn't know she exists" [...] as her obsession.

[...] The lyrics of [...] "Fragile" [...] are simple and aim directly at the [...] " [...] heart". [...] "Come into My World" [...] is a [...] "plea for love" [...] as Minogue invites her partner into her life. On the other hand, [...] "Dancefloor" [...] focuses <b>on</b> <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> dealing with an end of a relationship, with Minogue celebrating a break-up by [...] "lose it in the music".|$|E
