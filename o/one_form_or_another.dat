5|$|NEPA {{has been}} emulated, in <b>one</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> {{by more than}} one hundred other countries, and many states have also {{established}} “mini NEPAs.” When national government agencies first started to prepare EISs, there were no professional associations dedicated to the planning and problem solving that NEPA demanded. Subsequently, Caldwell's efforts in formulating NEPA, and later promoting it, led to formation of the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), a national professional association of persons who prepare EISs.|$|E

The evolution of the Portuguese flag is inherently associated with the evolution of the shield.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine {{had said}} that {{thirteen}} songs had been written in the sessions for the album, though only twelve were originally contracted for the album (one of which being a bonus track intended only for the Japanese market). However, it was later revealed that the album was to feature a total of 13 tracks.

5|$|The product {{garnered}} {{large amounts}} of attention on the internet after its discontinuation – at its peak the product was being mentioned in <b>one</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> on average once every 40 seconds. In its third-quarter 2014 earnings report, Burger King admitted that the massive social media attention {{was one of the}} primary reasons it brought the product back. The positive reaction to the reintroduction included over one million mentions on Twitter. This tied into a major push by the company to utilize social media as a free marketing tool to millennials, who overwhelmingly utilize interactive media to communicate and prefer companies that utilize these tools.|$|E
5|$|The {{video game}} Duke Nukem Forever spent fifteen years in development, from 1996 to 2011. It is a first-person shooter for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, {{developed}} by 3D Realms, Triptych Games, Gearbox Software and Piranha Games. It is {{a sequel to}} the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, {{as part of the}} long-running Duke Nukem video game series. Intended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever has become infamous in the video games industry and was considered vaporware due to its severely protracted development schedule; the game had been in development under 3D Realms since 1996. Director George Broussard, one of the creators of the original Duke Nukem game, first announced the title's development in April 1997, and promotional information for the game was released in <b>one</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> from 1997 until its release in 2011.|$|E
5|$|When Diocletian resigned, chaos ensued, {{but after}} the chaos had subsided, most of his reforms {{remained}} in effect. While the Emperor Constantine the Great did enact some revisions to this constitution, the most significant change over the centuries was in {{the abolition of the}} Caesares. Ultimately this constitution survived, in <b>one</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> until the Western Roman Empire fell in 476. Diocletian's division of the Empire into west and east set the stage for ages to come, and was a significant factor behind the ultimate division of the Christian church into western Roman Catholic and eastern Greek Orthodox, while his division of the Empire into prefectures and dioceses is used by the Catholic Church to this day.|$|E

It is clear that different choices of the prior distribution p(θ) may make the integral more or less difficult to calculate, and the product p(x|θ) × p(θ) may take <b>one</b> algebraic <b>form</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> For certain choices of the prior, the posterior has the same algebraic form as the prior (generally with different parameter values).

He dislikes the 'obscurantist' tendencies {{of a lot of}} so-called [...] "theory," [...] but he also deplores the fact that 'historicism in <b>one</b> newish <b>form</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> has become a new orthodoxy.' The most committed historicism, Dollimore claims, 'tends towards a policing of the play whatever else against interpretation. It doesn't just avoid questions of value, but represses them; in other words it's a contextualising which is also, and more fundamentally, a containment.' ...|$|R

60|$|Again, in the towns, street ballads on {{remarkable}} events, {{as early}} {{at least as}} the age of Henry VIII., were written or printed. Knox speaks of ballads on Queen Mary's four Maries. Of these ballads only one is left, {{and it is a}} libel. The hanging of a French apothecary of the Queen, and a French waiting-maid, for child murder, has been transferred to one of the Maries, or rather to an apocryphal Mary Hamilton, with Darnley for her lover. Of this ballad twenty-eight variants--and extremely various they are--were collected by Professor Child in his English and Scottish Popular Ballads (ten parts, 1882- 1898). In <b>one</b> mangled <b>form</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> such ballads would drift at last even to Ettrick Forest.|$|R

40|$|Heterogeneous Reasoning and Mediator Systems (HERMES), first {{proposed}} by Lu, Nerode and Subrahmanian, {{may be used}} to access and logically integrate information from external databases and/or software packages using functions already defined in those domains. When processing queries in HERMES, we need to execute these external programs, and this is often an expensive process, especially when these programs are located at remote sites on, say a network. Consequently, the problem of minimizing access to such external routines without compromising completeness is an important one. In this paper, we will present methods to cache the results of previous computations and use the knowledge about external programs to make intelligent use of the cached information to reduce calls to external programs. 1 Introduction During the past few decades, the world has witnessed a spectacular explosion in the quantity of data available in <b>one</b> electronic <b>form</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> This vast quan- T [...] ...|$|R
