5|$|The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It was {{intended}} as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> protective armour allocation against anti-aircraft artillery. An increase in armour would have meant a decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The ecclesiastical {{forms of}} Byzantine music, {{composed}} to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music, are, today, {{the most well-known}} forms. Ecclesiastical chants were a fundamental part of this genre. Greek and foreign historians agree that the ecclesiastical tones and in general the whole system of Byzantine music {{is closely related to}} the ancient Greek system. It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes the particulars of each musical work's circumstances, are known.|$|E

5|$|Alonso {{returned}} to the team for the , where the engine was retuned to operate {{at a higher level}} <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> the team introduced a range of aerodynamic updates including sidepod fins and a new front wing. However, Alonso and Button still qualified on the penultimate row of the grid ahead of the Manor Marussia drivers Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens. Both cars retired from the race with mechanical problems. The team did not score any points during the first round of flyaway races, struggling with poor reliability and a lack of engine performance; the Chinese Grand Prix was the only race where both cars were classified as finishing. Although Alonso repeated the team's best finish of eleventh place in Bahrain, any hope of improved performance was arrested with the start of the European season at the next round in Spain, where Button finished sixteenth and Alonso retired with brake problems.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} by analysts, the team easily secured a {{berth in the}} 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3â€“2, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals {{for the first time}} in franchise history. Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim. Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting, after a 39-point performance in Game 6. Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.|$|E

25|$|Important {{forms of}} {{intangible}} rewards include praise, recognition and rewards. Intangible rewards are ones from which an employee does not derive any material gain.

If an organization wants to use praise or other intangible rewards effectively, praise should be offered for a high level <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> for things that they employee has control over. Some studies have shown that praise can be as effective as tangible rewards.|$|E
