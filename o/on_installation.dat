5|$|The Arbiter {{is saved}} by the tentacled {{creature}} and meets the Master Chief {{in the bowels of}} the installation. The creature, Gravemind, is the leader of the Flood <b>on</b> <b>Installation</b> 05. The Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the Great Journey would destroy Flood, humans, and Covenant altogether, and sends both the Arbiter and Master Chief to different places to stop Halo's activation. The Master Chief is teleported into High Charity, where a civil war has broken out among the Covenant; In Amber Clad crashes into the city, and Cortana realizes that Gravemind used them as a distraction to infest In Amber Clad and spread the Flood. As the parasite overruns the city, consuming the Prophet of Mercy in the process, the Prophet of Truth orders Tartarus to take Keyes, Johnson, and Guilty Spark to Halo's control room and activate the ring. The Master Chief follows Truth aboard a Forerunner ship leaving the city; Cortana remains behind to destroy High Charity and Halo if Tartarus succeeds in activating the ring.|$|E

25|$|The Flood (originally {{called the}} shaping sickness) is a {{parasite}} which {{is driven by}} a desire to infect, kill or consume all sentient life it encounters. The Flood first appears in , when the Covenant release some captured specimens from stasis <b>on</b> <b>Installation</b> 04; the parasite spreads and threatens to escape the ring, until the Master Chief destabilizes the installation with a massive explosion coming from the Pillar of Autumn. It is also later found in Halo 2 <b>on</b> <b>Installation</b> 05 along with the Gravemind, an enormous tentacled creature that acts as the parasite's central intelligence. In Halo 3, the Flood reaches the Halo Ark using an the giant Covenant ship High Charity. Master Chief then defeats the Flood once again by exploding the replacement for Installation 04, which damages but does not destroy the Ark. The Gravemind, present on the replacement ring when it explodes, accepts defeat, but insists that it will only slow, not stop, the Flood.|$|E

25|$|The 1852 Drainage and Improvement Act {{gave the}} Commissioners wide powers {{to manage the}} river, but created an {{administrative}} structure that was too complex to be workable. With the river in a poor state, James Rendel was appointed as engineer, and began dredging the channel and raising the banks, which cost £124,000. Another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1854, to allow the Commissioners to borrow £325,000 {{to pay for the}} work. A new iron swing bridge was built in Wisbech, to replace a narrow stone bridge which restricted the flow of the river, and although it was tested <b>on</b> <b>installation,</b> it was not operated subsequently. Dams across the river were built at Waldersea and Guyhirn, and an underwater weir was constructed below the bridge at Wisbech. Wisbech Corporation took the Commissioners to court in 1859 for obstructing the river, and when an initial judgement was made in their favour, gangs of men destroyed most of the Waldersea dam overnight. An appeal to the Court of Chancery by the Commissioners also failed, and the dams were removed, as was the Wisbech weir, after an accident involving a train of lighters.|$|E
500|$|The Flood make {{a return}} {{appearance}} in Halo 2, first after being released on a Forerunner facility near Halo, and again <b>on</b> <b>Installation</b> 05 or [...] "Delta Halo". The Flood on Delta Halo {{are led by}} the Gravemind, a massive creature that dwells {{in the bowels of}} the ring. Gravemind brings together the Master Chief and the Arbiter and tasks them with stopping the Covenant leadership from activating the ring. In the meantime, Gravemind infests the human ship In Amber Clad and crashes it into the Covenant space station of High Charity. Once there, the Flood sweep through the city, before Gravemind appears and questions Cortana. As the Flood spread across Halo and infect High Charity in , the Covenant form a blockade in an effort to prevent the parasite from leaving its prison.|$|E
