40|$|Background: to {{investigate}} insulin levels in lean and overweight women {{with and without}} polycystic <b>ovaries.</b> An observational, cross-sectional study at The Northem General Hospital, Sheffield, UK. Methods: sixty-eight women born at Jessop Hospital, Sheffield, between 1952 and 1953 were divided into four groups according {{to the status of}} their polycystic <b>ovaries</b> and body mass index: either > or ~ 25. Therefore, this was an unselected sample, unlike previous studies that have recruited from endocrine clinics or similar. Subjects underwent pelvic ultrasonography to visualize their <b>ovaries</b> in order to diagnose or exclude polycystic <b>ovaries.</b> They all underwent a short insulin tolerance test. Results: women with a body mass index > 25 and with polycystic <b>ovaries</b> were the most insulin resistant. Women with a body mass index of ?? 25 and with normal <b>ovaries</b> were the most insulin sensitive. Women with a body mass index ?? 25 and polycystic <b>ovaries</b> were the more resistant than those with a body mass index > 25 and with normal <b>ovaries.</b> Conclusion: obesity increases insulin resistance, and the presence of polycystic <b>ovaries</b> increases insulin resistance. The presence of polycystic <b>ovaries</b> appears to have a stronger influence than obesity on insulin resistance. This is the first study to demonstrate these relationships using unselected volunteers...|$|R

40|$|Summary. <b>Ovaries</b> from 8 -week-old female NMRI mice in {{different}} stages of the oestrous cycle, or from females neonatally treated with the synthetic oestrogen diethyl-stilboestrol (DES; 5 =n- 0 =-=m for 5 days), were studied histologically and for the ability to synthesize steroids from [3 H]pregnenolone in vitro. Daily doses of 10 =-=m DES or higher resulted in absence of corpora lutea. In <b>ovaries</b> lacking corpora lutea, the interstitial tissue dominated and the cells in this compartment were large with a clear cytoplasm. The steroids synthesized in ovarian homogenates were separated with thin-layer chromatography. The homogeneity of the steroids was checked in recrystallization experiments. Daily doses of 5 =n- 0 =-=m in the neonatal period resulted in pronounced deviations {{in the pattern of}} ovarian steroids synthesized as compared with control <b>ovaries.</b> In DES-exposed <b>ovaries,</b> the synthesis of androstenedione and, above all, progesterone was high while the synthesis of 17 =ahydroxyprogesteroneand testosterone was reduced compared with controls. These results could argue for a difference in activities of 17 =ahydroxylaseand 17 =bol-dehydrogenasein <b>ovaries</b> from DES-treated females compared with controls. After transplantation of DES-exposed <b>ovaries</b> to ovariectomized control females, the steroid pattern changed to that typical for control <b>ovaries.</b> Control <b>ovaries</b> transplanted to DES-treated females had a steroid pattern similar to that of DES-exposed <b>ovaries...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{plants are}} scapose, having a single central {{leafless}} hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves {{arise from the}} bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the <b>ovary,</b> then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendent), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The <b>ovary</b> is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} LH matures {{the egg and}} weakens {{the wall of the}} {{follicle}} in the <b>ovary,</b> causing the fully developed follicle to release its secondary oocyte. The secondary oocyte promptly matures into an ootid and then becomes a mature ovum. The mature ovum has a diameter of about 0.2mm.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the <b>ovary.</b> Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} and efficacy of cryopreservation of <b>ovaries,</b> we developed a new method termed in situ oocyte (ISO) cryopreservation. ISO cryopreservation is a multistep procedure that involves aspiration of follicular fluid and then perfusion of antral follicles and diffusion of whole buffalo <b>ovaries</b> with cryoprotectant agent (CPA), rapid cooling, storage, thawing and, finally, dilution and removal of the CPA with return to physiological environment. Our study compared ISO cryo <b>ovaries</b> with cryo-diffused <b>ovaries.</b> We systematically {{examined the effects of}} ISO cryo and diffuse cryo on <b>ovaries</b> by morphological examination and with viability tests. The percentages of morphologically normal and viable follicular oocytes from ISO cryo were significantly higher than those that resulted from the cryo-diffused method (p< 0. 01).

40|$|The <b>ovaries</b> of leukaemic {{children}} were studied in 31 specimens obtained at autopsy. Twenty-eight <b>ovaries</b> from normal {{children of the}} same age who died from misadventure served as control. All <b>ovaries</b> from normal childred showed follicle growth and contained several large antral follicles. Follicle development was inhibited in all <b>ovaries</b> of leukaemic children; 22 % showed no follicle growth (quiescent <b>ovaries),</b> and in the <b>ovaries</b> in which there was follicle development, the number and size of antral follicles was significantly smaller than in the control. All children had been treated with cytotoxic drugs, the duration of the treatment being correlated with the stage of ovarian development. The <b>ovaries</b> of children treated for only 1 week were near-normal, while those treated for more than 2 months showed inhibition of follicle growth. It is argued that the disturbance in follicle development is an effect of the cytotoxic drugs, and not an effect of the disease itself...|$|R
5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the <b>ovary</b> lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E
5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the <b>ovary)</b> {{occurs in the}} late summer, and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, with the young being born the following spring to summer. The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} endometriomas on the regulation of early follicular development. DESIGN:Histologic analysis of prospectively collected biopsy samples. SETTING: Research unit in a university hospital. PATIENT(S) : Women < 40 years of age who have ovarian endometriomas. INTERVENTION(S) : Biopsy of healthy cortex from <b>ovaries</b> affected by endometriomas (≤ 4 cm) and contralateral <b>ovaries</b> without cysts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Histomorphological staging of early follicles, measurement of follicle, oocyte, and oocyte nucleus diameters, immunohistochemistry of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and caspase- 3. RESULT(S) : Thirteen cortical samples from <b>ovaries</b> with endometriomas and 13 samples from contralateral <b>ovaries</b> without endometriomas were evaluated. Cortex from <b>ovaries</b> with endometriomas contained significantly more morphologically atretic early follicles than cortex from contralateral <b>ovaries</b> without cysts. These follicles showed cleaved caspase- 3 immunostaining. Diameters of primordial follicles and oocytes were decreased in cortex from <b>ovaries</b> with endometriomas, whereas early follicles with proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive granulosa cells (GCs) were significantly increased in number. CONCLUSION(S) : <b>Ovaries</b> with endometriomas, which may be more prone to local pelvic inflammation, showed activated follicular recruitment and atresia of early follicles. The potential contribution of inflammation to follicle "burnout" in case of endometriomas is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the <b>ovary</b> in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E

40|$|Cryopreservation of the <b>ovaries</b> is {{a useful}} {{technology}} for preservation of germ cells from experimental animals, because if the female founder is infertile or has mutated mitochondrial DNA, preservation of female germ cells is necessary. Although {{it is possible to}} cryopreserve immature mouse <b>ovaries</b> {{with a high degree of}} viability by vitrification with a mixture of several cryoprotectants, the viability of cryopreserved adult mouse <b>ovaries</b> is still unknown. Here, we investigated the viability of mouse <b>ovaries</b> at various ages after cryopreservation by vitrification techniques. Donor <b>ovaries</b> were collected from 10 -day-, 4 -week-, 10 -week- and 7 -month-old, female, nulliparous, green fluorescence protein (GFP) -transgenic mice and cryopreserved by vitrification. The vitrified-warmed <b>ovaries</b> were orthotopically transplanted to 4 - or 10 -week-old mice. GFP-positive pups were obtained in all experimental groups.

40|$|Exposure of A. mellifera {{workers to}} CO 2 has been {{reported}} to decrease life span, induce behavioral changes, and inhibit the development of some glands and the <b>ovaries.</b> However, the use of CO 2 is currently practiced among beekeepers and how the development of workers’ <b>ovaries</b> are affected is unknown. The present work aimed to evaluate the effect of CO 2 on the <b>ovaries</b> of A. mellifera workers, using a morphological approach. Newly emerged, and 3, 5, and 10 -day-old workers were exposed to saturated CO 2 for 30 seconds, more than once. The <b>ovaries</b> were examined under light (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The <b>ovaries</b> of narcotized, 5 -day-old workers exhibited long ovarioles with well-developed germarium, although oogenesis showed little development. While in the control group, the <b>ovaries</b> already exhibited cysts with cystocytes forming rosettes. At 10 -days-old, the <b>ovaries</b> feature was variable; some of the <b>ovaries</b> showed ovarioles with many rosette cysts while others showed a high intensity of disorganization due to the beginning of cell death. The ovarioles of the <b>ovaries</b> of 15 -day-old treated workers were morphologically varied as oogenesis showed little or no advance. In others cases, a complete disorganization with swollen cells and cell death features were observed. Germ cells of the <b>ovaries</b> of CO 2 -treated workers exhibited well-structured organelles, such as the Golgi complex, and larger amounts of mitochondria in the cytoplasm than the control group, but there was disorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum membranes.

40|$|Facultative {{parthenocarpy}} {{induced by}} the recessive mutation pat- 2 in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) depends on gibberellins (GAs) and is associated with changes in GA content in unpollinated <b>ovaries.</b> Polyamines (PAs) have also been proposed {{to play a role}} in early tomato fruit development. We therefore investigated whether PAs are able to induce parthenocarpy and whether the pat- 2 mutation alters the content and metabolism of PAs in unpollinated <b>ovaries.</b> Application of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine to wild-type unpollinated tomato <b>ovaries</b> (cv Madrigal [MA/wt]) induced partial parthenocarpy. Parthenocarpic growth of MA/pat- 2 (a parthenocarpic near-isogenic line to MA/wt) <b>ovaries</b> was negated by paclobutrazol (GA biosynthesis inhibitor), and this inhibition was counteracted by spermidine. Application of alpha-difluoromethyl-ornithine (-Orn) and/or alpha-difluoromethyl-arginine (-Arg), irreversible inhibitors of the putrescine biosynthesis enzymes Orn decarboxylase (ODC) and Arg decarboxylase, respectively, prevented growth of unpollinated MA/pat- 2 <b>ovaries.</b> alpha-Difluoromethyl-Arg inhibition was counteracted by putrescine and GA(3), whereas that of alpha-difluoromethyl-Orn was counteracted by GA(3) but not by putrescine or spermidine. In unpollinated MA/pat- 2 <b>ovaries,</b> the content of free spermine was significantly higher than in MA/wt <b>ovaries.</b> ODC activity was higher in pat- 2 <b>ovaries</b> than in MA/wt.

All together, these results strongly suggest that the parthenocarpic ability of pat- 2 mutants depends on elevated PAs levels in unpollinated mutant <b>ovaries,</b> which correlate with an activation of the ODC pathway, probably as a consequence of elevated GA content in unpollinated pat- 2 tomato <b>ovaries.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
