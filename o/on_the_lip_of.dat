25|$|The plant attracts its insect prey with {{secretions}} from extrafloral nectaries <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> {{the pitcher}} leaves, {{as well as}} a combination of the leaves' color and scent. Slippery footing at the pitcher's rim, aided in at least one species by a narcotic drug lacing the nectar, causes insects to fall inside, where they die and are digested by the plant with proteases and other enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Oia typifies the white-painted {{houses of}} the Cyclades, in many cases built {{directly}} into niches which are cave houses used by crew of the ships, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the volcanic crater, between which are narrow alleys and blue-roofed churches with cupolas. The wealthy ship captains of the late 19th century built neo-classical mansions. These houses are seen built in succession one above the other.|$|E

60|$|The words, 'There is the sea, {{and here}} are the--' again trembled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> Goodchild, unaccompanied however by any sound.|$|R

25|$|The 2007 {{redevelopment}} plans announced {{under the}} previous regime {{were put on}} hold following the takeover of the club and its plc holding company by owner Mike Ashley. One of the first noticeable changes in the stadium in the new era was the removal of advertising mounted underneath the roofs (facing the crowd) for Shepherd Offshore and Cameron Hall Developments, companies associated with the previous regime. A large advertising sign for Sports Direct appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> {{the roof of the}} Gallowgate, visible from the pitch.|$|E
25|$|The Mask of Life's descent ends in Mahri Nui, an {{underwater}} city originally part of Voya Nui before it broke off and {{sunk into the}} sea. Upon sight, it becomes an object {{of interest to the}} Matoran villagers as well as the Barraki: six former warlords sent to the Pit (a prison that sits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the city) after their crimes as part of the League of Six Kingdoms. But after the Pit was damaged in the Great Cataclysm, they escaped into the surrounding ocean and were mutated by its mutagen waters. Believing the mask can change them back so they can rule the Kingdoms once again, the Barraki battle one another for possession of the Ignika. Meanwhile, the Toa Inika continue their descent through the stone cord, where they battle mutated incarnations of the Piraka, Vezon and an army of murderous Zyglak. Upon reaching the depths of the sea, the Mask of Life transforms the heroes into the water-breathing Toa Mahri, complete with new masks and weapons. The team engage with the Barraki and their aquatic Rahi armies upon arrival, but {{in the midst of the}} battle, Matoro is imprisoned in the Pit by a robotic Maxilos guard that reveals itself as Makuta Teridax, who possessed the robot after his essence followed the Toa through the stone cord. He informs Matoro that Mata Nui's life can only be saved if the Toa shatter the cord, and although not trustful in the villain's words, he relays the information to his team-mates. They agree and evacuate Matoran from both locations before proceeding to destroy the cord; sending Voya Nui plummeting into the ocean and demolishing Mahri Nui in the process. But by the time the Toa Mahri retrieve the Ignika, Mata Nui dies. Believing there's still hope, Matoro - the one person who can touch the Ignika without becoming cursed - races towards a hole in the seabed with it before Voya Nui descends to close it, leaving his team to continue fighting the Barraki. Once in, he falls through a waterfall in what resembles a large cave and hears a voice from inside the mask telling him to put it on. In doing so, Matoro learns of the Ignika's history and how to use it to resurrect Mata Nui. Now knowing it was his destiny to sacrifice himself to save the universe, Matoro uses the sentient mask's powers to teleport the Toa Mahri back to Metru Nui and make them amphibious, before the mask turns his body into pure energy that saves the Great Spirit. Meanwhile, the Maxilos body that Teridax inhabited is found badly damaged after a ferocious battle with the Barraki's armies, and is so presumed dead. Mata Nui has been saved, but remains asleep.|$|E
2500|$|Danny Way clipped his shins <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the quarterpipe after a 20+ foot freefall {{during the}} Big Air competition, which the {{commentators}} {{refer to as}} the [...] "second worst fall ever at the X Games" [...] (the first being Jake Brown's the year before). After spending a few minutes with paramedics, Way limped back to the ramp and went on to nail the trick he had fallen on, coming in second place, Behind Bob Burnquist who scored a 96.00.|$|E
60|$|Now Marcus understood, and {{a saying}} that he heard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> Miriam arose in his mind, though he knew not whence it came.|$|R
60|$|Magdalen {{repressed}} the shudder that stole {{over her}} at that reference to <b>the</b> marriage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> a stranger, and answered in the affirmative.|$|R
60|$|The {{little brown}} devils danced in Bellew's face. He nodded. They {{stood by the}} hearth in <b>the</b> sitting-room, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> both came and went a {{peculiar}} smile.|$|R
2500|$|The local {{sections}} of the Bruce Trail and the Niagara Escarpment, which is a UNESCO designated World Biosphere Reserve, provide excellent hiking opportunities. Kerncliff Park, in an abandoned quarry on the boundary with Waterdown, is a naturalized area <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the Niagara Escarpment. The Bruce Trail runs through the park, at many points running {{along the edge of}} the cliffs, providing a clear overlook of Burlington, the Burlington Skyway Bridge, Hamilton, and Oakville. On a clear day, one can see the CN Tower in Toronto, approximately [...] from the park.|$|E
2500|$|During Wilson's at-bat, Marty Barrett {{repeatedly}} {{yelled at}} Stanley from second for a throw as Knight was {{far off the}} bag and {{could easily have been}} picked off. [...] Stanley, however, could not hear from the crowd noise and was focused on Wilson. [...] On the tenth pitch of the at-bat, with the momentum having already shifted to the Mets as the Red Sox were no longer {{on the verge of a}} championship, Stanley induced a ground ball off Wilson's bat. Buckner, who was playing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the infield to protect against a hit through the first-second base hole, moved over to the foul line to try to field the ball. He did not field it. [...] The ball rolled between his legs and into the outfield, enabling Knight to come around third and score without a play. The Mets won the game 6-5 and tied the series at three games. The win went to Aguilera, with the loss going to Schiraldi as he was responsible for Mitchell and Knight on base. Schiraldi was also credited with a blown save after giving up the tying runs in the eighth while Stanley was also credited with one for not holding the lead in the tenth.|$|E
60|$|There was {{momentarily}} contempt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> {{the handsome}} smuggler, but it disappeared in {{an expression of}} evident and painful sadness.|$|E

6000|$|Then Rupert arose--he is Rupert now; no lesser name is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> {{his people}} henceforth. With an intense earnestness {{which seemed to}} glow in his face, he said simply: ...|$|R
6000|$|Ah, the decisiveness, {{the very}} {{sound of the}} words, was good in my ears. “Clear that raffle!” Imagine so salty a phrase <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Humphrey Van Weyden of a few months gone! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite know. At {{first sight}} I {{should say that}} we are {{standing}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> a crater of some vast extinct volcano. Look how it curves to north and south and at the slope running down to the lake." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{stir and}} rattle, and the dark, indistinct figure {{standing}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the ditch {{was covered by}} the eight muskets. To {{the eyes of the}} firing-party he {{was no more than a}} blurred shadowy form, showing a little darker than the encompassing dark grey.|$|E
60|$|An astounding laugh arose at my expense, and I {{should have}} been annihilated, but that the smile which mantled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> my partner, had a {{different}} expression from that of ridicule, and seemed to say, 'Do not take this to heart.' And I did not, Alan--my partner danced admirably, and I like one who was determined, if outshone, which I could not help, not to be altogether thrown into the shade.|$|E
6000|$|... "Urbane" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> Jacob had mysteriously all the {{shapeliness}} of {{a character}} which Bonamy thought daily more sublime, devastating, terrific than ever, though he was still, and perhaps would be for ever, barbaric, obscure.|$|R
50|$|For your information, before {{embracing}} the solo career, Ferré Gola produced 5 songs including Vita Imana, Victim of love, 100 kilos, love interest, Insecticide and several pieces of vocal that remained long <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> his fans.|$|R
50|$|The Prophecy of Magellan is an epic one-hundred {{and five}} verses long. In the {{following}} stanza the teenage author puts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese admiral his own fervent {{wish to see}} Portugal and Spain reunited eventually.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} see him any more, though I could hear him choking and {{strangling}} and coughing. The audience kept a death-like silence. I crouched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the entrance and waited. The strangling and coughing died down, and I could hear him now and again clearing his throat. A little later he began to climb down. He went very quietly, pausing every moment or so to stretch his neck or to feel it with his hand.|$|E
60|$|I {{took her}} {{for a walk in}} the wood, to that very point indeed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the crater whence we had watched her play her part as priestess at the Feast of the First-fruits. After we had stood there a while we went down among the great cedars, trying to retrace the last part of our march through the {{darkness}} of that anxious night, whereof {{now for the first time}} I told her all the story.|$|E
60|$|A {{great fear}} came upon him. This {{was more of}} the terrible unknown. He {{crouched}} down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the cave and gazed out on the world. He was very much afraid. Because it was unknown, it was hostile to him. Therefore the hair stood up on end along his back and his lips wrinkled weakly in an attempt at a ferocious and intimidating snarl. Out of his puniness and fright he challenged and menaced the whole wide world.|$|E
60|$|It was my {{turn now}} to stop suddenly. In the excited state of my curiosity, at that moment, the chance {{reference}} to Mr. Fairlie's place <b>of</b> residence, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> my strange companion, staggered me with astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|Waboose {{looked at}} me. [...] "Yes, it is glorious," [...] she said--"and I am grateful; {{but it is}} strange that you should use the very same words that were so often <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> my father just before he--" ...|$|R
60|$|As if in {{provoking}} {{answer to}} that thought, something like the ghost of an amiable smile passed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Assistant Commissioner. His manner was easy and business-like while he persisted in administering another shake to the tight rope.|$|R
60|$|He {{showed her}} the hawk's nest he had found in the lightning-shattered top of the redwood, and she {{discovered}} a wood-rat's nest which {{he had not seen}} before. Next they took the old wood-road and came out on the dozen acres of clearing where the wine grapes grew in the wine-colored volcanic soil. Then they followed the cow-path through more woods and thickets and scattered glades, and dropped down the hillside to where the farm-house, poised <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the big canon, came into view only when they were right upon it.|$|E
6000|$|The man {{lay down}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> {{the pool and}} drank long and deep of its water. [...] "Tastes good to me," [...] he murmured, lifting his head and gazing across the pool at the side-hill, while he wiped his mouth {{with the back of}} his hand. The side-hill {{attracted}} his attention. Still lying on his stomach, he studied the hill formation long and carefully. It was a practised eye that traveled up the slope to the crumbling canyon-wall and back and down again to the edge of the pool. He scrambled to his feet and favored the side-hill with a second survey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now listen, Woodden. Have {{you looked}} at that Odontoglossum Pavo, and if so, {{what do you think}} of it?" [...] and he nodded towards a plant which stood in the centre of the little group that was placed on the small table beneath the auctioneer's desk. It bore a spray of the most lovely white flowers. On the top petal (if it is a petal), and also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> each of these rounded flowers was a blotch or spot of which the general effect was similar to the {{iridescent}} eye on the tail feathers of a peacock, whence, I suppose, the flower was named [...] "Pavo," [...] or Peacock.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{her eyes}} had grown {{accustomed}} to the light, Lady Bellamy {{went up to the}} body, and, drawing off the sheet, gazed long and steadily at <b>the</b> mutilated face, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> bloody froth still stood.|$|R
60|$|They moved quietly, {{a little}} wanness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children, at Good Friday, feeling the shadow upon their hearts. Then, pale with a deathly scent, came the lilies of resurrection, that shone coldly till the Comforter was given.|$|R
60|$|A sad {{beginning}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> a young wife!--sad in its quiet plain-spoken truth. The {{few days}} {{we had all}} passed together at Blackwater Park had been many enough to show me--to show any one--what her husband had married her for.|$|R
