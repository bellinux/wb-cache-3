5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left <b>on,</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
500|$|Chris Campling of The Times {{said that}} Fry was smug, [...] "but {{then he has}} a lot to be smug about, not least the ability to waffle for 30 to 45 minutes about not very much without being boring or condescending." [...] The Good Web Guide also {{recommends}} the series, saying that [...] "whether he is bringing you up to date with his recent adventures of just riffing <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> interests him, he is always compelling company." [...] The guide also states, [...] "Stephen Fry is one of those very rare people who are incapable of being boring." ...|$|E
500|$|The TARDIS {{had been}} {{previously}} turned invisible by damage to its visual stabiliser in the Second Doctor story The Invasion. When Canton first leaves the TARDIS, the Doctor remarks, [...] "Brave heart, Canton," [...] {{a reference to the}} Fifth Doctor's recurrent statement to his companion Tegan Jovanka, [...] "Brave heart, Tegan." [...] When Amy asks the younger Doctor to trust her, he asks her to swear to him <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> matters. After some thought, she smiles and says [...] "Fish fingers and custard," [...] referring to events in [...] "The Eleventh Hour," [...] when Amy first meets the Doctor as a little girl.|$|E

500|$|In {{the ongoing}} {{conflict}} in Haiti, a rescue mission is staged to save American citizens. Bartlet decides {{to send in}} peacekeeping troops, in spite of political consequences. CJ then, when announcing the decision to the press, makes a grave mistake by saying that she thinks [...] "the president's relieved to be focusing <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> matters", implying both that the MS incident was unimportant and that the President was happy to use an incident in which American lives are at risk to deflect attention away from his illness. Leo responds by sitting her out for the next press briefing, and she reacts by offering her resignation. Yet she is eventually persuaded to stay by the president's heartfelt assurance that he considers her a vital member of the administration.|$|E
500|$|Chris claimed Kate Hudson's {{influence}} on his lyrics was subtle: [...] "More so than a literal reference to her, it's {{the vantage point}} from where I'm writing. [...] It's the reasons that I'm singing and it's the feeling. [...] That is an influence far greater than the literal influence." [...] He did grant, however, that [...] "Soul Singing" [...] and [...] "Miracle to Me" [...] were written with Hudson in mind, and explained that the album's track order roughly follows a path from confusion to clarity that mirrored his own. [...] Producer Don Was said of Chris, [...] "I realized he was taking <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was significant. [...] He was writing about becoming a man... There's {{a lot of old}} man/young man symbolism that's a self-conversation... I don't know that anyone has actually chronicled being 33 [...] as well as this album." ...|$|E
500|$|Yoshi's Island DSs {{gameplay}} is {{the same}} as the previous game, with some additions. Just like in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island the player guides various colored Yoshis through side scrolling stages. Yoshi can jump and hover (flutter jump) for a short time, eat enemies and turn them into eggs (which can be used for things like hitting switches and defeating distant enemies) and pound the ground (to smash crates, for example). Some stages offer Yoshi the ability to morph into vehicles for a short time. Like the original Yoshi's Island, the DS game differs from many platforming series in that Yoshi does not have a life bar; when Yoshi is hit, the baby he is carrying falls off his back and Yoshi must retrieve him or her before a timer expires. (unless Yoshi falls <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> kills him instantly, such as a lava pit or spike field) ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2011, at {{a public}} meeting to address TriMet's {{projected}} budget gap, one Milwaukie resident asked the agency to abandon its plans to fund Rebirth, saying that [...] "a {{lot of people think}} that thing's just ugly. Why are they spending money <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that's</b> an unnecessary add-on at the same time they're talking about cutting bus routes again?" [...] The agency's general manager responded that all possibilities would be considered, though TriMet officials confirmed that cuts to its public art program were not an option and the MAX Orange Line's budget was separate from TriMet's financial problems.|$|R
2500|$|In February 1965, as the Gaming Board was {{considering}} {{the issuance of}} a gambling license, the hotel submitted multiple partnership changes that would include increasing Parker's ownership from eight percent to twenty percent. The Gaming Board deferred action on the gambling license until the following month. Board member W. E. Leypoldt said, [...] "I don't think it's fair to ask us to act <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that's</b> entirely different from what was presented Monday. It would do the casino industry {{a great deal of}} harm if you opened and in six months went broke because of lack of financing." ...|$|R
500|$|Through a {{collaboration}} with science consultant André Bormanis, the producers established the Phage as a bacteriophage. During a behind-the-scenes feature {{included on the}} DVD release of the show's second season, Bromanis explained that the writers and producers paid close attention to imagining a virus that could believably almost exterminate an entire species. Both Piller and Braga responded positively to Taylor's concept of the Vidiians. Piller viewed the idea of [...] "an alien culture who are a civilized people who are forced to do uncivilized things in order to survive" [...] as a compelling plot point. Braga agreed with Piller's assessment, saying: [...] "Very rarely do you stumble <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has real resonance." [...] Freelance writer Skye Dent, who had helped with the original development of the Vidiians, felt that pride characterized the alien species. She explained: [...] "ven though {{they knew what they}} were doing was wrong in terms of the actual action, they were very confident that because they were culturally superior, they were totally justified in killing people and taking their organs".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} negative reviews, the film did receive some positive feedback. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune both gave Speed2 {{three out of}} four stars, - the film's only two positive reviews included on Rotten Tomatoes. On their film review TV series Siskel & Ebert, they collectively gave Speed2 a positive rating of [...] "Two Thumbs Up", calling it a [...] "truly rousing ocean liner adventure story", although Ebert criticized Bullock's more limited role in the sequel while Patric [...] "stole all the action sequences". Since his original review, Ebert claimed that he enjoyed Speed2 more than Bullock, and wrote an article in 2013 that his favorable review of the film [...] "inspired more disbelief" [...] than any other he had written and was frequently cited as an example of him being a poor film critic. At the Conference on World Affairs in 1999, Ebert spoke about the difficulty of making films such as Speed2 and defended his review by offering a [...] "Speed3" [...] contest for anyone to create a five-minute short film that takes place <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> cannot stop moving.|$|E
500|$|Much of Stelmach's term as Premier was {{dominated}} by questions related to the Athabasca Oil Sands. The rapid development of these reserves was fuelling the Alberta economy's strong growth, but also raised environmental questions. After winning the Premiership, Stelmach emphasized {{that he had no}} intention of taking measures that would slow down oilsands development and suggested that the economy would find its own appropriate growth rate. He aggressively defended Alberta's oil at home and abroad, and called the idea that it was extracted at an unacceptably high environmental cost [...] "a myth". When Liberal Party of Canada leader Stéphane Dion proposed a federal carbon tax to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, Stelmach rejected the policy on the basis that it would hurt the economy and would unfairly penalize the western provinces. Instead, he championed the development of carbon capture technology. In July 2008, Stelmach announced $2billion worth of funding for carbon capture initiatives, for which he was applauded by industry groups. However, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business called it [...] "a huge amount of money to spend <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> isn't proven", and Mike Hudema of Greenpeace suggesting that there were better environmental uses of the money available.|$|E

500|$|While {{planning}} the fourth season, Marvel {{suggested that the}} series introduce Ghost Rider, after the character's film rights had returned to Marvel from Sony in May 2013. Loeb felt that this made the season unquestionably [...] "the series' biggest" [...] with the [...] "most ambitious story yet". He added that [...] "one {{of the things that}} we talked about is, S.H.I.E.L.D. always looked out for the weird, the unusual, the things that were and could be a problem for the public," [...] and Marvel realized that Ghost Rider's abilities, which are more mystical than anything seen in the series to date, opened up [...] "a quarter of the universe that we haven't really spent a lot of time exploring ... what happens if our very real, our very grounded agents who are very much a family have to take <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is as bizarre and powerful and unique as Ghost Rider." [...] Bell added that the producers would have been willing to give an entire season of the show to a Ghost Rider arc if the season was 13 episodes or less, but 22 episodes seemed too long to [...] "feel like one flavor".|$|E
500|$|While {{trying to}} have a moment of silence for Li'l Sebastian in the parks {{department}} office, the staff is interrupted when a custodian playing the Shania Twain song [...] "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" [...] on his radio. This scene was actually based <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> happened in the writer's room. Ron discovers Leslie and Ben's affair after they accidentally pocket dial him while sexually role-playing with political figures. At one point, Leslie tells Ben she is going to kiss him both like former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg. At another, Ben impersonates former President Ronald Reagan, which prompts Leslie, pretending to be United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to say, [...] "Oh, President Reagan, my blazer popped open." [...] In a different scene, Andy seeks to write a song for Li'l Sebastian that is 5,000 times better than Elton John's [...] "Candle in the Wind", which inspires him to write the original song [...] "5,000 Candles in the Wind". Other songs played during Li'l Sebastian's memorial service include [...] "Wild Horses" [...] by The Rolling Stones and [...] "A Horse with No Name" [...] by America. In an attempt to explain to someone that she and Ben were hugging, Leslie explains she recently won a McArthur Genius Grant and that Ben was simply congratulating her. In addition, during Tom and Jean-Ralphio's eulogy presentation for Lil' Sebastian, a still of the Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius is seen. The image is more popularly recognized as the cover art for progressive rock band King Crimson's 1971 album Islands.|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E

Lucia specifically refers to the [...] "military mentality" [...] in this film. He said further that the theme covered [...] "a man testing himself against his own limitations", and he concluded: [...] "'Full Metal Jacket' is the latest chapter in an ongoing movie which {{is not merely a}} comment on our time or a time past, but <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> reaches beyond." ...|$|E

[...] When asked if it would take place in a different location, Abrams replied by saying that [...] "it would be a totally different kind of thing but it's too early to talk about."

2500|$|The director, Luc Jacquet, has {{condemned}} such {{comparisons between}} penguins and humans. Asked by the San Diego Union Tribune {{to comment on}} the documentary's use as [...] "a metaphor for family values – the devotion to a mate, devotion to offspring, monogamy, self-denial", Jaquet responded: [...] "I condemn this position. I find it intellectually dishonest to impose this viewpoint <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that's</b> part of nature. It's amusing, but if you take the monogamy argument, from one season to the next, the divorce rate, if you will, is between 80 to 90 percent... the monogamy only lasts for the duration of one reproductive cycle. You have to let penguins be penguins and humans be humans." ...|$|R

2500|$|After {{experimenting with}} others {{translating}} her work, Rodríguez [...] "began the fascinating process of translating them self.

[...] As she translates from one language to another, she tries to find the appropriate wording and context in English that would correspond to the Spanish. However, her poems and stories started to have different meanings in their respective languages. She translates her literary work more than once, until [...] "I felt that both tips of my tongue and my two sets of ears were satisfied with the final product....this process mirrors my hyphenated existence. I live and work on a teeter-totter, moving back and forth between two cultures and languages." ...|$|E
2500|$|The plastic {{results are}} {{determined}} by the technique. As we can see straightaway, it {{is not a matter of}} describing, nor is it a matter of abstracting from, anything that is external to itself. There is a concrete act that has to be realised, a reality to be produced - of the same order as that which everyone is prepared to recognise in music, at the lowest level of the esemplastic scale, and in architecture, at the highest. Like any natural, physical reality, painting, understood in this way, will touch anyone who knows how to enter into it, not through their opinions <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> exists independently of it, but through its own existence, through those inter-relations, constantly in movement, which enable us to transmit life itself.

Whitaker photographed them at work and later commented: [...] "I never saw them calmer, more contented than at this time. They were working <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> let their personalities come out … They'd stop, go and do a concert and then it was, 'Let's go back to the picture!'" [...] Having struggled to find a title for the new album since their arrival in Munich, the Beatles finally settled on Revolver and informed EMI of their decision by telegram on 2 July. Whitaker recalled that, despite the hours of confinement in the Hilton, the atmosphere within the band while in Tokyo was [...] "a crescendo of happiness".|$|E
