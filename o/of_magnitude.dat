5|$|IC 410, a faint nebula, is {{accompanied}} by the bright open cluster NGC 1893. The cluster is thin, with a diameter of 12 arcminutes and a population of approximately 20 stars. Its accompanying nebula has very low surface brightness, partially because of its diameter of 40 arcminutes. It appears in an amateur telescope with brighter areas {{in the north and}} south; the brighter southern patch shows a pattern of darker and lighter spots in a large instrument. NGC 1893, <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> 7.5, is classified as a Trumpler Class II 3 r n or II 2 m n cluster, meaning that it is not very large and is somewhat bright. The cluster possesses approximately 30 stars <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> 9–12. In an amateur instrument, IC 410 is only visible with an Oxygen-III filter. NGC 2281 is a small open cluster at a distance of 1,500 light-years. It contains 30 stars in a crescent shape. It has an overall magnitude of 5.4 and a fairly large diameter of 14.0 arcseconds, classified as a Trumpler Class I 3 m cluster. The brightest star in the cluster is magnitude 8; there are approximately 12 stars <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> 9–10 and 20 stars <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> 11–13.|$|E
