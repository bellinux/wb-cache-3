5|$|Goldilocks's fate {{varies in}} the many retellings: in some versions, she runs into the forest, in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her, in some she vows {{to be a good}} child, and in some she returns home. Whatever her fate, Goldilocks fares better than Southey's vagrant <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who,</b> in his opinion, {{deserved}} a stint in the House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul's church-yard.|$|E

After recovering back on Skyloft, Link is led to the island's statue of Hylia by Fi, {{the spirit of the}} Goddess Sword residing within the statue. Link draws the sword, showing himself to be the prophesied hero who will finally destroy Demise. Opening a way to the Surface, Link is guided by Fi to the Sealed Temple, where he meets an <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> tells him to track Zelda: this leads Link across the regions of Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano, and the Lanayru Desert. While he catches up with Zelda, he is prevented from returning her to Skyloft by Impa, a young woman guarding and guiding Zelda. Link is also confronted by Ghirahim, a self-proclaimed Demon Lord working towards freeing Demise.

In Kuniyoshi's time, it was believed that when a girl visited a temple after dark, she took the risk of being greeted by an <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> would offer her to stay the night. Once inside the house, the old woman would become a witch and devour her. Therefore, a cat around temples could be the witch in a cat form.|$|E

25|$|These hardships made young Kedarnath {{question}} {{the meaning of}} life and ponder over reasons for human sufferings. He felt unconvinced by conventional explanations and started doubting the reality of the many Hindu gods and goddesses worshiped in village temples. Exposed to contradictory views ranging from religious beliefs to tantric practices, exorcism, superstitions and avid atheism, Kedarnath found himself in a state of disappointment and philosophical confusion. It was at that time that an encounter with a simple <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> advised him to chant the name of Rama that unexpectedly made a profound impact on him, planting the seed of Vaishnava faith that he maintained throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|As an {{integral}} part of human culture and civilization, shoes have found their way into our culture, folklore, and art. A popular 18th century nursery rhyme is There was an <b>Old</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>Who</b> Lived in a Shoe. This story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a lot of children. In 1948, Mahlon Haines, a shoe salesman in Hallam, Pennsylvania, built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement. The Haines Shoe House was rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962. Since then, it has served as an ice cream parlor, a bed and breakfast, and a museum. It still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction.|$|E
25|$|At home, Liza {{plays the}} spinet {{as she and}} her friend Pauline sing a duet about evening in the countryside. Their girlfriends ask to hear more, so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look {{of the young man}} in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and opens the door to the <b>old</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> tells her to shut the windows and go to bed. After the Countess retires, Liza asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into his embrace.|$|E

25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E
25|$|Fisher was {{considered}} {{by those who}} met {{her to be a}} strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech {{at a meeting of the}} National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. She said she was a 57 year <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe in herself and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.|$|E

500|$|... "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" [...] and {{the older}} still [...] "The Story of the Three Bears" [...] are two {{variations}} of a 19th-century fairy tale. The original tale tells of a badly-behaved <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> enters the forest home of three bachelor bears whilst they are away. She sits in their chairs, eats some of their porridge, and sleeps {{in one of their}} beds. When the bears return and discover her, she starts up, jumps from the window, and is never seen again. The other major version brings Goldilocks to the tale (replacing the old woman), and an even later version retained Goldilocks, but has the three bachelor bears transformed into Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear.|$|E
500|$|Several {{theories}} have been advanced {{to account for}} the incorporation of shoes into the fabric of a building, one of which is that they served as some kind of fertility charm. There is a long-standing connection between shoes and fertility, perhaps exemplified by the nursery rhyme, [...] "There was an <b>Old</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>Who</b> Lived in a Shoe", and the custom of casting a shoe after a bride as she leaves for her honeymoon or attaching shoes to the departing couple's car. Archaeologist Ralph Merrifield has observed that in the English county of Lancashire women who wished to conceive might try on the shoes of a woman who had just given birth, a custom known as smickling.|$|E

500|$|Rescued by Rover was {{predominantly}} {{a family}} affair – Cecil Hepworth's wife, Margaret, wrote the scenario and {{played the role of}} the mother on screen. Hepworth himself directed, painted the scenery and acted as the father. Their child was the baby on screen, and the part of Rover was played by the family dog, Blair. Two professional actors were paid to appear, Sebastian Smith as the soldier, and his wife as the <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> stole the baby. The two actors were paid half a guinea each; Hepworth would recall [...] "We couldn't get them for less". The film is often cited as the first film to have used paid actors. Completing the cast was Mabel Clark, who had previously played Alice in Hepworth's version of Alice in Wonderland, as the child's nurse. Clark was also the cutting room assistant.|$|E

[...] "La Tia Pasitrote" [...] ("The Pasitrote Aunt") is a funk rock song performed by Ilona about the adventures of a crazy aunt. Julio Navas performs the album closer, [...] "Juan Matachín", about the widespread fear put upon by the titular General.|$|E
500|$|The {{roles of}} several {{characters}} also differ between novel and film {{due to this}} plot change. The Witch of the Waste is the chief antagonist of the book, whereas in the film she is reduced by Madame Suliman's magic to an ultimately harmless <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> evokes sympathy in the audience and in Sophie. In contrast, the film conflates the novel's two characters of Mrs. Penstemmon and the wizard Suliman into Madame Suliman. Although Suliman comes closest to being a traditional villain in the film, she is shown as having ambiguous motivations, and reviewers have stated that the real villain is war itself. Howl loses the [...] "rakish" [...] womanizing aspect that was {{a significant part of}} his character in the novel. In contrast, Sophie becomes a more conventional figure in the film; she is less grumpy and outspoken, and demonstrates her love for Howl earlier and more explicitly. The storyline in the novel of Sophie being a powerful sorceress in her own right is muted in the film, although she is still shown to have control over her curse.|$|E

40|$|New Zealand as {{a society}} is ageing. This {{translates}} to {{an increasing number of}} people particularly women, over the age of 85 years. Despite many <b>older</b> <b>women</b> living alone, they are often perceived by both society and health professionals as frail and dependent. This qualitative study was designed to explore and describe experiences of <b>older</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> lived alone in the community. A qualitative descriptive methodology underpinned the study. A sample of five <b>older</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> lived alone in their own homes was interviewed. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. Three themes emerged which reflected the reality of living by themselves: “active participation”, “keeping control”, and” healthy living”. The information gained from describing the lives of this group of women suggests that many <b>older</b> <b>women</b> are able to live full and successful independent lives in the community. This research provides nursing with {{a better understanding of the}} realities for <b>older</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> live alone. Finally, this paper will provide nurses with some ideas about how best to support this group of people as they age...|$|R
