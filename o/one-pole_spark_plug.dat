An in situ laser infrared (IR) absorption method was developed using a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor and a 3. 392 -μm He–Ne laser as the light source. This wavelength coincided with the absorption line of hydrocarbons. The newly developed IR <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor had a higher signal-to-noise ratio than its previous version due to the optimization of its quartz lens and two optical fibers. The new sensor provided quantitative cycle-resolved fuel concentration measurements around the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> with a high temporal resolution.

5000|$|Bartlett was a {{geologist}} who {{was interested in}} <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> and contributed greatly to the motor vehicle world, being the first to invent insulating materials for <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> using alumina ceramics. When <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> insulators were first invented, {{they were made of}} porcelain and molded on a potter's wheel, and thus, were prone to break easily. She has been credited to have discovered that high alumina metls, containing approximately 0.35 percent lithium oxide precipitated zeta alumina, and over the course of her career, gained 7 patents in connection with her work. Bartlett left her position at General Motors Corporation to work on The Manhattan Project, a research project for nuclear weapons at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but later returned. Dr. Bartlett's essential work on <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> improved the overall capabilities of motor vehicles. Alumina insulator material allows plugs to handle high heat and voltage within the <b>spark</b> <b>plug,</b> enabling vehicles to operate in a more clean and, in turn, more efficient manner. By encasing the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> Dr. Bartlett had made possible for them to become quite durable.
