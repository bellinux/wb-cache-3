5|$|The record shows, {{that for}} nearly thirty years, {{elements}} of the U.S. Department of Justice {{have been engaged in}} world-wide political targeting <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.|$|E
5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> Juliet can {{be traced}} to the early days of the {{relationship}} between Rodgers and Hammerstein. The musical Oklahoma! opened in 1943; it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's first work together and a massive hit. Soon after Oklahoma! opened, Rodgers began considering the idea of a musical set backstage at a theatre staging a musical. The production could explore different areas of the backstage world. Rodgers also saw it as the opportunity to write a pure musical comedy, without the serious themes which had marked their early works—such as the attacks on racism in South Pacific, and the cultural tolerance in The King and I.|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} for {{the idea that people}} employ conceptual metaphors (CMs) to interpret metaphorical expressions (MEs), although the available data regarding the thesis that comprehending MEs requires sensory-motor simulations of the base domains of such CMs is scarce and ambiguous. An experiment was carried out to determine whether such sensory-motor simulations are necessary or at least enrichthe comprehension <b>of</b> <b>MEs.</b> Sighted <b>and</b> congenitally blind subjects paraphrased novel MEs derived from the seeingunderstanding CM. The congenitally blind showed very good comprehension <b>of</b> these <b>MEs,</b> <b>and</b> their performanceon this task was not inferior compared to the sighted. It is concluded that sensory-motor simulations are not necessary nor do they enrich the comprehension <b>of</b> <b>MEs,</b> <b>and</b> that amodal CMs are enough for this task. Implications of the obtained results for the embodied view of Lakoff and Johnson's conceptual metaphor theory are discussed...|$|R

500|$|Julian Lennon {{discovered}} that [...] "Hey Jude" [...] {{had been written}} for him almost 20 years after McCartney composed the song. He recalled of his and McCartney's relationship: [...] "Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit – more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going {{and there seems to}} be far more pictures <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my dad." [...] In 1996, Julian paid £25,000 for the recording notes to [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at an auction. He spent a further £35,000 at the auction, buying John Lennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon's manager, stated at the time: [...] "He has a few photographs of his father, but not very much else. He is collecting for personal reasons; these are family heirlooms if you like." ...|$|E

500|$|In January, Davis wrote home, expressing {{frustration}} at the slow logistics of replacement aircraft parts, claiming this was slowing down missions.

He also said that he had begun to grow tired of the constant publicity about him. [...] "They're trying to make a hero <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I find it rather embarrassing", he wrote in a letter. At other times, Davis indicated he preferred to stay in combat.|$|E

500|$|By 1953, Waugh's {{popularity}} as {{a writer}} was declining. He was perceived as {{out of step with}} the Zeitgeist, and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available. His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, Officers and Gentlemen, had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating. Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: [...] "they tried to make a fool <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I don't think they entirely succeeded", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford. Peter Fleming in The Spectator likened the interview to [...] "the goading of a bull by matadors".|$|E
500|$|Anticipating a {{call for}} his {{services}} since Mississippi had seceded, Davis had sent a telegraph message to Governor John J. Pettus saying, [...] "Judge what Mississippi requires <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> place me accordingly." [...] On January 23, 1861, Pettus made Davis a major general of the Army of Mississippi. On February 9, a constitutional convention met at Montgomery, Alabama and considered Davis and Robert Toombs of Georgia as a possible president. Davis, who had widespread support from six of the seven states, easily won. He {{was seen as the}} [...] "champion of a slave society and embodied the values of the planter class," [...] and was elected provisional Confederate President by acclamation. He was inaugurated on February 18, 1861. Alexander H. Stephens was chosen as Vice President, but he and Davis feuded constantly.|$|E

Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – I hope so otherwise she deserves a slap."

500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours in front <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|A {{shortage}} of cash {{was the principal}} reason why, in 1953, Waugh agreed to be interviewed on radio by the BBC, first in the Overseas Service's Personal Call programme {{and then in the}} Frankly Speaking series. The second of these was broadcast on the BBC Home Service on 16 November 1953. Most of Waugh's friends thought that he had acquitted himself well, and he was mildly pleased with the result, writing to Nancy Mitford that [...] "they tried to make a fool <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I don't think they entirely succeeded". Nevertheless, the broadcasts preyed on Waugh's mind; he saw hostility in the attitudes of his interlocutors, a point noted by his 13-year-old son Auberon Waugh, who later wrote that the interviews [...] "drove my father mad". His friend, the poet John Betjeman, gave him William Burges's Narcissus washstand but Waugh became convinced that an ornamental tap was missing from the washstand, and was shaken when Betjeman denied the tap had ever existed.|$|E
