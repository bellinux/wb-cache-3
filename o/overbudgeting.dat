5000|$|Historically, the {{engineering}} of the S-Class was {{claimed to have}} been designed without regard to cost, a practice which continued unfettered up through the W140 line. The company in turn has been able to exploit this as a marketing tool, culminating in its onetime slogan, [...] "engineered like no other car in the world." [...] This slogan was used throughout the 1980s with the marketing of the W126 S-Class. However, following the formation of DaimlerChrysler and the cessation of engineer-sanctioned <b>overbudgeting</b> in the late 1990s, this slogan was dropped. The subsequent W220 model S-Class were reported to suffer from relatively lower reliability and quality rates to previous models.|$|E
5000|$|The {{police have}} always {{maintained}} that Toninho's murder {{was a common}} crime and that the criminals {{were not aware of}} the victim's identity. However, suspicions that the murder may have been targeted and may have had political motives were widespread, and have increased recently. Just before his death, Toninho had started investigations on alleged <b>overbudgeting</b> in contracts with urban cleaning companies. Toninho said he had received death threats, but {{was not going to be}} intimidated by them. [...] The murder of Celso Daniel, mayor of Santo André and also a PT member, a few months later (January 22, 2002) also contributed to these suspicions.|$|E
5000|$|The W140 {{introduced}} innovations such as double-pane window glazing, power-assisted closing {{for doors}} and trunk lid, electric windows which lowered back down upon encountering an obstruction, rear-parking markers which {{rose from the}} rear wings (discontinued on later vehicles, and replaced with sonar-assisted parking) and a heating system which, if desired, continued to emit warm air after the engine was turned off. For details like this, the W140 is often known as the last Mercedes to be [...] "over-engineered," [...] a Mercedes trait that was costing the company in product delays and <b>overbudgeting.</b> According to Motor Trend, this action reportedly caused project cost overruns and resulted in the departure of Wolfgang Peter, Daimler-Benz's chief engineer. The vehicle {{is believed to have}} cost Mercedes-Benz over $1 billion to develop. For the consumer, the W140 cost a considerable 25 percent more than its predecessor, the W126.|$|E
50|$|Filming on Secret Service in Darkest Africa {{took place}} between 12 April and 27 May 1943. The {{production}} budget was $174,536 but the negative cost rose to $210,033 ($35,497, or 20.3%, <b>overbudget</b> compared to a studio average of $8,199, or 5.7%, over all its serial production). Not only did this make the serial the most expensive of 1943 {{it was also the}} third most expensive and third most over budget of all the sixty-six serials Republic produced. The only serials that were more expensive were The Lone Ranger Rides Again (1939, $213,997) and Captain America (1944, $222,906). While Captain America was also the most <b>overbudget</b> (by $40,283 or 22.1%), the second most <b>overbudget</b> Republic serial was another 1944 serial, Haunted Harbor (by $37,757 or 22.2%).|$|R
5000|$|Megaprojects often {{raise capital}} based on {{expected}} returns—though projects often go <b>overbudget</b> and over time, and market conditions like commodity prices can change. Concern at cost overruns is often expressed by critics of megaprojects during the planning phase. Bent Flyvbjerg has noted {{the existence of}} incentives to overstate income, underestimate costs, and exaggerate future social and economic benefits {{due to lack of}} accountability and risk-sharing mechanisms. If the megaproject is delivered in a country with relevant corruption the likelood and magnitude of having <b>overbudgets</b> increases.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel cost £302,000 {{as opposed}} to the £238,000 {{estimate}} prior to construction. The main reason for the project being <b>overbudget</b> was the extra works necessitated by the condition of the ground through which the tunnel passes.|$|R
40|$|This Master’s thesis {{research}} {{explores the}} role of corrupt practices in development projects implemented by local NGOs in Pakistan. The intention is not to expose particular cases of corruption, but to study corruption risks and vulnerabilities in different phases of the project cycle and financial management (budgeting, accounting, financial reporting and auditing). It also explores other program support functions, i. e. procurement and human resources, and their vulnerability to corruption. The contribution of this study to academic literature is increasing awareness of NGO corruption and its different forms in Pakistan from the project management point of view. This is a qualitative study. The empirical data is collected by interviewing development experts in Pakistan. The data consists of six interviews and the purposive sampling method is used to select the respondents. The respondents form intentionally a heterogeneous group, who represent different embassies, international organizations and INGOs. The focused interview method is used. The empirical findings show various challenges related to corruption faced in NGO funding in Pakistan. Those include e. g. donors having limited access to the field, thus heavily relying on narrative and financial reporting; relying on audit reports in corruption detection despite the questionable quality of audit reports; common custom of <b>overbudgeting</b> and overestimating the required staff; and financial management is not being prioritized by either donors or implementing organizations. The study recognized that managing the projects is in many respects a balancing act in Pakistan, and recommends a wider distribution of financial information with beneficiaries as measure to increase transparency and downward accountability. Similarly, the donors are strongly encouraged to proactively share their projects’ financial information with other donors. It is also recommended to continue the research and further identify the best practices to prevent corruption in this particular context...|$|E

50|$|The {{increasing}} indulgence {{of these}} young directors did not help. Often, they'd go overschedule, and <b>overbudget,</b> thus bankrupting themselves or the studio. The three most famous examples of this are Coppola's Apocalypse Now and One From The Heart and particularly Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, which single-handedly bankrupted United Artists. However, Apocalypse Now eventually made its money back and gained widespread recognition as a masterpiece, winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes.|$|R
