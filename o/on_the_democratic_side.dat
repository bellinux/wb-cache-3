500|$|The 1953 Republican primary for all offices, {{including}} Controller, {{was complicated}} by a {{split in the}} party hierarchy between the [...] "regular" [...] faction, led by Hamilton and Board of Revision of Taxes President William F.

In the end, Foster A. Dunlap, a local attorney and the Hamilton-Meade candidate, won with 66,557 votes. Meehan's candidate, former Deputy Secretary of Supplies and Services Wilhelm F. Knauer, polled 50,185, and Gibson's running mate, Rudolph F.

50|$|A {{short time}} after its foundation, the PRD profited from the {{dissolution}} of the Portuguese parliament, occupied at the time by a grand coalition between the Socialist Party (PS) and <b>the</b> Social <b>Democratic</b> Party (PSD), from both of which the PRD included dissidents (for example, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PS side, José Medeiros Ferreira, former foreign Minister in a Mário Soares government and also a supporter of <b>the</b> centre-right <b>Democratic</b> Alliance as a dissident of <b>the</b> PS, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> Joaquim Magalhães Mota, a co-founder of the PSD). Due to a disastrous economic policy, Ramalho Eanes dissolved the parliament and called for a new election where the newly founded PRD surprisingly won 18% of the vote and got 45 MPs, becoming the third major party. The election did not give the majority of the seats to any party, so the party with the most votes, <b>the</b> Social <b>Democratic</b> Party, formed a minority government with PRD tactical support, sending the PSD's Socialist former coalition partners into opposition.|$|R
5000|$|Even some Congressmen who {{had voted}} for the Act criticized it privately, leading to {{speculation}} that [...] "if {{it had been an}} anonymous vote, it would have been voted down two-to-one." [...] The bill’s most controversial feature among Congressmen was its limit on outside income, which could be no more than 15 percent of his public service income. This restriction applied only to [...] "earned" [...] income, while excluding investment income from stocks or bonds. About a half-dozen members of the House of Representatives reportedly would not speak to the Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, because he pushed the Act through. Their claim was that the Act favored people with “unearned” wealth, people who already had it, over people with “earned” additional income, usually with a law practice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> <b>Democratic</b> Representative David R.

500|$|As the {{election}} of 1880 drew near, Bayard was again regarded as a likely candidate. [...] Hayes had pledged himself to a one-term presidency, which meant the Republicans {{would not have the}} advantage of incumbency. [...] <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> Tilden was regarded as the natural choice, as many Democrats were still convinced he had been robbed of the office in 1876. [...] Tilden's supporters saw Bayard as a rival, and sought to smear him by suggesting he had colluded with Republicans to defeat Tilden in 1876. [...] Meanwhile, in the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York began an investigation into the 1876 election, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. In fact, the Potter committee's investigation had the opposite effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, that offered bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. [...] The telegrams doomed Tilden's hopes for the nomination, and boosted Bayard's chance among the erstwhile Tilden supporters.|$|E
500|$|Strategists {{from both}} parties viewed {{the outcome of the}} race as a [...] "referendum on President Obama's {{handling}} of the economy". Chairman Michael Steele of the Republican National Committee said the special election was the first of three elections that were [...] "incredibly important" [...] for the Republicans to win. The Republican leadership made this race a top priority, and Chairman Steele, former Governor George Pataki, House Minority Leader John Boehner, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich helped Tedisco with fundraising. Steele visited the district twice. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> Senator Gillibrand appeared in commercials and robocalls for Murphy, and Senator Chuck Schumer helped Murphy's campaign with fundraising. Less than a week before the election, President Obama formally endorsed Murphy in a mass email to supporters and urged supporters to organize and vote for Murphy.

40|$|Managing {{ecosystems}} {{for multiple}} benefits and stakeholders {{is a formidable}} challenge requiring diverse knowledge to be discovered, transmitted, and aggregated. Costâ��benefit analysis (CBA) is advocated as a theoretically grounded decision-support tool, but in practice it frequently appears to exert little influence. To understand this puzzle, I consider ecosystem knowledge and CBA from both the demand and supply sides. I argue that all ecosystem knowledge is contestable, which restricts the influence of technocratic tools like CBA. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> demand <b>side,</b> <b>democratic</b> mechanisms shape decision makersâ�� motivations and incentives, but also provide a substitute for technocratic evidence. Supply-side factors limiting the influence of CBA include the scarcity of decision-pertinent evidence and the uncertain meaning and usefulness of CBA. Demand-side factors are resistant to change; but taking account of them, I suggest some supply-side reforms, arguing that CBA is best regarded not as a tool but as a venue where ecosystem knowledge is aggregated and contested...|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, {{while holding}} {{the rank of}} Assistant Superintendent, Broaster was {{assigned}} as Deputy Commander of the Patrol Branch.

40|$|After the 2008 presidential {{election}} season concludes, {{no doubt there}} will be calls to change the presidential nomination system, especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party <b>side.</b> Already before the current season began, Congress explored legislation to prevent the frontloading of the primary process {{through the creation of}} a series of rotating regional primaries. The close contest for <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party nomination this winter and spring revealed additional issues beyond the timing question. Critics have argued that the caucus system used in some states is unfair and poorly administered, that the unequal weighting of votes for purposes of delegate selection violates democratic principles, and that the fate of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party presidential nomination should not turn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> votes of unelected superdelegates. It is certainly possible that the parties themselves will change their nomination rules in response to these criticisms, as the parties have done in the past. But in the event the parties cannot agree on changes, Congress may consider legislation imposing changes to make the nomination rules comply more with the typical one person, one vote norms applicable to general elections. At the extreme, Congress might require presidential nominations to occur through state-by-state direct primaries conducted under one person, one vote principles. Here, I explore the question whether Congress has the power to impose such primaries <b>on</b> <b>the</b> parties and the states if the parties, states, or both object. I do not consider the wisdom of such legislation. As I explain, the main argument that parties can advance against Congressional (or for that matter, state) imposition of a direct presidential primary is that it violates the First Amendment associational rights of political parties to determine their method for choosing their standard bearers. This argument would appear to have much force given recent Supreme Court cases recognizing the parties 2 ̆ 7 rights to overrule <b>the</b> states <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open or closed nature of political primaries. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the Court has also accepted as 2 ̆ 2 too plain for argument 2 ̆ 2 a governmental power to require parties to use direct primaries to choose their nominees to assure fairness of the process. So resolution of the question is uncertain. The second argument that the parties or the states may raise against Congress is that Congress lacks the power under the Constitution to set the rules for {{presidential election}}s. Such an argument reads Congressional power under Article II of the Constitution narrowly, limited to setting the time for choosing presidential electors. Though the textual argument under Article II has some force, both Court precedent and policy suggest that the courts could well accept Congressional power to impose at least some regulations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> primary process, such as regulations setting the timing of primaries or caucuses. It is not clear whether congressional power would extend as far as to the imposition of a direct presidential primary against the parties 2 ̆ 7 and states 2 ̆ 7 wishes. Part I of this Essay briefly reviews complaints from the 2008 election season about the presidential nominating process. Part II considers the party autonomy argument against congressional legislation imposing a direct presidential primary. Part III considers the Congressional power argument. This Essay concludes by noting that even if Congress may lack the power, the threat of congressional action could spur the parties to reform themselves...|$|R

2500|$|After Indian {{independence}} {{and until the}} end of the Cold War, the relationship between the US and India was cold and often thorny. This was due to the closeness of the US towards India's arch-rival Pakistan during the War, with Pakistan joining the US-led Western Bloc in 1954. India's policy of being not aligned with either the US or the Soviet Union, but maintaining close ties with the latter, also impacted relations. American officials perceived India's policy of non-alignment negatively. Ambassador Henry F. Grady told then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that the United States did not consider neutrality to be an acceptable position.

2500|$|Another scholar {{contends that}} the {{minority}} leader position emerged even before 1883. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> [...] "there were serious caucus fights for the minority speakership nomination in 1871 and 1873," [...] indicating that the [...] "nomination carried with it some vestige of leadership." [...] Further, when Republicans were in the minority, the party nominated for Speaker a series of prominent lawmakers, including ex-Speaker James Blaine of Maine in 1875, former Appropriations Chairman James A. Garfield of Ohio, in 1876, 1877, and 1879, and ex-Speaker Keifer in 1883. [...] "It {{is hard to believe}} that House partisans would place a man in the speakership when in the majority, and nominate him for this office when in the minority, and not look to him for legislative guidance." [...] This was not the case, according to some observers, with respect to ex-Speaker Keifer.|$|E
2500|$|Dissatisfaction on {{the part}} of the growing middle class with the {{corruption}} and inefficiency of politics as usual, and the failure to deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems, led to the dynamic Progressive Movement starting in the 1890s. In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably Theodore Roosevelt, Charles Evans Hughes, and Robert La Follette on the Republican side, and William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> took up the cause of progressive reform. Women became especially involved in demands for woman suffrage, prohibition, and better schools; their most prominent leader was Jane Addams of Chicago, who created settlement houses. [...] "Muckraking" [...] journalists such as Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens and Jacob Riis exposed corruption in business and government along with rampant inner city poverty. Progressives implemented anti-trust laws and regulated such industries of meat-packing, drugs, and railroads. Four new constitutional amendments– the Sixteenth through Nineteenth– resulted from progressive activism, bringing the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and woman suffrage. The Progressive Movement lasted through the 1920s; the most active period was 1900–18.|$|E
