500|$|Horses {{normally}} require {{free access}} to all the fresh, clean water they want, and to avoid dehydration, should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time. However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources. [...] But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30–90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling <b>off</b> <b>process.</b> [...] A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked. [...] Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.|$|E

30|$|We {{proposed}} a gel-valve {{that can be}} highly integrated into a microfluidic chip. The gel-valve can be fabricated with 20  μm resolution by standard photolithography and lift <b>off</b> <b>processes.</b> We can actuate the gel-valve at 5  Hz with 38.2  mA. Furthermore, we demonstrated cell sorting by using two gel-valves fabricated near the branch of a microchannel on a chip. The target cell was successfully sorted. Since the proposed gel-valve can be actuated simply by local heating with a microheater with a power consumption of 39.3  mW, we can easily apply the valve in microfluidic chips.|$|R

5000|$|In late 2013 {{producers}} {{decided to}} retire {{the character of}} Sarah. They decided {{it was best to}} kill her off as then the character of TK Samuels could develop further romantic connections without fans opposing to it due to Sarah still being alive. Billing was informed in March 2014. She described the writing <b>off</b> <b>process</b> as one that had a lot of [...] "stuff that plays into it" [...] and noted some of it she understood, whilst a lot of it she did not. She hoped that Sarah would get a [...] "dramatic" [...] write-off that would involve a lot of location shooting. One of Sarah's final scenes that saw her say goodbye to her toddler daughter Tillie (Leila Eketone) proved difficult to film due to the cast and crew crying; a scene Billing described filming as [...] "deliciously painful". Billing finished filming in July and was celebrated with a large cast party. The publicity department worked hard to ensure the departure would not be leaked to the press following previous leaks on the departures of Teuila Blakely (Vasa Levi) and Beth Allen (Brooke Freeman), something Billing found hard to keep a secret. The character was killed off during scenes airing on 18 August 2014.|$|E

5000|$|The {{uppermost}} continuous strake {{along the}} topsides {{is called the}} sheer strake. In old vessels, a rubbing strake was built in just below a carvel sheer strake. It was much less broad but thicker than other strakes so that it projected and took any rubbing against piers or other boats when the boat was in use. In clinker boats, the rubbing strake {{was applied to the}} outside of the sheer strake. The strakes adjacent to the garboard are referred to accordingly as the first broad and second broad. Each strake thereafter has its own special name such as bottom strakes, lowers, bilge strakes, topside strakes, and uppers. Many current pleasure craft reflect this history by providing the boat with a mechanically attached (and therefore replaceable) rub rail at the location formerly occupied by a rubbing strake, often doubling to cover the joint between a GRP hull and its innerliner.A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape. It is commonly employed in carvel and iron/steel shipbuilding, but there are very few, possibly only one type of, clinker craft that use them."A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape." [...] This statement represents a mis-understanding of what a [...] "stealer" [...] is tasked with accomplishing as a hull is lined-off. After determining the widths of strakes amidships (there are three categories), a quantity can be determined for all these strakes. This quantity is then divided into the height of the stem to determine the width of the average hood-end. This width must be twice the hood-ends thickness or it {{will not be able to}} carry its fasteners. If the hood-ends are not wide enough, the quantity is dropped by one until the resulting revised width is strong enough to carry its fasteners. Stealer is actually a misspelling of the word steeler, the plankers borrowed this word from their peers in the foundry, where forgers would strengthen a piece of metal by steeling a different metal to the original piece. This was analogous to strengthening the hood-end by making it wider, providing more wood mass around each hood-end. Wider meant fewer hood-ends. A device was needed to compensate for the drop in strakes that actually reached the stem. The device was a strake that was stooped short of the stem by burying its forward butt end into a notch chiseled into a through plank. This strake was called a steeler by the plankers and a drop plank by the liners who originated it by counting strakes during the lining <b>off</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} variational {{assimilation}} system around a coarse resolution Earth System Model (ESM) {{and apply it}} for estimating initial conditions and parameters of the model.

In our variational approach, {{the length of the}} feasible assimilation window is limited {{by the size of the}} domain in control space over which the approximation by the derivative is valid.

30|$|A {{distributed}} energy-aware {{traffic engineering}} analysis DAISIES is proposed in [52]. DAISIES uses routing-based approach where the link switch <b>off</b> <b>process</b> is handled individually by each node. The switching <b>off</b> <b>process</b> is managed {{with respect to}} the traffic variations. A definite load-dependent link-weight function is proposed to perform DAISIES more efficiently. The proposed scheme is different from other studies in two important aspects: there is no off-line centralized component, and it searches for the best path for each traffic demand rather than search for the best set of links to switch off. It takes advantage of traffic engineering of the existing routers and modifies the path computation strategy, and it does not require significant changes in current routers. The event-driven simulation packet is used for simulations. For different traffic conditions, DAISIES performance is tested and it is observed that the proposed scheme provides significant energy gains.|$|E
