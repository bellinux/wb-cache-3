[...] "It {{is a piece of}} fiction." [...] The film has been praised for the realism of its premises and its overall adherence to physical principles, despite several inaccuracies and exaggerations. According to NASA Astronaut Michael J. Massimino, who took part in Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions STS-109 and STS-125, [...] "nothing was out of place, nothing was missing.

500|$|Although both singers {{worked with}} {{producer}} Benny Blanco in studio on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful", Spears recorded her vocals {{for the song}} before Sabi, who actually raps on the track. The latter also revealed she felt lucky and honored because Spears does not do features often, while commenting that [...] "it's just pretty crazy, I mean, I grew up watching Britney Spears. All my friends watched Britney Spears and we even had a routine to [...] that we were gonna perform, like, for a middle-school talent show. So it's a dream come true. Never did I ever think that I'd be in the mix with Britney. I'm just lucky." [...] When asked about how she learned about Sabi {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Spears revealed, [...] "friends and people around me are always showing me new artists that they love and that's how I learned about Sabi and ended up working with her on '(Drop Dead) Beautiful'. I have always wanted to feature a new artist <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> albums and she is really cool." [...] A small teaser of the song was unveiled by the singer on March 7, 2011. Four days later, it leaked in full online, along with another Femme Fatale track, [...] "Inside Out". On August 5, 2011, Spears posted a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be [...] "Criminal", [...] "Inside Out" [...] or [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful." [...] After the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed to MTV News that [...] "Criminal" [...] was chosen as the fourth single.|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} both {{original and}} existing music tracks. Tracks composed {{specifically for the}} film include [...] "100 Black Coffins" [...] by Rick Ross and produced by and featuring Jamie Foxx, [...] "Who Did That To You?" [...] by John Legend, [...] "Ancora Qui" [...] by Ennio Morricone and Elisa, and [...] "Freedom" [...] by Anthony Hamilton and Elayna Boynton. The theme, [...] "Django", was also the theme song of the 1966 film. Musician Frank Ocean wrote an original song for the film's soundtrack, but it was rejected by Tarantino, who explained that [...] "Ocean wrote a fantastic ballad that was truly lovely and poetic in every way, there just wasn't a scene for it." [...] Frank Ocean later published the song, entitled [...] "Wiseman", on his Tumblr blog. The film also features a few famous pieces of western classical music, including Beethoven's [...] "Für Elise" [...] and [...] "Dies Irae" [...] from Verdi's Requiem. Tarantino has stated that he avoids using full scores of original music: [...] "I just don't {{like the idea of}} giving that much power to anybody <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> movies." [...] The film's soundtrack album was released on December 18, 2012. Ennio Morricone made statements criticizing Tarantino's use of his music in Django Unchained and stated that he would [...] "never work" [...] with the director after this film, but later agreed to compose an original film score for Tarantino's The Hateful Eight in 2015. In a scholarly essay on the film's music, Hollis Robbins notes {{that the vast majority of}} film music borrowings come from films made between 1966 and 1974 and argues that the political and musical resonances of these allusions situate Django Unchained squarely in the Vietnam and Watergate era, during the rise and decline of Black Power cinema. Jim Croce's hit I Got A Name was featured in the soundtrack.|$|E
