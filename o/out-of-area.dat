25|$|The {{airborne}} divisions were disbanded {{after the}} Second World War, {{with only the}} 2nd Parachute Brigade (1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions) remaining. In February 1948, it was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade and posted to the British Army on the Rhine. The brigade remained in Germany until October 1949, when it relocated to Aldershot, which became {{the home of the}} Parachute Regiment for the next 50 years. The Territorial Army (TA) reformed after the war and raised the 16th Airborne Division with nine parachute battalions (10th to 18th) in three parachute brigades. The division was disbanded in the 1956 defence cuts, leaving the 44th Independent Parachute Brigade as the only reserve parachute formation. The remaining reserve battalions were the 10th (City of London), 12th (Yorkshire), 13th (Lancashire), 15th (Scottish) and 17th (Durham Light Infantry). Further reductions resulted in the amalgamation of the 12th and 13th Battalions soon afterwards. In 1967, the TA battalions were reduced again, the 12th, 13th and 17th being amalgamated to reform the 4th Battalion. The 44th Independent Parachute Brigade was disbanded in 1977, leaving the reserve parachute battalions as independent units. Following the Falklands War in November 1983, the 5th Airborne Brigade was formed for <b>out-of-area</b> operations. The brigade consisted of two of the parachute battalions and its own parachute trained artillery, engineers, medics, signals and logistics units. The Options for Change restructuring after the Cold War again reduced the number of TA battalions. The 4th and 15th Battalions were amalgamated in 1993 as the 4th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion was disbanded. The 5th Airborne Brigade lasted until the 1999 Strategic Defence Review, which recommended that the 5th Airborne and 24th Airmobile Brigade be amalgamated as the 16th Air Assault Brigade.|$|E
500|$|The 2004 Istanbul summit {{was held}} in Istanbul, Turkey from June 28 to June 29, 2004. It was the 17th NATO summit in which NATO's Heads of State and Governments met to make formal {{decisions}} about security topics. [...] In general, the summit {{is seen as a}} continuation of the transformation process that began in the 2002 Prague summit, which hoped to create a shift from a Cold War alliance against Soviet aggression to a 21st-century coalition against new and <b>out-of-area</b> security threats. The summit consisted of four meetings.|$|E
2500|$|As the 21st century approached, the PLAN {{began to}} {{transition}} to an off-shore defensive strategy that entailed more <b>out-of-area</b> operations {{away from its}} traditional territorial waters. [...] Between 1989 and 1993, the training ship Zhenghe paid ports visits to Hawaii, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India. [...] PLAN vessels visited Vladivostok in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996. [...] PLAN task groups also paid visits to Indonesia in 1995; North Korea in 1997; New Zealand, Australia, and the Philippines in 1998; Malaysia, Tanzania, South Africa, the United States, and Canada in 2000; and India, Pakistan, France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand in 2001. In March 1997, the Luhu-class guided missile destroyer Harbin, the Luda-class guided missile destroyer Zhuhai, and the replenishment oiler Nancang began the PLA Navy's first circumnavigation of the Pacific Ocean, a 98-day voyage with port visits to Mexico, Peru, Chile, and the United States, including Pearl Harbor and San Diego. [...] The flotilla was {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral Wang Yongguo, the commander-in-chief of the South Sea Fleet.|$|E

5000|$|This {{network is}} unique in {{that these are the}} only radio {{stations}} broadcasting from the three counties. The area sits within the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), which surrounds the Green Bank Radio Telescope in Green Bank, West Virginia. [...] Due to the NRQZ and surrounding mountainous terrain, few <b>out-of-area</b> radio signals penetrate these counties.|$|E
50|$|It has campus {{centers in}} Albion, Medina, Warsaw, Dansville, Arcade, Lima (previously Lakeville), New York. Thus, the college covers areas not only inside of Genesee County {{but also in}} Orleans County, Livingston County and Wyoming County. This two-year college also offers housing {{facilities}} to <b>out-of-area</b> students, although the school is attended primarily by commuters. Additionally, GCC offers some degree and certificate programs online.|$|E
50|$|The {{school is}} of {{moderate}} size, counting 1,062 students and 94 employees in 2014, slightly smaller than many nearby high schools.

50|$|Backcountry skiing (US), {{also called}} off-piste (Europe) or <b>out-of-area,</b> is skiing {{in the backcountry}} on unmarked or unpatrolled areas either inside or outside a ski resort's boundaries. This {{contrasts}} with alpine skiing which is typically done on groomed trails benefiting from a ski patrol. Unlike ski touring, backcountry skiing can {{include the use of}} ski lifts including snowcats and helicopters. Recent improvements in equipment have increased the popularity of the sport.|$|E

50|$|ORN made {{an attempt}} at a similar success in 1992 when Buffalo mayor Jimmy Griffin invited ORN for the {{so-called}} “Spring of Life.” The event became ORN's biggest public relations coup, when thousands of <b>out-of-area</b> protesters {{on both sides of}} the argument descended on Buffalo and Amherst. The crisis and financial hardship that the city endured because of the incidents was believed to have brought down the Griffin administration later that year.|$|E
50|$|In the main, the Canadian Special Operations Regiment enables special {{operations}} and, specifically, JTF2; thus, JTF2 {{can focus on}} the precise tasks {{for which they are}} so well selected and trained.

50|$|At {{its peak}} in 1969, 15,000 were paying to receive their {{television}} pictures via cable television. However, this was a relay service in the true sense - in other words only existing terrestrial programmes could {{be put on the}} cable, and in consequence, the interest in cable started to decline as more and more BBC and ITV transmitters made reception clearer. Unlike their American counterparts, the British companies were not allowed to broadcast <b>out-of-area</b> signals or original programmes.|$|E
50|$|The contest {{began in}} 1953 as the Northwest Mountain Fiddlers' Contest. It was {{organized}} by Blaine Stubblefield, secretary of the Weiser Chamber of Commerce. The contest increased in size each year, and competitors came from farther away. The name was changed to the Northwest Oldtime Fiddling Championships in 1956, when a regional division was added for <b>out-of-area</b> fiddlers. In 1963, the present National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest was inaugurated. The contest has continued to grow since then, and now sets the standard for fiddling competitions across the nation.|$|E

50|$|Network-based plans may {{be either}} closed or open. With a closed network, enrollees' {{expenses}} are generally only covered {{when they go}} to network providers. Only limited services are covered outside the network—typically only emergency and <b>out-of-area</b> care. Most traditional HMOs were closed network plans. Open network plans provide some coverage when an enrollee uses non-network provider, generally at a lower benefit level to encourage the use of network providers. Most preferred provider organization plans are open-network (those that are not are often described as exclusive provider organizations, or EPOs), as are point of service (POS) plans.|$|E
5000|$|The tumble {{of events}} in the past years has made it {{necessary}} to re-examine NATO's core strategic concepts. This re-assessment opens up possibilities for change and for plausible [...] "new" [...] strategies and [...] "new" [...] assumptions as well. At this summit, the allied leaders moved forward in a process which is expected to result in a new strategic doctrine which will be formally adopted at next year's summit in Lisbon, Portugal. The updated vision of NATO contemplates a range of expanded responsibilities, including <b>out-of-area</b> operations in Afghanistan and anti-piracy patrols near the Horn of Africa.|$|E
50|$|Bargo Rural Fire Brigade was {{established}} 1939. From its humble beginnings, the brigade's few handtools and drum of water have been constantly upgraded to its present-day Pumper, Heavy Tanker and Light Tankers, {{housed in the}} purpose-built Village Two category building {{on the outskirts of}} the township. The brigade's services include fighting structure fires and bush fires in the local area and attending vehicle accidents on the Hume Highway where passes through Wilton, Pheasants Nest and Yanderra. Bargo Fire Brigade assists with <b>out-of-area</b> disasters, for example, the 1994 Sydney Bushfires, the Sydney Hail Storm of 1999, the bushfires of the Christmas period 2001/2002, and 2007 Gosford storm damage.|$|E
50|$|The Brigade Nord {{commands}} all {{the operational}} {{units of the}} Army, {{with the exception of}} His Majesty the Kings Guard and the border patrol unit stationed in Sør-Varanger. As the army has no air defence capabilities anymore it relies on the NASAMS missile units of the Royal Norwegian Air Force for air defence. The Army Special Forces Command (Norwegian: Forsvarets Spesialkommando/Hærens Jegerkommando, abbreviated to FSK/HJK) is the armed forces' ranger-/parachute and special forces unit. The FSK/HJK has the ability to execute operations in the North Sea to defend Norway's oil installations. Internationally, the FSK/HJK has undertaken in recent years <b>out-of-area</b> missions, most recently two missions in Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|After 1993 {{troops of}} this {{division}} participated in numerous overseas deployments. Among them {{were the first}} <b>out-of-area</b> land deployment operations for the Bundeswehr (in fact of any German military unit after World War II). Troops were deployed to Somalia (UNOSOM II) from 1993 to 1994 and to Bosnia and Herzegovina (IFOR) from 1995 to 1996 and stayed in this country until 1998 (SFOR). Soldiers of the 10th Armoured Divisions SFOR contingent were also involved in the Bundeswehrs first combat operation in 1997 (Operation Libelle). In 2000, the 10th Armoured Division deployed more than 8,000 personnel to the Balkans. Between 2002 and 2003, it deployed to various operations in the Balkans and in Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|Upon his {{selection}} to flag rank in 1994, Nathman {{served on the}} NATO staff of Commander, Allied Forces Southern Europe (AF SOUTH), and as Director of Logistics for Commander, NATO Implementation Force (IFOR) during its first <b>out-of-area</b> deployment to Bosnia. In 1996, he commanded Carrier Group Seven, NIMITZ Carrier Strike Group and Battle Force FIFTY in the Persian Gulf. Nathman subsequently served as Director, Air Warfare, on the Chief of Naval Operations staff in Washington, D.C. In August 2000, he took command of Naval Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet and was designated Commander, Naval Air Forces in October 2001. In August 2002, Nathman was assigned as the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Requirements and Programs (N6/N7) at the Pentagon.|$|E
50|$|The city gained notoriety {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s for its {{aggressive}} traffic enforcement policies. The AAA {{went so far}} as to specifically label Ludowici as a speed trap. Members of the local police force were allegedly engaging in manipulation of the timing of the traffic signal downtown, so as to catch unsuspecting <b>out-of-area</b> motorists 'running' a suddenly changed red light. The switch for the stop light was located in the barber shop. The traffic light was at an intersection that was bypassed by a shortcut (Main Street - see a local map) so that local residents would not even come to the light when making the turn at the light. Thus, all the tickets went to nonresidents without the police having to be selective since no locals would be at the light.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} of Blanding {{and its surrounding}} area is rich in Anasazi artifacts, many examples of which are now {{on display at the}} Edge of the Cedars Museum. Largely these examples have come from the collections of local residents and were put together early {{in the history of the}} community. In more recent decades the majority of local residents have abandoned artifact hunting, partially because they became more difficult to find, but also because of more aggressive enforcement of the antiquities acts by Federal authorities. Federal authorities still retain <b>out-of-area</b> custody of local artifacts seized in raids conducted in 2009. There have been local efforts to have these artifacts also deposited in the Edge of the Cedars Museum in an effort to use them educationally to inform the public of the Anasazi heritage and to teach conservation of these resources.|$|E
5000|$|On 4 October 1960 Chivo {{began her}} first <b>out-of-area</b> cruise in eight years, though she first sailed south to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, for a two-week amphibious {{exercise}} with the 2d Reconnaissance Company, Fleet Marine Force. The submarine then sailed to South Africa, via Trinidad, British West Indies, for Operation CAPEX-60, a joint ASW exercise with British, French, Portuguese and South African ships and aircraft. While en route, the boat held the traditional crossing-the-line ceremonies at the equator. As put by the Navy Times, [...] "Although greatly outnumbered, the fifteen 'shellbacks' kept complete control as they initiated the 'polywogs' into the Ancient Order of the Deep."

50|$|The Dayton Agreement {{resulted}} from {{a long series of}} events. Notably, the failures of EU-led peace plans, the August 1995 Croat Operation Storm and its aftermath, the Bosnian Serb atrocities, in particular the Srebrenica massacre, and the seizure of UNPROFOR peace-keepers as human shields against NATO's Operation Deliberate Force.Admiral Leighton W. Smith, Jr. (Commander in Chief Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH)) acted as the Joint Force Commander for the operation (also known as Commander IFOR (COMIFOR)). He commanded the operation from HQs in Zagreb and later from March 1996 from the Residency in Sarajevo. Lt Gen Michael Walker, Commander Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) acted as the Land Component Commander for the Operation, commanding from HQ ARRC (Forward) based initially in Kiseljak and from late January 1996 from HQ ARRC (Main) Ilidža. This was NATO's first ever <b>out-of-area</b> land deployment. The Land Component's part of the operation was known as Operation Firm Endeavour.|$|E
5000|$|Denis Healey, the Defence Secretary in 1966, {{once said}} that {{aircraft}} carriers were required only for operations involving 'landing or withdrawal of troops against sophisticated opposition outside range of land-based air cover'. When the last conventional carrier in the Royal Navy, , was decommissioned in 1978, the pro-carrier lobby succeeded in acquiring light carriers (euphemistically christened 'through deck cruisers') equipped with VTOL Sea Harriers as well as helicopters, justified {{by the fact that}} one of their primary roles was anti-submarine warfare. John Nott's defence review concluded that anti-submarine defence would be performed more cheaply by a smaller number of destroyers and frigates. The carrier [...] was therefore to be scrapped and [...] sold to Australia. Under the review, the Royal Navy was focused primarily on anti-submarine warfare under the auspices of NATO. Any <b>out-of-area</b> amphibious operations were considered unlikely. The entire Royal Marines was in jeopardy of being disbanded and the sale of [...] and [...] was mooted.|$|E
