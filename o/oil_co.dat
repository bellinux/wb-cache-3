5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum <b>Oil</b> <b>Co.</b> explained that it was almost impossible for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E

30|$|Habibi et al. (2017) {{carried out}} {{experiments}} on CO 2 –oil systems {{to determine the}} interaction between <b>CO</b> 2 and <b>oil</b> in tight rock samples. They conducted constant composition experiments (CCEs) to determine the CO 2 –oil swelling factor and other measurable fluid and thermodynamic characteristics. Also, they performed CO 2 cyclic injection experiments to {{determine the amount of}} <b>oil</b> recovery. The <b>CO</b> 2 -oil swelling factor in their study was defined as “the volume of the <b>oil</b> after <b>CO</b> 2 injection divided by the volume of the <b>oil</b> before <b>CO</b> 2 injection into the cell.” In their experiments, increasing CO 2 concentration from 48.4 % to 71.1 % resulted in an increase in the CO 2 –oil swelling factor from 1.21 to 1.39, respectively. According to their experimental data, the oil swelling and expansion, CO 2 dissolution into the <b>oil,</b> and <b>CO</b> 2 diffusion into core samples are the main mechanisms contributing to the oil production (Habibi et al. 2017).|$|R
