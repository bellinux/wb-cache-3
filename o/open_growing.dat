40|$|Usually, {{innovations}} in NDT {{are part of}} many main-stream, state-of-the-art development efforts {{in science and technology}} and applicable regulations, codes and standards often significantly slow down the development of innovative products. Fortunately, the world is changing. The formation of global markets, mobility of production, and effective international scientific networks are accelerating the dynamics of innovations pushed by a new dimension of application demands. In this presentation, we outline these challenges for NDT scientists and engineers along the value-added chain of producing and operating technical products and systems. We start with the contribution of NDT to the development of new materials and the control of production processes by integrating smart-sensors with feedback capabilities. We also discuss the impact of new maintenance and lifetime-extension management strategies, such as risk based applications and health monitoring. The growing demand for techniques that support human activities to make life safer and more secure also poses challenges and presents opportunities for new contributions from the NDT community. We conclude that the market is <b>open,</b> <b>growing,</b> and ready for NDT scientists to move forward and meet these demands...|$|E
40|$|A range-wide {{collection}} of Juglans regia seeds was undertaken in autumn 1997 from 12 countries, including 25 provenances and 375 half-sib progenies. 2200 seedlings were produced using innovative nursery techniques. The seedlings were planted in three provenance trials in southern England in 1999, {{the largest of}} which acted as a combined provenance/progeny trial. After one growing season, survival was 98. 9 %, mean height growth 35 cm, and mean stem diameter increment 5 mm. Provenance differences for both height and stem diameter increment were highly significant (p< 0. 001). There were no significant genotype × environment interactions. Flushing assessments revealed few significant differences between provenances and flushing was complete by early April. Family heritability for tree height was 0. 19 at one site and, with combined selection, genetic gain was estimated at 8 %. The effects of three types of treeshelter and a stumping treatment on walnut establishment were tested over three growing seasons. Treeshelters were found beneficial to height increment. However, 120 cm tall shelters promoted early flushing, and consequent risk of increased frost damage, and caused more stem die-back than 75 cm shelters. Stumping promoted rapid early height increment but gave no longer-term benefit. The crown (cd) and stem (dbh) diameter at breast height relationship of <b>open</b> <b>growing</b> trees in Britain was assessed and was highly significant (r 2 = 0. 96, p< 0. 001). The regression equation (cd = 2. 71 + 17. 6 dbh) permitted the estimation of suitable planting densities for the provenance trials and the calculation of a thinning regime. Isozyme analysis of the 375 genotypes identified 20 loci in 15 enzyme systems with seed embryo extracts. Using young leaf extracts, the polymorphic locus Pgm- 1 indicated low expected heterozygosity of 0. 06 both within populations and at the species level. FST and GST estimates, both 0. 05, indicated high uniformity among populations. Genetic distance estimates did not identify significant clustering consistent with geographic origin...|$|E
40|$|Vocational {{education}} {{is an important}} part of Estonian education system but it has a negative reputation in Estonia. In order to balance education system and labour market, the people’s attitude towards vocational education should be changed more positive. The image of vocational schools among publics influences the attitude to vocational education but the opinions do not necessarily reflect reality. The study and analysis of image gives knowledge of how different publics see vocational schools. Having an overview of the present image, the specialists of public relations will be able to change it with the help of public relations exercise. The aim of the present thesis is to give an overview and analyse the image of vocational schools among its present and future students and find reasons behind the development of the present image. The thesis consists of four chapters. The first chapter gives an overview of the theory of publics and the treatment of image by different authors. Also, the present situation of vocational schools and studies conducted on it are discussed. The second chapter describes the study carried out. The third chapter discusses study methods and interviewees, and the results of the study are given. The fourth chapter includes main conclusions of the study and a discussion. In the present thesis the study methods are Osgood´s semantical differentiation method and a questionnaire. The students of vocational school describe the image of the school as developing, open, rising and growing. The students of general education school describe it as equal, developing and open. The students of Miina Härma Gymnasium associate vocational school with the words strange and scaring off. The students of Tartu Forselius Gymnasium characterise vocational school as developing, <b>open,</b> <b>growing,</b> friendly and rising. The main result of this thesis is that general {{education is}} orientated for higher education. Most of the pupils want to continue their studies in higher school and therefore it is possible to make a conclusion that general education schools increase beliefs among pupils that higher education is better than vocational education...|$|E

40|$|Disturbance—the {{death of}} trees due to {{external}} forces such as wildfire or windstorms—drives forest stand dynamics and shapes ecosystems. Natural disturbances {{arising from the}} interaction of climate, topography, and established tree species have often occurred with some regularity, resulting in apparently perpetual renewal of particular forest structures. Minor changes in climate can have profound impacts on these disturbance regimes, breaking historically observed cycles and introducing novel stand conditions. Long-term historical baselines are critical to understanding such changes. Observational records are often inadequate, especially in western North America, where 400 year-old stands are common but reliable data are generally unavailable prior to the 20 th century. I use tree ring analysis to investigate the history of Douglas-fir beetle and western spruce budworm infestations, {{and the influence of}} partial disturbances on the drought tolerance of surviving trees, developing baseline understanding of disturbance interactions in interior British Columbia. No evidence is found of any outbreaks of western spruce budworm or Douglas-fir beetle that exceed the magnitude of outbreaks in the early 21 st century, suggesting that recent outbreaks represent historically high levels of insect activity. Both natural and anthropogenic partial disturbances are demonstrated to positively affect the drought tolerance of surviving trees in old-growth remnants and younger managed stands, respectively. Access by roots to areas with uninterrupted precipitation throughfall appears to be the driving force behind observed drought resistance, and will likely become more important under climate scenarios where droughts are prolonged and intensified by warmer temperatures. A major growth release ca. 1800 brought previously suppressed trees from a number of age classes into preeminence within their respective stands across the study area, forming the basis of the structure we now consider to be representative of old forests in the region. I propose that mountain pine beetle {{is the leading cause of}} this regionally synchronous growth release, based on the number of sites affected and the survival of sapling-sized Douglas-fir. Silvicultural prescriptions designed to provide <b>open</b> <b>growing</b> space to residual trees may help reverse overstocking resulting from wildfire exclusion and enhance resilience of stands within the timber harvesting area to increased temperatures...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{spreadsheet}} (SIMULHYDRO) {{was designed}} to predict the consumption of both water and fertilisers, and the environmental impact associated to nutrient leaching, in greenhouse soilless cultures {{on the basis of}} a limited number of variables (such as global radiation, air temperature, and the ion composition of irrigation water) and parameters, the most important of which is the ion uptake concentration (i. e. the expected ratio between ion and water uptake by the crop). SIMULHYDRO aggregates three major models that run on a daily basis to estimated: i) crop water uptake (VU); ii) the ion composition and the electrical conductivity of recycling nutrient solution (ECNS); iii) the ion composition of drainage water in open (free-drain) and semi-closed (with periodical discharge of the recirculating water) growing systems. SIMULHYDRO was used to simulate the water and mineral relations of greenhouse tomato plants grown in semi-closed substrate (rockwool) culture using saline water (approx. 9. 5 mmol L- 1 NaCl) and three different fertigation strategies: A) VU was systematically compensated with nutrient solution at full strength (ECNS = 2. 5 dS m- 1) in order to maintain a (relatively) constant nutrient content; mostly due to the accumulation of ballast ions (Na+ and Cl-), this strategy resulted in a progressive increase of ECNS till it reached a ceiling value (ECNSMAX = 4. 5 dS m- 1) tolerated by the crop, afterwards the recirculating water was flushed out; B) an EC set-point of approx. 3. 0 dS m- 1 was maintained and the nutrient solution was flushed out whenever the N-NO 3 - concentration decreased below 1. 0 mmol L- 1; C) VU was initially compensated with nutrient solution at full strength, as in Strategy A; when ECNS reached 4. 5 dS m- 1, the mixing tank was refilled with fresh water only, in order to withdraw N from the nutrient solution before discharge. The experiment included also an open system to verify the possible influence of salinity build-up and/or nutrient depletion on crop yield. A good agreement was found between simulated and measured data. No important effects of the adopted strategies were observed on VU and fruit yield, although the former was significantly higher in open system than in the Strategies A and B. Strategies A and C reduced total water use compared to the others. The results confirmed that a semi-closed system conducted following the strategy of full nutrient solution replenishment (Strategy A) may produce a massive environmental pollution due to nutrient (nitrogen) leaching, although to a much lesser extent than <b>open</b> <b>growing</b> system...|$|E
