25|$|American {{inventor}} James T. Russell {{has been}} credited with inventing the first system to record digital information on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp. Russell's patent application was first filed in 1966, and he was granted a patent in 1970. Following litigation, Sony and Philips licensed Russell's patents (then held by a Canadian company, <b>Optical</b> <b>Recording</b> Corp.) in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|The Compact Disc, or CD, is {{an optical}} disc used to store digital data, {{originally}} developed for storing digital audio. In 1965, James Russell acted upon his {{idea that the}} music industry needed a new medium whereby a gramophone record and the needle on a phonograph would no longer {{come into contact with}} one another. With an interest in lasers, Russell soon began his research in an optical system that would replace a phonograph's needle {{and replace it with a}} laser that would read codes in order to record and playback sound. [...] At 12inches (30cm) in diameter, Russell in 1970 had successfully invented and built the world's first compact disc that contained digitized codes etched onto the disc that could be read from a laser. After partnering with Digital Recording which was later acquired by <b>Optical</b> <b>Recording</b> Corporation, Russell and the parent company that he worked for, found it increasingly difficult to enforce and protect his patents from infringement by competitors such as Sony, Philips, and Time Warner who all profited from Russell's invention. The belief that Dutch and Japanese scientists [...] "invented" [...] the compact disc is a misconception in the sense that Philips and Sony used Russell's underlying technology in order to develop a disc more refined, practical, smaller and sophisticated. In 1982, Sony and Philips had commercially introduced the compact disc, twelve years after Russell had already created a working prototype in 1970. By 1986, <b>Optical</b> <b>Recording</b> decided to legally act by suing Sony, Phillips, and Time Warner. Two years later, the company came to a licensing settlement with Sony and soon thereafter, agreements with Phillips and others soon followed, including a June 1992 court ruling that required Time Warner to pay <b>Optical</b> <b>Recording</b> $30 million due to patent infringement.|$|E
