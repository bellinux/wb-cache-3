40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{reports on}} the {{experience}} of one hospital regarding the surgical aspects, anatomic investigation and outcomes of the management <b>of</b> 21 conjoined <b>twin</b> pairs over the past 20 years. METHODS: All cases <b>of</b> conjoined <b>twins</b> who were treated during this period were reviewed. A careful imaging evaluation was performed to detail the abdominal anatomy (particularly the liver), inferior vena cava, spleen and pancreas, either to identify the number of organs or to evaluate the degree of organ sharing. RESULTS: There were eight sets <b>of</b> ischiopagus <b>twins,</b> seven sets <b>of</b> thoracopagus <b>twins,</b> three sets <b>of</b> omphalopagus <b>twins,</b> two sets <b>of</b> thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus <b>twins</b> and one set <b>of</b> craniopagus <b>twins.</b> Nine pairs <b>of</b> conjoined <b>twins</b> could not be separated due to the complexity of the organs (mainly the liver and heart) that were shared by both twins; these pairs included one set <b>of</b> ischiopagus <b>twins,</b> six sets <b>of</b> thoracopagus <b>twins</b> and one set <b>of</b> thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus <b>twins.</b> Twelve sets were separated, including seven sets <b>of</b> ischiopagus <b>twins,</b> three sets <b>of</b> omphalopagus <b>twins,</b> one set <b>of</b> thoracopagus <b>twins</b> and one set <b>of</b> craniopagus conjoined <b>twins.</b> The abdominal wall was closed in the majority of patients with the use of mesh instead of the earlier method of using tissue expanders. The surgical survival rate was 66. 7 %, and one pair <b>of</b> <b>twins</b> who did not undergo separation is currently alive.

However, such speculation has been disputed by local historian, Paulo Sauthier, who says Mengele did not study twins during his time in Brazil.
