5|$|In spite {{or perhaps}} because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> in these nuclear tests, Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E

5|$|Tyler {{is buried}} in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, near the gravesite of former President James Monroe. Tyler has since been the namesake of several U.S. locations, {{including}} the city of Tyler, Texas, named for him because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> in the annexation of Texas.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> {{in the death}} of the god Baldr, Loki (described as father of Fenrir) is bound on top of three stones with the internal organs of his son Narfi (which are turned into iron) in three places. There, venom drops onto his face periodically from a snake placed by the jötunn Skaði. Loki's wife Sigyn collects the venom into a bucket, but whenever she leaves to empty it, the drops reach Loki's face, and the pain he experiences causes convulsions, resulting in earthquakes. Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of Ragnarök.|$|E

5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> in the May Revolution, {{he was not the}} clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Guy Lombardo {{and the decline of}} the Royal Canadians' special, New Year's Rockin' Eve grew in popularity, and became {{ingrained}} in pop culture—even prompting Clark himself to make appearances on other programs in parody <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role.</b> To this day, New Year's Rockin' Eve has consistently remained the highest-rated New Year's Eve special broadcast by the United States' major television networks; its 2012 edition peaked at 22.6 million home viewers—not including viewers watching from public locations, which were historically not measured by Nielsen. Dick Clark hosted New Year's Rockin' Eve annually from 1973 through 2004, and served as a Times Square correspondent alongside Peter Jennings for ABC News's special coverage of year 2000 celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits {{went into a}} trust fund to support the insane person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not simply because somebody had been found insane.|$|E
50|$|As an actor, most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>roles</b> {{occurred}} between 1912 and 1936, not gaining {{as much attention}} as later he would as a director.|$|R

5|$|In 1891, the Henry Wilson school, a {{facility}} for black students, opened {{on what was}} then Central Street in the Washington County portion of the District of Columbia (now 17th Street in the Adams Morgan neighborhood). It was named for him in honor <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> emancipating the district's slaves. The school was closed in 1956 due to its small size, and shortly thereafter converted to the Morgan Annex, a satellite location of the adjacent Thomas P. Morgan School. The Morgan Annex was later closed; it was sold in 1989, and then reopened as the Morgan Annex Lofts condominiums.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} impeachment brought against him {{in response to his}} actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor James B. Ray for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28–30.|$|E
5|$|Macartney made 20 in {{the first}} innings and was unbeaten on 22, playing as an opener, as Australia {{completed}} a ten-wicket win in the First Test. It was Australia's sixth consecutive Test win over England. He failed to pass 20 {{in the next two}} county matches, but did take 2/19 against Middlesex, his first wickets on tour. This came in his 11th match on tour and was a reflection <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> as a specialist batsman in the post-war years. The next game against Gloucestershire heralded the start of a rich vein of run-scoring during the remainder of June. Macartney scored 149, in an Australian innings noted for elegant strokeplay and big hitting, after managing only 31 and eight in the eight-wicket win in the Second Test, hit three consecutive centuries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>roles</b> {{arguably the}} best known is Tihi, wisecracking World War II {{resistance}} fighter whom he portrayed in cult 1970s TV series Otpisani and Povratak otpisanih.|$|R

5|$|Michael {{automatically}} succeeded as king upon Ferdinand's {{death and}} the regency council took charge <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> as monarch. In May 1928, Carol, who had found his life abroad with Magda Lupescu unsatisfactory, attempted to return to Romania {{with the help of}} the 1st Viscount Rothermere. He was prevented from doing so by English authorities, who then proceeded to expel him from England. Infuriated, Marie sent an official apology to George V on behalf of her son, who had already begun plotting a coup d'état. Carol succeeded in divorcing Princess Helen on 21 June 1928, on grounds of incompatibility.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April 1944 Stalin granted Bagramyan's {{request to}} relieve the troops of the Front of {{offensive}} duties. However, German forces took this to their advantage as they mounted a new offensive against Soviet partisan fighters in Belarus. Bagramyan's senior staff diverted air support and other crucial supplies to aid the partisans, allowing most of them to escape the German encirclement. With the advance of Soviet forces in the Baltic and the Ukraine, German Army Group Center had largely been isolated as STAVKA prepared to eliminate the pocket (consisting of Third Panzer, Second, Fourth, and Ninth Armies). STAVKA's plan, codenamed Operation Bagration was kept secret {{from all of the}} involved Front commanders. Bagramyan himself was only informed in May 1944 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> in the offensive.|$|E

5|$|The mitre may {{be shown}} {{in all sorts of}} colours. It may be {{represented}} either gold or jewelled, the former more common in English heraldry. A form of mitre with coronet is proper to the Bishop of Durham because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> as Prince-Bishop of the palatinate of Durham. For similar reasons the Bishop of Durham and some other bishops display a sword behind the shield, pointed downward to signify a former civil jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his time}} at the college Ketèlbey wrote lighter, mostly mandolin-based, compositions. As he still aspired to be a serious composer, he adapted the {{pseudonym}} Raoul Clifford in an effort to distance himself from the genre. On leaving the college he became one of its examiners in harmony. He wrote piano pieces as part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role,</b> and used the pseudonym Anton Vodorinski for the work; he subsequently used the name for more serious works, which he published with French titles.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{preparations}} for Operation Downfall, {{the invasion of}} Japan, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC) in April 1945, assuming command of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific except the Twentieth Air Force. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command in the Pacific therefore remained divided. During his planning of the invasion of Japan, MacArthur stressed to the decision-makers in Washington that it was essential to have the Soviet Union enter the war as he argued it was crucial to have the Red Army tie down the Kwantung army in Manchuria. The invasion was pre-empted by the surrender of Japan in August 1945. On 2 September MacArthur accepted the formal Japanese surrender aboard the battleship , thus ending hostilities in World War II. In recognition <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>role</b> as a maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
40|$|Ministers {{occupy a}} status-position within a social system that carries a {{well-defined}} set of cultural expectations about their roles. The {{membership of the}} minister’s church, the community at large, and the minister himself formulate ideas and expectations about the function <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>roles.</b> Whenever the minister performs <b>his</b> <b>roles</b> {{in a manner that}} is contrary to the expectations of the membership <b>of</b> <b>his</b> church or the community the result is a role discord. Role discord also occurs when the minister performs <b>his</b> <b>roles</b> in a way that contradicts <b>his</b> own self-image <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>roles.</b> Therefore, this thesis will have as its main objective the discovery of conflict which exists between the ideal expectations that the membership has of the minister’s <b>roles</b> and <b>his</b> self-concept <b>of</b> these roles; and to test hypotheses concerning this conflict...|$|R
