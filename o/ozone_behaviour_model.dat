No consensus has been reached mainly due to the inability to generalize, operationalise and validate these subjective cognitive models in real driving conditions. This paper defines a framework for a new context aware driving <b>behaviour</b> <b>model</b> capable of predicting driver’s behaviour. This approach broadens the cognitive focus of existing driving <b>behaviour</b> <b>models</b> to integrate contextual information related to the vehicle, environment, driver and the interactions between them.

40|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{research}} to create capabilities that address the need for human behaviour representations in training simulations and other M&S application domains. In training, human <b>behaviour</b> <b>models</b> have applications as synthetic teammates and adversaries, but can also be used as a representation {{of the state of the}} trainee and as synthetic instructors to increase the effectiveness of the training enterprise as a whole. They are essential components for achieving the goals for training simulations and for Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) training, including affordability, availability, and credibility. Over the last two decades, numerous formalisms and architectures for modelling cognition, performance, and other relevant characteristics of the human being have emerged, and the capabilities and applications have expanded dramatically. However, models vary along many dimensions, including fidelity, application domain, underlying modelling formalisms, and behavioural repertoire. This diversity leads to critical challenges with respect to interoperability and reuse, in particular the integration of component models into a comprehensive <b>behaviour</b> <b>model,</b> and the integration of <b>behaviour</b> <b>models</b> into simulation environments. The challenges are further complicated by a lack of standards for human <b>behaviour</b> <b>modelling,</b> leading to brittle models, lack of reusability, and increased costs driven by the requirements of model integration and reengineering. In this paper, we discuss the need for human <b>behaviour</b> <b>modelling,</b> its role in supporting affordable, available, and credible training experiences in simulation and LVC environments, and propose a reference architecture to enable interoperability standards that support a variety of models serving a diverse set of purposes, both within and beyond the training domain.

40|$|Synthesis of {{operational}} <b>behaviour</b> <b>models</b> from scenario-based specifications {{has been}} extensively studied. Focus has been mainly on either existential or universal interpretations. Existing model synthesis techniques use traditional two-valued <b>behaviour</b> <b>models</b> such as Labeled Transition Systems (LTS). We propose a scenario-based language that supports both existential and universal interpretations for conditional scenarios. We show that LTS are not sufficiently expressive to accommodate such languages and shift the target of synthesis to Modal Transition Systems (MTS), an extension of LTS that can distinguish between required, unknown and proscribed behaviour to capture the semantics of existential and universal scenarios. MTSs support elaboration of <b>behaviour</b> <b>models</b> through refinement, which complements an incremental elicitation process suitable for specifying behaviour with scenario-based notations. The synthesis algorithm that we define constructs an MTS that uses refinement to characterise all the LTS models that satisfy a mixed, conditional existential and universal scenario-based specification.
