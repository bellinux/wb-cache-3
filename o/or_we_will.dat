25|$|On two occasions, {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} cosmologist Stephen Hawking has argued for space colonization {{as a means}} of saving humanity. In 2001, Hawking predicted that the human race would become extinct within the next thousand years, unless colonies could be established in space. In 2006, he stated that humanity faces two options: either we colonize space within the next two hundred years and build residential units on other planets, <b>or</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> face the prospect of long-term extinction.|$|E

25|$|Adding to {{the growing}} {{tensions}} between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted {{to give them an}} ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage <b>or</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> make sure you don’t get reelected. Burns stated “Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility.” She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his address to Congress. When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill. A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.|$|E

Haywood threatened the authorities with another strike, saying [...] "Open the jail gates <b>or</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> close the mill gates." [...] Legal efforts and a one-day strike on September 30 did not prompt the authorities to drop the charges. [...] Haywood was indicted in Lawrence for misuse of strike funds, a move that kept him from returning to the city and eventually led to his arrest on the Boston Common. However, on November 26, Ettor and Giovannitti were acquitted, and upon their release were treated to a massive demonstration of public support.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Mark McLeod, these postulated {{explanations of}} Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam {{at the time}} and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, {{both before and after the}} signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted: [...] "Gratitude ties us to our king. We will avenge the insults he has received , <b>or</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> die for him." [...] One of Định's proclamations to his followers read: [...] "The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed our duty to carry on our struggle.... The Emperor calls us rebels, but in the depth of his heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty. When the day of victory arrives, not only will the Emperor forgive us, he will furthermore grant us all kinds of awards." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne (23 April 17563 June 1819), {{also known}} as Jean Nicolas, was a French {{personality}} of the Revolutionary period. Though {{not one of the}} most well known figures of the French Revolution, Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne was an instrumental figure of the period known as the Reign of Terror. Billaud-Varenne climbed his way up the ladder of power during the period of The Terror, becoming one of the most militant members of the Committee of Public Safety. He was recognized and worked with French Revolution figures Georges Danton and Maximilien Robespierre, and is often considered one of the key architects of the period known as The Terror.

However, some scientists now believe that a [...] "peak phosphorus" [...] will occur in 30 years and that [...] "At current rates, reserves will be depleted in the next 50 to 100 years."

2500|$|After the Freeh report's release, local {{organizations}} {{called for}} the removal of the Joe Paterno statue outside Beaver Stadium. A small plane towed a banner over campus, reading Take the Statue Down <b>or</b> <b>We</b> <b>Will.</b> After some days of mixed messages, the school removed the statue on Sunday, July 22, in front of a crowd of student onlookers. The statue was reportedly put in storage. President Erickson said the statue had become [...] "a source of division and an obstacle to healing" [...] but made a distinction between it and the Paterno Library, also on campus. The $13 million 1997 library expansion, partially funded by a $4 million gift from Paterno and his wife Sue, [...] "remains a tribute to Joe and Sue Paterno's commitment to Penn State's student body and academic success, and it highlights the positive impacts coach Paterno had on the university....
