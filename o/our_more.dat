It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.|$|E

500|$|Wolfgang's {{original}} intention {{with the}} album {{was to create a}} collection of previously released b-sides along with three reworked demos, with Eddie saying: [...] "It would [...] a record of <b>our</b> <b>more</b> hardcore songs and none of the pop stuff. That was the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, the more we found. At the same time I was writing new songs. Dave got very excited about that. We all did. We ended up recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E

[...] He sees Hazlitt, too, in The Spirit of the Age along with some other essays, as the first to recognize how Scott traced the action of historical forces through individual characters.|$|E

2500|$|Social {{immunity}} is any antiparasite defence {{which is}} mounted {{for the benefit}} of individuals other than the actor. For parasites, the frequent contact, high population density and low genetic variability makes social groups of organisms a promising target for infection: this has driven the evolution of collective and cooperative anti-parasite mechanisms that both prevent the establishment of and reduce the damage of diseases among group members. Social immune mechanisms range from the prophylactic, such as burying beetles smearing their carcasses with antimicrobials or termites fumigating their nests with napthalene, to the active defenses seen in the imprisoning of parasitic beetles by honeybees or by the miniature 'hitchhiking' leafcutter ants which travel on larger worker's leaves to fight off parasitioid flies. Whilst many specific social immune mechanisms have been studied for some time in relative isolation (e.g. the [...] "collective medication" [...] found in wood ants), it was only until Sylvia Cremer et al.'s 2007 landmark paper 'Social Immunity' in Current Biology did the topic become seriously considered as a whole, conceptually and in an evolutionary sense. Empirical and theoretical work in social immunity continues to reveal not only new mechanisms of protection but also implications for our understanding of the evolution of group living and polyandry, as well as having consequences for <b>our</b> <b>more</b> general understanding of the origin of complex regulatory systems.|$|E
2500|$|McKenzie {{proposed}} {{outreach programs}} for the Nashville Black community. In early 1919, McKenzie wrote L. Hollingsworth Wood regarding his desire for Fisk to more aggressively engage with the Black community. McKenzie proposed a small fund to establishing a night school for local Blacks, provide extension work in Nashville, offer free weekly musical concerts, and offer continuing education programs for Black teachers and clergy in the South. McKenzie viewed summer school for Black church leaders, and student engagement in Black churches during Sunday services, as important tools for community engagement. [...] "If we had the funds we might gather a group of preachers for two weeks, or four weeks, or longer, and do them some good. As we develop our courses along religious and recreational lines we probably shall {{be able to develop}} the equivalent of a Y.M.C.A. training course, and {{we may be able to}} utilize <b>our</b> <b>more</b> advanced students to real advantage in the churches and Sunday schools of the city." [...] However, lack of funding precluded most of McKenzie's ideas from being implemented. Funding issues also hampered those efforts he did implement, including Bethlehem House, a settlement house where social service students trained. These efforts continued with McKenzie's successor, Thomas Elsa Jones, who in 1946 Fisk partnered with Tennessee State University to establish an extension program for [...] "functionally [...] illiterate" [...] Blacks in Nashville, an idea first envisioned by McKenzie in 1915.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first episode}} was [...] "Natural Born Kissers" [...] from season nine. The show's creator Matt Groening listed {{it as his}} eighth {{favorite}} episode in 2000. Selman considers his best episode to be season twelve's [...] "Trilogy of Error", {{which was based on}} the film Go, and features three inter-linked stories. Robert Canning of IGN praised the episode, calling it [...] "one extremely enjoyable misadventure. The Simpsons may have peaked in the '90s, but that doesn't mean the eight years since haven't delivered their share of quality episodes. This was one of them.". Other episodes he has written include [...] "Behind the Laughter", [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain", [...] "Husbands and Knives", [...] "The Haw-Hawed Couple", [...] "Future-Drama" [...] and [...] "That '90s Show". Selman stated he was [...] "proud" [...] of [...] "That '90s Show" [...] {{despite the fact that it}} [...] "irritated some of <b>our</b> <b>more</b> hardcore fans because they felt we were deliberately ret-conning the classic flashbacks of how Homer and Marge met and how the kids were born." [...] He added that it was [...] "not a serious attempt to rewrite the show's continuity". He has won five Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on the show, sharing them with the other producers. Selman received an Annie Award in 1999 for writing [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories". He also won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2004 for writing the episode [...] "The Dad Who Knew Too Little". In the episode, Homer's e-mail was said to be chunkylover53@aol.com. Selman registered the e-mail and received thousands of messages after the episode aired. He responded to some of them in the character of Homer, but gave up after being swamped with e-mails.|$|E
