5|$|In {{the second}} round, there are again three {{question}}s. Each question {{starts with a}} value of $10,000 and has two correct answers; the team must select both correct answers {{in order to get}} credit. After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which of them will be eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season <b>one</b> <b>only)</b> before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings.|$|E
5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the earth that the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people...

5|$|Kartik {{was called}} into the Test squad to tour New Zealand in late 2002 after Kumble withdrew, but in the warm-up match he bowled <b>one</b> <b>only</b> over, {{in which he was}} {{hammered}} for 23 runs. He then watched from the sidelines as India only fielded one spin bowler—Harbhajan—in the Tests, held on green, pace-friendly surfaces. Kartik returned to India and was ineffective in the zonal one-dayers, taking a total of 1/148 from 24 overs in three matches, conceding more than a run a ball. Combined with his results against the West Indies, the poor returns saw him left out of the 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Kumble preferred.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's operas {{consistently}} enjoyed enormous popularity {{during his}} lifetime, and {{the verdict of}} (the then pro-Meyerbeer) Wagner in 1841, when the Paris Opéra was vainly awaiting Le prophète and L'Africaine, was not atypical:The Paris Opéra lies dying. It looks for its salvation to the German Messiah, Meyerbeer; if he keeps it waiting much longer, its death agonies will begin...It is for that reason...that <b>one</b> <b>only</b> sees Robert le Diable and Les Huguenots turning up again when the mediocrities are forced to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|As the Scions mourn their fallen comrade, Aymeric parleys for aid in Ishgard's {{defense against}} Nidhogg's forces. Minfilia and Alphinaud reluctantly pledge {{the support of}} the Scions and Crystal Braves, though the other Grand Company leaders decline to provide assistance, citing {{domestic}} troubles and remembering Ishgard's reticence during the three Garlean invasions. The adventurer leads a band of volunteers at the Steps of Faith, Ishgard's main bridge. They manage to repel the attack and a victory celebration is held at Ul'dah with the hopes of pressuring Ishgard to rejoin the Alliance. At the banquet, Sultana Nanamo Ul Namo privately discloses to the Warrior of Light that she plans to dissolve the monarchy in order to erode the power of the Syndicate which is the source of much of Ul'dah's corruption. However, the sultana's wine is poisoned and Teledji Adeledji bursts in to accuse the player of regicide just as Nanamo takes her last breath. Adeledji brings the adventurer forward to the banquet with his charges and denounces Raubahn for his negligence. Enraged, Raubahn murders Adeledji but Lolorito, another scheming Syndicate member, takes this as proof of Raubahn's guilt and has him arrested. The Crystal Braves are revealed to be in the pay of Lolorito and attempt to apprehend the fleeing Scions who are taken out one by <b>one.</b> <b>Only</b> a humbled Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light manage to escape with the help of Raubahn's son Pipin Tarupin. Cid takes them to Coerthas where the grateful Ishgardians grant them asylum from the Syndicate's pursuers.|$|E
5|$|When mysterious shadow monsters begin {{attacking the}} SSS, Takamatsu gets devoured by <b>one,</b> <b>only</b> to {{reappear}} as an NPC. Otonashi reasons {{with the other}} SSS members {{and many of them}} agree to pass on in lieu of becoming an NPC, including the rest of Girls Dead Monster, Chaa of the Guild, and several unnamed members. Yuri destroys the computers responsible for the shadow program, which was programmed to activate when love was detected in the world, to prevent it from becoming a true paradise and maintain its limbo state. Those who are left—Otonashi, Yuri, Kanade, Hinata and Naoi—hold a graduation ceremony where they thank each other for their support. After Naoi, Yuri and Hinata pass on, Otonashi learns that Kanade's regret was not being able to thank him for the heart she received from Otonashi after his death. Otonashi is heartbroken after she thanks him and passes on, as he has fallen in love with her. In the epilogue, two people resembling Otonashi and Kanade meet each other on the street in the real world. In an alternative epilogue, Otonashi is shown to have stayed behind in the afterlife to help people pass on.|$|E
