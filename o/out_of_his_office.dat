500|$|Whitney {{supported}} the {{changes at the}} Tribune {{but they did not}} help the newspaper's bottom line. A survey of readers of the newspaper in late 1963 found that readers [...] "appreciated the Tribune's innovations, (but) the Times still plainly ranked as the prestige paper in the New York field, based mostly on its completeness." [...] Whitney himself was popular with the staff—Breslin called him [...] "the only millionaire I ever rooted for"—and once burst <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> wondering why the Tribune failed to sell more copies when [...] "there's compelling reading on every page."

Verdi claims that gradually he worked on the music: [...] "This verse today, tomorrow that, here a note, there a whole phrase, and little by little the opera was written" [...] so that by the autumn of 1841 it was complete.

50|$|In mid-2007, New York's {{attorney}} general opened {{an inquiry into}} the relationships between universities and providers of foreign study. According to Benjamin Lawsky, former deputy counselor {{in the office of}} Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, the inquiry was to focus on whether cash incentives and other perks that foreign-study providers give universities influence their decisions about where students may study. Critics contend that the practices, rarely disclosed and largely unknown, limit study abroad options and drive up the price that is ultimately passed onto students. The investigation follows disclosures in The New York Times that providers of study abroad are offering colleges rebates, free and subsidized travel, unpaid seats on advisory boards, help with back-office services and marketing stipends. In some cases, perks are tied to the number of students universities send to a given provider’s program. When asked, Lawsky said that the inquiry grew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office's</b> inquiries into similar practices in the student loan industry.|$|R
2500|$|The {{shooting}} {{took place}} at Accent Signage Systems, a sign-making business located in the Bryn Mawr neighborhood of Minneapolis, which is bisected by Interstate 394.

Before going to the executive offices, Engeldinger first went to his car, apparently to retrieve a Glock 19 9mm handgun. When he was informed by Souter that he was losing his job, Engeldinger responded with [...] "Oh, really?" [...] and took out the handgun from his holster. A struggle over the handgun ensued between Engeldinger, Souter, and top manager Rami Cooks; gunshots severely wounded Souter and fatally wounded Cooks. Engeldinger then left Souter's office, shooting and killing company founder Reuven Rahamim, who was stepping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> which was next to Souter's. He then left the executive offices and entered a sign-display area, killing Jacob Beneke, an employee from Maple Grove. Engeldinger then moved on to the loading dock area, where he shot and killed a second employee, Ronald Edberg of Brooklyn Center. He also killed Keith Basinski, a UPS driver who was on a delivery, as he was seated in his truck. Engeldinger then entered the production floor and continued firing, fatally wounding production manager Eric Rivers and grazing another employee.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his call}} for a boycott on June 2, 1925, Du Bois pursued his {{challenge}} to Fisk and McKenzie through his editorials in The Crisis, the official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and in Black newspapers across the country. In the fall of 1924, Du Bois embarked upon a lecture tour speaking to Fisk alumni clubs throughout the nation. He also contacted Fisk students, faculty, and alumni {{as part of an}} effort to collect evidence and examples of a paternalistic and authoritarian Fisk administration in sympathy with White Southern interests. [...] Soon Du Bois targeted McKenzie. In late 1924, Du Bois wrote of McKenzie's appointment as President in The Crisis: [...] "I knew him. I called him friend. I saw in him a new type of young, scientific philanthropist come to help and re-establish training among Negroes." [...] In early 1925, Du Bois resurrected the Fisk Herald, the former Fisk student newspaper. As a former editor of the Herald in the 1880s, Du Bois had a special affection for the newspaper. For many Fisk alumni, the Fisk Herald was an important symbol of literary freedom. Du Bois published the paper <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> in New York City, and proclaimed in the inaugural issue, [...] "Unless McKenzie is removed from Fisk, I intend to publish every word of evidence I hold to prove he is unfit and a detriment to the cause of higher education for our race." ...|$|E

[...] Including an article that was translated into Persian and Arabic that [...] "highlighted the diversity of his constituents in Minnesota, ranging from Swedes and Norwegians to 'the largest Somali immigrant community in America.'" [...] In his work in cooperation with the state department, Ellison stresses the religious freedom available in the U.S., saying things like [...] "religious tolerance has a much longer pedigree in America than some of the intolerance we've seen lately." [...] Even in his work with the State Department he remained critical of President Bush's Iraq policy saying [...] "he wants people around the world to know that 'there are many Americans who want to relate to the rest of the world in terms of cooperation, not military domination.'" [...] Ellison staffers told reporters that [...] "the State Department has shown no signs of squeamishness about publicizing his criticism of the war." [...] When asked about working with elements of the Bush administration Ellison said [...] "Hey, my country first. We can work out our political differences later. I've said I'm willing to do whatever I can to make some friends for America." ...|$|E
