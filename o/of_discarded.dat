3000|$|There are {{two rounds}} <b>of</b> <b>discarding</b> in the {{algorithm}} CudaChain. To {{evaluate the effectiveness}} of the proposed preprocessing method SPA, the remaining points after each round <b>of</b> <b>discarding</b> are counted; and then the effectiveness of two rounds <b>of</b> <b>discarding</b> is accordingly compared. The results presented in Fig.  15 show that SPA can dramatically reduce the number of remaining points and thus improve the overall efficiency of CudaChain. In addition, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>discarding</b> interior points by SPA becomes better with the increasing of the data size.|$|R
30|$|The {{correctness}} of CudaChain can obviously be guaranteed. It {{is clear}} that: (1) in the calculating of convex hulls, any potential extreme points {{should not be}} discarded; and (2) any points that {{have been identified as}} interior ones can be discarded. As mentioned several times, there are two rounds <b>of</b> <b>discarding</b> in CudaChain. In the first round <b>of</b> <b>discarding,</b> those points locating in the quadrilateral formed by extreme points are definitely the interior ones and can be discarded. In the second round <b>of</b> <b>discarding,</b> It has been proved that the points detected as the interior using the proposed preprocessing method SPA is reasonable; see Fig.  3. Thus, this discarding can also be guaranteed to be correct. After two rounds <b>of</b> <b>discarding,</b> all the remaining points are used to calculate the expected convex hull.|$|R
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|Mills booked {{herself into}} the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, which put her on a raw food vegan diet, using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound. After an operation, Mills {{discovered}} {{that she had been}} previously identified as having an O rhesus negative blood type, when in fact she was A rhesus negative, which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so-called blood type diet. As her prosthetic leg had to be replaced on a regular basis, because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed, she had the idea to collect thousands <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> prosthetic limbs for amputees in Croatia. Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the prosthetic limbs before being transported, which resulted in 22,000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with prosthetic limbs by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients. The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994 and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the Good Morning with Anne and Nick daytime TV show. She received an award in 2001 from Croatia's prime minister, Ivica Račan for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring {{live and}} dead {{discarded}} catch contributes to effective fisheries management and ecological and socioeconomic sustainability. We determined contemporary rates and levels <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> in global tuna fisheries. An estimated 265 279 t (52 283 to 478 275 t 95 % CI) is annually discarded by global tuna fisheries, composing about 5 % {{of the weight}} of the total catch. Pelagic longline and purse seine fisheries contributed about 64 and 36 % <b>of</b> <b>discards,</b> respectively. Other gear types composed < 1 % <b>of</b> <b>discards.</b> Discards in tuna fisheries are now 63 % lower than estimated 1 decade earlier, mainly due to large declines in discards in longline tuna fisheries, possibly from increased retention <b>of</b> formerly <b>discarded</b> species and sizes of catch and increased gear selectivity. The decline also resulted, in part, from employing different methods to categorize caught sharks whose fins were retained and carcasses discarded following processing. Discard rates were greater in shallow-than deep-set longline fisheries, and higher in purse seine sets associated with fish aggregating devices and other floating objects than in other purse seine set types. The quality and availability <b>of</b> data on <b>discards</b> in global tuna fisheries were extremely limited. Filling gaps in monitoring, improving observer data fields and collection protocols, and providing public access to amalgamated discard data held by fisheries management organizations will improve the certainty <b>of</b> future <b>discard</b> estimates, supporting effective management <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> in global tuna fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Discards {{generated}} from marine fisheries have significantly affected species populations and community composition of seabirds through mechanisms such as competition, predator–prey interactions and nutrient transfer. Our {{understanding of the}} fate <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> beyond seabird scavenging is fragmented, but {{it is likely that}} similar mechanisms come into play. This study contributes in resolving this knowledge gap by quantifying the amount and composition <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> that become available to scavengers other than seabirds. The key was nevertheless found in revealing seabird discard consumption, as seabirds are likely the first in taking profit <b>of</b> fishery <b>discards</b> due to their high mobility. Their selective consumption determines the composition and amount of food remaining for others. The consumption <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> by scavenging seabirds was assessed for the French fishing fleet in the Bay of Biscay. Experimental sea trials were conducted to assess the proportion <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> consumed by foraging guild and discard type. Experimental discard consumption (EDC) was raised to fleet level by foraging guild using the total number <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> by discard type. The raising procedure accounted for the spatio-temporal variability of both foraging guilds and discards, by standardising both distributions to their lowest common resolution. Discards limited inferences in space, whilst the highest temporal resolution was determined by the biennial monitoring of foraging guilds. As EDC of roundfish by Large gulls and Gannets varied considerably, we investigated the main drivers. Consumption increased logarithmically with the number of ship followers for both guilds, but was greatly impaired by competitors for Large gulls. Competition between Large gulls and Gannets reduced the roundfish consumption by threefold, while other guilds such as Kittiwakes, Procellariids and Skuas had only a limited though significant influence. As Large gulls dominated during the first semester (April to September), the consumption <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> and notably roundfish was dictated by this foraging guild. The abundance of ship following Gannets was remarkably higher in the second semester (October to March). This change in flock composition and in numbers of ship followers implied an increase in the consumed proportion of roundfish of 27. 9 %. The total number <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> that became available to non-avian scavengers was however higher in the first semester, as more discards were produced during this period. Most discards comprised benthic invertebrates, but excluding this discard type revealed that over two thirds <b>of</b> the <b>discards</b> remained roundfish...|$|R
25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and non-target species, particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> fish and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the Pacific halibut caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or lesser spotted dogfish in beam trawls in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments. Crustaceans {{are thought to be}} more hardy, though survival of crustaceans is variable; for instance, a survival rate of 25% is assumed for Nephrops norvegicus, the Norway Lobster, whilst survival rates of almost 100% have been demonstrated for the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} evidence of early domestication comes from the Botai culture, found in northern Kazakhstan. The Botai culture was a culture of foragers who seem to have adopted horseback riding in order to hunt the abundant wild horses of northern Kazakhstan between 3500–3000 BCE. Botai sites had no cattle or sheep bones; the only domesticated animals, in addition to horses, were dogs. Botai settlements in this period contained between 50–150 pit houses. Garbage deposits contained tens to hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> animal bones, 65% to 99% of which had come from horses. Also, there has been evidence found of horse milking at these sites, with horse milk fats soaked into pottery shards dating to 3500 BCE. Earlier hunter-gatherers who lived in the same region had not hunted wild horses with such success, and lived for millennia in smaller, more shifting settlements, often containing less than 200 wild animal bones.|$|E
25|$|Homelessness is the {{condition}} of people without a permanent dwelling, such as a house or apartment. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing. The legal definition of homeless varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region. The term homeless may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a homeless shelter, a domestic violence shelter, long-term residence in a motel, a vehicle, squatting, cardboard boxes, a tent city, tarpaulins, shanty town structures made <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> building materials or other ad hoc housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, a home {{is not just a}} physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, a sense of belonging and a place of emotional wellbeing. American government homeless enumeration studies also include people who sleep in a public or private place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. There are a number of organizations who provide help for the homeless.|$|E

25|$|According to Efraim Karsh, {{before the}} {{fighting}} started, the IDF used loudspeakers broadcasting in Arabic {{to urge the}} locals to evacuate the camp, and he estimates that some 11,000 left.

After the battle, Israeli intelligence estimated that half the population of noncombatants had left before the invasion, and 90% had done so by the third day, leaving around 1,300 people. Others estimated that 4,000 people had remained in the camp. Some camp residents reported hearing the Israeli calls to evacuate, while others said they did not. Many thousands did leave the camp, with women and children usually permitted to move into the villages in the surrounding hills or the neighbouring city. However, the men who left were almost all temporarily detained.
