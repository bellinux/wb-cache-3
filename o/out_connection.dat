40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to evaluate safety performances of different exit ramps used in Florida and nationally. More specific, the research objectives include the following two parts: (1) to evaluate the impacts of different exit ramp types on safety performance for freeway diverge areas; and (2) to identify the different factors contributing to the crashes happening on the exit ramp sections. To achieve the research objectives, the research team investigated crash history at 424 sites throughout Florida. The study area includes two parts, the freeway diverge area and the exit ramp sections. For the freeway diverge areas, exit ramp types were defined {{based on the number of}} lanes used by vehicular traffic to exit freeways. Four exit ramp types were considered here including single-lane exit ramps (Type 1), sing-lane exit ramps without a taper (Type 2), two-lane exit ramps with an optional lane (Type 3), and two-lane exit ramps without an optional lane (Type 4). For the exit ramp sections, four ramp configurations, including diamond, <b>out</b> <b>connection,</b> free-flow loop and parclo loop, were considered. Cross-sectional comparisons were conducted to compare crash frequency, crash rate, crash severity and crash types between different exit ramp groups. Crash predictive models were also built to quantify the impacts of various contributing factors. On the freeway diverge areas, it shows that Type 1 exit ramp has the best safety performance in terms of the lowest crash frequency and crash rate. The crash prediction model shows that for one-lane exit ramp, replacing a Type 1 with a Type 2 will increase crash counts at freeway diverge areas by 15. 57 % while replacing a Type 3 with a Type 4 will increase crash counts by 10. 80 % for two-lane ramps. On the exit ramp sections, the <b>out</b> <b>connection</b> ramps appear to have the lowest average crash rate than the other three. The crash predictive model shows that replacing an <b>out</b> <b>connection</b> exit ramp with a diamond, free-flow, and parclo loop will increase crashes counts by 26. 90 %, 68. 47 % and 48. 72 % respectively.

40|$|In South Africa, {{paediatric}} nursing practice {{has traditionally been}} seen as a speciality. Yet in 1998, while a staggering 45 % of the population were younger than 18 years, still only 2. 4 % of all registered nurses held a Paediatric qualification 1 and the reality {{of the size of the}} population of children, continued to impact Health Service provision. The challenge of facilitating undergraduate students learning a traditionally post-basic nursing discipline led to this study in the Department of Nursing at the University of Cape Town. Here the philosophical approach is health based; whole-person orientated and family centred and the programme includes a distinct children's nursing component. The purpose of the study was to discover how student nurses learn to nurse children. Participants came from four consecutive student groups in their third year of undergraduate study. The use of grounded theory methodology allowed a rich understanding of the process to emerge. Data included participant observation and student descriptions, both private in reflective journals and narratives and corporate, in focus groups. In the wealth and variation of experience and learning, analysis of data confirmed the complex relational nature of students' learning. The relationships students establish with the children they encounter in the course of their learning emerged as central to their learning. Findings indicate that puzzling <b>out</b> <b>connection</b> is the students' basic social process in learning to nurse children. Students' experiences of childhood and parenting influence their expectations, interactions and application of learning. The various conditions that affect how students choose to engage children have been extensively explored and described. Students in this study engage children in four distinctive modes; which have been described as playful 1 connecting, dutiful safeguarding, in relay with the child's mother and distant doing. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of how students learn to nurse, especially in the life stage of late adolescence. This is essential for structuring the learning environment and experiences of students learning to care for children...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to evaluate the safety performance of different freeway exit types used in current practical designs. More specific, the research objectives include the following two parts: 1) to compare the safety performance of different design types at freeway diverge areas and exit ramp sections; and 2) to identify the impact factors contributing to the crashes happening at these two specific segments. The study area includes four subjects, the freeway widely-spaced diverge areas; the freeway closely-spaced diverge areas; the left-side off-ramps and the exit ramp sections. For the freeway diverge areas, design types were defined {{based on the number of}} lanes used by vehicular traffic to exit freeways and lane-balance theory. Four exit ramp types were considered for the widely-spaced diverge area, including single-lane exit ramps (Type 1), sing-lane exit ramps without a taper (Type 2), two-lane exit ramps with an optional lane (Type 3), and two-lane exit ramps without an optional lane (Type 4). For the closely-spaced diverge areas, three types, named as Type A, Type B and Type C, are selected to compare the safety performances among the three types. For the left-side off-ramp at the freeway diverge area, this study examined the two most widely used design types at the left-side freeway diverge areas in Florida, which are defined as Type I (one-lane left-side off-ramp), and Type II (two-lane left-side off-ramp). Type I is comparable to Type 1 design type and Type II is comparable to Type 3 design type at widely-spaced freeway diverge area. For the exit ramp sections, four ramp configurations, including diamond, <b>out</b> <b>connection,</b> free-flow loop and parclo loop, were considered. Cross-sectional comparisons were conducted to compare the crash frequency, the crash rate, the crash severity and target crash types between different design groups.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} stability analysis and optimal controls for stochastic dynamic systems. It encompasses two parts. One {{part of our}} work gives an in-depth study of stability of linear jump diffusion, linear Markovian jump diffusion, multi-dimensional jump diffusion and regime-switching jump diffusion together with the associated numerical solutions. The other part of our work is controls for stochastic dynamic systems, to be specific, we concentrated on mean variance types of control under different formulations. We obtained the nearly optimal mean-variance controls under both two-time-scale and hidden Markov chain formulations and convergence for each case is achieved. In Chapter 2, stability analysis of benchmark linear scalar jump diffusion is studied first. We presented the conditions for exponential p stable and almost surely exponentially stable for SDE and that of numerical solutions. Note that due {{to the use of}} Poisson processes, using asymptotic expansions as in the usual approach of treating diffusion processes does not work any longer. Different from the existing treatments of Euler-Maurayama methods for solutions of stochastic differential equations, techniques from stochastic approximation is employed in our work. The similar analysis is carried out for Markov jump diffusion and multi-dimensional jump diffusion. Beside of these, we have a thorough study on regime switching jump diffusion in which asymptotic stability in the large and exponential p-stability are carried <b>out.</b> <b>Connection</b> between almost surely exponential stability and exponential p-stability is exploited. Necessary conditions for exponential p-stability are derived and criteria for asymptotic stability in distribution are provided. In Chapter 3 We work on the famous mean variance problem in which a switching process (say, market regime) is embedded. We first use a two-time-scale formulation to treat the underlying systems, which is represented by usage of a small parameter. As the small parameter goes to 0, we obtain a limit problem. Using the limit problem as a guide, we construct controls for the original problem, and show that the control so constructed is nearly optimal. In chapter 4, we revisited the mean variance control problem in which the switching process is a hidden Markov chain. Instead of having full knowledge of switching process, we assume a noisy observation of switching process corrupted by white noise is available, we focus on minimizing the variance subject to a mixed terminal expectation. Using the Wonham filter, we convert the partially observable system to a completely observable one first. Because closed form solutions are virtually impossible to obtain, our main effort is devoted to designing a numerical algorithm. Convergence of the algorithm is obtained...|$|E
