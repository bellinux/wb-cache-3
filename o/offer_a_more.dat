WCU and the EBCI have initiated a ten-year language revitalization plan consisting of: (1) a continuation of the improvement and expansion of the EBCI Atse Kituwah Cherokee Language Immersion School, (2) continued development of Cherokee language learning resources, and (3) building of Western Carolina University programs to <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> comprehensive language training curriculum.|$|E
25|$|Only Universitäten {{have the}} right to confer doctorates and habilitations. Some {{universities}} use the term research university in international usage to emphasize their strength in research activity in addition to teaching, particularly to differentiate themselves from Fachhochschulen. A university covering the full range of scientific disciplines in contrast to more specialized universities might refer to itself as Volluniversität. Specialized universities which have the formal status of Universität include Technische Universitäten, Pädagogische Hochschulen (Universities of Education), Kunsthochschulen (Universities of Arts) and Musikhochschulen (Universities of Music). The excellence initiative has awarded eleven universities with the title University of Excellence. Professors at regular universities were traditionally required to have a doctorate as well as a habilitation. Since 2002, the junior professorship was introduced to <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> direct path to employment as a professor for outstanding doctoral degree.|$|E
25|$|While {{this had}} no {{immediate}} {{effect on the}} hoteliers, other trends of the era began producing a decline in guests at the Escarpment hotels. Expansions of the railroad network meant that the wealthy guests who had previously been content {{to go to the}} Mountain House or Kaaterskill instead went to their own great camps in the Adirondacks, or to other mountainous or coastal regions. Competing hotels in areas further inland now recognized as being in the Catskills claimed to <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> genuine mountain experience, and purer air, to their guests. The guests who did come tended to stay for shorter periods, mainly hot weekends in the summer. Beach and the Mountain House made a long-planned joint venture to build an incline railway up the Escarpment to the hotel a reality in 1892, but it cut into their profits.|$|E

25|$|Pen-and-paper {{role-playing}} games typically {{involve a}} player called the gamemaster (or GM for short) who can dynamically create the story, setting, and rules, and {{react to a}} player's choices. In role-playing video games, the computer performs {{the function of the}} gamemaster. This offers the player a smaller set of possible actions, since computers can't engage in imaginative acting comparable to a skilled human gamemaster. In exchange, the typical role-playing video game may have storyline branches, user interfaces, and stylized cutscenes and gameplay to <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> direct storytelling mechanism. Characterization of non-player characters in video games is often handled using a dialog tree. Saying the right things to the right non-player characters will elicit useful information for the player, and may even result in other rewards such as items or experience, as well as opening up possible storyline branches. Multiplayer online role-playing games can offer an exception to this contrast by allowing human interaction among multiple players and in some cases enabling a player to perform the role of a gamemaster.|$|E
25|$|General Electric (GE) stated {{it would}} not offer the GP7000 engine on the aircraft, and that {{previous}} contracts for the GEnx on the original A350 {{did not apply to}} the XWB. Engine Alliance partner Pratt & Whitney seemed to be at odds with GE on this, having publicly stating that it was looking at an advanced derivative of the GP7000. In April 2007, Airbus former chief executive Louis Gallois held direct talks with GE management over developing a GEnx variant for the A350 XWB. In June 2007, Airbus's chief operating officer John Leahy indicated that the A350 XWB would not feature the GEnx engine, saying that Airbus wanted GE to <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> efficient version for the airliner. Since then, the largest GE engines operators, which include Emirates, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and ILFC have selected the Trent XWB for their A350 orders. In May 2009, GE said that if it were to reach a deal with Airbus to offer the current 787-optimised GEnx for the A350, it would only power the -800 and -900 variants. GE believed it can offer a product that outperforms the Trent 1000 and Trent XWB, but was reluctant to support an aircraft competing directly with its GE90-115B-powered 777 variants.|$|E

500|$|Comics and {{cartoons}} are literary genres {{that use}} drawings or graphics, usually {{in combination with}} text, to convey an entertaining narrative. Many contemporary comics have elements of fantasy and are produced by companies {{that are part of}} the entertainment industry. Others have unique authors who <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about superheroes such as Superman are of the first type. Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years [...] of Charles M. Schulz who produced a popular comic called Peanuts about the relationships among a cast of child characters; and Michael Leunig who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate social criticism. The Japanese Manga style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. Caricature uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.|$|E
500|$|Its {{name and}} {{platform}} change were officially announced at E3 2013, with further trailers showcasing the game concept released later. The 2013 trailer was again a concept piece consisting mostly of CGI rather than actual gameplay footage. Staff later stated that XV had been announced and displayed too early. The game's next official appearance {{was made at}} TGS 2014, with the announcement of its commercial demo, and a tech demo showing off the game's engine. After its reappearance, regular livestreamed shows called [...] "Active Time Reports" [...] (ATR) were broadcast, giving updates to the game and responses to fan questions. According to Tabata, the ATRs were created to help fans left confused by the game's change of platform and title, along with establishing a two-way communication with the fanbase. During 2015, official forums were created to allow the developers to receive direct feedback from fans. Starting from February 12, the Japanese forums were discontinued and replaced with a developer's blog. Their stated reason was to <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> accessible medium for both feedback and developer updates.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V.

[...] He also bemoaned the fact that only [...] "Everything Stays" [...] features flashbacks, arguing that [...] "rushing through those past events is a missed opportunity to <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> comprehensive look at where Marceline comes from and how those circumstances have shaped her". With that being said, Sava was highly complimentary towards the voice acting, with praise being directed towards Olson and the actors who voice the villains; Sava wrote, [...] "The new characters' personalities are quickly solidified by the guest stars' expressive performances." [...] Eric Thurm of Pitchfork Media opined that Stakes [...] "includes all sorts of cool action sequences and, best of all, it focuses on the backstory of the show's most musical character: Marceline [...] But Stakes, as fun as it is, ultimately fails to fully deliver, mostly because of a lack of, um, stakes." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} stages of development, the designers' {{priority}} was purely on streamlining and polishing the shooting aspects; RPG elements were not added until {{this process was}} complete. According to lead designer Christina Norman, [...] "we wanted more satisfying combat and {{a big part of}} that is making weapons more accurate and powerful at level one—basically saying 'let's take the RPG out of the shooter.'" [...] Since BioWare had no experience with shooter games, the team spent roughly three months tuning how combat would work using the original Mass Effect as a basis. The camera was improved to <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> precise aiming that included body-specific targeting like headshots. Norman explained that they wanted the weapons to have their own identity, noting that the final build of the game has 19 weapons with 108 tuning variables. The inclusion of limited ammunition was not initially part of the main game design and was simply implemented for some early playtesting. However, the developers ultimately felt it improved the tension and pacing of combat. The pacing of the story was also improved, especially in the opening, as developers wanted to get players into the action faster.|$|E

[...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can be here today and gone tomorrow.
