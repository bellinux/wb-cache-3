The catholicon was on the eastern side, the refectory and the kitchen, on the western side and the bathhouse, which was transformed into the monastery's olive <b>oil</b> <b>extractor</b> during the Turkish rule, and, finally, the monks' cells in front of which there was an open arcade.|$|E
40|$|The {{frequent}} marine {{oil spill}} accidents in nowadays has aroused great attention {{all over the}} world. Lots of superwetting absorption materials with 2 D or 3 D structures are fabricated to efficiently remove oil spill, but the desorption of the absorbed oil is more difficult. Oil contaminants adhere on the surface will decline the performance and reusability of the absorption materials. Discarding or burning them will bring secondary pollution. Faced with these problems, we prepared an <b>oil</b> <b>extractor</b> integrated by a superhydrophobic-superoleophilic stainless steels wire mesh and a 3 D porous cellulose sponge with superhydrophilicity-superoleophilicity in air and superoleophobicity in water. The <b>oil</b> <b>extractor</b> can in situ collect oil spill no matter on the water or under the water. More importantly, it is good at underwater oil desorption, which ensure the recovery and reuse of oil, and meanwhile avoid the materials being fouled by oils. More than 85. 5 % of crude oil could be successfully discharged only in 2 min when the oil- contaminated sponge was placed in water. The findings in this work not only put forward a new strategy for collection and reuse of various "oils", but also offer a facile method to achieve a combination of two kinds of materials with diverse wettability.

40|$|Crude oil {{is a major}} natural {{resource}} and the mainstay of any country that have it in abundance; its sole disadvantage is its tendency of spilling to the environment. Kenaf {{has been found to}} be a good absorbent for physical clean-up and treatment of oil spillage both on land and water surfaces. Kenaf absorbs the oil thus making it soaked and the absorbed oil can however be recovered using appropriate technology. The aim of the research work is to design and construct an <b>oil</b> <b>extractor</b> to remove and recover the absorbed oil from kenaf bast and core. The functional parts of the machine are: barrel (80 mm diameter and 1000 mm length), worm shaft (minimum diameter 50 mm and maximum diameter 65 mm), gear reduction box (20 : 1), prime mover (7 hp, 1420 rpm), oil and cake outlet, hopper, conical restrictor, pulley and transmission belts. The worm shaft was tapered to build up pressure as it travels across the length of the barrel and it conveys, grinds, presses and squeezes oil out of kenaf into the oil outlet via the oil collection tray. The residual cake from where the oil was extracted is extruded out of the cake outlet in form of briquettes. The <b>oil</b> <b>extractor</b> machine was evaluated in compliance with Philippines Agricultural Engineering Standard PAES 230 and 231 : 2005 and the results showed a percent kenaf recovery of 60 %, extraction efficiency of 62. 2 %, throughput capacity of 36. 5 kg/hr and an extraction loss of 37. 8 %. The extraction efficiency varies with the moisture content of the soaked kenaf bast and core. The operation of the machine does not require any technical-know-how and the machine can be easily maintained as it has the tendency of self-lubricating the extraction chamber due to presence of oil in the input materials...|$|E

40|$|Citrus {{cold pressed}} oils are of great {{importance}} to the flavour and fragrance industry. Because of their high added value, careful attention must be paid to ensure the oils’ genuineness and authenticity. Characterising their chemical complexity in a holistic perspective constitutes a potent way to relate specific compounds to the organoleptic properties of interest and to assess their quality. In this context, a complete characterisation using untargeted metabolomics represents an analytical challenge. The present study takes advantage of multiblock data modelling to integrate heterogeneous signals collected from GC-FID, 1 H-NMR, UHPLC-TOF/MS- (negative mode) and UHPLC-TOF/MS+ (positive mode) platforms to obtain a complete characterisation of 64 samples of cold pressed lemon oil (CPLO). Two statistical approaches (MB-PLS-DA and Consensus OPLS-DA) were used to classify the samples according to their extraction processes [i. e. Sfumatrice, Food Machinery Corporation Inline Extractor (FMC), Brown <b>Oil</b> <b>Extractor</b> (BOE), Pelatrice, or mixed FMC + Pelatrice]. Furthermore, the multiblock strategy allows links between variables from different analytical methods to be drawn easily and facilitates the identification of compounds. Because citrus oils extracted using the Sfumatrice process constitute the reference quality from an organoleptic point of view, these samples were characterised thoroughly and are reported to contain less fatty acids but more sesquiterpenes and furocoumarins compared with products obtained using other extraction processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{foundations}} of the modern fragrance industry {{can be traced to}} fragrance producers established in the south of France during the sixteenth century. Through the nineteenth century, French flower farms, essential <b>oil</b> <b>extractors,</b> and manufacturers of branded fragrances, were family enterprises, and it was relatively easy for these businesses to maintain proprietary information about distillation techniques, the composition of branded perfumes, etc. The inexorable consolidation in the fragrance manufacturing industry over the past century has resulted in an industry now dominated by a handful of large fragrance multinationals that are increasingly vulnerable to misappropriation of their intellectual property, and particularly of their fragrance formulas developed at significant expense. The itinerancy of perfumers today has engendered unease among these fragrance houses as to the security of their most valuable assets: formulas and other trade secrets that can now be readily obtained, copied, and shared by employees with access to relevant information stored on the company’s servers. Even more disconcerting today to the fragrance industry is the potential of analytic technologies to reveal the chemical composition of fragrances. Unlike digital technologies that have similarly discombobulated the media industry because they enable surreptitious copyright infringement, chemical analytic technologies do not enable the illegal acquisition or distribution of intellectual property. In fact it is generally lawful not only to use these technologies to obtain the fragrance formulas of competitors, but also to use the acquired information to develop competing products. Concurrent with the erosion of the fragrance industry’s trade secrets has been the increasingly widespread deployment of fragrances as a component of multi-sensory trade dress used to brand a wide range of commercial spaces including retail stores, cinemas, hotels, etc. This article proposes that while trade secrets underlying the creation of fragrances have lost much of their efficacy, trademark and unfair competition law may offer a hitherto mostly unrealized legal protection of the deployment of fragrances as trade dress. After considering the limited efficacy of copyright and patent protection for fragrances the article canvasses the growing use of fragrance as a component of trade dress, and the potential legal protection, and financial implications, of trademark and unfair competition law...|$|R

In the last decades, {{a lot of work}} have been carried out on the wax deposition mechanism (Hamouda and Viken 1993; Hoffmann and Amundsen 2010; Xiao et al. 2012). The wax deposition is mainly caused by the decrease of temperature and pressure, which is affected by the oil composition, moisture content, physical and chemical characters, fluid producing intensity, and other production operation conditions (Azevedo and Teixeira 2003; Weingarten and Euchner 1988; Banki et al. 2008; Kelechukwu et al. 2013).The wax deposition of tubing and sucker rod is shown in Fig.  1.

Soxhlet <b>extractor</b> is used to extract the rubber seed oil from the rubber seed. Then,the hexane is removed by using rotary evaporator to get pure rubber seed oil. The catalytic cracking with presence zeolites as the catalyst is applied to crack the fatty acid complex into smaller hydrocarbon molecules. Five grams of zeolites catalyst is added into the crucible that contain 25 ml rubber seed oil. The mixture is heated in the furnace at 300 °C for 15 minutes. After that,the different temperature is used which is 350 °C and 400 °C in order to see the effect of temperature on the isooctane production. By using the gas chromatography,the presence of isooctane in the sample can be detected which is indicate that biopetrol is produced. Based on this research,the highest amount of isooctane is produced which is 75. 3234 % at temperature of 350 ºC. The presence of temperature and catalyst that used will give the sudden effect to production of isooctane from the rubber seed oil.
