5|$|On 13 April 2007, the Marine Corps {{announced}} the first V-22 combat deployment at Al Asad Airbase, Iraq. On 17 September 2007, 10 MV-22Bs of VMM-263 left for Iraq aboard USS Wasp.

5000|$|On 16 January 2017, the DUP {{launched}} a petition <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> in the Assembly {{to protect the}} Speaker from Sinn Féin's {{motion of no confidence}}. 30 MLAs are required to sign a petition <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> and, when a petition <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> is deployed, any votes taken are subject to a cross-community vote. As the DUP hold the majority of unionist seats, they effectively blocked the motion from passing. In protest at the DUP's use of the petition <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> Sinn Féin retracted their motion of no confidence as it {{would not be able to}} pass. Sinn Féin called the use of the petition <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> as [...] "insulting". Sinn Féin MLA Conor Murphy said that the DUP [...] "invoked the Petition <b>of</b> <b>Concern</b> to protect the Speaker" [...] and said that [...] "the DUP are corrupting the institutions in their own interests and against the wishes of the general public".|$|R

5|$|Allen became Jamaica's sixth {{appointed}} governor-general (eighth overall, {{including two}} acting governors-general). He replaced Sir Kenneth O. Hall, who resigned for health reasons.

5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators {{that live in the}} forest and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species are present in the forest, with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Amador Valley High School, {{originally}} Amador Valley Joint Union High School, {{was named}} for its location in the Amador Valley (part of the Tri-Valley area of the San Francisco East Bay).

The school was founded on March 14, 1922, {{as part of the}} Amador Valley Joint Union High School District (AVJUHSD), out <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> of overcrowding and transportation for students traveling to nearby Livermore High School. Amador Valley's first class graduated in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> of {{long-term}} adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years {{are not supposed to}} exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day. The EFSA set UL at 2,500 mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine ULs.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> about adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, except that the bamboo lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain {{increased}} support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War—the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768. Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.|$|E
