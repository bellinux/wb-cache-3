The precursors of the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in oil shale and coal differ {{in a sense}} that oil shale is of algal origin, but may also include remains of vascular land plants that more commonly compose much of the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in coal. The origin of some of the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in oil shale is obscure {{because of the lack of}} recognizable biologic structures that would help identify the precursor organisms.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the research were to know the influences of crop <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> to diversity of soil mesofauna and macrofauna under paraserianthes’ stand (Paraserianthes falcataria), rate of <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> decomposition, {{as well as the}} relationship between the rate of <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> decomposition and diversity of soil mesofauna and macrofauna. The framework of thinking of this research was the crop <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> which were given to the soil would influence the soil mesofauna and macrofauna diversities. The presence of soil fauna would help the decomposition process of <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> which fertilize the soil. This research was established under paraseanthes’ stand, with 7 treatments of crop <b>organic</b> <b>matters,</b> i. e. cardamom, pineapple, cocoyam, cardamom- pineapple, cardamom-cocoyam, pineapple-cocoyam, cardamom-pineapple- cocoyam, and the treatment without crop <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> (control). The sampling of mesofauna data used soil extraction “Barlesse-Tulgreen” method, meanwhile the macrofauna data were obtained from “Hand- Sorting” method and “Fill-Trapp” method. The sampling of decomposition rate data used Pudjiharta’s method (1995). The data which have been obtained were analyzed by using Analysis of Variance (ANAVA) and continued with DMRT test. The Correlation test was done to find out the relationship between the rate of decomposition of crop <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> and the soil mesofauna and macrofauna diversities. It can be concluded that the applying of crop <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> influenced the soil mesofauna and macrofauna diversities. The highest coefficient value index of soil mesofauna diversity was 1. 36 by using cardamom-cocoyam <b>organic</b> <b>matters.</b> The highest coefficient value index of the soil macrofauna diversity was 1. 11 by using pineapple <b>organic</b> <b>matters.</b> The highest coefficient value indexof macrofauna diversity {{on the surface of the}} soil was 1. 27 by using pineapple <b>organic</b> <b>matters.</b> The crop <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> of cardamom-cocoyam has the highest coefficient value decomposition rate, was 0. 45.

The experiments were arranged as split plot design with the main plot was pathogen inoculation and non pathogen inoculation. As sub-plot were the addition of <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> and or addition of bioagent Trichoderma sp. plus two control treatments. Pathogen S. rolfsii applied as fragment mycelia of 1 x 10 6 fragment/ mL {{with the number of}} 10 L/plot. Inoculation of the pathogen was conducted when seedlings were about one month old.
