5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women.

Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E

5|$|When {{juxtaposed}} together, Stelae 15 and 12 <b>offer</b> <b>up</b> {{two images}} of a {{what it means to}} be a genuine king. Stela 15 shows K'inich Yat Ahk II as a devout practitioner of religious rituals, doing his sacred duty. On the other hand, Stela 12 shows the ajaw as a victorious military chief, defeating enemies and taking captives. O'Neil argues that their presence on the upper terrace of the O-13 pyramid is similar to how the images of previous kings of Piedras Negras were serialized. In addition, both Stelae 15 and 12 include the names of several sculptors and artists, one of whom worked on both stelae. These names are difficult to translate because many are unique when compared to extant Mayan glyphic texts.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 {{during an}} {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, King declared that, while Hanneman still had not {{been involved with the}} album, the band was waiting for label issues to be resolved before recording. King stated that he and Lombardo had eight songs that they were working on, as well. When asked about whether or not Exodus guitarist Gary Holt, who had been filling in for Hanneman during live shows, would play on the record, King denied it, saying that he would handle all guitars except for Hanneman's lead parts. King also said that Hanneman had yet to <b>offer</b> <b>up</b> any material for the album. Araya later contradicted King's statement about Hanneman and stated that Hanneman had been working on material for the album. Shortly after Hanneman's death, Araya revealed that Hanneman had {{gone so far as to}} send Araya music that he had been working on, and Araya later said that some of this material—including an outtake from World Painted Blood—may make it onto the album.|$|E
5|$|James {{asserted}} {{his authority}} not only over the nobility but also upon the Church and lamented that King David I's benevolence towards the Church proved costly to his successors {{and that he}} was 'a sair sanct to the croun'. James also considered that the monastic institutions in particular needed improvement and that they should return to being strictly ordered communities. Part of James's solution was to create an assembly of overseeing abbots and followed this up by establishing a Carthusian priory at Perth to provide other religious houses with an example of internal conduct. He also sought to influence Church attitudes to his policies by having his own clerics appointed to the bishoprics of Dunblane, Dunkeld, Glasgow and Moray. In March 1425, James's parliament directed that all bishops must instruct their clerics to <b>offer</b> <b>up</b> prayers for the king and his family; a year later, parliament toughened up this edict insisting that the prayers be given at every mass under sanction of a fine and severe rebuke. This same parliament legislated that every person in Scotland should 'be governed under the king's laws and statutes of this realm only'. From this, laws were enacted in 1426 to restrict the actions of prelates whether it was to regulate their need to travel to the Roman Curia or their ability to purchase additional ecclesiastical positions while there. In James's parliament of July 1427, it is evident that statute being enacted had the purpose of reducing the powers of the church jurisdiction.|$|E
