5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> on Venus, and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> and thunder. The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> on Venus. One {{possibility is that}} ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped {{by a factor of}} 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E

The feasibility <b>of</b> using total <b>lightning</b> flash data, both intracloud (IC) and cloud-to-ground (CG), collected from the OTD satellite in conjunction with CG lightning flashes detected by the NLDN was demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract: Lightning rod {{is widely}} used in {{lightning}} protection systems. It is of practical interest to analyze the protective performance <b>of</b> a <b>lightning</b> rod taking into consideration some stochastic behaviors <b>of</b> the <b>lightning</b> process. The effec-tiveness <b>of</b> a single <b>lightning</b> rod is investigated in this paper using a fractal growth approach based on dielectric breakdwon model (DBM). The effective interception area, the strike distribution on rod and the protection zone <b>of</b> single <b>lightning</b> rods <b>of</b> various heights are calculated. Comparing our results {{with those of the}} rolling sphere method, it is shown that, the fractal approach is able to make reasonable evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>lightning</b> protective performance. New features such as the inherent vulnerability of the rod to lateral strikes and the division of the protection zone into three regions are also presented...|$|R

5|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>Lightning</b> Returns {{originated}} during {{development of}} XIII-2, while the development team was brainstorming ideas for possible continuations {{of the story}} and universe of the games, though there was no solid decision to make a second sequel to XIII at the time. Development <b>of</b> <b>Lightning</b> Returns started in May 2012, soon after the release of Requiem of the Goddess, the final story-based DLC episode for XIII-2. According to Motomu Toriyama, he had wanted to tell more stories about Lightning, and the DLC had not provided a satisfactory ending for her. The game was designed in a shorter time than the other games in the series; Yoshinori Kitase explained that this was because the team did not want players to forget the story of the previous games, and the team needed to work especially hard as a result. Another reason was that the team wished to bring the XIII series to a close before the release of the next generation of gaming hardware. The title was also chosen to be the last original Final Fantasy game on seventh generation consoles, and next-gen versions of the game were not considered. Developer tri-Ace, who had previously worked with the team on XIII-2, returned to help with the graphics.|$|E

5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized by the presence <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{electrostatic}} discharge <b>of</b> terrestrial <b>lightning</b> superheats {{the air to}} plasma temperatures {{along the length of}} the discharge channel in a short duration, kinetic theory dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a shock wave audible as thunder. Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length <b>of</b> the <b>lightning's</b> path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry <b>of</b> the <b>lightning</b> channel, by acoustic echoing from terrain, and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>lightning</b> strike.|$|R
