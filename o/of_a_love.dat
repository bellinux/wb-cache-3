5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally {{going to be part}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau knew he would return to Lost at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E
5|$|Joe Dante was {{the next}} choice, {{increasing}} the budget for his idea of Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, {{making it to the}} final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E
5|$|The Broadway {{production}} {{also received}} positive reviews. When it {{opened at the}} Madison Square Theatre, a New York Times reviewer complimented Mansfield for his acting and for overcoming the difficulty of presenting the story's allegorical material onstage. According to a New-York Daily Tribune reviewer, Mansfield gave excellent performances as Jekyll and Hyde despite a few technical production flaws. A Life review praised Sullivan's adaptation, particularly his addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> interest for Jekyll, and complimented the performances of Mansfield, Cameron and Harkins.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{portrayed as}} an {{imaginary}} {{character in a}} schizophrenia storyline, Rae was later revealed to be real when she arrived to study in Hollyoaks. She was central to a controversial suicide storyline, and was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> triangle with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), which left her pregnant by Ste. She miscarried during an argument with Brendan and subsequently feuded with him; Barlow praised her character for {{being one of the}} few who dared to oppose the Hollyoaks villain. Rae was originally characterised as a chav with a feisty persona, but underwent a transformation when she attempted to embrace domestic life with Ste. During series four of the post-watershed spin-off Hollyoaks Later, Rae was murdered by a serial killer, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). The late broadcast slot allowed an explicit depiction of her death. Barlow hoped that Rae would be remembered for her strong-willed nature, and that her exit would be considered one of the best in the programme's history.|$|E
5|$|Sakura's most {{well-known}} physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Consequently, {{because of this}} Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque feeling to it, {{so as to make}} her more feminine. During Part II's last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto thought a popular fictional character, Hinata Hyuga, take a more active role and become a heroine. Despite initially deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end together, Kishimoto thought it would be interesting if Sakura formed part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> triangle. Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what his series he wanted to focus on. In the middle of the manga's final arc Sakura is given a love letter. The real reasons for this is that Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.|$|E

Townsend grew up in Griffin, Georgia, graduating from Griffin High School in 1978. Townsend graduated from North Georgia College in 1982 with a bachelor's degree in psychology. He was commissioned into the Infantry from the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Borovansky's second ballet was Terra Australis, {{which is}} the first all-Australian ballet. It premiered in Melbourne on 25 May 1946, {{performed}} by his company. The ballet's libretto was by Tom Rothfield while the score was commissioned from Esther Rofe. The ballet focused on the subject of Australia's colonisation by white settlers. This was represented in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> triangle where the virginal Spirit of Australia was courted by a white explorer and an Aboriginal lover. The original cast featured Peggy Sager as the Spirit of Australia, Martin Rubinstein as the Explorer and Vassilie Trunoff as the Aborigine. The ballet was restaged in 1947 with Kathleen Gorham as the new lead.|$|E
25|$|In {{her first}} {{collection}}, Standing Female Nude (1985), {{she uses the}} voices of outsiders, for example in the poems 'Education for Leisure' and 'Dear Norman'. Her next collection Feminine Gospels (2002) continues this vein, showing an increased interest in long narrative poems, accessible in style and often surreal in their imagery. Her 2005 publication, Rapture (2005), {{is a series of}} intimate poems charting the course <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> affair, for which she won the £10,000 T.S. Eliot Prize. In 2007, she published The Hat, a collection of poems for children.

25|$|The {{style in}} which Bouguereau chooses {{to paint the}} {{children}} is articulated and meaningful. Their white flesh is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love {{through the use of}} pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> story. By not using pink and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness of their skin. The painting doesn’t strike the viewer but is a rest for the eyes.|$|E
25|$|Thor {{remains in}} Asgard {{to deal with}} the vacuum left by Odin's {{apparent}} death, and drives off Hela; meets Tiwaz, his great-grandfather; forces Loki to cure him from the effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> potion; with allies enters Hela's realm and rescues lost mortal souls. Returning to Earth, Thor and Beta Ray Bill defeat the transformed Dark Elf Kurse, although Loki uses the power of Surtur's discarded sword to change Thor into a frog. After an adventure in Central Park, Thor manages to partially restore himself and then forces Loki to reverse the spell. While rescuing X-Factor member the Angel from torture by the mercenary team the Marauders, Thor is cursed by Hela, who makes his bones as brittle as glass and unable to heal if damaged; and renders him truly immortal and unable to die no matter how severe his injuries. Thor is injured again during a battle with the Absorbing Man engineered by Loki, and is ultimately saved by Loki during a battle with the Dark Elves.|$|E
25|$|An {{emotional}} {{woman who}} is at the center <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>love</b> triangle between Boone and Chalmers, she begins as head of the Russian contingent. The novels hint that she used both wit and seduction to rise through the ranks of the Russian space agency to become the leader of the first colonization mission. After the first revolution, she flees {{with other members of the}} First Hundred to the hidden colony in the pole. She becomes a school teacher of the children of the hidden colonists but later becomes a powerful political force. After the deaths of Chalmers and Boone, she falls in love with Michel Duval. She suffers heavily from bipolar disorder and from memory-related psychological disorders with growing age, which often lead her to isolate herself from others and sometimes turn violent. Throughout the novels, Maya takes an active political role, helping to keep the surviving First Hundred together during the failed revolution of 2061 and guiding the successful revolutions that occur decades later, despite her psychological problems.|$|E
