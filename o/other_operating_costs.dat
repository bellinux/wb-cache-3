40|$|Whether {{the poor}} {{pay more for}} food than other income groups is an {{important}} question in food price policy research. Stores serving low-income shoppers differ in important ways from stores that receive less of their revenues from Food Stamp redemptions. Stores with more revenues from Food Stamps are generally smaller and older, and offer relatively fewer convenience services for shoppers. They also offer a different mix of products, with a relatively high portion of sales coming from meat and private-label products. Metro stores with high Food Stamp redemption rates lag behind other stores in the adoption of progressive supply chain and human resource practices. Finally, stores with the highest Food Stamp redemption rates have lower sales margins relative to other stores, but have significantly lower payroll costs {{as a percentage of}} sales. Overall, <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> for stores with high Food Stamp redemption rates are not significantly different from those for stores with moderate Food Stamp redemption rates.

This article reports an efficiency analysis of health care in state correctional institutions (SCIs) in a single, mid-Atlantic state from 2003 to 2006. A two-stage data envelopment analysis was used to estimate the techni-cal efficiency of prison health care and determine inmate and institutional characteristics that were associated with efficiency. Our output variable was the number of infirmary inpatient days for each year of study. The input variable for the first stage was the sum of personnel medical staff <b>costs</b> and <b>other</b> medical <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> SCIs with more white prisoners, older prisoners, and higher proportions of inmates with parole violations were significantly less efficient in their provision of health care than other SCIs.

40|$|A multi-period {{nonlinear}} programming (NLP) formulation {{is presented in}} this paper. This is intended to optimize energy and materials simultaneously for diesel hydrotreating units {{in order to minimize}} the total costs which include product income, material cost, energy <b>cost,</b> and <b>other</b> fixed <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> The heat exchanger network (HEN) is integrated into the model to address the energy consumption changes with the stream flow and temperature of different production modes. Some process models are regressed from production data or are supplied by refinery engineers, similar to the models for steam turbines and compressors, and distillation towers. An iterative algorithm is developed to solve the complex mathematical model based on HEN simulation. An industrial diesel hydrotreating unit is provided by the Chinese Refinery Complex and is used to demonstrate the performance of the formulated model and algorithm. It is found that the optimized results from the simultaneous consideration of the energy and materials are more profitable than those obtained from other methods that individually optimized the energy or materials.

40|$|The {{operational}} {{stability of}} a complex process such as the blast furnace is under constant threat owing to variation {{in the quality of}} raw materials as well as <b>other</b> <b>operating</b> conditions. Significant <b>cost</b> reductions can be achieved with adequate control of this process. Hence, mathematical models have proven to be useful in the thermal control of blast furnaces with regards to the fuel consumption and operational stability of these reactors. The thermo-chemical model calculates the hourly carbon consumption, which allows the operator to adjust for the aiming quantity of carbon. A strong correlation is observed between the results of the model and the actual results from the process. Thus, the model provides conditions for the operator to anticipate carbon behavior, and thus prevent large variation in the thermal properties of the blast furnace and provide high levels of operational safety...|$|R
40|$|Administrative and {{investment}} costs per participant appear to vary widely across pension funds. These costs {{are important because}} they reduce the {{rate of return on}} the investments of pension funds and consequently raise the cost of retirement security. This paper examines the impact of determinants of these costs, such as the size, governance, pension plan design and outsourcing decisions, using data on all Dutch pension funds across the 1992 - 2004 period, including more than 10, 000 observations. We find that economies of scale dominate the strong dispersion in both administrative {{and investment}} costs across pension funds. Industry-wide pension funds are significantly more efficient than company funds and <b>other</b> funds. The <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> of pension funds' defined contribution plans are lower than those of defined benefit plans.
