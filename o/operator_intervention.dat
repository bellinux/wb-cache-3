25|$|These techniques, {{although}} {{they take a}} long time, involve very little <b>operator</b> <b>intervention</b> and thus are very cheap. Small tumblers (one pound capacity) are available and inexpensive for home/hobbyist use. At {{the other end of}} the scale, professionals can use very large barrels to do a lot of work at once. The main disadvantage of tumbling is its limited scope - stones will be smooth and have semi-random shapes (like pebbles from the beach), and metals need to be relatively simple shapes, with no fine work.|$|E
25|$|During {{this same}} period, the US Army Air Force became {{interested}} in a very-high accuracy system for bombing pinpoint targets. Raytheon won a contract to develop a system called Cytac, which used the same basic techniques as LF LORAN, but included considerable automation to handle the timing internally without <b>operator</b> <b>intervention.</b> This proved to be extremely successful, with test-runs placing the aircraft within 10 yards of the target. As the mission changed from short-range tactical bombing to over-the-pole nuclear delivery, the (newly formed) US Air Force lost interest in the concept. Nevertheless, they continued experimentation with the equipment after adapting it to work on LF LORAN frequencies and renaming it Cyclan, lowering accuracy compared to the original, but providing reasonable accuracy {{on the order of}} a mile at greatly increased distances.|$|E
25|$|Hayes' {{solution}} to the problem was to use a small microcontroller to implement a system that examined the data flowing into the modem from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from the modem using the same data pins as {{all the rest of the}} data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem could pick up the phone, dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any <b>operator</b> <b>intervention.</b> The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.|$|E

This research constructs a detailed theory that explains how and why <b>operators</b> plan <b>interventions</b> under procedural constraints – particularly interventions that result in deviations from procedures. Consistent with this theme, three general conclusions result from the study: 1) procedures and potential procedure pathways are useful mechanisms for predicting and explaining the most common operator behaviors (i. e., those which are procedure-compliant); 2) non-compliant interventions can be predicted and explained through a situation assessment that considers the impact of system events and procedural directives on management goals; and 3) the complex system model provides a context for anticipating operator rationalization and argumentation in defense of chosen actions – a necessary constituent of behavior in program-constrained task environments. By exploring how and why actors sometimes work outside of imposed procedures, this study lays the groundwork for an improved computationally-based method of procedure execution [...] one that is capable of engaging in a collaborative problem-solving dialogue with a human decision maker. 1...|$|R

It is founded on Minkowski space–time diagrams showing cones representative of accessible and inaccessible past and future. This approach is generalised to establish widescale application to all human–machine systems.

Thus, the interactions in a multi-dimensional space are complex and one element of the system may have access to regions inaccessible to others.

40|$|BGP/MPLS IP VPN and VPLS {{services}} {{are considered to}} be widely used in IP/MPLS networks for connecting customers' remote sites. However, service providers struggle with many challenges to provide these services. Management complexity, equipment costs, and last but not least, scalability issues emerging as the customers increase in number, are just some of these problems. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that can solve aforementioned issues using a logically centralized controller for network devices. In this paper, we propose a SDN-based solution called SDxVPN which considerably lowers the complexity of VPN service definition and management. Our method eliminates complex and costly device interactions that used to be done through several control plane protocols and enables customers to determine their service specifications, define restriction policies and even interconnect with other customers automatically without <b>operator's</b> <b>intervention.</b> We describe our prototype implementation of SDxVPN and its scalability evaluations under several representative scenarios.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the architecture {{and behavior of}} a prototype intelligent decision support system for monitoring operations in complex process control environments. Development of the underlying model required {{an examination of the}} various influences on process outcomes, including not only the causal nature of physical processes themselves, but also the role of human interventions and the associated impact of operating procedures on human behavior. The empirical study of nuclear power plant operations used in this research indicates that procedures are an important, but not necessarily deterministic, influence on the intervening behavior of an operator. Operators will deviate from procedures when the requirements of a situation render a procedure inadequate or counterproductive. Goal- and plan-based knowledge structures were derived from physical processes, operating procedures, and human operators. These structures were incorporated into the model 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge base, which serves as the basis for interpretation and prediction of <b>operator</b> <b>interventions</b> in a series of emergency scenarios in simulated real-time. The eventual goal of this research is to enhance management oversight and control of complex, dynamic task environments by providing both management and operators with advice that is informed by an understanding of the constituent influences on process outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Ultrasonic {{measurements}} of human carotid and femoral artery walls are conventionally obtained by manually tracing interfaces between tissue layers. The drawbacks {{of this method}} are the interobserver variability and inefficiency. In this paper, we present a new automated method which reduces these problems. By applying a multiscale dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, approximate vessel wall positions are first estimated in a coarse-scale image, which then guide the detection of the boundaries in a fine-scale image. In both cases, DP is used for finding a global optimum for a cost function. The cost function is a weighted sum of terms, in fuzzy expression forms, representing image features and geometrical characteristics of the vessel interfaces. The weights are adjusted by a training procedure using human expert tracings. <b>Operator</b> <b>interventions,</b> if needed, also take effect under the framework of global optimality. This reduces the amount of human intervention and, hence, variability due to subjectiveness. By incorporating human knowledge and experience, the algorithm becomes more robust. A thorough evaluation of the method in the clinical environment shows that interobserver variability is evidently decreased {{and so is the}} overall analysis time. We conclude that the automated procedure can replace the manual procedure and leads to an improved performance. Index Terms—Artery, boundary detection, dynamic programming, imaging, ultrasonic.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of beyond design basis accidents (BDBA) {{is an essential}} component of the safety concept of nuclear power plants (NPP). Goal of the analysis is to achieve a set of actions aimed to prevent the escalation into a severe accident, to mitigate consequences of a severe accident, and to achieve a long term controllable state of the NPP. This paper presents an analytical procedure to optimize the timing of <b>operator</b> <b>interventions.</b> The procedure is demonstrated based on four sets of parameters, first, parameters which define the operator actions are chosen. Second, parameters which define the system availability are chosen. Third, parameters which define in a continuous way the status of the plant are chosen. Finally, one looks for a functional dependency of the accident management (AM) -parameters and the parameters describing the plant status. Once a function could be found, this function is “optimized” {{in the sense that the}} AM-parameters are varied to find a optimal overall condition for the plant. In the first part, the paper presents the analytical procedure in a general way, in the second part, an initiating event is chosen.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} {{the development of}} a transient monitoring system to detect the early stage of a transient, to identify the type of the transient scenario, and to inform an operator with the remaining time to turbine trip when there is no operator's relevant control. This study focused on the transients originating from a secondary system in nuclear power plants (NPPs), because the secondary system was recognized to be a more dominant factor to make unplanned turbine-generator trips which can ultimately result in reactor trips. In order to make the proposed methodology practical forward, all the transient scenarios registered in a simulator of a 1, 000 MWe pressurized water reactor were archived in the transient pattern database. The transient patterns show plant behavior until turbine-generator trip when there is no <b>operator's</b> <b>intervention.</b> Meanwhile, the operating data periodically captured from a plant computer is compared with an individual transient pattern in the database and a highly matched section among the transient patterns enables isolation of the type of transient and prediction of the expected remaining time to trip. The transient pattern database consists of hundreds of variables, so it is difficult to speedily compare patterns and to draw a conclusion in a timely manner. The transient pattern database and the operating data are, therefore, converted into a smaller dimension using the principal component analysis (PCA). This paper describes the process of constructing the transient pattern database, dealing with principal components, and optimizing similarity measures...|$|R
