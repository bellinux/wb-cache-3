5|$|Several major premodern Native American groups {{eventually}} {{gained control}} of lands along the river: the Yuhaviatam or Yuharetum people in the upper basin, the Payomkowishum in the southeastern basin, the Cahuilla in the desert areas of the watershed, and the Tongva people in the lower basin. The Yuhaviatam generally lived in the mountain headwaters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> Ana River and its tributaries rimming the present-day Inland Empire basin, in present-day San Bernardino County, {{as well as in}} the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Tongva lived on the flat coastal plains of present-day Orange County south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> Ana Mountains. They were also the larger of the two groups, controlling all the coastal lands from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Aliso Creek in the south, including all of the Los Angeles Basin.|$|E

5|$|Cairano's art {{and career}} began a rapid ascent {{following}} several other commissions for {{work within the}} sanctum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> Maria dei Miracoli. On November 16, 1941, he was paid for two keystones for the vault of the old Duomo which was being built {{under the aegis of}} Bernardino da Martinengo. Cairano was given the sole commission for figurative sculptures in the new building. Two years later, in 1493, Cairano began work at the courtyard of the Loggia palazzo.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942, Kongō was {{attacked}} by four Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, but she received no hits. In mid-November, this battleship and other warships provided distant cover for the unsuccessful mission by the I.J.N. to bombard Henderson Field again and to deliver more Army reinforcements to Guadalcanal. On 15 November 1942, following the Japanese defeat and the sinking of Hiei and Kirishima during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the Third Battleship Division returned to Truk, where it remained {{for the rest of}} 1942.|$|E
5|$|Early plans also {{included}} a northsouth freeway {{on each side of}} the Los Angeles Central Business District, splitting at the merge of the Harbor Parkway (Harbor Freeway) and Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway (Pasadena Freeway) and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. Initially known as the East By-Pass and West By-Pass, the latter later became part of the Harbor Parkway, while the former remained as a separate route roughly along Main Street. The state legislature added the East By-Pass to the state highway system in 1947 as Route 222. The Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved a revised master plan in mid-1955, based on various studied that had been made. A new Industrial Freeway replaced the Terminal Island Freeway and Alamitos Parkway between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles, where it then continued north along the former East By-Pass (which was not kept south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> Monica Freeway) and the southern part of the Riverside Parkway to the interchange of the Glendale Freeway and Golden State Freeway (which had replaced the rest of the Riverside Parkway). The Industrial Freeway south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> Monica Freeway became Route 270 in 1959, but the ex-Riverside Parkway piece north of the Arroyo Seco Parkway never became a state highway.|$|E

5|$|Since Herrick and {{his brother}} began selling {{manipulated}} taxidermy heads in the 1930s, such trophies, as well as jackalope postcards and related gift-shop items, {{can be found in}} many places beyond Douglas.

5|$|A similar, strong {{competition}} was established very probably between Gasparo Cairano and Antonio della Porta (Tamagnino), who debuted in Brescia (in documentary terms) along with Cairano with his cycle of twelve Angels {{for the first}} dome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> Maria dei Miracoli, between 24 December 1489 and May 3, 1490. It {{is not clear what}} brought this Milanese artist to Brescia. He belonged to a family of sculptors, and between 1484 and 1489 was known to have worked in Milan and Pavia for the Sforza, in close contact with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. His debut as a figurative sculptor at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, however, owed to the Sanmicheli, who typically specialized in the field of decorative sculpture and lacked outside of this field. Note that Gasparo Cairano himself also first appeared on the art scene as a figurative sculptor under the Sanmicheli: he created his sequence of twelve Apostles at the same project.|$|E
