The modified plan would have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E

25|$|A {{capital gain}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> (often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.|$|E

500|$|Individuals {{under the}} current system who {{accumulated}} savings from ordinary income (by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings (such as a Roth IRA or CD). When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved {{under the current}} system, that spending would be subject to the FairTax. People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed. Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some taxpayers who have accumulated significant savings from after-tax dollars, especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings. Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different, since compliance costs and [...] "hidden taxes" [...] embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be [...] "taxed" [...] a second time already when spent. The rebate would supplement accrued savings, covering taxes up to the poverty level. The income taxes <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> estates, social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax. In addition, the FairTax legislation adjusts Social Security benefits for changes in the price level, so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income. Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{policies}} {{proposed that}} economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were {{low enough to}} spur investment, which would then lead to higher employment and wages. Critics labeled this [...] "trickle-down economics"—the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a [...] "trickle-down" [...] effect to the poor. Questions arose whether Reagan's policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty, and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles. These views were exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Reagan's economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at $3.35 an hour, slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60%, cutting the budget for public housing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half, and eliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block Grant program. The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan's economic policies took effect. Along with Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income, he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20%. Reagan later set tax rates <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%. Reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times {{over the course of his}} presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility. According to Paul Krugman, [...] "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr.Clinton's 1993 tax increase." [...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} (i) whether value-growth characteristics {{have more}} power than past performance in predicting return reversals; and (ii) whether typical rational behaviour such as incentives to delay paying <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> taxes can better explain long-term reversals than past performance. We find that value-growth characteristics generally provide better explanations for long-term stock returns than past performance. The evidence also shows that winners identified by <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> dominate past performance winners in predicting reversals in the cross-sectional comparison. However, in the time-series analysis, when returns <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> winners are adjusted by the Fama and French (1996) risk factors, the predictive power of <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> winners disappears. Our results show that <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> winners are heavily featured as growth stocks. Return reversals in <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> winners potentially reflect market price corrections for growth stocks. We conclude that investors' incentives to delay paying <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> taxes cannot fully rationalise long-term reversals in the UK market. Our results also imply that the long-term return pattern potentially reflects a mixture of investor rational and irrational behaviour. Long-term reversals Overreaction Taxes UK stock market...|$|R

2500|$|The primary {{effect of}} the tax changes {{over the course of}} Reagan's term in office was a change in the {{composition}} of federal receipts, towards more payroll taxes and new investment taxes, and away from higher earners and capital gains on existing investments. Federal revenue share of GDP fell from 19.6% in fiscal 1981 to 17.3% in 1984, before rising back to 18.4% by fiscal year 1989. Personal income tax revenues fell during this period relative to GDP, while payroll tax revenues rose relative to GDP. [...] Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20% – its lowest level since the Hoover administration.

2500|$|Gingrich favors keeping {{federal and}} state taxes as low as {{possible}} in order to encourage economic growth.

40|$|Previous {{theoretical}} {{analyses of}} the <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax have suggested that investors have considerable opportunity to avoid the tax. Yet, past empirical work has found relatively little evidence of such activity. Using a previously unavailable panel data set with a very large sample of high-income individuals, this paper aims to bring the theory and evidence closer together by examining the behavior of individual taxpayers over time. Though confirming past findings that avoidance of tax <b>on</b> realized <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> is not prevalent, we do observe that tax avoidance activity increased {{after the passage of}} the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and that high-income, high-wealth and more sophisticated taxpayers were most likely to avoid tax. However, the efficacy of tax avoidance strategies depends on being able to avoid tax for long periods, and we find that most tax avoidance is of relatively short duration. Thus, the effective tax rate <b>on</b> realized <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> is very close to the statutory rate in all years and tax brackets. ...|$|R
