40|$|Being able {{to infer}} <b>one</b> <b>way</b> direct <b>connections</b> in an oscillatory network {{such as the}} suprachiastmatic nucleus (SCN) of the {{mammalian}} brain using time series data is difficult but crucial to understanding network dynamics. Although techniques {{have been developed for}} inferring networks from time series data, there have been no attempts to adapt these techniques to infer directional connections in oscillatory time series, while accurately distinguishing between direct and indirect connections. In this paper an adaptation of Granger Causality is proposed that allows for inference of circadian networks and oscillatory networks in general called Adaptive Frequency Granger Causality (AFGC). Additionally, an extension of this method is proposed to infer networks with large numbers of cells called LASSO AFGC. The method was validated using simulated data from several different networks. For the smaller networks the method was able to identify all <b>one</b> <b>way</b> direct <b>connections</b> without identifying connections that were not present. For larger networks of up to twenty cells the method shows excellent performance in identifying true and false connections; this is quantified by an area-under-the-curve (AUC) 96. 88 %. We note that this method like other Granger Causality-based methods, is based on the detection of high frequency signals propagating between cell traces. Thus it requires a relatively high sampling rate and a network that can propagate high frequency signals...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to explore}} <b>one</b> <b>way</b> of making <b>connections</b> between a {{teaching}} problem, a research process and a theory arrived at through action research. The article suggests {{this as a}} fruitful approach to pedagogic research in general. It focuses on a particular action research project on developing critical academic writing in an international context, illustrating how a particular teaching problem led to an action research investigation {{which resulted in a}} principled, theoretical framework to describe and guide the development of critical academic writing. Arriving at the theoretical framework involved the iterative interaction of theory with practice and required the integration of multiple theoretical perspectives. The theoretical framework was based on general principles or praxiology. There are few studies of this type on critical academic writing, or indeed any pedagogic issue, which seek to: (1) provide a framework for teaching; (2) operationalise this framework; (3) rigorously research its impact in in-depth case studies; and then (4) revise the framework in the light of reflection and analysis...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{assumes that}} since Gramsci {{influenced}} Sraffa and SraffA influenced Wittgenstein {{it may be}} possible to delineate a set of philosophical ideas which they shared in some degree. Gramsci's ideas are first reviewed on terms of his concept of hegemony, concept of caesarism and philosophy of praxis. On this basis three philosophical themes are identified in his thinking: the conept of emergence; catastrophic equilibrium; and the idea of a concrete universal. The thinking of Sraffa (both earlier and later) and the thinking of Wittgenstein (later) are then interpreted in terms of these same three themes. These links neither exhaust their philosophical thinking nor necessarily constitute the only links among the three. But these ideas provide <b>one</b> <b>way</b> of exploring <b>connections</b> among the three. The paper closes with brief remarks concerning two opposed philosophical traditions in modern European intellectual history at the turn of the century — one associated with thinking in Britain and one associated with continental thinking — meant to suggest the distinctiveness of a line of thinking running through Gramsci, Sraffa and Wittgenstein. Gramsci, Sraffa, Wittgenstein, Philosophical Linkages, Continental Tradition,...|$|R

40|$|In 2013, Farid and Vasiliev [arXiv:quant-ph/ 1310. 4922] for {{the first}} time {{proposed}} a way to construct a protocol for the realisation of "Classical to Quantum" <b>one</b> <b>way</b> hash function, a derivative of the Quantum <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function as defined by Gottesman and Chuang [Technical Report arXiv:quant-ph/ 0105032] and used for constructing quantum digital signatures. We, on the other hand, {{for the first}} time, propose the idea of a different kind of <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function which is "quantum-classical" in nature, that is, it takes an n-qubit quantum state of a definite class as its input and produces a classical output. We formally define such a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function and propose a way to construct and realise it. The proposed <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function turns out to be very useful in authenticating a quantum state in any quantum money scheme and so we can construct many quantum money schemes based on such a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function. Later in the paper, we also give explicit construction of quantum money schemes like quantum bitcoins and quantum currency schemes, solely based on the proposed <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function.
