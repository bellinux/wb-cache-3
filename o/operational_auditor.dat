40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the need for}} better management tools and techniques for managers of small not-for-profit organizations. It discusses the impact, purpose {{and size of the}} private not-for-profit sector. An argument is made for the need and application of an operational audit for small not-for-profit organizations, and discussion given to specific benefits to be derived by managers whose organizations are examined by an <b>operational</b> <b>auditor.</b> Integrating the special needs and considerations that must be contemplated before intervening into a small not-for-profit organization, a model is designed for assisting small not-for-profit managers. Once the model is outlined, the author demonstrates the usefulness of the model by applying the model to a real small not-for-pro fit institution. Concluding that an operational audit provides managers with a tool which allows them to be better managers. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|For over {{a century}} {{the role of the}} {{internal}} auditor has been recognized as a special role within organizations that provided important support to the organization. The importance of this support has been growing over the century. In particular internal audit is considered to encompass the audit of both operational activities as well as purely financial activities. During the last few years there has been a growing interest in organizational culture. The {{purpose of this study is}} to look at the organizational culture of organizations and their internal audit operations from the perspective of operational audit. The study will use an organizational cultural model to see if operational internal audit has identical cultural to the organization, and if not what differences exist, and how these differences might be seen to mean that the operational internal audit with a particular cultural profile better achieves its goals, and assists the organization as a result. In conducting this study, because of the need for richer in depth data than could be achieved with a survey analysis, a multiple case approach has been taken. Three organizations within the same economic sector were examined to see how culture affected their use of operational internal audit, and how the operational internal audit responded. The results suggest that the operational internal audit of organizations generally have their own cultural orientation, and these orientations are independent of the organizations’ own cultural orientations. Further the results suggest that <b>operational</b> internal <b>auditors</b> with a strong cultural orientation towards rules and procedures will better serve their organizations...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary The {{exponential}} rise in {{concern over}} corporate control and regulatory compliance has exposed spreadsheets {{as a major}} source of business risk. ClusterSeven provides a solution to this challenge that can meet the needs of regulatory compliance, <b>operational</b> risk and <b>auditors</b> without reducing business flexibility and the ability of Excel to power innovation and opportunity. The largest single list of publicised spreadsheet errors (www. eusprig. org) shows that almost all significant risk incidents in spreadsheets have been caused by authorized users working in spreadsheets that are being used and consumed as business applications. ClusterSeven is focused on addressing this problem. It does this by focusing on the spreadsheet as an application, rather than as a document – by understanding, reporting and alerting the critical changes to cell level and VBA content (both formulae and data) during business operations. This complements and contrasts with the document level management capability offered by Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server 2007 and Office Excel 2007. Most importantly, ClusterSeven delivers spreadsheet change information {{in a way that it}} can be analyzed and signed off as part of regular business workflow. ClusterSeven customers are regularly finding significant issues in seconds that would have previously taken hours or would never been discovered until a financial loss had been created. This paper addresses the additional benefits that ClusterSeven brings to the capabilities of the Microsoft Office System and, in particular, the 2007 release. It does this by examining the five dimensions of a complete solution...|$|R
40|$|This paper discuses {{the use of}} {{technology}} in the area of fraud detection. Using a number of case studies Eckhardt will discuss various techniques and technology solutions which he has used in the past. It is intended for: management, who has an obligation to certify financial information and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or who has to meet other compliance or <b>operational</b> requirements and; <b>auditors</b> and investigators charged with the audits of financial information, value for money audits or forensic investigations. Since the collapse of Enron on December 2, 2001 and other corporate failures around the world, wide-ranging changes have been made to the regulatory environment of business. Corporate governance has become a common focus for many boards and audit committees. In an attempt to restore confidence in the markets, securities regulators have promulgated various pieces of legislation, namely the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the US and Bill 198 and Multilateral Instrument 52 - 109 in Canada that require the certification of the design and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting by the CEO and CFO. Perhaps one of the more far-reaching revisions to the auditing standards concerns the auditor's responsibility to consider fraud. In all of these new standards and guidelines, technology solutions can play an ever-increasing role to the point where their use is now becoming a necessity, especially in the area of fraud detection...|$|R
40|$|Corporate scandals {{during the}} last decade fostered many Corporate Governance reports. These reports aimed at {{restoring}} checks and balances in companies to prevent fraudulent behaviour and restore public trust. One of the functions active in many organizations is Internal Audit. This function operates under the umbrella of the Management Board and is geared towards monitoring lower level management. Due to the Corporate Governance reports the interest in the work of internal auditors has increased. In many reports special attention is paid to this function. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee are required to oversee the activities and results of external as well as internal auditors. Furthermore, regulators are also keen on the results of their work. The aim {{of this study was to}} research the impact of Corporate Governance reports on the role, position, and scope of services of the Internal Audit Function. Agency Theory and Transaction Cost Economics were applied to further theory around internal auditing. Information asymmetry and asset specificity were used to test whether there was a correlation between high scores on information asymmetry and/or asset specificity for the organization and the size of an Internal Audit Function, the ‘make or buy’ issue, or its scope of services. Results showed that such was the case for the size but not for the ‘make or buy issue or the scope of services. Furthermore, this study contains descriptive characteristics of internal audit functions. Financiële schandalen in het afgelopen decennium hebben geleid tot een stroom aan Corporate Governance rapporten. Deze rapporten hadden tot doel om de beheersingsmaatregelen te versterken en daarmee het vertrouwen van het maatschappelijk verkeer te herstellen. Een van de functies actief in organisaties is Internal Audit. Deze functie opereert onder de hoede van de Raad van Bestuur/Directie en is gericht op het monitoren van het management onder de Raad van Bestuur/Directie. Dankzij die Corporate Governance rapporten is de belangstelling voor het werk van internal auditors toegenomen. In vele rapporten wordt ook aandacht besteed aan deze functie. De Raad van Commissarissen en het Audit Committee worden geacht toe te zien op het functioneren van zowel externe als internal auditors. Ook regelgevers en toezichthouders zijn geïnteresseerd in de resultaten van hun werk. Het doel van deze studie was na te gaan wat de invloed is van de Corporate Governance rapporten op de rol, positie en taakopdracht van de Internal Audit Functie. Agency Theory en Transaction Cost Economics zijn gebruikt om de theorie rondom internal auditing te versterken. Information asymmetry en asset specificity zijn gebruikt om te testen of er een correlatie bestaat tussen hoge scores voor information asymmetry en/of asset specificity van de organisatie en de omvang van de Internal Audit functie, het in- of uitbestedingsvraagstuk en de taakopdracht. De resultaten toonden aan dat dit wel het geval was voor de omvang maar niet voor het in- of uitbestedingsvraagstuk, noch de taakopdracht. Verder bevat deze studie beschrijvende karakteristieken van internal audit functies.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{identify}} and analyze the perceptions of college and university auditors concerning the importance of selected factors associated with operational auditing. The secondary purpose was to determine whether the perceptions of certified auditors differ significantly from those of noncertified auditors. Selected factors associated with operational auditing for colleges and universities were categorized in three attribute groups—organizational, personal, and environmental. The identification of organizational and personal attributes was based mainly on concepts set forth in the Standard for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing published by the Institute of Internal Auditors (1978). Identification of environmental attributes was based on a review of the relevant literature, as well as on discussions with selected college and university auditors. Each attribute, whether categorized as organizational, personal, or environmental, was used as a basis for the identification of detailed factors associated with operational auditing. The findings of this study reveal that factors dealing with organizational attributes were perceived as considerably more favorable than were factors dealing with personal or environmental attributes. With regard to the secondary purpose of this research, a total of 14 hypotheses were developed and subjected to t-tests to determine whether the perceptions of certified auditors differed significantly from those of noncertified auditors. Of the 14 hypotheses tested, there were no significant differences between perceptions of the two groups concerning the importance of independence, audit plan, audit program, audit supervision, continuing education, training, audit follow-up, objectivity, technical competence, experience, and interpersonal skills. Certified auditors perceived attributes that deal with audit report and professional certification to be more important to operational auditing than did their noncertified counterparts. With regard to the importance of a knowledge and understanding of the higher education environment (i. e., knowledge of characteristics uniquely identifiable with institutions of higher education) to <b>operational</b> auditing, certified <b>auditors</b> perceived this attribute less favorably than did noncertified auditors...|$|R
