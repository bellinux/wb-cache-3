40|$|<b>Optimal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>charging</b> for {{transportation}} infrastructure requires {{the meeting of}} numerous conditions to achieve first-best traffic flows. In practice, these types of assumption are not met, and first-best pricing is seldom tenable. Second-best approaches pose particular problems for atomistic markets, such as cars seeking road space, although the challenges are different when there are {{a limited number of}} buyers and queuing abilities are constrained. This paper considers this latter situation in the context of air transportation infrastructure. It looks at some of the empirical work on airport runway pricing to assess whether it adequately reflects the nature of the situation. It considers the role that more direct, market-oriented approaches may play in enhancing the efficiency of infrastructure allocation once one moves away from the atomistic market that dominates thinking regarding road transportation. In doing so it pays particular attention to the technical differences of the industries involved. © 2008 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to investigate the <b>optimal</b> <b>economic</b> life cycle of grass leys with winter damage problems in northern Norway and to determine the threshold of winter damage before it is profitable to re-seed. A two-level hierarchic Markov process has been constructed using the MLHMP software. The model takes uncertainty concerning yield potential, damage estimation and weather dependent random fluctuations into account. A Kalman filter technique is used for updating of knowledge on yield potential and damage level. The application of the model is demonstrated using data from two commercial Norwegian farms. Since parameter estimates vary considerably among farms, it is concluded that decision support concerning <b>optimal</b> <b>economic</b> life cycle of grass leys should be done at farm level. The results also show the importance of using a flexible dynamic replacement strategy. Use of the model for a specific farm situation is illustrated. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>optimal</b> <b>economic</b> {{level in}} leakage {{reduction}} must be defined when reaching equilibrium between marginal costs of saved water and marginal costs of achieving additional reduction in leakage (Farley and Trow, 2003). This concept {{is used to}} deal with the question of what the target in reducing leakage should be and how related costs can be justified. Nevertheless, when negotiating for optimal decisions considering complex multi-centre (or multi-district) supply systems, subject to reduced water resources and reduced funds, the problem could be much more difficult to define and analyze. Mainly, in this situation, the <b>optimal</b> <b>economic</b> problem can be modified in finding the priorities in investment for leakage reductions between the centres in the supply network. This paper is related to these aspects; it mainly focuses on finding a reliable and correctly justified cost- function attribution for the water in multi-source and multi-centre systems...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we use quasi-variational inequalities {{to provide}} a {{rigorous}} proof of the familiar square root formula for the <b>optimal</b> <b>economic</b> order quantity (EOQ) in the classical deterministic average cost inventory model. 1 Introduction The familiar square root formula for the <b>optimal</b> <b>economic</b> order quantity (EOQ) in simple inventory models {{is one of the}} most fundamental results in management science and operations research. The formula dates back to Harris (1915); see Erlenkotter (1989) for its history. The development of the formula and its subsequent derivations have been largely informal. Every OR textbook contains a calculus derivation of the EOQ formula. But such a derivation does not establish formally that the EOQ formula provides a production policy that minimizes the long-run average cost over the class of all admissible policies. Certainly there are many possible ways to prove the formula. But there does not seem to be a publication devoted directly to providing a mathema [...] ...|$|R

However, under a certain definition of fair-value hedge accounting, the hedging decision preserves the <b>optimal</b> <b>economic</b> hedge. We then demonstrate that long-term and future shareholders prefer a certain definition of fair-value hedge accounting to no-hedge accounting, while short-term shareholders prefer either approach depending on risk preferences and the level of uncertainty. We speculate about circumstances in which a manager would choose not to adopt fair-value hedge accounting when he has the option not to do so...|$|R
30|$|<b>Optimal</b> <b>economic</b> {{operation}} of microgrid is to properly allocate {{the output of}} micro-sources to increase the economic benefits of the microgrid. Many related researches have been reported. Based on the new photovoltaic output model, Reference [6] formed a probability sequence of wind-solar collaborative output through the convolution method and established a microgrid <b>optimal</b> <b>economic</b> operation model that can convert stochastic constraint into certainty constraints. The microgrid <b>optimal</b> <b>economic</b> operation model established in [7] took {{the impact of the}} electricity market into account and by optimizing the outputs of different micro-sources it reduced power fluctuation of the power lines and the total operating costs. Reference [8] put forward a multi-objective fuzzy adaptive HPSO algorithm to optimize the microgrid operation. It converted the multiple objective functions of power supply cost, environmental pollution expenses and generating cost into a single objective through the proposed algorithm. Reference [9] established a model for energy storage charge–discharge loss and incorporated it into the microgrid economic operation model to analyze its effect on the economic {{operation of}} the microgrid. In Reference [10], considering the energy storage characteristics, electric/heat load and time-of-use (TOU) power price, it proposed an economic operation model for regional connected microgrid that uses electricity-heat combined scheduling. References [11 – 16] considered the connection of renewable energy sources into the co-generation microgrid and the impacts of the characteristics of renewable energy power generation equipment and load randomness on optimal operation of the microgrid to optimize the outputs of different micro-sources, in order to achieve the lowest economic cost.|$|R
