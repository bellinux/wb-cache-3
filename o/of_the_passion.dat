40|$|Most seventeenth-century moralists and philosophers, such as Pascal and Malebranche, {{commonly}} describe <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> and <b>the</b> imagination as symptoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corruption <b>of</b> human nature. Descartes {{is not an}} {{easy fit}} in this general framework, especially since most studies of his account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> read him rather univocally as committed only to a scientific investigation of certain phenomena that properly belong to the soul but do originate in bodily movements. In this paper, it will be argued that Descartes’ account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> is more complex. Namely, by suggesting, on the one hand, that <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> are all good in themselves and, on the other hand, that <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> generosity is <b>the</b> highest human virtue, Descartes seems at a remarkable distance from many of his contemporaries. Yet, Descartes equally warns against the potentially dangerous effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions,</b> particularly when <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> and <b>the</b> faculty <b>of</b> imagination collaborate closely. <b>The</b> representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object <b>of</b> a <b>passion</b> is often illegitimately and excessively esteemed by the imagination. This inclines the human soul to assume the images represented by a passion as real and then willingly attributes a disproportionate significance to these. As such, the human soul is necessarily at <b>the</b> mercy <b>of</b> error and deception. This nuanced appreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> will be illustrated in reference to <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> vanity (‘orgueil’), joy (‘joie’) and love (‘amour’), which are <b>the</b> three fundamental <b>passions</b> that determine <b>the</b> relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul to itself and the external world. If <b>the</b> representations <b>of</b> these <b>passions</b> are exposed to <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination, they potentially turn into <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> all human errors and immorality. Descartes also emphasizes, however, <b>the</b> positive use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> which is enabled by retaining <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> free will. What is more, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> free will can even turn <b>the</b> most dangerous <b>passions</b> into virtues if <b>the</b> (imaginary) representation <b>of</b> their objects does not seduce the soul to (self-) deception. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Descartes’s {{mechanistic}} account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> {{is sometimes}} dismissed as one which lacks the resources toadequately explain <b>the</b> cognitive aspect <b>of</b> emotion. By some, he {{is taken to}} be “feeling theorist”, reducing thepassions to a mere awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physiological state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul-body union. If this reading of Descartes’spassions is correct, his theory fails {{not only because it}} cannot account for <b>the</b> intentional nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passions,but also because <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> cannot play <b>the</b> role in Descartes’s moral theory they are meant to play. I arguethat Descartes’s account is not best read as a feeling theory. I defend a reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cartesian <b>passions</b> whichacknowledges their mechanistic nature, arguing that for Descartes, <b>passions</b> are modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul withcognitive significance, they are perceptions of relational axiological properties.

5|$|Heralds {{could have}} {{attributed}} to Jesus the harp for arms inherited as {{a descendant of}} David. Nevertheless, the cross was regarded as Christ's emblem, {{and it was so}} used by the Crusaders. Sometimes the arms of Christ feature a Paschal lamb as the principal charge. By the 13th century, however, numerous indulgences had brought increased veneration for the instruments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Passion.</b> These instruments were described in heraldic terms and treated as personal to Christ much as a coat of arms (Dennys, 96). An early example in a seal from c. 1240 includes the Cross, nails, lance, crown of thorns, sponge and whips.|$|E

50|$|A {{first feature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Passions</b> Bach wrote for Leipzig follows from <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> service: <b>the</b> <b>Passions</b> {{needed to be}} in two parts, for performance {{before and after the}} sermon. A second structural feature specific for Leipzig is <b>the</b> recitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unaltered Gospel text, as in Leipzig it was not allowed to paraphrase <b>the</b> Gospel in <b>Passion</b> presentations: for this reason an unaltered setting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brockes <b>Passion,</b> which contained a lot of such paraphrasing loosely based on all four Gospel texts of Christ's Passion, was not possible, although Bach returned often to Brockes' text, choosing parts of its poetry as lyrics for commenting arias after recitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospel text. For this reason Bach's Passions for Leipzig are named after the Evangelist from whoms Gospel <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> text is used.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary philosopher Roberto Mangabeira Unger has {{developed}} a view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> that disassociates them from human nature, and instead gives them a formless life that serve in our noninstrumental dealings with each other.

In this way, Unger rejects <b>the</b> traditional view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> as something counter to reason and which are associated with certain expressions, rather he sees them at <b>the</b> service <b>of</b> reason and their expression formed within certain contexts.|$|R
5|$|The gilding and monumentality of {{the cross}} link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is {{reflective}} of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes are closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Velázquez to Francis Bacon.|$|E
5|$|The {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 15th century; its carved panels alternate images of the symbols of the Four Evangelists with seated figures of the Doctors of the Church (Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, and Pope Gregory I). The central column carries shields depicting the Instruments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> and the Holy Wounds. The eastern shield is unusual in that a sword is shown with an ear stuck to it. This refers {{to the story of}} Saint Peter striking off the ear of Malchus, the High Priest's servant, in the garden of Gethsemane.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, apart from his devotion to the Sagrada Família, Gaudí participated only in minor {{projects}} which were not completed: in 1916, on the death of his friend bishop Josep Torras i Bages, he designed a monument in his honour, which he wanted to place in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> facade of the Sagrada Família. He made a sketch of the project, which ultimately was not carried out, and made a plaster bust of the bishop, the work of Joan Matamala under the instruction of Gaudí. It was put in the Sagrada Família, where it would have formed part of the church, but it was destroyed in 1936. Another commemorative monument project, also not carried out, was dedicated to Enric Prat de la Riba, which would have been situated in Castellterçol, birthplace of this Catalan politician. The project dates from 1918, and would have consisted of a tall tower with two porticos and a spire topped with an iron structure flying the Catalan flag. The sketch of the project was done by Lluís Bonet i Garí, Gaudí's assistant.|$|E
40|$|A {{recurring}} theme within Robert Solomon’s writings concerns <b>the</b> central importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions.</b> His high regard for <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> even motivates him to challenge <b>the</b> traditional understanding <b>of</b> virtue. Solomon rejects the Aristotelian view that virtues are dispositions of character developed according to rational principles rather than <b>passions.</b> He offers <b>the</b> counter-example <b>of</b> erotic love as a passion {{that is not}} based upon rationality, which he argues ought {{to be viewed as}} a virtue. This paper argues that while Solomon’s account of love can accommodate the traditional Aristotelian motivations for rejecting passions as virtues, there are compelling reasons for preferring <b>the</b> Aristotelian account <b>of</b> virtue. Ultimately, Solomon’s argument relies upon an implausible view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> and offers inferior resources for examining love in terms of virtue...|$|R

5|$|The {{instruments}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> {{were sometimes}} split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E

Smith gives an analysis of action whereby in order for anything to count as an action at all, it must be explicable in terms of a belief-desire pair.
