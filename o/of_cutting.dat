5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching {{is that it does not}} require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to {{treatment}} effects <b>of</b> <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> a grape variety called Moldova with 0. 01 % solution of heteroauxin on their regenerative capacity, depending on the light conditions. We have established that the germination <b>of</b> <b>cuttings</b> in the dark, {{as well as the}} treatment of heteroauxin significantly stimulate their regenerative abilities. The length of the shoots, regardless of the use of heteroauxin, depends on the mode of the light produced during the germination <b>of</b> <b>cuttings.</b> In both studies, the length of the shoots on the end <b>of</b> experiment <b>cuttings</b> germinated in the dark, was 1, 71 - 2, 66 times more than when germinated in the light.

In both studies, the rooting <b>of</b> <b>cuttings</b> started earlier and passed more rapidly during their germination in the dark. Processing cuttings with heteroauxin, followed by germination in the dark, speeded up the formation of roots even more, compared with the case where the cuttings treated with heteroauxin germinated in the light.

40|$|Propagation of {{tropical}} and subtropical eucalypts is often limited by reduced production <b>of</b> rooted <b>cuttings</b> in winter. We assessed whether changing {{the temperature of}} stock plants of Eucalyptus cloeziana from 28 / 23 (day/night) to 18 / 13, 23 / 18 or 33 / 28 °C affected the production, nutrient concentrations and percentages <b>of</b> <b>cuttings</b> that subsequently formed roots. Lowering the temperature to 18 / 13 or 23 / 18 °C greatly reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>cuttings</b> harvested from stock plants but {{did not affect the}} percentage <b>of</b> <b>cuttings</b> that formed roots.

The effects of stock plant temperatures on rooting were not the result of altered nutrient concentrations. However, consistent relationships were found between adventitious root formation and boron concentration.

5|$|As {{the home}} country of {{beetroot}} borscht, Ukraine boasts great {{diversity of the}} soup's regional variants, with virtually every province having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.|$|E

Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer. This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E

The area of these varieties, which are inter-specific hybrids, in the Krasnodar region is more than 2 thousands hectares. The cuttings were rooted in sawdust in a greenhouse on a heated rack. It was found, that the regenerative capacity <b>of</b> <b>cuttings</b> was strongly dependent on the method of their storage prior to installation on the germination. The best results were obtained in the case when cuttings had been stored in the refrigerator before starting the experiment. The lowest impact of the way to store cuttings was on the percentage <b>of</b> <b>cuttings</b> with blossoming eyes, and the largest - the length of the shoots, the output <b>of</b> the <b>cuttings</b> with at least 3 of the roots, and the average number of roots developed on one <b>cutting.</b> Rooting <b>of</b> <b>cuttings</b> and their growth with three and more roots were different over the years for the varieties of Pervenets Magaracha and Cytrony Magaracha, in favor of one sort or another, but the average 3 -year difference between varieties was not significant.
