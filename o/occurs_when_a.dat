5|$|Isotopes such as lithium-6, {{as well as}} some {{beryllium}} and boron {{are generated}} in space through cosmic ray spallation. This <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E

5000|$|The Majority of sprained ankles in volleyball <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> {{player is}} at the net, either {{blocking}} or Spiking. [...] The reason why ankle sprains occur at the net is because both blocking and spiking involve jumping and possibly of landing on an opponents foot causing the injury. Approximately 50 percent of all sprained ankles in volleyball <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> blocker lands on the attacking players foot, while about 25 percent <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> blocker lands on their own teammates foot following a block with multiple blockers involved.|$|R
5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> gene undergoes duplication to form a tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide, such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E

5|$|Language endangerment <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> {{language}} {{is at risk}} of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism, where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.|$|E
5|$|OCD <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> {{loose piece}} of bone or {{cartilage}} partially (or fully) separates {{from the end}} of the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply (osteonecrosis) and decalcification of the trabecular bone matrix. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the joint stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees, ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.|$|E
5|$|Sodium lauryl {{sulphate}} (SLS), a detergent {{present in}} some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration in some individuals. It {{has been shown}} that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in ulceration <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> SLS-free toothpaste is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products, there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E

5|$|The {{final stage}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> massive star begins {{producing}} iron. Since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron {{does not produce}} a net release of energy. To a very limited degree such a process proceeds, but it consumes energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, such energy cannot be released by fission.|$|E
5|$|Whole colonies can {{reproduce}} asexually, forming two colonies {{with the}} same genotype. The possible mechanisms include fission, bailout and fragmentation. Fission occurs in some corals, especially among the family Fungiidae, where the colony splits into two or more colonies during early developmental stages. Bailout <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> single polyp abandons the colony and settles on a different substrate {{to create a new}} colony. Fragmentation involves individuals broken from the colony during storms or other disruptions. The separated individuals can start new colonies.|$|E
5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the foul line {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{resistance}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> person becomes {{infected with}} a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, {{not taking the}} prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E

5|$|Special double-doubles are rare. One such double-double {{is called}} double double-double (also {{referred}} to as 20–20 or Double-20). It <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> player accumulates 20 or more in two different statistical categories in a game. Another such double-double is called a triple double-double (also {{referred to as}} 30–30). The only player in NBA history to record a 40-40 is Wilt Chamberlain, who achieved the feat eight times in his career. Of the five instances, four were recorded in his rookie season, and the fifth was achieved the following year where he recorded 78 points and 43 rebounds in a game. Wilt Chamberlain also holds the record for most career double-doubles (regular season and playoffs) with 1111. Tim Duncan is second with 1005, followed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with 1004.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{are less}} likely to be {{attacked}} by parasites than bees, wasps and ants, as they are usually well protected in their mounds. Nevertheless, termites are infected by a variety of parasites. Some of these include dipteran flies, Pyemotes mites, and a large number of nematode parasites. Most nematode parasites are in the order Rhabditida; others are in the genus Mermis, Diplogaster aerivora and Harteria gallinarum. Under imminent threat of an attack by parasites, a colony may migrate to a new location. Fungi pathogens such as Aspergillus nomius and Metarhizium anisopliae are, however, major threats to a termite colony as they are not host-specific and may infect large portions of the colony; transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact. M.anispliae is known to weaken the termite immune system. Infection with A.nomius only <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> colony is under great stress.|$|E
5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E
