50|$|Mikasaite, a mixed iron-aluminium sulfate of {{chemical}} formula (Fe3+, Al3+)2(SO4)3 {{is the name}} of mineralogical form of iron(III) sulfate. This anhydrous form occurs very rarely and is connected with coal fires. The hydrates are more common, with coquimbite (nonahydrate) as probably the most often met among them. Paracoquimbite is the other, rarely met natural nonahydrate. Kornelite (heptahydrate) and quenstedtite (decahydrate) are rarely found. Lausenite (hexa- or pentahydrate) is a doubtful species. All the mentioned natural hydrates are unstable compounds connected with Fe-bearing primary minerals (mainly pyrite and marcasite) oxidation in <b>ore</b> <b>beds.</b> In the solutions of the <b>ore</b> <b>beds</b> oxidation zones the iron(III) sulfate is also an important oxidative agent.|$|R

5000|$|The part of Rudolph {{within three}} {{miles of the}} Wisconsin River was in the [...] "Indian strip," [...] sold by the Menominees to the U.S. {{government}} in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars. As such, it was logged and surveyed early. In 1840 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed that southern half of the six mile square that would become Rudolph, walking through the woods and crossing the river, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:Considerable good land on the North East part of this Fractional Township. Extensive(?)

50|$|Bog ore is a {{renewable}} resource when mined and utilized with care. It is produced when rain water leaches out humic and tannic acids and reacts with carbon dioxide, which is produced {{as a part}} of the natural life-cycle of microorganisms in the soil. Part of this leachate consists of iron particles from deeper in the soil. As the water passes through these areas of loamy soil, also called marl, it deposits a solution of iron carbonate which rises up to the surface. This iron carbonate then combines with the surface soil and, over time, hardens into a solid mass. This process only takes about 25 to 35 years, making it an ideal, almost perpetual resource for industry but only if treated with respect. If the <b>ore</b> <b>bed</b> is left undeveloped and unpolluted, the beds can be mined indefinitely farther south in New Jersey. The operators of furnaces were forced to purchase ore from Staten Island, New York, because the ore beds had been over-mined.|$|E

Next above lies the Big seam, approximately 17 ft thick, above which these is about 38 ft of red sandstone that carries small quartz pebbles, the lower 14 ft of which has yellow shale about equal in amount to sandstone. About 30 ft still higher is the Pentamerus-bearing bed (Hickory Nut seam), a ferruginous sandstone full of casts of the interiors of the big brachiopod Pentamerus oblongus.

5000|$|The seventh {{essay was}} not part of the Essays Upon Field Husbandry, but it {{concerned}} a new way to manufacture iron from a substance found in New England. This essay was entitled An Essay On The Invention or Art of Making Very Good, If Not The Best Iron, From Black Sea Sand. Eliot recounted how he experimented with [...] "black sea sand" [...] for use in iron-making. In 1744 Eliot’s uncles, Aaron Eliot and Ichabod Miller, succeeded in making more than a half-ton of steel at the furnace in Sansbury. Since the only place to get steel-making materials was New York, there was a need to find sources closer to home. Jared revealed that he was part of a group of investigators who secured an <b>ore</b> <b>bed</b> at Sansbury (by a patent grant from the Great Assembly) to find something to make into iron. This essay concerned the experiments and findings from using black sea sand to make iron.|$|E
50|$|The {{geological}} strata in Lincolnshire {{includes a}} number of iron bearing rocks including (downwards) the Claxby ironstone (Claxby, Lower Cretaceous period); the Lincoln ironstone; the Caythorpe ironstone (Caythorpe, Middle Lias period), below which is the 'Frodingham Ironstone' once mined at Scunthorpe. At Frodingham the ironstone existed in a bed up to 35 ft thick, covered by loose sand. The ore {{was found in the}} form of a calcareous hydrated oxide, with some oolitic nodules, much affected by water weathering; local variations within the <b>ore</b> <b>bed</b> included bands with iron content as high as 40%, down to 12%, with an average iron content of 25%, excluding spoil. The ironstone bed dipped slightly towards the east - the bed's proximity to the surface, its fair uniformity, and the general low value of the land on which it stood led to rapid development of open ore workings. The lime content of the ore rendered it self fluxing, but is high lime content and basic nature were problematic and led to the practice of using it in combination with silica containing ores (for slag formation). Iron produced from the bed including the fossiliferous lime contained over 1% phosphorus, similar to that from the Cleveland ironstone, as well as a few percent of manganese.|$|E
50|$|The Kiruna orebody {{was formed}} {{following}} intense volcanic activity. Iron-rich solutions precipitated the iron on to a syenite porphyry footwall. Then the <b>ore</b> <b>bed</b> {{was covered by}} further volcanic deposits, quartz porphyry, and sedimentary rocks. Later the whole body was tilted to its current dip of 50 to 60°. Having a grading of more than 60% iron and an average of 0,9% phosphorus, the ore contains a very pure magnetite-apatite mix.The original reserve of the Kiruna mine was around 1.8 billion tonnes of ore. In the beginning, surface mining was used, but the mine has been mined with the sublevel caving mining method since the 1960s. As of 2008 the Kiruna mine had estimated proven reserves of approximately 602 million tonnes grading 48.5% iron with probable reserves of 82 million tonnes grading 46.7% iron. Measured, indicated and inferred resources add a further 328 million tonnes to the proven reserves. Until 1999 the deepest level of the mine reached 775 m, but after 1999 the new level went deeper reaching a depth of 1045 m. The 1045 m level can support current iron ore production until 2018. On October 28, 2008 Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB decided to go even deeper, the new level reaching a depth of 1365 m to be finished by 2012 {{at a cost of}} US$1.7 billion.|$|E

Old Uncle Barney became quite a rich man, and took up his home with the other Stevensons.|$|R
5000|$|.....The Red Mountain ores {{are known}} as a red fossil ore, because {{originally}} the iron accumulated in extensive beds of fragments of fossils, principally the hard parts of crinoids, bryozoans, and brachiopods. The iron, from solution in some form, was precipitated upon and within these beds of fossil fragments and thus the <b>ore</b> <b>beds</b> are simply {{a particular kind of}} sedimentary layers inclosed in ordinary sediments, shales, and sandstones, composing the bulk of the Red Mountain formation. As the fossil fragments were composed of calcium carbonate, which is the mineral that forms limestone, the iron <b>ore</b> <b>beds</b> at depth, where they are unweathered and where there has been no condition that permitted leaching of the lime content, carry a considerable percentage of lime, so that the ore is self-fluxing. Another type of ore is oolite ore, in which the iron oxide occurs in the form of small [...] pellets. The precipitation of the iron that forms this ore started around some minute particle like a small grain of sand or fragment of fossil and built up a small lenticular body. The two kinds of ore are more or less mixed or one or the other may predominate in a particular layer of ore. - Geology of Alabama (1926) ...|$|R
