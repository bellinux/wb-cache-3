However, the Code did not expressly state that chapter 11 excluded individuals who were not engaged in business from filing a chapter 11 case.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, it was {{a common}} {{practice}} of many railroad companies to issue wharfage charges on customers when transporting goods from railroad cars and onto piers, or vice versa. At {{some point during the}} war, the United States government (referred to by the Court in its decision as the [...] "Government") took over <b>operating</b> <b>control</b> of a number of piers in Norfolk, Virginia. Instead of using the railroad companies' wharfage services, the Government transferred its cargo to and from piers using its own materials. The Government, not requiring any railroad services apart from transporting the goods to and from the site, requested that it be granted an allowance for the wharfage fees, effectively asking for a refund of fees already paid before the request was made. The railroads refused to make this allowance, prompting the Government to request that the railroads then perform the services themselves, a request which the railroads also denied.|$|E

40|$|In {{this portion}} of the dry cask storage system (DCSS) review, the NRC evaluates the <b>operating</b> <b>controls</b> and limits or the {{technical}} specifications (including their bases and justification) that the applicant has established as license conditions (for site-specific applications) or conditions of use (for applications requesting DCSS system approval under 10 CFR Part 72 1). The NRC also determines whether the applicant has fully evaluated the proposed <b>operating</b> <b>controls</b> and limits, or technical specifications, and whether the safety evaluation report (SER) prepared by the NRC staff incorporates any additional <b>operating</b> <b>controls</b> and limits that the staff deems necessary. For simplicity in defining the acceptance criteria and review procedures, the term technical specifications may be considered synonymous with <b>operating</b> <b>controls</b> and limits. The technical specifications define the conditions that are deemed necessary for safe DCSS system use. Specifically, they define <b>operating</b> limits and <b>controls,</b> monitoring instruments and control settings, surveillance requirements, design features, and administrative controls that ensure safe operation of the DCSS. As such, these technical specifications are included in a DCSS certificate of compliance or site-specific license, as applicable. Each specification should be clearly documented and justified in the technical review sections of the safety analysis report (SAR) and the associated SER as necessary for safe DCSS operation...|$|R
