5|$|Soil types {{mentioned}} in records are black soil (Karimaniya) in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil (Kebbayya mannu) Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land {{and to a}} lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called kalani, galde, nir mannu or nir panya and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water. The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms gosahasra (a thousand cows), gasara (owner <b>of</b> <b>cows),</b> gosasi (donor <b>of</b> <b>cows),</b> goyiti (cowherdess), gosasa (protector <b>of</b> <b>cows)</b> attest to this. Inscriptions indicate ownership <b>of</b> <b>cows</b> may have been as important as cultivable land and that there may have existed a social hierarchy based on this. Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women (pendir-udeyulcal), abduction of women by bedas (hunter tribes); all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age.|$|E

Her daughters Rohini and Gandharvi are the mothers of cattle and horses respectively. Still, it is Surabhi who is described as the mother of all cows in the text.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the amount <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk production and its price in Turkey in the period between 1985 - 2015. The Koyck model that is one of the distributed lag models was used to analyse of these data. The production <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk was considered as dependent variable and the price series consisting <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk prices and lagged price series are considered as explanatory variable in the model. According to the results of Koyck model, it was determined that the production <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk was affected by the prices of maximum one year retrospectively and the time required to dramatically affect to production <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk <b>of</b> the change taken place in prices <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk was 2. 9 years. Furthermore, the increase of 1 TL in price <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk decreases the production <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk by 183372. 4 tonnes. On the other hand, the increase of 1 TL in prices in the previous period decreases the production <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk by 137345. 9 tonnes. Based on these data, it can be said that the price <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk composed in the free market conditions is rather efficient in determination to production amount. In conclusion, economic measures such as making of production planning, constituting of efficient marketing opportunities, price policies and giving a place to stable production can be taken against to fluctutations in the price increases...|$|R

5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number <b>of</b> <b>cows</b> milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E
5|$|Dominant bulls follow groups <b>of</b> <b>cows</b> {{during the}} rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.|$|E

5|$|Kamadhenu {{is often}} {{addressed}} by the proper name Surabhi or Shurbhi, which is also used as a synonym for an ordinary cow. Professor Jacobi considers the name Surabhi—"the fragrant one"—to have originated from the peculiar smell <b>of</b> <b>cows.</b> According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit–English Dictionary (1899), Surabhi means fragrant, charming, pleasing, as well as cow and earth. It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu, the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a Matrika ("mother") goddess. Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are Sabala ("the spotted one") and Kapila ("the red one").|$|E
5|$|Several {{communities}} in Baker County were devastated, leaving seven people dead, {{as many as}} 100 injured, and hundreds destitute. The county sheriff estimated that merely a dozen houses out of a thousand survived the storm, that thousands <b>of</b> <b>cows</b> were killed, and that {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees were toppled.

Eight people were killed in Suwannee County, including two children crushed by the collapse of their home near Wellborn. In Columbia County, dozens of buildings suffered near or total destruction, while nine people were killed. One woman lost her life in Grady, a small settlement in Lafayette County. Additionally, there were five fatalities in Bradford County, including one man reportedly struck by flying bricks that were lofted nearly a half mile downwind.

5|$|Ti Noel {{recalls the}} tales that a fellow slave, Macandal, would regale on the {{plantation}} of their master, Lenormand de Mezy. Macandal would tell tales of magical characters and mythical kingdoms with rivers {{rising in the}} sky. He is said to not only have irresistible qualities that appeal to black women, but also the ability to captivate men. He suffers an accident in which his left hand is caught in machinery, and his arm is dragged in up to the shoulder. Being useless to his owner, he departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi that appear to have magical qualities. Ti Noel joins Macandal and both learn about the magical attributes of these natural elements. Macandal suggests {{that the time has}} come, and no longer goes to the plantation. After the rain season has passed, Ti Noel meets with him in a cave populated with strange items. Macandal has established contact with surrounding plantations, and gives instructions to ensure the death <b>of</b> <b>cows</b> using secret herbs. The poison spreads, killing livestock by the hundreds as well as Frenchmen, wiping out adults and children. Madame Lenormand de Mezy dies as a result, and the deaths continue with entire families suffering the same fate. At gunpoint, a slave eventually explains that Macandal has superhuman powers and is the Lord of Poison. Death within the plantations returns to normal rates as a result and the Frenchmen return to playing cards and drinking, as months pass with no word of Macandal. Macandal, now with the ability to transform into animal forms, like bird, fish, or insect, visits the plantation to affirm faith in his return. The slaves decide to wait four years for Macandal to complete his metamorphoses and once again become a human. After four years, he returns during a celebration and all present are delighted. The chanting alerts the white men, and preparations are made to capture Macandal. He is captured and tied to a post in order to be lashed and burned in front of massive black crowds, but he escapes, flying overhead, and lands among the crowd. He is again captured and burned, but the slaves are certain that he has been saved by African Gods and return to their plantations, laughing.|$|E

Ewe or goat cheese products with a minimum of 1 % <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk are considered to be adulterated. For the quantitative determination <b>of</b> <b>cow,</b> ewe and goat milk in cheeses, standard mixtures of cow-ewe and cow-goat milk were made by adding 0; 0. 5; 1; 2; 5; 10; 25; 50; 75 and 100 % (v/v) <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk. The quantification was performed by determining the peak area ratio <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> γ-casein in comparison to ewe/goat casein in prepared standard cheeses. The calibration curves were calculated based on the relation of the peak area ratio <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> γ-caseins (calculated as the percentage of total γ-caseins) in contrast to the relative content (%) <b>of</b> <b>cow</b> milk in the mixture.
