40|$|Abstract—A sound {{localization}} aid {{based on}} eyeglasses with three microphones and four vibrators was {{tested in a}} sound-treated acoustic test room and in an <b>ordinary</b> <b>office.</b> A digital signal-processing algorithm provided a determination of the source angle, which was transformed into eight vibrator codes each corresponding to a 45 ˚ sector. The instrument was tested on nine deaf and three deaf-blind individuals. The results show an average hit rate of about 80 % in a sound-treated room with 100 % for the front 135 ˚ sector. The results in a realistic com-munication situation in an <b>ordinary</b> <b>office</b> room were 70 % cor-rect based on single presentations and 95 % correct when more realistic criteria for an adequate reaction were used. Ten of the twelve subjects were interested in participating in field tests using a planned miniaturized version. Key words: digital signal processing, directional aid, sound localization...|$|R
