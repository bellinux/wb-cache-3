500|$|<b>Otosclerosis</b> is a {{congenital}} or spontaneous-onset disease {{characterized by}} abnormal bone remodeling {{in the inner}} ear. Often this causes the stapes {{to adhere to the}} oval window, which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing loss. Clinical <b>otosclerosis</b> is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. <b>Otosclerosis</b> is more likely in young age groups, and females. Two common treatments are stapedectomy, the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole. [...] Surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related damage {{to the base of the}} bone, or obliterative <b>otosclerosis,</b> resulting in obliteration of the base.|$|E
500|$|An {{increasing}} {{degree of}} deafness, caused by hereditary <b>otosclerosis,</b> led to Alexandra's social isolation; she {{spent more time}} {{at home with her}} children and pets. Her sixth and final pregnancy ended tragically when her infant son died only a day after his birth. Despite Alexandra's pleas for privacy, Queen Victoria insisted on announcing a period of court mourning, which led unsympathetic elements of the press to describe the birth as [...] "a wretched abortion" [...] and the funeral arrangements as [...] "sickening mummery", even though the infant was not buried in state {{with other members of the}} royal family at Windsor, but in strict privacy in the churchyard at Sandringham, where he had lived out his brief life.|$|E
2500|$|Low-frequency {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} is present in many patients with SCDS and is explained by the dehiscence acting as a [...] "third window." [...] Vibrations entering the ear canal and middle ear are then abnormally diverted through the superior semicircular canal and up into the intracranial space where they become absorbed instead of being registered as sound in the hearing center, the cochlea. Due to the difference in resistance between the normal round window and the pathological dehiscence window this hearing loss is more serious in the lower frequencies and may initially be mistaken for <b>otosclerosis.</b> [...] In some patients there is true enhancement of low frequency hearing via bone conducted sound. [...] A clinical sign of this phenomenon {{is the ability of}} the patient to hear (not feel) a tuning fork placed upon the ankle bone.|$|E
50|$|Sensorineural {{hearing loss}} (SNHL) {{has also been}} noted in {{patients}} with otosclerosis; this is usually a high-frequency loss, and usually manifests late in the disease. The causal link between <b>otosclerosis</b> and SNHL remains controversial. Over the past century, leading otologists and neurotologic researchers have argued whether the finding of SNHL late {{in the course of}} <b>otosclerosis</b> is due to <b>otosclerosis</b> or simply to typical presbycusis.|$|E
50|$|Tympanometry {{measures}} the peak pressure (TPP) and peak-compensated static admittance (Ytm) {{of the middle}} ear at the eardrum. As the stapes is ankylosed in <b>otosclerosis,</b> the lateral end of the ossicular chain may still be quite mobile. Therefore, <b>otosclerosis</b> may only slightly reduce the admittance, resulting in either a shallow tympanogram (type AS), or a normal tympanogram (type A). <b>Otosclerosis</b> increases in the stiffness of the middle-ear system, raising its resonant frequency. This can be quantified using multi-frequency tympanometry. Thus, a high resonant-frequency pathology such as <b>otosclerosis</b> can be differentiated from low resonant-frequency pathologies such as ossicular discontinuity.|$|E
5000|$|The renowned German {{composer}} Beethoven was theorized {{to suffer}} from <b>otosclerosis,</b> although this is controversial.Victorian journalist Harriet Martineau gradually lost her hearing during her young life, and later medical historians have diagnosed her with probably suffering from <b>otosclerosis</b> as well. Margaret Sullavan, American stage and film actress, suffered from the congenital hearing defect <b>otosclerosis</b> that worsened as she aged, making her more and more hard of hearing.Howard Hughes the pioneering American aviator, engineer, industrialist, and film producer also suffered from <b>otosclerosis.</b> Frankie Valli, lead singer of The Four Seasons, suffered from it in the 1970s, forcing him to [...] "sing from memory" [...] {{in the latter part}} of the decade (surgery restored most of his hearing by 1980). Pittsburgh Penguins forward Steve Downie suffers from <b>otosclerosis.</b> The British queen Alexandra of Denmark suffered from it, leading to her social isolation; Queen Alexandra's biographer, Georgina Battiscombe, was able to have [...] "some understanding of Alexandra's predicament" [...] because she too had otosclerosis.Adam Savage, host of MythBusters, uses a hearing aid due to <b>otosclerosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Otosclerosis</b> {{results in}} an {{audiogram}} with significant loss at all frequencies, often of around 40 dB(HL).
