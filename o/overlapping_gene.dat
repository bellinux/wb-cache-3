50|$|An <b>overlapping</b> <b>gene</b> is a gene whose expressible {{nucleotide}} sequence partially overlaps with the expressible {{nucleotide sequence}} of another gene. In this way, a nucleotide sequence {{may make a}} contribution to the function of one or more gene products. Overprinting refers to a type of overlap in which {{all or part of the}} sequence of one gene is read in an alternate reading frame from another gene at the same locus. Overprinting has been hypothesized as a mechanism for de novo emergence of new genes from existing sequences, either older genes or previously non-coding regions of the genome. Overprinted genes are particularly common features of the genomic organization of viruses, likely to greatly increase the number of potential expressible genes from a small set of viral genetic information.|$|E

40|$|Presence of <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> (OGs) is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in bacterial genomes. Most frequently, <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> share coding regions with as few as one nucleotide {{to as many as}} thousands of nucleotides. <b>Overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> are often co-regulated, transcriptionally and translationally. <b>Overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> are also subject to the whims of evolution, as the <b>gene</b> <b>overlap</b> is known to be disrupted in some species/strains and participating genes are sometimes lost in independent lineages. Therefore, a better understanding of evolutionary patterns and rates of the disruption of <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> is an important component of genome structure and evolution of gene function. In this study, we investigate the fate of ancestrally <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> in complete genomes from 15 contemporary strains of Salmonella species. We find that the fates of <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> inside and outside operons are distinctly different. A larger fraction of <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> inside operons conserves their overlap as compared to gene pairs outside of the operons (average 0. 89 vs. 0. 83 per genome). However, when <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> in the operons separate, one partner is lost more frequently than in those separated genes outside of operons (average 0. 02 vs. 0. 01 per genome). We also investigate the fate of a pan set of <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> at the present and ancestral nodes over a phylogenetic tree based on genome sequence data, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Overlapping {{transcripts}} in antisense orientation {{have the}} potential to form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a substrate for a number of different RNA-modification pathways. One prominent route for dsRNA is its breakdown by Dicer enzyme complexes into small RNAs, a pathway that is widely exploited by RNA interference technology to inactivate defined genes in transgenic lines. The significance of this pathway for endogenous gene regulation remains unclear. RESULTS: We have examined transcription data for <b>overlapping</b> <b>gene</b> pairs in Arabidopsis thaliana. On the basis of an analysis of transcripts with coding regions, we find the majority of <b>overlapping</b> <b>gene</b> pairs to be convergently overlapping pairs (COPs), with the potential for dsRNA formation.

The probability that both the sense and antisense copy of a COP are co-transcribed matches the theoretical value for coexpression under the assumption that the expression of one partner does not affect the expression of the other. Among COPs, we observe an over-representation of spliced (intron-containing) genes (90...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Between {{five and}} {{fourteen}} per cent of {{genes in the}} vertebrate genomes do overlap sharing some intronic and/or exonic sequence. It was observed that majority of these overlaps are not conserved among vertebrate lineages. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain <b>gene</b> <b>overlap</b> origination the evolutionary basis of these phenomenon are still not well understood. Here, we present results of the comparative analysis of several vertebrate genomes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> in the context of their evolution and mechanisms leading to their origin. Results Based on the presence and arrangement of human <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> orthologs in rodent and fish genomes we developed 15 theoretical scenarios of <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> evolution. Analysis of these theoretical scenarios and close examination of genomic sequences revealed new mechanisms leading to the overlaps evolution and confirmed that many of the vertebrate <b>gene</b> <b>overlaps</b> are not conserved.

40|$|Abstract Background Previously, gene {{normalization}} (GN) {{systems are}} mostly focused on disambiguation using contextual information. An effective gene mention tagger is deemed unnecessary because the subsequent steps will filter out false positives and high recall is sufficient. However, unlike similar tasks {{in the past}} BioCreative challenges, the BioCreative III GN task is particularly challenging {{because it is not}} species-specific. Required to process full-length articles, an ineffective gene mention tagger may produce a huge number of ambiguous false positives that overwhelm subsequent filtering steps while still missing many true positives. Results We present our GN system participated in the BioCreative III GN task. Our system applies a typical 2 -stage approach to GN but features a soft tagging gene mention tagger that generates a set of <b>overlapping</b> <b>gene</b> mention variants with a nearly perfect recall. The <b>overlapping</b> <b>gene</b> mention variants increase the chance of precise match in the dictionary and alleviate the need of disambiguation. Our GN system achieved a precision of 0. 9 (F-score 0. 63) on the BioCreative III GN test corpus with the silver annotation of 507 articles. Its TAP- k scores are competitive to the best results among all participants. Conclusions We show that despite the lack of clever disambiguation in our gene normalization system, effective soft tagging of gene mention variants can indeed contribute to performance in cross-species and full-text gene normalization. </p...|$|E

Coupling between members of nonoverlapping neighboring gene pairs is independent of operons and decreases to background levels as the distance increases beyond 10 kb.

In contrast, genes that are on opposing strands and transcribed in convergent directions are less transcriptionally coupled than the genome-wide background, suggesting a mutual inhibition mechanism.

40|$|Abstract Background Same-strand <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> {{may occur}} in frameshifts of one (phase 1) or two {{nucleotides}} (phase 2). In {{previous studies of}} bacterial genomes, long phase- 1 overlaps {{were found to be}} more numerous than long phase- 2 overlaps. This bias was explained by either genomic location or an unspecified selection advantage. Models that focused on the ability of the two genes to evolve independently did not predict this phase bias. Here, we propose that a purely compositional model explains the phase bias in a more parsimonious manner. Same-strand <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes</b> may arise through either a mutation at the termination codon of the upstream gene or a mutation at the initiation codon of the downstream gene. We hypothesized that given these two scenarios, the frequencies of initiation and termination codons in the two phases may determine the number for <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes.</b> Results We examined the frequencies of initiation- and termination-codons in the two phases, and found that termination codons do not significantly differ between the two phases, whereas initiation codons are more abundant in phase 1. We found that the primary factors explaining the phase inequality are the frequencies of amino acids whose codons may combine to form start codons in the two phases. We show that the frequencies of start codons in each of the two phases, and, hence, the potential for the creation of <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes,</b> are determined by a universal amino-acid frequency and species-specific codon usage, leading to a correlation between long phase- 1 overlaps and genomic GC content.

Therefore, it {{can be used as a}} null model of neutral evolution to test selection hypotheses concerning the evolution of <b>overlapping</b> <b>genes.</b> Reviewers This article was reviewed by Bill Martin, Itai Yanai, and Mikhail Gelfand. </p...|$|R
