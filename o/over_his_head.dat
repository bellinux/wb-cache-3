5|$|From {{the start}} of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a {{favorite}} subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1953, the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> concealing his features. The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.|$|E

French felt he was being punished for requesting to have Gus Mancuso as his catcher. In addition, Hartnett was forced to catch more games {{due to the lack}} of hitting from the other Cubs catchers. On August 28, 1939, he broke Ray Schalk's Major League record of 1,727 career games as a catcher. His record for longevity was surpassed by Al López during the 1945 season.|$|E

Worell suffered a concussion and missed six games, while Niedermayer was suspended for ten games – nine in the regular season, and New Jersey's first playoff game. After returning from his ban, Niedermayer's steady defensive contributions in the playoffs helped the Devils win their second Stanley Cup by defeating the Dallas Stars in six games in the 2000 Stanley Cup Final. While celebrating his day with the Cup, Niedermayer took the trophy to Fisher Peak, overlooking his hometown of Cranbrook and was famously pictured hoisting it <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground.

Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued.
