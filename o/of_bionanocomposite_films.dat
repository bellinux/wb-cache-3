30|$|The present work {{shows the}} role of MMT in {{physical}} properties and biodegradation <b>of</b> <b>bionanocomposites.</b> An increase in the Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was observed when 1 - 5 % (w/w) of MMT {{was added to the}} PVA/S/CMC. With the increase of the MMT concentration from 0 t o 5 %, the UTS increased 5 from 18.36 to 20.38 MPa, however, the strain to break (SB) decreased noticeably from 35.56 to 5.22 %. The MMT content significantly impacted on the rate of starch solubilistion. The decrease of the degradation rate observed in the final stage can be explained to the lower degradability of the MMT-PVA-CMC domains that remain in the material. After 8 – 72 h, the variation is almost negligible, nearly zero as demonstrated before. The reduction of the degradation rate is also influenced by the water uptake ability of these polymers. The water uptake ability of blends was decreased significantly as the MMT percentage increased from 0 to 5 % (W/W). At the level of 5 % (W/W) MMT, the films showed the lowest WAC% values and DED% decreased from 27.69 μg/ml h for the film without MMT to 18.95 μg/ml h for that containing 5 % MMT. Based on these results, the PVA:S:CMC:MMT <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> show better physicochemical properties than PVA:S:CMC films and they can be potentially replaced of PVA:S:CMC films.|$|R

The model drug, Ibuprofen, had a nominal drug loading of 50 mg/g of carrier. However, when the beads were subjected to external magnetic field, the drug loading behaviour was altered and the nominal drug loading was found to increase by 12 - 22 % of carrier.

30|$|This {{present study}} reports {{the role of}} {{cellulase}} enzyme in the degradation of nanocomposites. The sodium montmorillonite clay content significantly impacted on the rate of CMC solubilization. Biodegradation behavior of films depends {{on the content of}} nanoparticles, and the decrease of the degradation rate observed in the final stage can be explained to the lower degradability of the MMT-PVA-S-CMC domains that remain in the material. After 4 to 72 h, the variation is almost negligible, nearly zero, as no saccharides and other compounds leached to the solution, as demonstrated before. The reduction of the degradation rate is also influenced by the water uptake ability of these polymers. MMT (0 % to 5 % w/w film) could decrease the WAC% and DED% of PVA/S/CMC/MMT nanocomposite films compared to the PVA/S/CMC films. Considering these results, it seems that the PVA/S/CMC/MMT <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> show better physico-chemical properties than PVA/S/CMC films, and they can potentially replace PVA/S/CMC films.|$|R
40|$|Cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW) {{extracted}} from plant fibers exhibit remarkable properties {{that make them}} suitable {{for use in the}} development <b>of</b> <b>bionanocomposites.</b> CNW have demonstrated the capability to enhance the properties of a polymer matrix at low filler loading. In this study, poly (lactic acid) (PLA) bionanocomposites were prepared using the solution casting technique, by incorporating the PLA with the CNW obtained from an oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed no significant changes in the PLA peak positions, which indicates that incorporating the CNW into the PLA did not result in any significant changes in the chemical structure of the PLA. Thermogravimetric analysis, on the other hand, revealed that the bionanocomposites (PLA-CNW) had better thermal stability than the pure PLA. The tensile strength of PLA-CNW increased by 84 % with the addition of 3 parts of CNW per hundred resins (phr), and decreased thereafter. Moreover, a linear relationship was observed between the Young's modulus and CNW loading. Elongation at break, however, decreased with the addition of 1 -phr CNW, and remained constant with further addition. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that agglomeration of CNW occurred at 5 -phr loading, consistent with the tensile strength results.

The HNT/CB[6] hybrid was characterized by sev- eral methods (thermogravimetry, FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy) highlighting the influence of the supramolecular interactions on the composition, thermal behavior and morphology of the filler.

Water contact angle measurements, thermogravimetry and tensile tests evidenced the effects of the modified filler on the thermo-mechanical and wettability properties of pectin, which were correlated to the microscopic structure of the biocomposite film.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the functions of polymers and size of nanoparticles on the antibacterial activity <b>of</b> silver <b>bionanocomposites</b> (Ag BNCs). In this research, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were incorporated into biodegradable polymers that are chitosan, gelatin and both polymers via chemical reduction method in solvent in order to produce Ag BNCs. Silver nitrate and sodium borohydride were employed as a metal precursor and reducing agent respectively. On the other hand, chitosan and gelatin were added as a polymeric matrix and stabilizer. The antibacterial activity of different sizes of silver nanoparticles was investigated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the disk diffusion method using Mueller-Hinton Agar. Results The properties of Ag BNCs were studied as a function of the polymer weight ratio in relation to the use of chitosan and gelatin. The morphology of the Ag BNCs films and the distribution of the Ag NPs were also characterized. The diameters of the Ag NPs were measured and their size is less than 20 nm. The antibacterial trait <b>of</b> silver/chitosan/gelatin <b>bionanocomposites</b> was investigated. The silver ions released from the Ag BNCs and their antibacterial activities were scrutinized. The antibacterial activities of the Ag BNC films were examined against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (S. aureus and M. luteus) by diffusion method using Muller-Hinton agar. Conclusions The antibacterial activity of Ag NPs with size less than 20 nm was demonstrated and showed positive results against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The Ag NPs stabilized well in the polymers matrix. </p...|$|R

Protein structural changes {{and the nature of the}} physical interaction between lignin and zein were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and correlated with physical properties. Most relevant protein structural changes were observed at low AL concentration, where strong H-bondings between the functional groups of AL and the amino acids in zein induced a destructuring of inter- and intramolecular interactions in R-helix, β-sheet, and β-turn secondary structures. This destructuring allowed for an extensive protein conformational modification which, in turn, resulted in a strong improvement of the physical properties <b>of</b> the <b>bionanocomposite...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceBio-hybrid {{networks}} are designed {{based on the}} self-assembly of surface-engineered collagen-silica nanoparticles. Collagen triple helices can be confined {{on the surface of}} sulfonate-modified silica particles in a controlled manner. This gives rise to hybrid building blocks with well-defined diameters and surface potentials. Taking advantage of the self-assembling properties of collagen, collagen-silica {{networks are}} further built-up in solution. The structural and specific recognition properties of the collagen fibrils are well-preserved within the hybrid assembly. A combination of calorimetry, dynamic light scattering, zetametry and microscopy studies indicates that network formation occurs via a surface-mediated mechanism where pre-organization of the protein chains on the particle surface favors the fibrillogenesis process. These results enlighten the importance of the nano-bio interface on the formation and properties <b>of</b> self-assembled <b>bionanocomposites...</b>|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The development <b>of</b> three novel <b>bionanocomposite</b> scaffolds is presented in this dissertation. These scaffold materials are comprised of amine-functionalized nanomaterials crosslinked to the extracellular matrix (ECM) component of a porcine diaphragm tendon. On its own, the ECM is an ideal scaffold material with the structure and properties needed to support cellular attachment and tissue ingrowth. Nanomaterials were utilized to improve the physicochemical properties of the ECM while also influencing cellular behavior through a nanostructured surface. A full characterization <b>of</b> the <b>bionanocomposite</b> scaffolds was accomplished through a variety of common materials characterization techniques. Several biocompatibility studies were also performed including both in vitro studies using flow cytometry and bioreactors, as well as in vivo studies involving rodent and porcine models. The results of these studies indicated that the bionanocomposite scaffolds possessed appropriate properties for soft tissue repair applications. Future studies will be performed with the goal of further developing these materials into commercial products...|$|R
