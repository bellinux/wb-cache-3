5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E
