5|$|As a {{cost-saving}} move, {{effective on}} July 1, 1934, the Georgia Board <b>of</b> <b>Regents</b> transferred {{control of the}} relatively large Evening School of Commerce to the University of Georgia and moved the small civil engineering program at UGA to Tech. The move was controversial, and both students and faculty protested against it, fearing that the Board <b>of</b> <b>Regents</b> would remove other programs from Georgia Tech and reduce it to an engineering department of the University of Georgia. Brittain suggested {{that the lack of}} Georgia Tech alumni on the Board <b>of</b> <b>Regents</b> contributed to their decision. Despite the pressure, the Board <b>of</b> <b>Regents</b> held its ground. The Depression also {{had a significant impact on}} the athletic program, as most athletes were in the commerce school, and resulted in the elimination of athletic scholarships, which were replaced by a loan program. Plans for an industrial management department to replace and supersede the Evening School of Commerce were first made in fall 1934. The department was established in 1935, and evolved into Tech's College of Management.|$|E
