5|$|In 1534, Tabinshwehti and {{his deputy}} Bayinnaung, {{then a couple}} of 18-year-olds, {{launched}} their first military campaign against Hanthawaddy. It {{was the first of}} a series <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> by Toungoo that would engulf western and central mainland Southeast Asia for the next 80 years. In 1538–39, the upstart kingdom captured Hanthawaddy's capital Pegu (Bago), and in May 1541, Martaban (Mottama) and Moulmein (Mawlamyaing). Significantly, for the first time, the Burmese and the Siamese shared a common border in the upper-Tenasserim coast.|$|E

5|$|Stephen was crowned {{the first}} king of Hungary on either December 25, 1000, or January1, 1001. He {{consolidated}} his rule {{through a series}} <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> against semi-independent local rulers, including his maternal uncle, Gyula. He proved his kingdom's military strength when he repelled an invasion by Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1030. Marshlands, other natural obstacles, and barricades made of stone, earth or timber provided defense at the kingdom's borders. A wide zone known as gyepü was intentionally left uninhabited for defensive purposes along the frontiers. Most of the early medieval fortresses in Hungary were made of earth and timber.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} ended soon after, in {{an effective}} stalemate and a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth {{sit on the}} Armenian throne, but his nomination had {{to be approved by}} the Roman emperor. This conflict was the first direct confrontation between Parthia and the Romans since Crassus' disastrous expedition and Mark Antony's campaigns a century earlier, and would be the first of a long series <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> between Rome and Iranian powers over Armenia (see Roman–Persian Wars).|$|E
5|$|Warwick's war {{policies}} were more pragmatic than Somerset's, {{and they have}} earned him criticism for weakness. In 1550, he signed a peace treaty with France that agreed to withdrawal from Boulogne and recalled all English garrisons from Scotland. In 1551, Edward was betrothed to Elisabeth of Valois, King Henry II's daughter. In practice, he realised that England could no longer support the cost <b>of</b> <b>wars.</b> At home, he took measures to police local unrest. To forestall future rebellions, he kept permanent representatives of the crown in the localities, including lords lieutenant, who commanded military forces and reported back to central government.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number <b>of</b> <b>wars,</b> genocides, and human rights abuses {{since the end of the}} Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
5000|$|The Confederate States Secretary <b>of</b> <b>War</b> was {{a member}} of the Confederate States President's Cabinet during the American Civil <b>War.</b> The Secretary <b>of</b> <b>War</b> was head <b>of</b> the Confederate States Department <b>of</b> <b>War.</b> The {{position}} ended in May 1865 when the Confederacy crumbled during John C. Breckinridge's tenure of the office.The Secretary <b>of</b> <b>War,</b> a Confederate cabinet position, was the chief officer <b>of</b> the Confederate <b>War</b> Department. Answerable to President Jefferson Davis, the Secretary <b>of</b> <b>War</b> controlled all matters regarding the army and Indian tribes, and had the right to appoint as many clerks as it found necessary. This designation allowed the Secretary <b>of</b> <b>War</b> to create what eventually became the biggest department [...] in the Confederacy. Related to the war effort, the Secretary <b>of</b> <b>War</b> managed important aspects <b>of</b> the <b>war</b> effort like medical distribution, engineering devices (pontoon bridges), prisoners <b>of</b> <b>war</b> and fort cessions. During the war the Confederate Secretary <b>of</b> <b>War’s</b> report on the war effort became important information for the Confederate Congress and President Jefferson Davis. The President had the power to appoint and fire the Secretary <b>of</b> <b>War</b> for unnecessary, dishonest and inefficient work performance. The Secretary <b>of</b> <b>War</b> was also subject to impeachment proceedings from the Confederate Congress.|$|R

5|$|After {{succeeding}} {{his father}} in 997, Stephen had {{to fight for the}} throne against his relative, Koppány, who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors. He defeated Koppány mainly with the assistance of foreign knights, including Vecelin, Hont and Pázmány, but also with help from native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by Pope Sylvester II. In a series <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> against semi-independent tribes and chieftainsincluding the Black Hungarians and his uncle, Gyula the Youngerhe unified the Carpathian Basin. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, to withdraw from Hungary in 1030.|$|E
5|$|Among the Ainu, the otter {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger between humans and the creator. The sea otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of the sea otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.|$|E
5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, {{but much of}} the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls was only half their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E

5|$|By many general {{criteria}} of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages {{could very well}} be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including a long series <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 10th century, two powers had come to dominate the Balkans: the Byzantine Empire controlled the south of the peninsula and the coasts, and the Bulgarian Empire held the central and northern Balkans. The early decades of the century were dominated by Tsar Simeon(r. 893–927), who expanded his empire at Byzantium's expense in a series <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> and secured for himself recognition of his imperial title. Simeon's death in May 927 was soon followed by a rapprochement between the two powers, formalized with a treaty and a marriage alliance later that same year. Simeon's second son and successor, Peter I(r. 927–969), married Maria, the granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor Romanos I Lekapenos(r. 920–944), and his imperial title was recognized. An annual tribute (which the Byzantines termed a subsidy for Maria's upkeep, to save face) was agreed to be paid to the Bulgarian ruler in exchange for peace.|$|E
5|$|During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain pioneered European {{exploration}} of the globe, {{and in the process}} established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then, following union between England and Scotland in 1707, Great Britain, the dominant colonial power in North America. It then became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757.|$|E
