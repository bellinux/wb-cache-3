The duty of Bank Indonesia about observing bank arranged in Undang-Undang No. 23 year 1999 section 8 about Bank Indonesia which is changed become Undang-Undang No. 3 year 2004. This matter because role of the bank observation is very important thing {{in order to create}} and keep the health of banking system, beside that, the health of bank is just not become the owner’s importance and the organizer of that bank, but it is become the citizen and government importance and also for national economy. The target of this research is for knowing based on yuridis sosiologis, {{the implementation of}} Bank Indonesia’s duty in observing Bank Perkreditan Rakyat, because until now, there are many people do not know yet about how Bank Indonesia does the observation, moreover some circle who might be assumed knowing about the observation, in the reality they don’t know about that. So that, the observation that Bank Indonesia does just likely for their internal environmental and bank which is observed. Beside that, it is important knowing about what kind of efforts that Bank Indonesia does to handle bank which is have a problem. The method which is used in this research is by using yuridis sosiologis method, that is focused at research of field or analysis problems of law which is happened by seeing how the practical of Bank Indonesia’s duty in observing Bank Perkreditan Rakyat (BPR) at Bank Indonesia Malang’s regional activity. Based on this research, the result is there are two (2) kind of observation that Bank Indonesia does, that are on-site supervision and off-site supervision, beside that, there are public inspection (report inspection, local inspection) and special inspection (if there is a case and or data validity for). From the result of research at Bank Indonesia Malang, researcher found that there are Bank Perkreditan Rakyat which are not health, so that Bank Indonesia must do the effort construction and put Bank Perkreditan Rakyat on in special observation status, if by passing that process the health level of Bank Perkreditan Rakyat still does not increase, so that Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan (LPS) will announce the statement if Bank Perkreditan Rakyat has competent to become healthy or become liquidation.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an explanation for}} the <b>observation</b> that <b>banks</b> hold on average a capital ratio in excess of regulatory requirements. We use a functional approach to banking based on Diamond and Rajan (2001) to demonstrate that banks can use capital ratios as a strategic tool for renegotiating loans with borrowers. As capital ratios affect the ability of banks to collect loans in a nonmonotonic way, a bank may be forced to exceed capital requirements. Moreover, high capital ratios may also constrain the amount a banker can borrow from investors. Consequently, the size of the banking sector may shrink. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{orthodox}} assumption in {{the banking}} literature is that capital requirements are a binding constraint on banking behavior. This is {{in conflict with the}} empirical <b>observation</b> that <b>banks</b> hold a buffer of capital well in excess of the minimum requirements. This paper develops a model where capital is endogenously determined within a profit-maximizing equilibrium. Optimality involves balancing the reduction in expected costs associated with regulatory breach with the excess cost of financing from increasing capital. We demonstrate that when the equilibrium probability of regulatory breach is less than one-half, banks are expected to hold precautionary capital.

50|$|A {{significant}} {{result of the}} siege was the blow it gave Banks’s political ambitions. If Banks had overrun the position in May, he could then have taken command of Grant’s siege of Vicksburg as the ranking officer and appeared a hero. This would have redeemed his military reputation, and bolstered his political hopes for a presidential candidacy. Since Vicksburg fell before Port Hudson, Grant reaped the promotions and reputation for victory in the west, and eventually attained the White House, Banks’s cherished ambition. As it was, Banks {{had to settle for}} setting up cotton deals for his northeast constituency, and arrange political alliances for a new state government aligned with Union and Republican interests in mind. He was quite experienced in this kind of scheming, {{and in the absence of}} military opportunities, economic advantages beckoned. Banks’s armies had gathered $3 million worth of livestock and supplies while engaged in operations in western Louisiana in the spring of 1863. This bounty impressed Banks, and it was also estimated that vast stores of cotton and many Union sympathizers were waiting on the Red River in eastern Texas. In response to these <b>observations,</b> <b>Banks</b> produced his one third holding plan, the idea of re-opening trade with Europe, and diverting one third of the proceeds for the Federal Treasury. This economic bonanza would once again revive his political prospects, and justify the beginning of the Red River Campaign, a military expedition into eastern Texas, the next step in military operations in Louisiana.|$|R

We check that the actions and supersymmetries match between the D-instanton solution and the Yang-Mills instanton. Generalizing this result, we propose that any supergravity solution satisfying the ansatz corresponds to a (anti-) self-dual Yang-Mills configuration. Using this ansatz a family of identities for correlation functions in the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are derived. Comment: LaTeX, 19 pages, no figure, some typos correcte...|$|R

I distinguish between traditional banks and shadow banks {{based on their}} ability to raise debt and equity funding.

In line with empirical <b>observations,</b> shadow <b>bank</b> lending moves in the opposite direction to bank lending following monetary policy shocks, which mitigates aggregate credit responses.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to account for the <b>observation</b> that <b>banks</b> are both owners and clients of Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) which were created in Europe after the {{implementation}} of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). Using a duopoly model of two-sided markets, we show that banks' participation in MTFs crucially affects their objective function shape, pricing policy and profit. We show that when brokerage and trading activities are particularly important for banks' revenue compared to their profit as MTF operators, some market outcomes may emerge, whereby both MTFs include banks' interest as clients in their objective function. In these situations, although they earn negative profit as shareholders, banks benefit from lower fees as MTF's clients. This finally results in larger global revenue. This may explain why banks are at the origin of the creation of MTFs and why they maintain their stake despite negative profit. JEL codes: G 10 G 23 G 24 L 10 L 11 L 2...|$|R

40|$|<b>Observations</b> of side <b>bank</b> erosion in rivers {{are very}} important, {{as well as}} {{experimental}} andtheoretical investigations, to estimate the safety of river banks and the stability of river channels. Bank erosion data in low water courses in Teshio River and Uji River are mentioned as examples. Annual changes of the cross sectional shape at 43 km site in Uji River are analysed by usingdischarge data at Yodo Water Gauging Station, 4 km downstream. Bank erosion processes have a large spacial difference and some intermittency. In channelswhere bank erosion continues, erosion becomes rapid when the mean shear stress comes up near 20 N/m 2 while erosion stops when it becomes less than 10 N/m 2. The intermittency indicatesthat banks containing silt and clay have also the erosion cycle as same as in experiments: scour ofthe bank slope-collapse of the upper part-fluvial remove of the deposit part. Bank erosion isaccelerated by local bed scour near the <b>bank</b> slope. An <b>observation</b> of <b>bank</b> erosion process in a low water course {{has been carried out}} since June, 1980 near 43 km site in Uji River.

The receding rates correspond to the flood discharge and the total duration as a whole, butthe relation between them is not clear. The difference in the erosion rates seems not so large asthat in the discharge. One of this reason is that the shear stress does-not increase monotonouselyaccording to the discharge because of the channel conditions, such as backwater from the junction. Actually, {{at the peak of the}} flood in August, 1982, the shear stress became smaller than 7 N/m 2 inspite of the discharge of more than 1000 m 3 /sec, because of the decrease of the water surface slopedue to the backwater.
