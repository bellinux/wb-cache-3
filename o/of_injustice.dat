5|$|French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir {{provided}} a Marxist solution and an existentialist view {{on many of}} the questions of feminism with the publication of Le Deuxième Sexe (The Second Sex) in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense <b>of</b> <b>injustice.</b> Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination.|$|E
5|$|After {{nearly twenty}} years as a major, Berryman was {{promoted}} to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1935. Promotion to substantive rank, which carried the rank's pay as well as status, occurred on 1 July 1938, when he became Assistant Director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters. From December 1938 to April 1940 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the 3rd Division. The slow rate of promotion of regular officers in the inter-war years fostered a sense <b>of</b> <b>injustice</b> and frustration among officers with good war records who found themselves outranked by Militia officers who had enjoyed faster promotion.|$|E

5|$|In {{developing}} the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations. For instance, several character names are near-anagrams: Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is Edward Kelley, a 16th-century mystic, and Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, {{began as an}} anagram for Rasputin. Viewers are told that the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated {{that part of the}} legend, along with allusions to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible, to play on the themes <b>of</b> <b>injustice</b> done on those who were called witches.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand {{and the head}} of state. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Governor-General can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases <b>of</b> <b>injustice</b> and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials, and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a bill into law). The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.|$|E

5|$|Rajab {{traveled}} to India to study Political Science and History. He received his bachelor's degree but financial problems {{after his father}} became ill prevented him obtaining a master's degree. He returned to Bahrain to find employment. During his college years, he remained independent of political affiliations. According to Rajab, despite lacking {{a clear understanding of}} what constitutes a culture of human rights or knowledge of human rights standards and norms, he was active within the general Bahraini students union, speaking out against all forms <b>of</b> <b>injustice.</b> He also became involved in international campaigning on specific issues.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{attained}} {{its greatest}} geographic extent, but the attempted union with Russia {{could not have}} been achieved, as the systemic, cultural and religious incompatibilities between the two empires proved to be insurmountable. The territorial annexations and the ruthlessly conducted wars left a legacy <b>of</b> <b>injustice</b> suffered and desire for revenge {{on the part of the}} Russian ruling classes and people. The huge military effort weakened the Commonwealth and the painful consequences of the adventurous policies of the Vasa court and its allied magnates were soon to be felt.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{references}} {{a number}} of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice {{gives way to the}} epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters—who were also intrigued with subjects <b>of</b> <b>injustice,</b> war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, as is evident in Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (18181819) and Eugène Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.|$|E

5|$|Forensic entomology: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{forensic}} science book Collected Cases <b>of</b> <b>Injustice</b> Rectified published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer Song Ci in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology. In {{a murder case}} of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a sickle; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved. The local magistrate had the villagers assemble {{in the town square}} where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye. It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Pillai is released. He brings {{news that}} Jackson has been {{transferred}} back to England on Davison's recommendation. At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai {{and his men}} have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men {{to do it because}} of the famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him <b>of</b> <b>injustice.</b> Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington does not agree and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sunderalingam, overhears this and informs him; he prepares for battle.|$|E
5|$|Vasey held {{a series}} of staff postings in Australia and India. From 1928 to 1929 he {{attended}} the Staff College at Quetta, India, where Bernard Montgomery was an instructor. In October 1934 he was appointed as a brigade major once more. Following a brief stint as a GSO2 on the headquarters of the 1st Indian Division, his final posting in India was again as a brigade major, from April 1936 to March 1937. By November 1934 his substantive rank was that of captain, but while he held the brevet and local rank of major, he was not promoted to the substantive rank of major until 1 March 1935. Vasey was finally promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1937, after nearly 20 years as a major, although he was only promoted to the substantive rank on 2 November 1939. This was not unusual, and it fostered a sense <b>of</b> <b>injustice</b> and frustration among regular officers, who found themselves outranked by CMF officers who had enjoyed faster promotion.|$|E

25|$|Greenberg (1987) {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} organizational justice with regard to how an employee judges the behaviour of the organization and the employee's resulting attitude and behaviour.
