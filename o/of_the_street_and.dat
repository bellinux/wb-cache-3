5|$|Radio Network House was a 14-storey {{office tower}} {{constructed}} in 1986. The building was located at 155 Worcester Street, {{on the north}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> in the block between Manchester Street and Latimer Square. For its last twelve years Radio Network House was owned by Greg Hedges through his company Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd.|$|E
5|$|All around are pubs and brothels. The Earl of Cardigan tavern is on {{one side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) {{with a bunch of}} grapes on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is adulterating a hogshead of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of Matthew Prior who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord successively of both the Rummer and Grapes and the Rummer".|$|E
5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E

5|$|Homer and Bart are {{watching}} television {{when they are}} interrupted by Lisa playing her saxophone in her bedroom. Bart enters Lisa's bedroom and tries to grab the saxophone from her, but he inadvertently tosses it out the window. It lands in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> is run over by traffic and stomped on by Nelson Muntz. In a period of mourning, Lisa reveals she cannot remember ever not having that saxophone, so Homer recounts the instrument's origins.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{the council}} {{announced}} that Denmark Street would be redeveloped by the architectural firm ORMS {{as part of}} a major development in conjunction with the Crossrail construction work around Tottenham Court Road tube station and Centre Point. The proposed development includes the construction of an 800-seat subterranean performance venue. Numbers 1–6 and 17–21 Denmark Place, which run parallel along the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> the York and Clifton Mansions will be demolished, along with partial demolition of No. 21 Denmark Street.|$|E
5|$|When {{the search}} for {{survivors}} ended, authorities closed Salta Street. Engineers began checking the buildings at ground zero, trying to restore the original layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> demolishing unstable structures. Secretary of Public Works Omar Saab said that the two remaining buildings were beyond repair {{and had to be}} demolished. As a sign of respect, the demolition would not be carried out with explosives. Secretary of Housing Gustavo Leone estimated that the work would take nearly six months. People were allowed to enter their destroyed houses in small groups at a time, starting on August 9. Nearby streets began to be reopened on August 13.|$|E

25|$|Broad Street {{was further}} pedestrianised in 1995, {{and the bus}} {{services}} that previously used it were diverted onto the loop route around the town's central area, using St Mary's Butts, Friar Street, Market Place and Minster Street. The street was subsequently remodelled with a red-brick surface extending across the whole width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> with the inclusion of street trees, sculpture and licensed street traders.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the surface}} {{portions}} of the light rail line will fit into the street environment. Light-rail tracks will be laid on the surface within reserved lanes in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> cross street intersections at grade.

50|$|Years of war {{and neglect}} have taken a heavy toll on the city infrastructure, with no {{electricity}} or running water in large sectors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> avenues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city are dirt roads.|$|R
25|$|Since {{that time}} the city has seen rapid growth along its prime {{commercial}} corridor, West Broad Street. This occurred, perhaps not coincidentally, after the city rebuilt and replanted the street {{to make it more}} appealing. The reconstruction reestablished shade trees along the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> added street furniture and landscaping, in addition to placing utility lines underground. The sharp economic recession of the late-2000s brought most development to a halt.|$|E
25|$|James J. Haurer {{claimed that}} General George Washington, with his staff, {{not long after}} the battle of Trenton, passed through Allentown, up Water Street, which is now Lehigh Street.
