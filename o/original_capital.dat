5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was decreed that the <b>original</b> <b>capital</b> had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E

The <b>original</b> <b>capital</b> was in the principality of Anegondi on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today's Karnataka. It was later moved to nearby Vijayanagara on the river's southern banks during the reign of Bukka Raya I, because it was easier to defend against the Muslim armies persistently attacking it from the northern lands.|$|E

The Vijaynagar Empire successfully resisted Muslim invasions for centuries. But in 1565, the empire's armies suffered a massive and catastrophic defeat at the hands of an alliance of the Sultanates, and the capital was taken. The victorious armies then razed, depopulated and destroyed the city over several months.

25|$|Balhae (698–926), {{also known}} as Bohai, Pohai or Parhae, was a kingdom in present-day Manchuria and {{northern}} Korean peninsula. Balhae was established by former Goguryeo general Dae Jo-yeong in 698 after his defeat of the Tang Chinese at Tianmenling. Balhae's <b>original</b> <b>capital</b> was at Dongmo Mountain in modern Dunhua, Jilin Province. In 742 it {{was moved to the}} Central Capital in Helong, Jilin. It was moved to the Northern Capital in Ning'an, Heilongjiang in 755, to the Eastern Capital in Hunchun, Jilin in 785, and back to the Northern Capital in 794. According to a Chinese source, the kingdom had 100,000 households and a population of about 500,000. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Balhae culture was an amalgamation of Chinese, Korean, and indigenous cultures. In 926, the Khitan Liao dynasty conquered Balhae and established the autonomous kingdom of Dongdan ruled by the Liao crown prince Yelü Bei, which was soon absorbed into the Liao, while the southern parts of its territory, and a series of nobilities led by crown prince Dae Gwang-hyeon, were absorbed into Goryeo.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} based on Parrondo's history-dependent game model that has been put forward by P. Arena. Using discrete-time Markov chains and {{computer}} simulation, we analyse the parrondo's paradox when games ABC…ABC played periodically and the parameter M= 4. And then we find the volume of parameter space for which the paradox takes effect. Meanwhile we simulate the different sequences for mixing games A, B and C by computer and find an interesting phenomenon that when the total time of playing game A,B and C is an even number, the mixing game's payoff dependents on the <b>original</b> <b>capital's</b> parity...|$|R
