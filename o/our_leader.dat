Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained something of {{the essence of the}} Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E

[...] When Buchanan {{dropped out of the}} Republican primary race, Rothbard then shifted his interest and support to Ross Perot, [...] who Rothbard wrote had [...] "brought an excitement, a verve, a sense of dynamics and of open possibilities to what had threatened to be a dreary race." [...] Rothbard ultimately supported George Bush over Bill Clinton in the 1992 election.|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2012, Anderson re-signed {{with the}} Saint John Mill Rats. Ian McCarthy said, [...] "He's an elite player {{at any level}} and is <b>our</b> <b>leader</b> in our pursuit of championship." [...] The general manager also commented on Anderson, {{saying that he was}} their {{franchise}} player. Anderson also joined Saint John for training camp. David Cooper would be named head coach for the Mill Rats for the 2012–13 NBL Canada season. Anderson made his regular season debut on November 2, 2012, putting up 24 points, 7 assists, and 5 rebounds vs. the Summerside Storm. In his following appearance, he recorded a double-double of 24 points and 12 rebounds as the Mill Rats defeated the Montreal Jazz. Anderson had another notable performance on January 13, 2013, with 28 points and 10 rebounds vs. the Moncton Miracles. In another game against the Miracles on January 24, he scored 20 points, recorded 14 assists, and grabbed 7 rebounds. In his next contest, in a victory over the Jazz, Anderson scored 35 points. He followed up by notching a career-best 43 points on January 30, 2013, vs. the Miracles. However, he left the Mill Rats in mid-February and did not take part in the NBL Canada playoffs after signing a contract with El Jaish of the Qatari Basketball League. Anderson capped his season in the Canadian league averaging 21.1 points, 4.4 rebounds, 7.1 assists, and two steals per game. With El Jaish, he reached the finals of the Emirates Cup and the semifinals of the Qatar Cup. Anderson later remarked that Qatar was one of his favorite countries to live in, as well as Cyprus.|$|E

500|$|... "The Only One" [...] was {{originally}} called [...] "Tuna Afternoon" [...] and lyrically delves on Lee's experiences with close-mindedness and {{people around her}} who seemed lost {{in a world in}} which they did not belong. It starts with a piano introduction similar to that of the band's Fallen era and songs by Sarah McLachlan. In the song, Lee [...] "decries human guidance" [...] with the chorus lines, [...] "All our lives / We've been waiting / For someone to call <b>our</b> <b>leader</b> / All your lies / I'm not believing / Heaven shine a light down on me". [...] "Your Star" [...] was motivated by Lee's loneliness during the band's tour in support of Fallen. She was inspired to write the chorus in Lisbon when she looked at the night sky and could see no stars. Other inspiration came from the works of [...] Pantera. Guitars and piano provide the track's instrumentation; while Lee sings about God according to Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone. [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] was co-written by guitarist John LeCompt; it describes Lee's night-time writing process, which is showcased in the opening line, [...] "I can feel the night beginning / Separate me from the living". It contains [...] "power chords", elements of electronica, and abrasive guitars. [...] "Good Enough" [...] was solely written by Lee, and was placed at the end of the album for symbolizing its themes and those of the singer's life. While featuring a string section, it resembles Tori Amos' and Sarah McLachlan's songs. Inspired by her then-future husband Josh Hartzler, [...] "Good Enough" [...] has a similar composition to [...] "My Immortal" [...] because of their piano sounds.|$|E

Holloway, there {{was a sort of}} 'Who dat?' reaction. James Lemuel Holloway Jr. has not been a dashing, spectacular figure. He has, however, compiled a steady record of uncanny ability as an organizer which has overshadowed a fine combat record in two world wars." ...|$|E

He knew what he had to do, when to do it, and that's what makes him one of the greatest players, ever." [...] Teammate Alexander Ovechkin added, [...] "He's <b>our</b> <b>leader...</b> He's our best guy in the locker room. He showed it. He's our best guy.

2500|$|On 23 September 2007, Liberal Party {{national}} director Jamie Carroll sparked controversy when, during discussions about whether francophone Quebecers should be hired {{in order to}} appeal to francophone voters, he commented: [...] "Do {{we also have to}} hire people from the Chinese community to represent the Chinese community?" [...] Carroll argued that the comment was taken out of context, but it nevertheless raised the hackles of many Liberals in Quebec, prompting calls from MPs Pablo Rodriguez and Liza Frulla for Carroll to be fired. Stéphane Dion stood by Carroll's version of events and rejected calls for Carroll's dismissal. On 10 October, a Liberal press release announced Carroll's resignation and commended him for his [...] "loyalty to <b>our</b> <b>leader</b> and to our party".|$|E

2500|$|After being nominated, Palin's {{religious}} views came under increasing scrutiny in the media.

2500|$|Murphy also {{referred}} {{to the history of}} section 41 in the Convention Debates, in particular the records of 3 March 1898, where Edmund Barton proposed that the clause which would become section 41 should explicitly apply only to electors who had the right to vote at state level [...] "at the establishment of the Commonwealth or afterwards [...] under the law in force in any state at the establishment of the Commonwealth." [...] But Barton faced opposition. Alexander Peacock expressed concern that if Victoria followed South Australia in granting women's suffrage, but did so after Federation, then Barton's clause would not protect their rights federally. The President of the Convention, Charles Kingston, was also sceptical. Frederick Holder said that [...] "If the clause is altered as <b>our</b> <b>leader</b> wishes it to be altered, the right of the state Parliaments to expand the franchise would cease on the establishment of the Commonwealth, and the federal action in reference to the franchise might not be taken for some years." [...] Barton's proposal was defeated, and the broader wording remained, and so in Murphy's view, the history of section 41 demanded that it not be regarded as a transitional provision.|$|E
2500|$|Konstanty {{became the}} second Phillie {{to win the}} Most Valuable Player Award, after Chuck Klein (1932); his 22 saves and 16 wins by a {{reliever}} were both National League records at the time. Ennis led the team in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in, while Roberts' 20 wins in 1950 were the beginning of six consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins for the pitcher. As the catcher, Seminick provided veteran leadership for the team and helped guide the young pitching staff. Roberts said of Seminick,"If you had to pick {{a guy in the}} clubhouse who was <b>our</b> <b>leader</b> that year, it would be Andy. He always played hard, and that was his best year by far." [...] Six players have since been elected members of the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame: outfielder Ashburn; pitchers Roberts, Konstanty, Simmons; and infielders Hamner and Jones. National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum inductees from the Whiz Kids include Roberts, who entered the Hall in 1976, and Ashburn, elected in 1995. The [...] "Whiz Kids" [...] name endured for the Phillies franchise into the 1980s, when the 1983 Philadelphia Phillies, a team of veteran players who faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series that season, were coined the [...] "Wheeze Kids".|$|E
2500|$|The two actual {{founders of}} the Bond party were a German man named Borckenhagen who lived in Bloemfontein, and an Afrikaner named Reitz, who {{afterwards}} became the state secretary of the Transvaal. There are two recorded interview that show the true aims of the {{founders of the}} Bond from the very beginning. One occurred between Borckenhagen and Cecil Rhodes, the other between Reitz and T. Schreiner, whose brother later became prime minister of Cape Colony. In the first interview, Borckenhagen remarked to Rhodes: [...] "We want a united Africa," [...] and Rhodes replied: [...] "So do I". Mr Borckenhagen then continued: [...] "There is nothing in the way; we will take you as <b>our</b> <b>leader.</b> There is only one small thing: we must, of course, be independent of the rest of the world." [...] Rhodes replied: [...] "You take me either for a rogue or a fool. I should be a rogue to forfeit all my history and my traditions; and I should be a fool, because I should be hated by my own countrymen and mistrusted by yours." [...] But as Rhodes said in Cape Town in 1898, [...] "the only chance of a true union is the overshadowing protection of a supreme power, and any German, Frenchman, or Russian would tell you that the best and most liberal power is that over which Her Majesty reigns." ...|$|E
