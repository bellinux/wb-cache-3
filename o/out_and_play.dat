25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are so excited to finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been lucky enough to have some amazing support shows... but to be able to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E

[...] "That {{was a really}} tough game," [...] he said, [...] "and full credit to Canada, but we can't beat top teams in the world when we only shoot at 34%, that was the key statistic." [...] Merritt, who had a British accent, {{said that she had}} [...] "the utmost respect for Canada. They're a great team, but we'll refocus on the game tomorrow and go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> like we know we can, the Australian way." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the 2008 season, Hester stated that he would not attend the Bears' summer camp unless the team offered him a new contract. He further voiced his displeasure with his current contract in a phone interview with the Chicago Tribune, commenting, [...] "I can’t go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> this year making $445,000. Come on, man." [...] Adam Schefter believed that the Bears were puzzled over how Hester should be classified (as a wide receiver or a return specialist of such a star caliber), and be offered a contract accordingly. After receiving a $30,000 fine for not attending two days of training, Hester returned to the team's camp. The team later offered him a new four-year contract extension, worth over $40 million.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it in recent times. Gilmour has said the album was [...] "a load of rubbish. We were at a real down point ... I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period" [...] and [...] "a good idea but it was dreadful... Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it." [...] Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said [...] "If somebody said to me now – right – here's a million pounds, go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking." [...] Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone gave Atom Heart Mother a negative review, ultimately stating [...] "if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven't found them here." ...|$|E

The performance is {{featured on the}} DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, {{as well as the}} documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with [...] "Come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play,</b> make up the rules" [...] instead of the eventual opening of [...] "Load up on guns, bring your friends." [...] A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on [...] A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary , filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth.|$|E

500|$|Bryan Carlstrom {{produced}} their self-titled debut. [...] He had engineered albums by multi-platinum outfits The Offspring and Alice in Chains {{as well as}} producing labelmates Stavesacre [...] [...] Schwab drew upon personal struggles he {{was experiencing}} {{at the time to}} write meaningful lyrics. Sonny Sandoval, lead singer of nu metal group P.O.D., appeared as a guest performer. The album was released in June 1998 and was well received. It sold over 50,000 copies to date and gained mainstream exposure on MTV shows Road Rules and The Real World. Project 86 was observed by Allmusic to be the [...] "most daring album at the time for its genre". The success of their debut made Project 86 a top seller for BEC/Tooth and Nail. [...] The band embarked on a pioneering tour called [...] "The Warriors Come <b>Out</b> <b>and</b> <b>Play</b> Tour" [...] in May 1999 with friends P.O.D. and Blindside as the middle slot, which drew crowds of 600-1000 across the nation.|$|E
500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E
500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> them your songs {{like the first time}} you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business". The band released a greatest hits collection entitled A-Sides on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously-unreleased [...] "Bleed Together," [...] which had been recorded during the Down on the Upside recording sessions.|$|E

500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{integrated}} the band's typical punk and funk style, but {{moved away}} from this with more melodically driven songs. Tracks like [...] "The Righteous and the Wicked", [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Funky Monks" [...] still incorporated use of heavy metal guitar riffs, but differed from Mother's Milk in that they contained less distortion. Flea, who had centered his bass playing around the slapping technique, downplayed on this {{in favor of more}} traditional and melodic bass lines. He also adopted a minimalist, [...] "less is more" [...] philosophy: [...] "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good." [...] Kiedis felt that the album would expand the Chili Peppers' musical horizons, and that it was a departure from their previous material. One of Blood Sugar Sex Magiks more melodic tracks, [...] "Breaking the Girl", was written about Kiedis' constantly shifting relationships. He feared that he was following in his father's footsteps and simply becoming a womanizer, rather than establishing stable and long-term relationships: [...] "...As exciting and temporarily fulfilling as this constant influx of interesting and beautiful girls can be, {{at the end of the}} day, that shit is lonely and you're left with nothing." [...] The track also featured a bridge in the middle, consisting of percussion instruments salvaged from a garbage dump.|$|E

2500|$|On November 9, 1985, {{the band}} {{released}} its fourth studio album, Come <b>Out</b> <b>and</b> <b>Play,</b> produced by Dieter Dierks. It {{was not nearly}} as successful as its predecessor, although it did earn the band a gold album for sales of 500,000 copies. Some speculate that the failure was partly due to MTV choosing not to air the video for [...] "Be Chrool to Your Scuel" [...] {{on the grounds that it}} was graphically offensive. The song featured such guests as Alice Cooper (who also stars in the video), Brian Setzer, Clarence Clemons and Billy Joel. The tour supporting the album was a near fiasco, with low attendance and many cancelled dates. Not even Atlantic's re-release of a remixed Under the Blade helped the band recover its popularity. Come <b>Out</b> <b>and</b> <b>Play</b> was one of the first CDs to go out of print.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the main}} {{motivation}} for his decision, Lukather said: When Dave [...] retired that was REAL {{hard for me}} 'cause we started the band together. Hell, it's 35 years if you count High School where the core all met. When Mike [...] fell ill and had to leave that was it for me. If there isn't Paich {{or at least one}} Porcaro how can we even call it Toto? … Honestly, I have just had enough. This is NOT a break. It is over.

2500|$|... "It's really {{important}} if you're {{going to remain}} a valid band that you play your new stuff. Otherwise you become a parody of what you started out doing. But it's impossible [...] Back in the early 80s you could probably do it, but now with YouTube and downloading, the songs would all be out before the album was out. We did Somewhere Back in Time and that dealt with the 80s, and the time before that we did A Matter of Life and Death, just the one album. You can't go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> the greatest hits every time – it's important to play the newer songs because we really believe in them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often {{recognized}} for their live performances, the band generally does not perform in larger venues such as arenas and amphitheaters {{outside of the}} UK. Instead, they regularly play smaller venues such as House of Blues, as was their intention from the start. Myles Kennedy {{said in an interview}} with Artistdirect, [...] "We're definitely a live band. That's what it's all about for us. We make records so we can go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> for people." [...] The band has been joined on stage by several surprise guests, including Slash, Paul Reed Smith, Wolfgang Van Halen, and Eric Friedman, and several other notable musicians, such as Eddie Van Halen, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones, have been reported to have attended an Alter Bridge concert. Alter Bridge's live performances are generally praised.|$|E
