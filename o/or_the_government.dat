5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, {{should be a}} priority of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working on}} plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward push—on March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was ready to move.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E

25|$|Sedition, {{which is}} {{committed}} when spoken or written words are published with seditious intent, {{was a criminal}} offence under English common law. It emerged in an era where political violence threatened the stability of governments. The Star Chamber, {{in the case of}} De Libellis Famosis (1572), defined seditious libel (that is, sedition in a printed form) as the criticism of public persons <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> and established it as a crime. The crime of sedition was premised on the need to maintain respect for the government and its agents, for criticism of public persons <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> undermines respect for public authorities. Even though the Star Chamber was later dissolved, seditious libel had become established as a common law offence.|$|E

25|$|From time to time, boards or {{panels are}} commissioned, {{either by the}} federal {{government}} <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of one of the provinces, to conduct hearings into the public’s views on matters of policy.

25|$|Bangkok's multi-faceted sights, attractions {{and city}} life appeal to diverse groups of tourists. Royal palaces and temples {{as well as}} several museums {{constitute}} its major historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. The city is also famous for its dynamic nightlife. Although Bangkok's sex tourism scene is well known to foreigners, it is usually not openly acknowledged by locals <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Académie {{consists}} of forty members, known as immortels (immortals). New members are {{elected by the}} members of the Académie itself. Académicians hold office for life, but they may be removed for misconduct.

According to an NBC News report, the rebels acquired nearly two dozen surface-to-air missiles, which were delivered to them via neighbouring Turkey. However, a rebel FSA spokesman denied the report. CNN {{reported that}} rebels were using a school as a prison, housing captured pro-government milita members. United Nations observers in the area saw Syrian Air Force jets bombing rebel held districts on 1 August.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war in}} August 1914 initially served to quiet the prevalent social and political protests, focusing hostilities against a common external enemy, but this patriotic unity did not last long. As the war dragged on inconclusively, war-weariness gradually took its toll. More important, though, was a deeper fragility: although many ordinary Russians joined anti-German demonstrations {{in the first few}} weeks of the war, the most widespread reaction appears to have been skepticism and fatalism. Hostility toward the Kaiser and the desire to defend their land and their lives did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for the Tsar <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|Officially, {{prostitution}} {{is illegal}} in mainland China. The government of China has vacillated, however, in its legal treatment of prostitutes themselves, treating them sometimes as criminals and sometimes as behaving with misconduct. Since the reemergence of prostitution in the 1980s, government authorities have responded by first using the legal system, that is, the daily operations of institutions like courts and police. Second, they {{have relied on}} police-led campaigns, clearly delineated periods of intense public activity, {{as a form of}} social discipline. Despite lobbying by international NGOs and overseas commentators, there is not much support for legalisation of the sex sector by the public, social organizations <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of the PRC.|$|E

25|$|India needs {{trillions of}} dollars to build its infrastructure, hospitals, housing and schools for its growing population. The Indian economy is small, with limited surplus capital. The {{government}} is already operating on budget deficits. It is simply not possible for Indian investors <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> to fund this expansion, job creation and growth at the rate India needs. Global investment capital through FDI is necessary. Beyond capital, the Indian retail industry needs knowledge and global integration. Global retail leaders, {{some of which are}} partly owned by people of Indian origin, can bring this knowledge. Global integration can potentially open export markets for Indian farmers and producers. Walmart, for example, expects to source and export some $1 billion worth of goods from India every year, since it came into Indian wholesale retail market.|$|E
25|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} are {{regulated by the}} Constitution. The {{elections are}} held after the four-year term of the previous assembly has expired, but can also be held before that if the Assembly dismisses the Government <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> resigns and no majority can be reached to elect new Government. Elections are called by the President of Serbia 90 days {{before the end of}} the term of office of the National Assembly, so that elections are finished within the following 60 days. Elections are closed party-list proportional. The whole country is one electoral district. 250 seats are than distributed between the lists using d'Hondt method. There is a minimum voting threshold of 5%, so that only the party lists which get more than 5% of the votes are awarded the seats. There is no threshold for the ethnic minority lists.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{freshwater}} {{supply is}} a metric {{often used in}} conjunction when evaluating water scarcity. This metric is informative because it can describe the total available water resource each country contains. By knowing the total available water source, an idea can be gained about whether a country is prone to experiencing physical water scarcity. This metric has its faults {{in that it is}} an average; precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year and annual renewable water resources vary from year to year. This metric also does not describe the accessibility of water to individuals, households, industries, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> Lastly, as this metric is a description of a whole country, it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity. Canada and Brazil both have very high levels of available water supply, but still experience various water related problems.|$|E
