500|$|<b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North {{has been}} invoked on several {{occasions}} as a comparison when similar drama programmes have been screened on British television. The year following <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the Norths broadcast, Tony Marchant's drama serial Holding On was promoted by the BBC as being an [...] "Our Friends in the South," [...] after Marchant made the comparison when discussing it with executives. The 2001 BBC Two drama serial In a Land of Plenty was previewed by The Observer newspaper as being [...] "the most ambitious television drama since <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North." [...] The writer Paula Milne drew inspiration from <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North for her own White Heat (2012); she felt that <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> in the North had been too centred on white, male, heterosexual characters, and she deliberately wanted to counter that focus.|$|R

[...] What were once entire neighborhoods are now covered by grass and trees, part of an extensive area of parkland called the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. In East Grand Forks, this transformation is especially visible. One former neighborhood is now a large campground, the center of what is now known as the Red River State Recreation Area. The cities of today are significantly different from their pre-flood state, but many residents are pleased with this, seeing it as fulfillment of President Bill Clinton's promise that the cities would [...] "rebuild stronger and better than ever."

500|$|On 17 June 1947, {{serialisation}} of {{the story}} paused after Hergé disappeared.

Tintin is no longer me... my Boy Scout spirit has been badly damaged." [...] He followed this with a holiday to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland with Germaine. Editors of Tintin magazine posted a sarcastic notice in the magazine stating that [...] "Our friend Hergé is in need of a rest. Oh, don't worry, he's fine. But in refusing to marshal his forces to bring you a new episode of The Temple of the Sun each week, <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> is a little over-worked." [...] He disappeared again in early 1948, this time for six weeks, again to Gland, but according to biographer Pierre Assouline he was accompanied by a young, married woman, with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Angered by his absence, the editorial board decided to command other artists and writers to continue the story, a threat which made Hergé return to work.|$|E
