40|$|Vehicles {{emissions}} {{are one of}} the main contributors to the air pollution in Hong Kong. Environmental Protection Department (HKEPD) has <b>implemented</b> <b>measures</b> to control emissions from all vehicles, inc uding petrol, diesel and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles. This paper presents the progress of one of our control measures, the implementation of stringent emission standards and fuel specifications for the reduction of vehicular emissions. From the phasing-out of leaded petrol in early 90 s to the latest implementation of Euro III emissions standards and the application of cleaner unleaded petrol, ultra low sulphur diesel and LPG, we have worked closely with the trade. Taking this <b>measure</b> with all <b>other</b> <b>implemented</b> control <b>measures,</b> we are targeting to reduce the particulate and nitrogen oxides emissions from vehicles by about 80 % and 30 % respectively by 2005...|$|R
30|$|We {{suggest the}} {{following}} alternative {{explanations for the}} differences encountered between the study areas: First, adaptation behaviour may depend on the social and institutional background. Second, the provision of risk information is likely to trigger a focus on relevant adaptation measures. Third, dealing with risks and local knowledge can vary between countries and therefore influence behaviour. Finally, adaptive behaviour can depend {{on the existence of}} and reliance on public adaptation. However, <b>other</b> <b>implemented</b> adaptation <b>measures</b> did not significantly differ between countries, indicating that an implementation of these measures does not depend on background, risk information, general dealing with risks or public adaptation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Mosquitoes are vectors {{for many}} {{diseases}} such as malaria. Insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying of insecticides are the principal malaria vector control tools used to prevent malaria in the tropics. Other interventions aim at reducing man-vector contact. For example, house screening provides additive or synergistic effects to <b>other</b> <b>implemented</b> <b>measures.</b> We used commercial screen materials made of polyester, polyethylene or polypropylene to design novel mosquito screens that provide remarkable additional benefits to those commonly used in house screening. The novel design {{is based on a}} double screen setup made of a screen with 3 D geometric structures parallel to a commercial mosquito screen creating a trap between the two screens. Owing to the design of the 3 D screen, mosquitoes can penetrate the 3 D screen from one side but cannot return through the other side, making it a unidirectional mosquito screen. Therefore, the mosquitoes are trapped inside the double screen system. The permissiveness of both sides of the 3 D screens for mosquitoes to pass through was tested in a wind tunnel using the insectary strain of Anopheles stephensi. Results Among twenty-five tested 3 D screen designs, three designs from the cone, prism, or cylinder design groups were the most efficient in acting as unidirectional mosquito screens. The three cone-, prism-, and cylinder-based screens allowed, on average, 92, 75 and 64 % of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes released into the wind tunnel to penetrate the permissive side and 0, 0 and 6 % of mosquitoes to escape through the non-permissive side, respectively. Conclusions A cone-based 3 D screen fulfilled the study objective. It allowed capturing 92 % of mosquitoes within the double screen setup inside the wind tunnel and blocked 100 % from escaping. Thus, the cone-based screen effectively acted as a unidirectional mosquito screen. This 3 D screen-based trap design could therefore be used in house screening as a means of avoiding infective bites and reducing mosquito population size...|$|R

Traffic congestion here, where the buses mingle with private vehicles, sometimes causes service delays and is seen by some as the main weakness in the Transitway system. The Transit Committee planned {{to reduce the number}} of buses travelling on Albert and Slater streets by 30% if the extension of the light-rail was <b>implemented.</b> <b>Other</b> <b>measures</b> may be <b>implemented</b> to avoid traffic problems despite the cancellation of the initial O-Train extension downtown.|$|R

The latter concern had its origin in Darden's actions as Governor of Virginia, where he recommended barring students at the College of William and Mary from living in fraternity or sorority houses {{on the grounds that it}} was [...] "undemocratic" [...] and placed undue financial burden on parents.

The empirical part analyses opinions of students of a selected state secondary vocational school. The main method employed in the empirical part is a questionnaire research addressing second and third grade students of the Secondary Vocational School for Public Catering in Poděbrady. The goal of the research is to gather information as to how the students are influenced by the teacher´s gender and age, motivation, communication skills, character and employed teaching methods. The respective results are meant to assist the vocational training teachers in evaluating their work and, if appropriate, in <b>implementing</b> <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at a more effective teaching in the vocational context...|$|R

He rescinded {{the property tax}} law, which had exempted immigrants from paying taxes for tenyears. He further increased tariffs on goods entering Mexico from the United States, causing their prices to rise. The 1830s laws also brought settlement contracts under federal rather than state control. Colonies {{that did not have}} at least 150inhabitants would be canceled. Among the affected colonies were the Nashville Company run by Sterling C. Robertson and the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company, run by David G. Burnet, Lorenzo de Zavala and Joseph Vehlein. Finally, he prohibited further immigration to Texas from the United States, although Anglos would still be welcome in other parts of Mexico. The ban and other measures did not stop U.S. citizens from migrating illegally to Texas by the thousands. By 1834, it was estimated that over 30,000Anglos lived in Texas, compared to only 7,800Mexicans.|$|R

Directly after {{the attacks on the}} World Trade Centre, the 22 nd conference of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was hold (in November 2001). During this conference decisions are made to develop new measures {{to ensure the safety of}} ships, ports and terminals. Among <b>other</b> things the <b>implemented</b> <b>measures</b> contain the development of the International Ship and Port facilities Security code (ISPS code). This ISPS code uses three security levels. In case of a higher risk on a security incident the level will scaled up to an higher level. In that case port facilities must take extra security measures to resist terroristic attacks. Measures that will take at the entrances of the terminal could lead to extra congestion on the road network in the Port of Rotterdam. In this research the effects of anti terroristic measures that must be taken in case of a raised terroristic threat are studied with the following main research question: What are the effects of the anti terroristic measures on the traffic situation on the road network around the Port of Rotterdam and how can the negative effects he minimized?TILTransport, Infrastructure and LogisticsDelft University of Technolog...|$|R

40|$|Many jurisdictions have {{introduced}} other non-custodial measures {{to decrease the}} usage of fines, nevertheless they are still a popular sanction. Although the majority of offenders fined pay their fine, some are {{unable or unwilling to}} do so and as a consequence can be imprisoned. At a time when prisons are overcrowded and short term sentences are a substantial administrative endeavour, with little to no re-socializing potential, many jurisdictions have <b>implemented</b> <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> to prevent imprisonment for fine default such as unpaid work. Both Austria and Scotland have implemented the possibility of unpaid work as an alternative to imprisonment for fine default.

This article examines the experience of unpaid work as an alternative to imprisonment for fine default in these two contrasting jurisdictions and discusses the key differences between them.
