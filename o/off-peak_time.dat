2500|$|MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American {{cable and}} {{satellite}} television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as [...] "video jockeys" [...] (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, particularly {{high school and college}} students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in <b>off-peak</b> <b>time</b> periods. It has also become involved in promoting left-wing political issues and progressive social causes. The network received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.|$|E

50|$|A {{thermal energy}} storage tank is a {{naturally}} stratified thermal accumulator that allows the storage of chilled water produced during <b>off-peak</b> <b>time,</b> to use this energy later during on-peak time to chill the turbine inlet air and increment its power output. A {{thermal energy storage}} tank reduces operational cost and refrigerant plant capacity. One advantage is the production of chilled water when demand is low, using the excess of power generation, which usually coincides with the night, when ambient temperature is low and chillers have better performance. Another advantage is {{the reduction of the}} chilling plant capacity and operational cost in comparison with an on-line chilling system, which produce delays during periods of low demand.|$|E

50|$|For {{community}} applications, UltraBattery {{can be used}} as back-up in {{the event}} of grid outage (see Section 5.1) and for peak shaving. Also known as peak lopping, peak shaving is the ability to charge batteries during <b>off-peak</b> <b>time,</b> and use the power from the batteries during peak times to avoid higher charges for electricity. Another example of a community application is a 300 kW smart grid demonstration system set up by Furukawa Battery in the Maeda Area in Kitakyushu, Japan. This load-levelling application uses 336 UltraBattery cells (1000 Ah, 2 volts). The company has also installed two smart grid demonstrations of UltraBattery peak shifting technology at Kitakyushu Museum of Natural History & Human History.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the success}} with Fox Broadcasting Company, several other {{companies}} started {{to enter the}} fray in the 1990s to become the fifth commercial broadcast network that would allow a station to brand itself better to stand out amongst {{the increasing number of}} channels particularly cable. Chris-Craft Industries and Warner Bros. Television Distribution (syndication arm) jointly launched the Prime Time Entertainment Network in September 1993, a consortium created in attempt at creating a new [...] "fifth network". PTEN, Spelling Premiere Network, Family Network and proposed WB Network & Paramount Network were being shopped in January 1994 against syndicated blocks the Disney Afternoon and Universal's [...] "Action Pack". Spelling Premiere had launched in August 1994. All American Television considered as of November 1994 of launching a first run movie network with 22 movies. Chris-Craft subsidiary United Television then partnered with Paramount (by then recently merged with Viacom) to create the United Paramount Network (UPN), which launched in January 1995. Warner Bros. parent Time Warner then formed a partnership with the Tribune Company to create The WB, which also launched {{less than a week after}} UPN made its debut. Concurrently, United left PTEN's parent, the Prime Time Consortium, to focus on UPN, leaving PTEN as primarily a syndicator of its remaining programs; the service shared affiliations with its respective parents' own network ventures (in some cases, resulting in PTEN's programming airing in <b>off-peak</b> <b>time</b> slots) until it finally folded in September 1997.|$|E

40|$|Presently, {{the usage}} of {{electricity}} is not balanced between day and night. High demand from industrial, commercial and even residential at day time contributed to extra power generation by Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB).

This study proposes dual tariff electricity for domestic usage. Tariff will be divided into two which is peak time and <b>off-peak</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Off-peak</b> <b>time</b> will have lower tariff compare to peak time. Today, domestic area is using the typical energy meter, which only applicable for single tariff. To apply dual tariff, a new meter should be used; Smart Meter for Dual Tariff.
