2500|$|Tracking dye; as {{proteins}} and nucleic acids are mostly colorless, their {{progress through the}} gel during electrophoresis cannot be easily followed. Anionic dyes of a known electrophoretic mobility are therefore usually included in the PAGE sample buffer. A very common tracking dye is Bromophenol blue (BPB, 3',3",5',5" [...] tetrabromophenolsulfonphthalein). This dye is coloured at alkali and neutral pH and is a small negatively charged molecule that moves towards the anode. Being a highly mobile molecule it moves ahead of most proteins. As it reaches the anodic end of the electrophoresis medium electrophoresis is stopped. It can weakly bind to some {{proteins and}} impart a blue colour.

40|$|Background: Dental erosion is a {{risk factor}} for dental health, {{introduced}} by today's lifestyle. Topical fluoride applications in the form of varnishes and gel may lead to deposition of fluoride on enamel. Purpose: This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the effect of two fluoride varnishes and one fluoride gel on the dissolution of bovine enamel by acids. Methods: Enamel samples (72) were divided (n = 8) : artificial saliva (control-G 1), Pepsi Twist (R) (<b>G</b> 2), <b>orange</b> juice (<b>G</b> 3), Duraphat (R) + Pepsi Twist (R) (G 4), Duraphat (R) + <b>orange</b> juice (<b>G</b> 5), Duofluorid (R) + Pepsi Twist (R) (G 6), Duofluorid (R) + <b>orange</b> juice (<b>G</b> 7), fluoride gel + Pepsi Twist (R) (G 8), and fluoride gel + <b>orange</b> juice (<b>G</b> 9). Fluoride gel was applied for 4 min and the varnishes were applied and removed after 6 h. the samples were submitted to six cycles (demineralization: Pepsi Twist (R) or orange juice, 10 min; remineralization: saliva, 1 h). Samples were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (144 line-scanning). Results: the amount of Ca and P decreased significantly in the samples of G 2 and G 3, and the Ca/P ratio decreased in G 3. Mineral gain (Ca) was greater in G 9 samples than in G 4 > G 3 > G 5 > G 1, and (P) greater in G 7 samples than in G 9 > G 4 - 6 > G 2 - 3. Conclusions: the protective effect of Duofluorid (R) was significantly lower than fluoride gel against orange juice. the fluoride varnishes can interfere positively with the dissolution of dental enamel in the presence of acidic beverages. Fluoride gel showed the best protection level to extrinsic erosion with low costs. Microsc. Res. Tech. 74 : 839 - 844, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Materials and methodsThe materials included resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Vitremer 3 M™ ESPE™ Core buildup restorative) and composite resin (Filtek™ 3 M™ ESPE™ Z 350). A total of 45 disks of each restorative material were prepared. The disks were divided into groups of 15, which were immersed for 7 days in deionized water (G 1 /G 4, control group), apple juice (G 2 /G 5), or <b>orange</b> juice (<b>G</b> 3 /G 6). The pH of the apple juice was approximately 4. 8 and the pH of the orange juice was approximately 4. 9. Surface hardness tests were performed before immersion and at various times following immersion. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA with repeated measurement and Tukey’s test.
