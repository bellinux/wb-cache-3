5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often <b>of</b> <b>related</b> taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from bacteria and eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of {{the remainder of the}} unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes <b>of</b> <b>related</b> function—such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.|$|E
5|$|Disagreement {{exists as}} to whether Attalea should be {{considered}} a single genus, or a group <b>of</b> <b>related</b> genera. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (as it was then defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa. Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms, and Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus.|$|E
40|$|This article explores {{an aspect}} of the {{cultural}} modulation of recovery in psychosis. It begins with the idea that recovery hinges on the ability <b>of</b> subjects to <b>relate</b> to their distressing experiences in ways that expand rather than diminish agency.  Based on fieldwork in the Dakhla oasis of Egypt and subsequent analysis, it is argued that interpretations of psychosis as spirit possession offer a broader range of intentionality than biomedical interpretations and therefore broader possibilities <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> to psychotic states. Modes <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> to spirits may take active or passive forms, the former consistent with the recovery goal of symptom control. Factors constitutive of the active, agency-expanding mode <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> include: the nature of spirits; the values and beliefs of the subject; the broader cultural/religious discourses which may make it either more or less likely for the subject to achieve the desired state of control over symptoms. </p...|$|R

The music generally features sparse, syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies.|$|E
