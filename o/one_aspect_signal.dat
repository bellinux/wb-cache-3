40|$|AbstractIn {{this issue}} of Cell, a study by N. Cho and {{coworkers}} provides insight {{into the role of}} vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in Drosophila hematopoiesis (Cho et al., 2002). Their work suggests that an ancestral function of VEGF was to guide blood cell migration and highlights the conservation of at least <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of VEGF <b>signaling</b> during evolution...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new characterization of musical signals which {{may lead to}} better understanding about how such signals are perceived. We first consider some signal analysis methods which facilitate measures of perceived qualities of music. More precisely, we consider a particular representation of signal energy {{on which to base}} a quantitative measure of sensory dissonance. After defining sensory dissonance in section 2. 1, we describe a well known signal decomposition method, the matching pursuit. Thereafter, we consider <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of <b>signal</b> energy which has been largely ignored in the literature – the Wigner-Ville interferences. We explain why and how these interferences can be used as the basis for a dissonance characterization of a musical signal. ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{no longer}} a block post for train control purposes, {{it was able to}} be used as such until 2000. The station had a single-aspect signal {{installation}} in the 'starter signal' position on the 'down' platform. The <b>one</b> displayable <b>aspect</b> was 'danger' (red). This was unusual in a non-block station. This signal had the outward appearance of being two-aspect, but this was an illusion, as <b>one</b> apparent <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> was in fact the repeater flashing light to indicate to train drivers that the adjacent level crossing (with Jefferstone Lane) signals had operated correctly to stop road traffic.|$|R
40|$|Whether {{your passion}} is to {{understand}} and reverse disease processes or “simply” {{a better understanding of}} how cells work, anyone wishing to understand cell regulation today must have a detailed and accurate understanding of regulatory GTPase mechanisms and their application to specific pathways. This is becoming increasingly difficult as the details of signaling by members of different families of GTPases and their regulators expand. But this is all the more reason to continually ask, which <b>aspects</b> of GTPase <b>signaling</b> are distinct to a GTPase or its subfamily and which are conserved throughout the superfamily? We each have slightly different views of the key <b>aspects</b> of GTPase <b>signaling</b> that are derived from the main GTPases studied in our own labs; e. g., translocation onto a membrane is an essential and integral aspect of Arf activation but not of other GTPases. However, <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of GTPase <b>signaling</b> that I had come to believe to be widespread and of general importance is not universally accepted. In fact, through my conversations at the recent FASEB summer research conference on “Arf Family GTPases” and reading of the literature in a graduate tutorial class, I realized that it is not known or accepted by the majority of researchers. The question is the role of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) in signaling. Are they “pure” terminators of signaling or do they serve effector functions...|$|R

25|$|Multiple <b>aspect</b> <b>signals,</b> by {{providing}} several intermediate speed stages between 'clear' and 'on', allow high-speed trains {{sufficient time to}} brake safely if required. This becomes very important as train speeds rise. Without multiple-aspect signals, the stop signals must be placed far apart to allow sufficient braking distance and this reduces track utilisation. At the same time, slower trains can also be run closer together on track with multiple <b>aspect</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that}} post-burn activation of the p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of the <b>signalling</b> cascade culminating in post-burn secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α which contributes to post-burn myocardial apoptosis. Studies were designed to determine {{the time course of}} the induction of p 38 MAPK, TNF-α and myocardial apoptosis after burn injury. Our quantitative bacterial culture data demonstrated that viable bacteria reached the heart, and Western blotting data identified the increase in the phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK at an early time after burn. The peak incidence of myocardial apoptosis was also seen at an early time after burn. The expression of TNF-α mRNA, infiltrated neutrophils and serum creatine phosphokinase myocardial band data peaked at a late time after burn. FR 167653, a specific inhibitor of p 38 MAPK, prevented the induction of myocardial apoptosis, TNF-α expression and myocardial injury after burn. Presumably, the bacterial LPS-induced activation of p 38 MAPK pathway occurring at an early time after burn induced the subsequent myocardial apoptosis. The p 38 MAPK-induced activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine appeared to promote the degenerative myocardial injury at a late time after burn. Our present data provided evidence for the hypothesis that the p 38 MAPK pathway controls both myocardial apoptosis and the pro-inflammatory mediator...|$|R

50|$|The Thameslink {{train was}} {{approaching}} London Bridge from New Cross Gate on the Up Fast {{line of the}} Brighton Main Line, and had been signalled to cross on to the Up Passenger Loop of the South Eastern Main Line at Spa Road junction. The Connex South Eastern train was approaching Spa Road from New Cross and had received the correct signalling sequence of a Preliminary Caution (two yellow <b>aspect</b> <b>signal)</b> and Caution (single yellow <b>aspect</b> <b>signal)</b> prior to L154 (the signal protecting the junction) being at Danger. However the driver {{did not respond to}} the signals and failed stop his train at the Danger signal, continuing until his train collided with the Thameslink train at the trailing points.|$|R
