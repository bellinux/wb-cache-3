5|$|Steve Jobs is a 2015 American biographical drama film {{directed}} by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. Based on {{the biography of}} the same name by Walter Isaacson as well as interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film is structured into three acts which cover 14 years (1984–1998) in the life of personal computing innovator and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, with each act taking place immediately prior to the launch <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> product – the Apple Macintosh, the NeXT Computer and the iMac. Jobs is portrayed by Michael Fassbender, with Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg and Jeff Daniels in supporting roles.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an oblique, isometric format and is set inside a haunted castle. As Sir Arthur Pendragon, the player's main objective is to collect sixteen pieces <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> before midnight, which when all connected will form {{the shape of a}} pentacle. The pieces of the pentacle are guarded by various magical creatures, some of which can be defeated by casting spells, others requiring accurately timed attacks and nimble dodging. Once a piece is obtained, the player must take it to a specific chamber within the castle. Once all pentacles have been placed in their chambers, the player can establish the whereabouts of the Staff of Karnath, which must be destroyed before midnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} approach takes {{traffic from}} the A12 {{and the southern}} approach takes traffic from the A2, making the tunnel crossing a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic {{between the north and}} south sides of the river. It forms part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> route into Central London from South East London and Kent and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the Dartford Tunnel in 1963. It remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames, and regularly suffers congestion, to the extent that tidal flow schemes were in place from 1978 until controversially removed in 2007. Proposals to solve the traffic problems have included building a third bore, constructing alternative crossings of the Thames such as the now cancelled Thames Gateway Bridge or the Silvertown Tunnel, and providing better traffic management, particularly for heavy goods vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist is Ashley Riot, a male {{member of}} the Valendia Knights of the Peace (VKP) {{in pursuit of a}} cult leader named Sydney Losstarot.

Ashley's partner is Callo Merlose, an agent of the VKP Inquisitors. Also attempting to capture Sydney is Romeo Guildenstern of the Crimson Blades, whose mission was undertaken without the approval of the VKP.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} set two million years ago. The {{inhabitants}} of the planet Krikkit built a race of androids called the Krikkitmen to wipe out all life in the universe. They were stopped by the Time Lords, who trapped Krikkit within a temporal prison. A group of Krikkitmen which escaped the Time Lords' sentence are trying to reassemble the components <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> which can free Krikkit—components which happen to resemble elements of the Earth game of cricket, itself actually {{a reflection of the}} ancient war. The Doctor and Sarah stumble upon this plot when they see the Krikkitmen steal the Ashes during a test match at Lords. They then travel to the planet Bethselamin to foil {{the next step in the}} Krikkitmen's quest.|$|E

25|$|The Keys to the Kingdom {{are seven}} objects of power {{given to the}} Trustees along with command over their demesnes. It is unknown whether, but implied that, control of the Key is that which gives one control over a demesne and its namesake day in the Secondary Realms. The Key will bond to the {{rightful}} owner <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Key,</b> and protect him or her from harm, somewhat from pain but not at all from discomfort. A rightful owner <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Key</b> is an Heir, the Trustee to whom it was originally entrusted, or a Steward. Over time, the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Key</b> will irreparably turn a mortal into a Denizen, though it is mentioned that after a few centuries, this process may reverse a little. Because {{the presence of a}} Denizen in the Secondary Realms is inimical to mortal life, Arthur attempted to use the Keys as little as possible, as he wishes to remain mortal and return to his family; however, he later realizes that without the keys he would not be alive, and used the powers to protect the Lower House and his home town.|$|E

25|$|A {{keyboard}} typically has characters engraved or {{printed on}} the keys (buttons) and each press <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence.

40|$|For single-photon quantum key {{generation}} between two users, it is shown that for collective attacks the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shared secret <b>key</b> extended via <b>a</b> pseudo-random number generator may simultaneously enhance {{the security and}} efficiency of the cryptosystem. This effect arises from the intrinsic performance difference between quantum detectors with versus without knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>key,</b> <b>a</b> purely quantum effect and a new principle for {{key generation}}. No intrusion level estimation is needed and the method is directly applicable to realistic systems involving multi-photon sources, losses, noises, and finite-sequence statistical fluctuations. It is suggested that such use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secret <b>key</b> be routinely incorporated in <b>a</b> quantum <b>key</b> generation system. The use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secret <b>key</b> in quantum direct encryption is also indicated...|$|R
25|$|Mechanism of the {{intramolecular}} aldol reaction involves formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> enolate intermediate and an intramolecular nucleophilic addition process. First, hydroxide abstracts the α-hydrogen {{on carbon}} 6 {{to form the}} enolate. Next, nucleophilic attack of the ketone carbon 2 by the enolate forms the carbon-carbon bond between carbons 2 and 6. At last, usually under heating conditions, the elimination of water molecule forms the cyclized α,β-unsaturated ketone.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{secondary}} feedwater pumps stopped, three auxiliary pumps activated automatically. However, because the valves {{had been closed}} for routine maintenance, the system was unable to pump any water. The closure of these valves was a violation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) rule, according to which the reactor must be shut down if all auxiliary feed pumps are closed for maintenance. This was later singled out by NRC officials as a key failure.|$|E

25|$|Many games provide {{players with}} {{the option of}} mapping their own choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> or button to a certain control. An early {{technique}} of players, circle strafing, saw a player continuously strafing while aiming and shooting at an opponent by walking in circle around the opponent with the opponent {{at the center of}} the circle. Players could achieve this by holding down a key for strafing while continuously aiming the mouse towards the opponent.|$|E
25|$|The Bellus–Claisen {{rearrangement}} is {{the reaction}} of allylic ethers, amines, and thioethers with ketenes to give γ,δ-unsaturated esters, amides, and thioesters. This transformation was serendipitously observed by Bellus in 1979 through their synthesis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> intermediate of an insecticide, pyrethroid. Halogen substituted ketenes (R1, R2) are often used in this reaction for their high electrophilicity. Numerous reductive methods {{for the removal of}} the resulting α-haloesters, amides and thioesters have been developed. The Bellus-Claisen offers synthetic chemists a unique opportunity for ring expansion strategies.|$|E
