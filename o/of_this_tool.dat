25|$|Brown-headed nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) {{have been}} {{observed}} to methodically use bark pieces to remove other flakes of bark from a tree. The birds insert the bark piece underneath an attached bark scale, using it like a wedge and lever, to expose hiding insects. Occasionally, they reuse the same piece of bark several times and sometimes even fly short distances carrying the bark flake in their beak. The evolutionary origin <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>tool</b> use {{might be related to}} these birds frequently wedging seeds into cracks in the bark to hammer them open with their beak, which can lead to bark coming off.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{whirling}} arm {{does not produce}} a reliable flow of air impacting the test shape at a normal incidence. Centrifugal forces {{and the fact that}} the object is moving in its own wake mean that detailed examination of the airflow is difficult. Francis Herbert Wenham (1824–1908), a Council Member of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, addressed these issues by inventing, designing and operating the first enclosed wind tunnel in 1871. Once this breakthrough had been achieved, detailed technical data was rapidly extracted by the use <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>tool.</b> Wenham and his colleague John Browning are credited with many fundamental discoveries, including the measurement of l/d ratios, and the revelation of the beneficial effects of a high aspect ratio.|$|E
