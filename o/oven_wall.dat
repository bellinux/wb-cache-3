40|$|During {{carbonisation}} coal undergoes {{both physical}} and chemical changes that result in the generation of gas and tar {{and the formation of}} an intermediate plastic state. This transformation is known to generate high internal gas pressures for some coals during carbonisation that translate to high pressures at the <b>oven</b> <b>wall.</b> In this study, three low volatile coals A, B and C with <b>oven</b> <b>wall</b> pressures of 100 kPa, 60 kPa and 20 kPa respectively were investigated using high-temperature rheometry, H- 1 NMR, thermogravimetric analysis and SEM, with the primary aim to better understand the mechanisms behind the coking pressure phenomenon. Rheometer plate displacement measurements (Delta L) have shown differences in the expansion and contraction behaviour of the three coals, which seem to correlate with changes in rheological properties; while SEM images have shown that the expansion process coincides with development of pore structure. It is considered that the point of maximum plate height (Delta L-max) prior to contraction may be indicative of a cell opening or pore network forming process, based on analogies with other foam systems. Such a process may be considered important for coking pressure since it provides a potential mechanism for volatile escape, relieving internal gas pressure and inducing charge contraction. For coal C, which has the highest fluidity Delta L-max occurs quite early in the softening process and consequently a large degree of contraction is observed; while for the lower fluidity coal B, the process is delayed since pore development and consequently wall thinning progress at a slower rate. When Delta L-max is attained, a lower degree of contraction is observed because the event occurs closer to resolidification where the increasing viscosity/elasticity can stabilise the expanded pore structure. For coal A which is relatively high fluidity, but also high coking pressure, a greater degree of swelling is observed prior to cell rupture, which may be due to greater fluid elasticity during the expansion process. This excessive expansion {{is considered to be a}} potential reason for its high coking pressure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{carbonization}} of coal, {{the thermal}} conditions within the supporting coke oven walls vary substantially. This {{gives rise to}} a continually developing strain field within the walls which could cause cracks to occur in the refractory materials and, thus, shorten the operating life of the oven. Since a more precise knowledge of the location of high strain regions should help in improving the design of coke ovens, a mathematical study was initiated to identify the conditions under which high strain gradients are induced during carbonization. As such, this paper outlines the construction and application of a mathematical model to evaluate the strain distribution and its development in coke oven walls during carbonization. The model includes the influence of all the main thermal and physical properties of silica refractory bricks within a finite element formulation to evaluate the temperature and thermally induced strain distributions in a cross-section of a coke <b>oven</b> <b>wall.</b> The thermal strain field for a typical oven design is calculated at a number of stages throughout the carbonization cycle.

40|$|A fully predictive, {{algebraic}} {{method has}} been developed for the prediction of the timewise temperature variation of a thermal load situated in an electrically heated oven. The model which underlies the method takes into account both natural convection within the oven cavity and radiation between the thermal load and the <b>oven</b> <b>walls.</b> The model provides a complete description of heat transfer external to the thermal load. It {{can be used to}} provide boundary conditions for an analysis of thermal loads of various heat-conducting characteristics. This method is able to accommodate loads of various shapes, sizes, materials, and radiation surface finishes, as well as oven heating conditions characterized by a wide range of oven set-point temperatures. Extensive experiments were performed to validate the predictive method. These experiments encompassed thermal loads of different shapes, masses, and surface finishes. Measurements were made of the transient response of the thermal load. The results of these experiments, presented in Figures 1 – 3, reveal overall agreement to within about 1 % between the predictions and the data, thereby validating the veracity of the assumptions that underlie the predictive model. Encompassing temperature data were collected at 170 sites on the <b>oven</b> <b>walls.</b> These data have been brought together in the form of isotherms.

40|$|This work follows on {{from two}} papers which {{presented}} a hypothesis for the mechanism behind <b>oven</b> <b>wall</b> pressure. It was proposed that <b>oven</b> <b>wall</b> pressure results when {{the period of}} pore growth is lengthy prior to coalescence and/or the period of coalescence is minor ahead of resolidification. When this occurs a thick swollen band of closed pores in the viscoelastic medium results which exerts pressure on the oven walls. The band is a resistance to volatile transfer and the largely closed pore network remains throughout resolidification further exacerbating pressure on oven walls. This hypothesis has resulted from a mapping of the viscoelastic properties obtained from a rheometer against the plate behaviour of the rheometer where pore nucleation and growth has been characterised {{by an increase in}} plate gap (ΔL) when the plate is held under constant axial force (AF) or an increase AF when the plates are held at constant gap. Pore coalescence has been characterised by a peak in AF or a decrease in the rate of expansion of ΔL. Because the behaviour of either ΔL or AF has brought about our understanding of coking pressure this paper attempts to prove that pore coalescence can be monitored from plate behaviour. As such this paper attempts to track pore growth and coalescence using mercury porosimetry, permeability, scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy, all of which have been carried out on quenched coke samples. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the ΔL profile provides an accurate account of the onset of bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence. Porosity measurements indicate that the proportion of open pores in the 1 - 100 μm range increases significantly after the peak in AF or decrease in the rate of expansion of ΔL, indicating that these points coincide with a bubble coalescence phenomena. Optical microscopy showed a distinct difference in pore structure between the image corresponding to the peak in axial force and images after, whereby the number of isolated cells decreased and pore walls became thinner. Permeability measurements on quenched samples throughout the softening process show an initial drop in permeability due to the loss of interparticle voidage and the onset of swelling followed by a steady increase coinciding with the peak in axial force and decrease in the rate of ΔL expansion. This work has helped to reinforce the proposed mechanism for coking pressure. Furthermore, permeability measurements of quenched samples at 550 °C show that the high pressure coals tend to have the lower permeabilities at this temperature. The finding that pore growth and coalescence behaviour is what impacts on coking pressure has opened the door for finding novel ways to manipulate pore behaviour and therefore manipulate coking pressure. Understanding and manipulating pore growth behaviour has other implications, largely the understanding for coke strength development, which is currently being explored by the authors...|$|E
40|$|Fifth Chapter "Combined Microwave and Infared Heating of Foods" is a {{collaboration}} chapter written with Srikanth Geedipalli. A quantitative, model-based understanding of heat exchange in infrared and combined infrared-microwave heating of food inside an oven is developed. The research {{is divided into}} three parts: measurement of optical properties, radiative heat transfer analysis and combined microwave-radiative heat transfer analysis. Optical properties of reflectance, absorptance and transmittance in a potato tissue are measured as a function of wavelength, using a spectroradiometer. Penetration of energy is higher for halogen lamps that emit in the near- and mid-infrared range, compared to ceramic rods that emit mostly in the far infrared range. Reflectance in the near infrared range increases with moisture content of the food, thus decreasing the energy coupled. Surface structure has significant influence on the optical properties. A 3 -D radiative heat exchange model of an oven-food system is developed using a commercial finite-element package. The air in the oven is assumed transparent to the radiation. Heat conduction is assumed in the entire oven (food and air) for the short duration. The wavelength dependence of emissivity (non-gray surface) is found to significantly affect the surface radiative flux and the use of a non-gray model is recommended for such materials, although simplification of the emissivity variation is required to keep the computation time reasonable. Lowering food surface emissivity reduces the radiative flux that is absorbed by the food surface. Reducing <b>oven</b> <b>wall</b> emissivities increase the radiative flux on the food surface. The location of the radiative heat source in the oven as well as placement of the food relative to the heat source were found to have significant influence on the radiative heat flux over the food surface. To add microwave heating, Maxwell's equations of electromagnetics were solved for the same cavity using separate finite element software and the volumetric heat generation, in the food, obtained from this model was input to the radiative heat transfer model, thus coupling them. Using measures such as mean temperature rise and the standard deviation of temperatures, it was demonstrated that combination heating leads to more uniform heating, without compromising the speed of heating...|$|E

There {{are a variety}} of manufacturing industries utilizing microwave power as heating-drying source, several cases incorporating hybrid-heating technologies in processes such as paper, rubber, polymers, foodstuff and brick. In reference to starch based adhesive bonding, microwave processing produced improved adhesive joint properties due to the incorporations of dielectric heating methodologies. Relative to the ageing steam heated hot plate, which has been plagued with inconstancies such as; operational efficiency, economics of scale, factory floor requirements and throughput, the science of microwave curing of wheat base starch adhesive is based on the relationship between the interaction of electromagnetic energy and the dielectric properties of the materials [1].

The campaign life of the new ovens is expected to exceed 30 years. During the service the linings are exposed to cyclic thermo-mechanical loads.

This study investigates the resistance of two types of silica based refractories to cyclic fatigue failure for material selection purposes. The typical methods approached in previous studies to address fatigue failure in materials are reviewed and their applicability to fulfill the aims of this study is discussed. A strain-controlled test procedure is developed for the existing testing equipment in three point bending and compression setups. Both of the materials are found susceptible to cyclic fatigue failure in the strain-controlled mode. Moreover, the stress-strain envelopes in monotonic and cyclic loading tests are found to be different. Fractographic analysis and other complementary techniques revealed the difference is due to the gradual development of micro-damage during the loading cycles.

Large pressures against coke <b>oven</b> <b>walls</b> can seriously damage the ovens and reduce their life span. In the work presented here, a laboratory scale method is used to investigate swelling pressures during slow pyrolysis of thermoplastic coals with an aim in detecting the parameters which most influence this phenomenon.

Results showed significant difference in the thermal behaviour of this coal when compared with the low swelling pressure coal in the temperature region of contraction of the semi-coke. Both, the high and low swelling pressure coals, were thermally investigated using series of gas analysis and long distance microscopic techniques. Results showed similarities in the amount of gas release between the two coals, especially for lower molecular weight volatiles; however, the prime difference was in their tar evolution rates and temperatures. For this purpose, the tars were collected for both coals and their blends and further analysed using matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI).

50|$|Vitreous enamel {{has many}} useful properties: it is smooth, hard, {{chemically}} resistant, durable, scratch resistant (5-6 on the Mohs scale), has long-lasting colour fastness, {{is easy to}} clean, and cannot burn. Enamel is glass, not paint, so it does not fade under ultraviolet light. A disadvantage of enamel {{is a tendency to}} crack or shatter when the substrate is stressed or bent, but modern enamels are relatively chip- and impact-resistant because of good thickness control and coefficients of thermal expansion well-matched to the metal. The Buick automobile company was founded by David Dunbar Buick with wealth earned by his development of improved enamelling processes, c. 1887, for sheet steel and cast iron. Such enameled ferrous material had, and still has, many applications: early 20th century and some modern advertising signs, interior <b>oven</b> <b>walls,</b> cooking pots, housing and interior walls of major kitchen appliances, housing and drums of clothes washers and dryers, sinks and cast iron bathtubs, farm storage silos, and processing equipment such as chemical reactors and pharmaceutical process tanks. Structures such as filling stations, bus stations and Lustron Houses had walls, ceilings and structural elements made of enamelled steel. One of the most widespread modern uses of enamel is in the production of quality chalk-boards and marker-boards (typically called 'blackboards' or 'whiteboards') where the resistance of enamel to wear and chemicals ensures that 'ghosting', or unerasable marks, do not occur, as happens with polymer boards. Since standard enamelling steel is magnetically attractive, it may also be used for magnet boards.
