He stated that there is no use <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or scientific knowledge.

5|$|Miller {{warmed up}} for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF.

In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook on the arm and head respectively, {{provoking}} an angry crowd reaction. At the time, Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling, so his success led to calls for him to start taking it seriously, instead <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> jogging in and releasing the ball.

5|$|By the 1840s, Romanticism {{had largely}} supplanted Neoclassicism, {{not only in}} painting, but also in {{sculpture}} and architecture. The Academy did not resume its role <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> providing education: prizes, medals, scholarships in foreign countries and funding were used as incentives. Among its staff and students {{were some of the}} most renowned Brazilian artists, including Simplício Rodrigues de Sá, Félix Taunay, Manuel de Araújo Porto-alegre, Pedro Américo, Victor Meirelles, Rodolfo Amoedo, Almeida Júnior, Rodolfo Bernardelli and João Zeferino da Costa. In the 1880s, after having been long regarded as the official style of the Academy, Romanticism declined, and other styles were explored by a new generation of artists. Among the new genres was Landscape art, the most famous exponents of which were Georg Grimm, Giovanni Battista Castagneto, França Júnior and Antônio Parreiras. Another style which gained popularity in the fields of painting and architecture was Eclecticism.|$|E

5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|He {{arranged}} {{a new system}} to appoint judges. Instead <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> proposing a new judge candidate to the Congress, the presidency first released names {{of a number of}} potential candidates, who were then evaluated by several non-governmental organizations, who assessed if the candidate was suitable as a judge. The ministry of justice compiled all the support and criticism, and the president then decided which candidate would be proposed to the Congress, which made the final decision, as under the previous system. Raúl Zaffaroni, a former FREPASO politician, was the first judicial appointment under the new system. He was followed by Elena Highton de Nolasco, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court. The appointment of Carmen Argibay (another female judge) was controversial, since Argibay was an atheist and a supporter of legal abortion. The judges held liberal views on criminal justice, countering social demands for harsher, pro-victim policies after the murder of Axel Blumberg. However, the new Supreme Court had little political power, as the national government ignored all rulings that were not favorable.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{went on to}} play {{a two-day}} match for the RAAF against Lancashire, where his 52 was the only fifty in a low-scoring game. He also took match figures of 2/28. After scoring 30 in an innings victory over Learie Constantine's XI, Miller {{represented}} the RAAF against the RAF at Lord's where he top-scored with 63 in 90 minutes. The Second Victory Test was played at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, where the grandstands were damaged by German air raids. Hassett sent the Englishmen into bat. Miller went wicketless. He was run {{out in the first}} innings for 17. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fast and hostile spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton in the arm before hitting Cyril Washbrook in the head, provoking an angry crowd reaction, comparing Miller to the Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood. He later removed Washbrook and ended with 2/28. His efforts led to calls for him to start taking his bowling seriously, instead <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> jogging in releasing the ball, especially from former South African representative Bob Crisp. Despite this, Miller fell for eight in the second innings and Australia fell 41 runs short of the target and series was squared.|$|E

5|$|The next Divine film, Lust in the Dust (1985), reunited {{him with}} Tab Hunter and was Divine's first film not {{directed}} by John Waters. Set in the Wild West {{during the nineteenth}} century, the movie was a sex comedy that starred Divine as Rosie Velez, a promiscuous woman {{who works as a}} singer in saloons and competes for the love of Abel Wood (Tab Hunter) against another woman. A parody of the 1946 western Duel in the Sun, the film was a moderate critical success, with Divine receiving praise from a number of reviewers. Divine followed this production with a very different role, that of gay male gangster Hilly Blue in Trouble in Mind (1985). The script was written with Divine in mind. Although not a major character in the film, Divine had been eager to play the part because he wished to perform in more male roles and leave behind the stereotype <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> being a female impersonator. Reviews of the film were mixed, as were the evaluations of Divine's performance.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was a {{stand-up}} goaltender, rarely falling on both knees {{to stop a}} puck. He {{was one of the}} first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.|$|E
5|$|While American economists quickly {{abandoned}} disequilibrium models, European economists {{were more}} open to models without market clearing. Europeans such as Edmond Malinvaud and Jacques Drèze expanded on the disequilibrium tradition and worked to explain price rigidity instead <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> assuming it. Malinvaud (1977) used disequilibrium analysis to develop a theory of unemployment. He argued that disequilibrium in the labor and goods markets could lead to rationing of goods and labor, leading to unemployment. Malinvaud adopted a fixprice framework and argued that pricing would be rigid in modern, industrial prices compared to the relatively flexible pricing systems of raw goods that dominate agricultural economies. Prices are fixed and only quantities adjust. Malinvaud considers an equilibrium state in classical and Keynesian unemployment as most likely. Work in the neoclassical tradition is confined as a special case of Malinvaud's typology, the Walrasian equilibrium. In Malinvaud's theory, reaching the Walrasian equilibrium case {{is almost impossible to}} achieve given the nature of industrial pricing.|$|E

5|$|The game's setting, Kyrat, is {{a fictional}} {{country in the}} Himalayas region. When {{building}} Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size {{is similar to that}} of Far Cry 3, but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identify for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead <b>of</b> <b>simply</b> being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture, so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.|$|E
