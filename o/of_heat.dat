5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior, with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive amount <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit. Their calculations suggested that the amount <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generated for an Io with a homogeneous interior would be three {{times greater than the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generated by radioactive isotope decay alone. This effect would be even greater with a differentiated Io.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the heating}} {{substation}} {{plays a key}} role in transferring the thermal energy from the primary network to the secondary network and controlling the <b>heat</b> output <b>of</b> district <b>heating</b> system to meet the thermal load, high operation performance <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> substation is essential for energy conservation, cost saving and emission reduction. The dynamic operation stability <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> substation is a very important dynamic characteristic <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> substation and largely affects the operation efficiency <b>of</b> district <b>heating</b> system. The operation instability <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> substation mainly manifest as flow rate and pressure oscillations, which will deteriorate the network hydraulic condition, break the network thermal balance, reduce the consumer comfort and increase the energy cost of the pumping system. Since heating substations will easily operate unstably under some conditions, this paper presents a theoretical method to analyze the stability and retune the feedback controller for operation stability <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> substation. Mathematical model <b>of</b> the plate <b>heat</b> exchanger was established and the feedback control theory was adopted to study the operation stability <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> substation. Based on the mathematical model and feedback control theory, a stability criterion was proposed for analyzing the operation stability <b>of</b> district <b>heating</b> substation effectively. The dynamic model <b>of</b> plate <b>heat</b> exchanger was validated with measured data. Simulation results show that controller tuned at certain operating condition can’t ensure operation stability <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> substation, when operating condition varies in large range. The stability analysis method proposed in this paper can be applied to analyzing the operation stability and tuning the controller <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> substation to enhance the operation stability...|$|R
