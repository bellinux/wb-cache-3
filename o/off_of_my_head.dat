5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I told him the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Kelly never writes any lyrics down; he freestyles {{everything}} in the studio. He states: [...] "I never write anything down, since I've been in the song writing business – 20 years, I never write anything on paper, everything comes <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I get in there, do the track, and whatever the track feels like, that's what I do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jagger uses a half-hearted rap {{delivery}} {{for some}} lines, saying at the time, [...] "I'm {{not a great}} rapper... It's just made up on the spot as well. It's completely extemporized, as well, most of it. A couple words I cleaned up. I don't mean clean up, just made better sounds. That was just rap <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I didn't write it down, even." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{pretty much}} came <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I've {{always had a}} real {{interest}} in songwriting and it {{just happened to be}} at the better end of a million ideas I had. I tend to put one hand on my keyboard, play a chord and see what comes out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth. 'The Key The Secret' was actually about taking magic mushrooms, which a lot of people never really realised at the time." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bolt has {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} the original character [...] "Boltmutt" [...] by furry internet personality, Drew. Boltmutt is the alter ego of the dog that replaced Bolt in his absence during the movie. Yeah the dog that set the studio on fire, that's Boltmutt. Boltmutt is a well known personality in the furry fandom, and their real name is Drew, idk they like Sonic the Hedgehog memes a lot too that's really all the information I know <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> ok thanks.|$|R
5000|$|I {{tried to}} write that song for a year, and couldn't. I went to write it at the studio and passed out. I woke up two hours later and sat down and wrote the whole end of the song, like, just <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It was like, don't even know what's coming out, man, but it's coming. I {{think one of the}} best things that I've ever written was maybe the end segment of the song [...] "Coma". It just poured out.|$|R
5000|$|My {{attitude}} toward homosexuality has changed. I {{came to the}} conclusion that I was wrong. I was never someone who hunted down 'fags' as we used to call them on the street. I would, sometimes, say something anti-homosexual <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> because it was thought, in those days, to be funny. I never really deeply believed those comments, but I gave the impression of being thoughtless in these areas. I have, over many years, changed my attitude about gay men and women.|$|R
5000|$|A Chronicle columnist, Ralph J. Gleason, {{highlighted}} the saying {{in his column}} on November 18. The saying then went viral, becoming a favorite for reporters and columnists wishing to ridicule the young, the New Left, or the hippie/Yippie movement. That annoyed Weinberg, who has said"I've done some {{things in my life}} I think are very important, and my one sentence in history turns out to be something I said <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> which became completely distorted and misunderstood. But I've become more accepting of fate as I get older." ...|$|R
500|$|The title {{refers to}} the rabbits' destination, Watership Down, a hill {{in the north of}} Hampshire, England, near the area where Adams grew up. The story began as tales that Richard Adams told his young daughters Juliet and Rosamond during long car journeys. As he {{explained}} in 2007, he [...] "began telling the story of the rabbits... improvised <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> as we were driving along." [...] The daughters insisted he write it down—"they were very, very persistent". After some delay he began writing in the evenings and completed it 18 months later. The book is dedicated to the two girls.|$|R
500|$|The Badmotorfinger logo {{consists}} of a jagged, cyclone-like design. In {{the center of the}} logo is a triangle with the album's title, containing a spark plug. The album's cover art was illustrated by guitarist Mark Dancey from the Sub Pop band Big Chief. Thayil suggested the title Badmotorfinger as a joke on the Montrose song [...] "Bad Motor Scooter". Regarding the title, Thayil said, [...] "It was sort <b>of</b> <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I simply like it because it was colorful. It was kinda aggressive, too... It conjures up a lot of different kinds of images. We like the ambiguity in it, the way it sounded and the way it looked." ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 2, 2016, [...] "Wow" [...] (sometimes stylized as [...] "WOW") was {{released}} {{as the second}} single and it was confirmed the new album {{was scheduled to be}} released October 21, 2016. That release date was later delayed and scrubbed from Beck's PR site with no explanation given. Beck told KROQ that [...] "Wow" [...] "was completely <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I didn't write any of it. It was just us fooling around in the studio. I didn't even mean to release it. I was working on another song and came up with the riff and then I just started freestyling." [...] "Wow" [...] was included on Billboards 100 Best Pop Songs of 2016" [...] list.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{interview}} Aiko {{described the}} music and her style on the mixtape saying [...] "Honestly, I don’t think it fits in and I think that’s why it stands out. It’s about what I’m saying. It’s a marriage with real music. Fisticuffs, they don’t use any samples and they use live instruments {{a lot of the}} times in their beats, so I would go in there and I would be singing and they would be making the track. It was like a complete marriage of sound. I wouldn’t write anything down, just sing it on the mic and come up with everything <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I feel like it doesn’t have to sound like anything that’s on the radio to be good music".|$|R
5000|$|... “I spent a {{good portion}} of a day on {{agricultural}} websites, and specifically, because I wanted to get an emotional feeling for pigs—not just a clinical, dry feeling—I also went and researched pig enthusiast websites. I don’t mean the kind of websites you have to hide from your children, I mean there are people in America, probably here too, who own pigs as pets and they write lots of articles about pigs and how pigs feel and what pigs like (besides other pigs)… <b>Off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> I could not tell you how much a full-grown, male farm pig should weigh. I knew ‘Big,’ but when you’re a writer, you want to sound like you know what you’re talking about, so I actually went and spent some time.” ...|$|R
5000|$|I was {{painting}} my mom's house in Ontario {{when the phone}} rang. The {{voice on the other}} end said it was Cardinal Bertone, and my first thought was that it was a prank, … you know, I thought maybe it was one of the Redemptorists fooling around. Quickly, though, I realized that it really was Bertone, and he said that the Holy Father wants you to do this. My first reaction was to tell him that <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> I could give him the names of five people much more qualified to do this job than I am. I was completely serious about it. But Cardinal Bertone said no, this is what the Holy Father wants. He said I could take a week to ten days to think about it, so I talked to my superiors, my closest friends in religious life, and my spiritual director.|$|R
500|$|The album's opening track, the Al Green-styled [...] "Thinking of You", was {{one that}} the group {{conceived}} and recorded together at 3 a.m. in Saadiq's Pookie Labs studio. As he remembered it, [...] "I was just playing around and started singing <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I never wrote anything down, it was just what came out." [...] "Annie May", one of Wiggins' songs for House of Music, had Saadiq's backing vocals pre-recorded and then overdubbed to the track's final mix. One of Saadiq's songs for the album, [...] "Me and the Blind Man", was excluded from the final mix because, as Saadiq told Yahoo! Music, [...] "they didn't want anybody playing favorites, so one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> songs had to come off." [...] The recording was a moody blues piece with surrealistic lyrics about lust, longing, and a fictitious blind man's secret powers. Saadiq wanted to show [...] "a darker side... some depth" [...] to listeners with the song. [...] "To me songs like 'Blind Man,' make the whole sound, the House of Music", he remarked. It was featured on an album sampler sent by the group's label to music journalists.|$|R
5000|$|Blush's {{observations}} were seconded by numerous NYHC notables, as interviewed {{in the oral}} history book NYHC by Tony Rettman (Bazillion Points). Paul Cripple of Reagan Youth testified that [...] "in all honesty, Denise Mercedes, the guitarist of the Stimulators, was the catalyst for New York Hardcore". Doug Holland of Kraut and Cro-Mags added that [...] "I can tell you 10 dudes <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> who have thriving punk bands today because they {{went to see the}} Stimulators." [...] Artist Sean Taggart, who got his start designing album covers for hardcore artists, compared The Stimulators' transitional role between scenes in NYC to what the Germs accomplished for the Los Angeles area punk scene(s). Jesse Malin of Heart Attack and D Generation noted that the presence of the adolescent Harley Flannagan in the band was a seminal influence on the underaged future hardcore set. Word got around that one of their peers was playing in the band, and by hook or crook they would attend. Malin suggests this may have been an influence on the all-ages shows that became a characteristic of hardcore punk.|$|R
5000|$|Jonathan Liebesman {{intended}} {{the film to}} be a realistic depiction of an alien invasion {{in the style of}} a war film, taking inspiration from the films Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, and United 93 for his documentary style of filming. Liebesman also drew inspiration from YouTube videos of Marines fighting in Fallujah for the look of the film. As a result, the film was not shot in 3D as the director felt that combined with the handheld camera style of shooting would make the audience [...] "throw up in two minutes." [...] Instead, standard film was used, intercutting footage from three different cameras. The filmmakers tested shooting the film digitally on a Red camera, but found the camera could not capture the same quality image as standard film. The film was shot for a PG-13 rating, as the director felt making the film overly gory did not suit the more suspenseful tone they were trying to achieve. Screenwriter Chris Bertolini tried to include humour and suspense as well as action, which he felt were important elements to help draw the audience into the drama.In an interview with IGN, Liebesman described the interaction between actors, as well as the natural development of the film during pre-production exclaiming, [...] "What comes out of that is a lot of tiny little details and tiny things that these guys bring out,". He also noted, [...] "Whether it's, just <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> Ne-Yo, who plays Harris, and Gino Pesi, who plays Stavrou, have a great relationship, a lot of which they made up behind the scenes. Just little things, characters that you thought, 'Ah, s--t this wasn't really in the script.' These guys, like Guerrero (Neil Brown, Jr.). He's one of the guys way back there but he's got a personality and he brought it and it was just stuff you don't expect." ...|$|R
40|$|Nearly 11 {{years ago}} when I became the Chief Economist of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, one of the {{greatest}} jobs any son of a Kansas farmer/rancher could have, I was told that unlike wheat, corn and soybeans, beef trade just didn’t matter much. Early on during my tenure, it was the opinion of some that we needed to focus our efforts on keeping beef imports out and that beef exports would never be anything more than a niche business of little consequence to the bottom line of U. S. cattlemen. I politely disagreed then and recall what I was thinking to myself at the time…you don’t know what you’ve got until it is gone. Back in 2003 BCSC (Before the Cow that Stole Christmas), beef exports in 2003 were $ 3. 86 billion with Japan leading the way at $ 1. 4 billion – statistics I can still recall <b>off</b> the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Actually, beef exports already mattered a lot back in 2003. Back in the fall of that year, our export tonnage was hitting new monthly levels and the November 2003 value of beef exports was $ 150 /head – a historic high. If hides and offal were added in the value of these exports came to just under $ 200 /head. Currently, export markets account for almost $ 300 /head, which means that 17 percent of the value of a finished steer now comes from the international marketplace. Another {{way to look at it}} is that 17 percent of the money used as payment for the product we are producing comes in the form of Pesos, Yen, Won, Yuan, Euros, Rubles, Canadian or Taiwan dollars. The point here is that producers should not get caught up in the notion that per capita domestic beef consumption is declining. Think of the marketplace in terms of every consumer on the planet who buys their food from a supermarket, “wet market” butcher or restaurant. Also consider that one of the biggest economic changes of the past decade is the increased buying power of consumers in all corners of the globe for U. S. beef...|$|R
