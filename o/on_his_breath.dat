[...] "He was small in stature and I {{could not help but}} detect the smell of alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as he {{introduced}} himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. [...] "He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. [...] "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical." ...|$|E
6000|$|The sun grew hotter and hotter, Bertram's wound bled, {{though not}} profusely, the smart grew upon him, his tongue was parched with thirst, {{and though he}} kept resolutely <b>on,</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> came panting, his head grew dizzy, his eyes dim, his feet faltered, and at last, just as he {{attained}} a wider and more trodden way, he dropped insensible {{by the side of}} the path, his dry lips trying to utter the cry, [...] "Lord, have mercy on me!" ...|$|E
60|$|And I {{caught my}} great, radiant vision of Mr. Pike, galley slave of the race, and a driver of men under men greater than he; the {{faithful}} henchman, the able sailorman, battered and grizzled, branded and galled, the {{servant of the}} sweep-head that made mastery of the sea. I know him now. He can never again offend me. I forgive him everything--the whiskey raw <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> the day I came aboard at Baltimore, his moroseness when sea and wind do not favour, his savagery to the men, his snarl and his sneer.|$|E

6000|$|... 'What {{can you do}} for me!' cried Hugh, {{clutching}} him by {{the collar}} with both hands, and shaking him {{as though he were}} bent <b>on</b> stopping <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> by that means. 'What have you done for me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{so he went}} <b>on</b> till <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> run out, {{and he had to}} stop. I couldn't {{think of}} {{anything}} to say just then, and so I begun to look over the paper again. [...] "Ay! here's another proclamation, or something like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Entering the house, Mr. Staples {{led the way}} to the dining-room, {{where there}} was a large empty table {{in the middle of the}} room, and in the deep bay of the window a smaller one, laid out with wine and dessert, where sat 'old Fulbert.' Having always heard him so called, the {{brothers}} were surprised to find him no more than elderly. He must have been originally a thorough florid handsome Underwood, and had the remains of military bearing, though with an air of feebleness and want of health, and a good deal of asthmatic oppression <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> He did not rise, but held out his hand, saying, 'Good evening. Thank you for coming to see a sick man.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They have a {{primitive}} mode of conducting funerals here," [...] said Tom Brown when the major had left. [...] "I {{happened to be}} up at the kraal currying favour with the chief man, for he has the power of bothering us a good deal if he chooses, and I observed what they did with this same dead man. I {{saw that he was}} very low as I passed the hut where he lay, and stopped to look <b>on.</b> <b>His</b> <b>breath</b> was very short, and presently he fell into what either might have been a profound sleep, or a swoon, or death; I could not be quite sure which, not being used to black fellows. I would have examined the poor man, but the friends kicked up a great row and shoved me off. Before the breath could have been well out of his body, they hoisted him up and carried him away to burial. I followed out of mere curiosity, and found that the lazy rascals had shoved the body into an ant-eater's hole in order to save the trouble of digging a grave." ...|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the influx}} of known crime figures, the local {{business}} community tried to cast Las Vegas in a respectable light when the Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur visited in 1929 to inspect the dam site. However a subordinate was found with alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> (this was {{during the time of}} Prohibition) after a visit to Block 16 in Las Vegas. The government ultimately decided that a federal-controlled town, Boulder City, would be erected for the dam workers.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 May 2005, while {{filming a}} {{commercial}} with his troupe in Mexico City, an overtaking car slammed into his motorcycle caravan, sending Ponce {{flying into the}} air and injuring three other actors. Ponce {{was rushed to the hospital}} but died early the next morning. Police charged the driver with involuntary homicide and detected alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> but believed he did not intend to kill Ponce. Ponce's co-star Poncho de Nigris accused the man of trying to hit them, stating, [...] "the car didn't hit the brakes or anything".|$|E
50|$|Sister James (Amy Adams), a {{young and}} naive teacher, observes the {{closeness}} between Father Flynn and Donald Miller (Joseph Foster), an altar boy and the school's only black student. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. She decides to report her suspicions to Sister Aloysius.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed smilingly. Miss Sally {{suddenly}} slipped behind him. He {{felt the}} soft touch {{of her small}} hands <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulders; warm <b>breath</b> stirred the roots of his hair, and then--the light pressure <b>on</b> <b>his</b> scalp of what seemed the lips of a child.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the closing}} movie, the greens swoop in, {{taking out the}} {{remaining}} tans and enjoying a major victory for the Green Army.

50|$|Hard {{decisions}} {{have to be}} made. A posse will be soon coming for the outlaws. Miller is <b>on</b> <b>his</b> last <b>breaths.</b> The three Younger brothers are so injured that {{they are unable to}} continue. Only Jesse and Frank James are in any condition to ride further. Even though it is his gang, and they follow his commands, Jesse elects to leave all the badly wounded behind. Frank reluctantly agrees. Cole objects, implying that it is disloyal to abandon them, but Jesse ignores him, while Frank declares that he has to abide by his brother's decision.|$|R
5000|$|On April 25, 2012, Meriweather {{was arrested}} in Arlington County, Virginia, on {{suspicion}} of driving while intoxicated, according to a press account. Meriweather was initially stopped for speeding on westbound I-66, according to Arlington County Police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck, who also said that officers detected an odor of alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and performed a field sobriety test, which Meriweather failed. Sternbeck further stated that Meriweather refused a breathalyzer test, was arrested and {{spent the night in}} the Arlington County jail. According to the press account, [...] "Police say Meriweather claimed he was driving home from a club in D.C., but couldn’t remember the name of the club." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of the tipplers (a black dog, {{perhaps a}} {{prototype}} of Goopy Geer) joins Piggy onstage. The dog drinks from a bottle of bootleg hootch (the film was made during alcohol Prohibition in the USA), and belches in Piggy's face. The fumes <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> instantly intoxicate Piggy. Piggy snatches the booze and {{runs out of the}} theater with the dog chasing him. He pours some of it into the radiator of an automobile, which arches its back like a frightened cat and takes Piggy for a wild ride through the city. Even the streets, lampposts, telephone poles, and background buildings seem to come to life in a loopy, drunken state.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Whip {{visits and}} soon becomes {{intimate}} with Nicole, but Whip's drinking habits clash with Nicole's attempts to stay drug-free. Later, at a crew member's funeral, {{he attempts to}} persuade flight attendant Margaret (Tamara Tunie) who survived to tell the NTSB that he was sober. Whip then pays a visit to Ken after awaking from his coma. Ken sustained severe injuries due to the crash, meaning that he will most likely never pilot a plane ever again. Ken confides into Whip that {{on the day of}} the crash that he could smell the alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> However, due to his religious beliefs Ken has decided not to challenge it, stating to Whip that he has a 'higher plan' for him. Nicole decides to separate from Whip, following his failed attempts to stay sober.|$|E
50|$|Remote {{dispensing}} also {{places a}} physical barrier between {{the patient and}} pharmacist, limiting the pharmacist's ability to detect a patient's nonverbal cues. A patient with alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>breath</b> would go undetected via remote dispensing, increasing the risk for dangerous interactions with drugs such as tranquilizers, sleeping pills, narcotics, and warfarin to name a few. This problem may be amplified through telecommunication service disruptions, which were reported in previous studies examining the utility of remote dispensing technology.|$|R

60|$|So now {{the battle}} was ended. Immediately the moon shone out as brightly {{as if all the}} {{troubles}} of the world, and all the wickedness and the ugliness that infest human life, were past and gone forever. And Theseus, as he leaned <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sword, taking <b>breath,</b> felt another twitch of the silken cord; for all through the terrible encounter he had held it fast in his left hand. Eager to let Ariadne know of his success, he followed the guidance of the thread, and soon found himself at the entrance of the labyrinth.|$|R
5000|$|Wilson's powerful, electrifying live {{performances}} rarely failed to bring audiences {{to a state}} of frenzy. His {{live performances}} consisted of knee-drops, splits, spins, back-flips, one-footed across-the-floor slides, removing his tie and jacket and throwing them off the stage, a lot of basic boxing steps (advance and retreat shuffling) and one of his favorite routines, getting some of the less attractive girls in the audience to come up and kiss him. [...] "If I kiss the ugliest girl in the audience," [...] Wilson often said, [...] "they'll all think they can have me and keep coming back and buying my records." [...] Having women come up to kiss him is one reason Wilson kept bottles of mouthwash in his dressing room. Another reason may have been his attempt to hide the alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
50|$|In another case, a Southwest Airlines {{co-pilot}} faced federal DUI {{charges in}} 2006. A federal complaint was filed against Carl Fulton, {{who was accused}} of operating a plane {{under the influence of alcohol}}. Fulton was pulled from the cockpit of a Southwest Airlines Flight preparing to leave Salt Lake City bound for Phoenix after a Transportation Security Administration screener detected alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> The screener followed Fulton and watched him board the flight. Airport police were called and Fulton was asked to step outside the plane, according to a complaint filed in federal court. Fulton made an appearance before Judge Paul Warner, and he was charged with one count of operation of a common carrier under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines.|$|E
50|$|Several controversies arose {{during the}} 2005-06 season. Sebastian Telfair, who {{replaced}} Damon Stoudamire {{as the starting}} point guard, had issues with McMillan. Forward Ruben Patterson engaged in several public power struggles with McMillan and earned a lengthy suspension from the team. Zach Randolph, recovering from a knee injury, was criticized for his alleged poor play and work ethic. Darius Miles also had issues with McMillan, including a game where he changed into street clothes at halftime in protest of lack of playing time. Both Miles and Randolph publicly requested trades, though Randolph later apologized. In May 2006, Miles gave an interview with The Oregonian reporter Jason Quick in which he admitted to coming to practice with alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Telfair, Miles, Randolph, Theo Ratliff, and Joel Przybilla also spent significant minutes out with injuries. The Blazers finished the season 21-61, the worst in the NBA, and landed the fourth pick in the 2006 NBA draft.|$|E

5000|$|This prose-poem {{has many}} Daoist {{elements}} besides researching [...] "the subtle mysteries of Tao and Te" [...] (above). Transcendental whistling {{is presented as}} a powerful method of self-cultivation through breath control. The statement that [...] "with his mind he controls his breath" [...] uses the Daoist term yùqì 御氣 [...] "control the breath; move qi through the body", further described as,The eight sounds and five harmonies constantly fluctuate; The melody follows no strict beat. It runs, but does not run off. It stops, but does not stop up. Following his mouth and lips, he expands forth. Floating <b>on</b> <b>his</b> fragrant <b>breath,</b> he wanders afar 假芳氣而遠逝. The music is, in essence, subtle with flowing echoes. The sound races impetuously, but with a harsh clarity. Indeed, with its supreme natural beauty, It is quite strange and other-worldly. (tr. White 1994: 434) Fangqi 芳氣 [...] "fragrant breath" [...] is a Daoist metaphor for meide 美德 [...] "beautiful virtues".|$|R

5000|$|Galluccio {{has been}} convicted three times of driving-related offenses. In 1984 {{he was convicted of}} driving under the {{influence}} of alcohol, for which he was pardoned by governor William Weld in 1993. [...] He was convicted of the same offense in 1997. [...] In October 2009, he was accused of having fled the scene of a car crash. He pleaded guilty to the charge on December 18, 2009, and was sentenced to six months home confinement, with the qualification that he may attend church and cast votes in the State Senate. Within 72 hours of beginning his house arrest the court-ordered breath-alcohol testing device, the BI Sobrietor, detected alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Galluccio speculated that due to his house arrest his personal hygiene had increased and consequently blamed his toothpaste. [...] He was given the maximum sentence of one year in prison. [...] Galluccio was released from prison on July 15, 2010 and placed on probation.|$|E
50|$|The central {{character}} {{of the novel is}} Eugene Wren, a wealthy, middle-aged art dealer whose secretive personality jeopardizes both his sanity and his relationship with, and eventual engagement to, Ella Cotswold, an attractive general practitioner ten years his junior. Having in the past overcome various slight addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and food, Wren gets hooked on a special brand of sugar-free sweet, which he wants to conceal from his fiancée. When the couple decide that Ella should sell her flat and she moves in with him, he starts inventing excuses and lies so as to be alone just for {{the time it takes to}} suck a sweet and to get rid of the sweet smell <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> afterwards. Extremely ashamed of his habit, he buys, hoards, and consumes the sweets secretly, and he establishes several caches in his antique-studded home. When Ella happens to find one of them, out of curiosity goes on to search the rest of the house, and finally confronts Wren with her find, he is so ashamed of himself that he sees no other way than to break off their engagement and move into a hotel.|$|E
50|$|At {{approximately}} 2:08 a.m. on 3 October 2010, Tyler McNeely {{was stopped}} after a highway patrol officer observed him exceed the posted speed limit, and cross over the centerline. The officer reportedly noticed signs of intoxication from McNeely, including bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, {{and the smell}} of alcohol <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> McNeely failed field-sobriety tests administered by the officer. After refusing to blow into a handheld breathalyzer, and stating that he would refuse a breathalyzer at the police station, the officer drove McNeely directly to a medical center instead of the station. The officer did not seek a warrant to conduct the blood test, but asked McNeely for his consent. McNeely was warned by the officer that by refusing a chemical test, his license would be revoked for one year. McNeely continued to refuse, and at 2:35 a.m., the officer proceeded to instruct the lab technician to draw a specimen of blood from McNeely. The results of the blood test showed a BAC of 0.154 percent, which was above the state's legal limit of 0.08 percent. McNeely was charged with driving while intoxicated, and later moved to suppress the results of his blood test, as he argued that it was done unconstitutionally as an unreasonable search and seizure.|$|E
