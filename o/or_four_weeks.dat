5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks,</b> and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|The regular {{army was}} {{supported}} by the Territorial Force, and by reservists. In August 1914, there were three forms of reserves. The Army Reserve of retired soldiers was 145,350 strong. They were paid 3Shillings and 6pence a week (17.5pence) worth about £70 per week in 2013 terms, and had to attend 12 training days per year. The Special Reserve had another 64,000 men and was a form of part-time soldiering, similar to the Territorial Force. A Special Reservist had an initial six months full-time training and was paid the same as a regular soldier during this period; they had three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> training per year thereafter. The National Reserve had some 215,000 men, who were on a register that was maintained by Territorial Force County Associations; these men had military experience, but no other reserve obligation.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Waller went to New York City to be a tutor, {{but left}} after three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks.</b> This {{was the last}} time in his life that he was paid as a teacher but he still opened and funded some schools. He opened a {{classical}} school in Bloomsburg, which was built in 1839, and he contributed $3500 to it. Shortly after arriving in Bloomsburg, he organized a singing school and also created a Bible class in 1839. The class continued until after his death. He helped to open Bloomsburg's State Normal School. He was appointed a trustee of Lafayette College in 1849 by the Synod of Philadelphia. He held that position until 1879. He was also on Lafayette College's Ways and Means committee and helped stop the college from closing in 1852. In 1856, Waller helped convert a classical school into the Bloomsburg Literary Institute and served as one of the nine initial trustees. He resigned from being a trustee in 1866 after a dispute about where to set up a new building for the institute. Despite resigning from the trustees, he helped conduct the opening ceremony of the institute's new building on April 3, 1867.|$|E

Although the materials are alike, differences in the manufacturing processes determine if the resulting lens will be a [...] "daily disposable" [...] or one recommended for two <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>week</b> replacement. However, sometimes manufacturers use absolutely identical lenses and just repackage them {{with different}} labels.|$|R

The {{first part of the}} institute consists of two weeks of workshops on topics like community archiving, linguistics, audio and video recording, language teaching, and activism. The workshops are followed by a three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>week</b> practicum where participants work intensively with speakers of a language to document it.|$|R

40|$|Lesion {{paradigms}} used {{to assess}} regeneration potential of DRG neurons (A) In conditioning after CNS injury, initially a dorsal column lesion (DCL) was made, followed by a peripheral sciatic nerve injury (PL) after two, <b>four</b> <b>or</b> eight <b>weeks.</b> Three days later, DRGs were dissected out. (B) In conditioning lesion before CNS injury, the sciatic nerve was cut and three days later the dorsal columns were lesioned.

500|$|Lee divided {{his forces}} into {{multiple}} columns, spread apart widely {{as he moved}} into Maryland and also maneuvered to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. This was a risky move for a smaller army, but Lee was counting on his knowledge of McClellan's temperament. He told one of his generals, [...] "He is an able general but a very cautious one. His army {{is in a very}} demoralized and chaotic condition, and will not be prepared for offensive operations—or he will not think it so—for three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks.</b> Before that time I hope to be on the Susquehanna."

The following day, Edward Stone, attorney for the Lexington committee, sent Beach a letter formalizing the contract. [...] Beach would not be paid unless the Commission of Fine Arts approved the plaster models. Beach replied to Stone on the 4th, relating that he had spoken to James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel and sculptor member of the commission, and had been informed that the commission had just had its monthly meeting, but that a quorum could be assembled to approve the coin. Beach noted that the Mint would take three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> to begin striking coins once final approval was given; he had discussed this with Chief Engraver George T. Morgan in 1924. Morgan had recently died, but Beach did not expect the new chief engraver, John R. Sinnock, to cause any additional delays.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how voltage {{total harmonic distortion}} (VTHD) indices obtained from medium voltage sites calculated over different assessment periods vary across a year. The aim {{of the study is}} to determine how much variation is present in VTHD indices calculated using a one week assessment period and, if the variation is large, attempt to determine an assessment period which reduces the variability to an acceptable level. The study findings indicate that there is significant variation in indices calculated using the commonly used weekly assessment period. It is clear that monitoring for one random week at any given time during the year is not acceptable for compliance evaluation as the error between the minimum weekly value and the maximum weekly value across the year can be very large. Moving to a two <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>week</b> assessment period reduces the variation, however a quarterly assessment interval is required to reduce variation to a level that may be acceptable...|$|R
