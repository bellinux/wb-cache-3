5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, Providence {{was one of}} the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest {{industrial}} manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products from steam engines to precision tools to silverware, screws, and textiles. Giant companies were based in or near Providence, such as Brown & Sharpe, the Corliss Steam Engine Company, Babcock & Wilcox, the Grinnell Corporation, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, Nicholson File, and the Fruit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Loom</b> textile company.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> {{development}} path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> {{is a key}} to study on <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> in ancient China. Based on the studies on historical materials and archeological findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> in ancient China, we found that there were two paths in <b>the</b> development process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> in ancient China. Before the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), plain weave and figure-weave fabrics were produced on similar <b>looms.</b> But after <b>the</b> Han Dynasty, <b>the</b> two kinds <b>of</b> <b>looms</b> evolved into all kinds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treadle <b>loom,</b> <b>the</b> multi-heald and multi-treadle <b>loom</b> and <b>the</b> draw <b>loom...</b>|$|R

40|$|To make {{efficiency}} {{analysis and}} to increase efficiency of a weaving hall, {{it is necessary to}} obtain and then analyze technical and weaving data received from looms. In small and mid-size weaving halls, generally technical data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>looms</b> are kept by responsible technical personnel. Data processing without a defined automation makes efficiency analysis of weaving hall more complex, or may decrease liability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis. In this paper, a data acquisition system that uses controller area network (CAN) for <b>the</b> efficiency analysis <b>of</b> <b>looms</b> where developed and implemented in a mid-size weaving hall is presented.

25|$|The {{technically}} more advanced, stationary vertical looms {{are used}} in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loom,</b> {{while there is no}} limit to the length of the carpet that can be woven on a vertical roller beam loom. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loom</b> beams.|$|E

40|$|Rear-end {{collisions}} {{account for}} about one-third of all traffic crashes on a yearly basis. It has been apparent {{for some time that}} the key to perceiving a slower vehicle ahead of us as an imminent hazard, i. e., one re-quiring immediate action, is a sufficient rate <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead vehicle. This is known as the “looming threshold”, among other things. A number of laboratory researchers have reported values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>looming</b> threshold to be in <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 0. 003 radian/sec. Forensic practitioners routinely use elevated values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>looming</b> threshold, e. g., 0. 005 - 0. 008, to account for <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> real-world driving tasks. However, only one source has used data from actual vehicle accidents to arrive at a looming threshold – and that value, 0. 0275 rad/sec, is an order of magnitude larger than that derived from laborato-ry studies. In this study, we examine a much broader range of real-world accident data to obtain an estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasonable upper end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>looming</b> threshold. <b>The</b> results show a range of 0. 0397 to 0. 0117 rad/sec, for presumed perception-reaction times (PRTs) of 0. 75 and 2. 0 seconds, respectively. We discuss the implications for forensic human factors analysis of rear-end crashes...|$|R

25|$|Looms do {{not vary}} greatly in {{essential}} details, {{but they do}} vary in size and sophistication. The main technical requirement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loom</b> is to provide the correct tension and the means of dividing the warps into alternate sets of leaves.
