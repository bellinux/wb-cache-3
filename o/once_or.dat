5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|An older snake may shed {{its skin}} only <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice a year, but a younger, still-growing snake, may shed {{up to four}} times a year.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether John Doukas married <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice. The name of only one wife, Zoe Doukaina, is known. She was the {{daughter}} of Constantine Doukas and Anna Doukaina, whose exact identity is unclear. If he married twice, then his first marriage took place c. 1150, and his unknown first wife must have died c. 1165. If Zoe Doukaina was indeed his second wife, this marriage took place c. 1170.|$|E
5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice per week.|$|E

5|$|The {{avifauna}} of Puerto Rico {{is composed}} of 349 species, 18 of which are endemic to the archipelago. Almost half of the species (166) are accidental, meaning {{that they have been}} sighted only <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice, and 42 of the species have been introduced, either directly or indirectly (mainly through habitat alteration), by humans. Approximately 120 species, including both native and introduced, breed regularly in the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least <b>once</b> <b>or</b> a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered {{numerous}} samples of products by merchandisers who required a licence {{to be allowed}} to sell them such as clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games. Epstein rejected all of them; directing the merchandisers to Byrne instead, who was already in New York ensconced in The Drake Hotel on Park Avenue at 56th Street. Byrne rented expensive offices on Fifth Avenue, hiring two limousines (on 24-hour standby) and a helicopter to fly clients to and from the airport, insisting that only the presidents of merchandising companies were allowed to talk directly with him, or with his partner, Lord Eliot, who helped to promote the company name with use of his title. Eliot would later recall going to the Seltaeb office <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice a week to draw $1,000 from petty cash.|$|E

5|$|From 2000 to 2011, {{the stadium}} was the almost-permanent home of Welsh football. The {{national}} team played {{the vast majority}} of home matches at the Millennium Stadium, with a handful of friendly matches <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice a year at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham or Liberty Stadium, Swansea. The first Welsh football game at the stadium was played against Finland in 2000, and drew a then-record home crowd for Welsh football of over 66,000. This has since been beaten on several occasions. However, since 2011, the majority of home games have been played at the smaller Cardiff City Stadium, the home of Cardiff City.|$|E
5|$|Museum curators {{consider}} {{visitors who}} pick up {{items from the}} ground to be thieves, and local police will charge them as such. The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of ten years. On 22 June 2015, two British youths from the Perse School were convicted of theft after picking up buttons and shards of decorative glass they found on the ground near the area where camp victims' confiscated personal effects were stored. The boys, both 17 years old, received probation and were fined £170, but later appealed the sentence. Curators said that similar incidents happen <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice a year.|$|E

5|$|Spanish rule {{eventually}} {{contributed significantly}} to bringing political unity to the fragmented states of the archipelago. From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain and then was administered directly from Madrid after the Mexican War of Independence. The Manila galleons, the largest wooden ships ever built, were constructed in Bicol and Cavite. The Manila galleons were accompanied with a large naval escort as it traveled to and from Manila and Acapulco. The galleons sailed <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice a year, between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Manila Galleons brought with them goods, settlers and military reinforcements destined for the Philippines, from Latin America.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Mountain sheep is a {{hardy breed}} that can scrape {{a living from}} the mountainous {{habitats}} where they spend the whole year. Being adept at exploiting their environment, they have local knowledge of their mountains and are {{left to their own}} devices, being gathered <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice a year. Originally often horned, and various shades of brown or black, they were often of poor conformation and bedraggled appearance. More recently, scientific breeding has improved them and they have been exported to many parts of the world. They form part of the ancestry of various local breeds of sheep in Wales, the Llanwenog, the Lleyn sheep, the Kerry Hill, the badger-faced, the Welsh mule and the Beulah speckle-faced. In rural areas, sheep are still an important part of life with local livestock shows and sheep dog trials taking place annually.|$|E
5|$|The {{lyrics of}} the Epistles {{describe}} {{a gallery of}} fictional and semi-fictional characters who take part in more or less real events {{in and around the}} Stockholm of Bellman's time. This cast includes some 44 named personages, many of whom appear only <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice. Some, like the principal characters Jean Fredman and Ulla Winblad, are based on real people, and in Fredman's case his real name was used. The Fredman of the Epistles is an alcoholic former watchmaker, and is the central character and fictional narrator. He is thus supposedly present in all the Epistles, but is only named in a few of them. The backdrop of many of the Epistles, Stockholm's taverns, is also frequented by musicians including Christian Wingmark on flute, Father Berg on various instruments, Father Movitz, and the dance master Corporal Mollberg.|$|E

5|$|The temple is a {{focal point}} of festivals of the Chinese {{community}} in Penang. The Chinese New Year celebrations are particularly impressive. For 30 days following Chinese New Year, the temple remains open until late at night whilst thousands of lights turn the scenery into a sea of light. During the festival days, the complex is decorated with thousands of lanterns representing donations offered by devotees. Another festive feature is the long marches undertaken by hundreds of monks from Thailand to the temple, <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice in a year.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} descriptions, {{the body of}} the Lesser Antillean macaw was red and the wings were red, blue and yellow. The tail feathers were between 38 and 51cm (15 and 20 in) long. Apart from the smaller size and the all-red coloration of the tail feathers, it resembled the scarlet macaw and may therefore have been a close relative of that species. The bird ate fruitincluding the poisonous manchineel, was monogamous, nested in trees and laid two eggs <b>once</b> <b>or</b> twice a year. Early writers described it as being abundant in Guadeloupe, but it was becoming rare by 1760, and only survived in uninhabited areas. Disease and hunting by humans are thought to have eradicated it shortly afterwards. The Lesser Antillean macaw is one of 13 extinct macaw species that have been proposed to have lived in the Caribbean islands. Many of these species are now considered dubious because only three are known from physical remains, and there are no extant endemic macaws on the islands today.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the player {{can choose to}} talk to demons encountered on the field, and attempt to recruit them to their party; {{the success of this}} depends on the player's level, with more powerful demons only being recruitable if the player's level is sufficiently high. In Ronde, the player does not initiate these conversations themselves, however: instead, defeated demons sometimes choose to talk to the player, and sometimes decide to join their party. Like in other Megami Tensei games, the player can fuse multiple allied demons with each other, thereby creating more powerful demons. In Ronde, the player can form contracts with demons, allowing human characters to use demon magic. Demons are fueled by magnetite, so the player needs to manage the supply of this, and thus cannot have too many allied demons on the field at <b>once</b> <b>or</b> take too long to finish a battle. By clearing battles, the player can advance to the next chapter. The games' stories are affected by player choices, and have multiple endings.|$|E
