40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to assess ways to improve plant {{availability}} of an organisation in order to reduce its reactive maintenance from its current level of 30 %. The pharmaceutical products the <b>organisation</b> (<b>name</b> withheld) produces are in short supply. It is vital the equipment that produces these products are reliable and produce quality products all the time. Loss of one batch due to equipment malfunction not only equates to loss of revenue but also the loss of vital medications which could jeopardise patient safety. This paper solely focuses and reports on the SIRFrt method to assess plant reliability in order to achieve maintenance excellence. There are seven elements that can impact maintenance excellence, however the {{focus of this}} paper is on reliability improvement since the audit scores were low in comparison to the other elements considered under the SIRFrt method. As a result of using feedback gained through the SIRFrt method assessment, it is anticipated that reactive maintenance will reduce below 10 %...|$|E
40|$|Many proper {{names are}} widely used metonymically. Thus, for example, <b>organisation</b> <b>names</b> {{can be used for}} {{products}} produced by the organisation, members of an organisation or events associated with the organisation. Their treatment is crucial for many natural language processing tasks like question answering and anaphora resolution. At the moment, language resources do not contain the necessary information for large-scale metonymy processing. As a contribution, we describe a general framework for annotating metonymies in domainindependent text that considers the regularity, productivity and underspecification of metonymic usage. We will then concentrate on two fully worked out annotation schemes for location and <b>organisation</b> <b>names</b> and rigorously evaluate these schemes as to their reliability. We also present a gold standard corpus consisting of 4000 annotated occurrences of location and <b>organisation</b> <b>names</b> in the British National Corpus. We use this corpus to examine the distribution of metonymies as well as for experiments in automatic metonymy resolution. ...|$|R
