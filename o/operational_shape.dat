For example, the Battle of Midway is often cited as a decisive operational victory for the US {{despite the fact that}} the Pacific War ended more than three years later with the decisive strategic victory of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which directly led to the Japanese surrender; this is because the Midway operation represented the destruction of the majority of the IJN's offensive carrier forces, which decisively stopped both the IJN's string of unbroken victories in combat and their plans to expand eastward into Midway Island, Hawaii, the Aleutian Islands and potentially the US mainland.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a vibration based procedure for locating reductions of stiffness in two-dimensional structures {{that can be}} modeled as plates. This procedure is a generalization to the two-dimensional case of the previously published Interpolation Damage Detection Method (IDDM). The method {{is based on the}} definition of a damage sensitive feature in terms of the accuracy of a spline function in interpolating the <b>operational</b> displacement <b>shapes</b> of the structure. These latter are recovered from frequency response functions (FRFs) measured at different locations of the structure during vibrations. At the i-th location, the FRF is calculated through spline interpolation using the FRF’s recorded at the all the instrumented locations but the i-th. For two-dimensional structures a spline surface is defined to interpolate the <b>operational</b> <b>shapes.</b> The accuracy of the spline interpolation is measured by an error function defined as the difference between the measured and interpolated <b>operational</b> mode <b>shapes.</b> At a certain location an increase (statistically meaningful) of the interpolation error, with respect to a reference configuration, points out a localized variation of the <b>operational</b> <b>shapes</b> thus revealing the existence of damage.

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} seen as a viable {{alternative}} energy option for future energy demand. The blades of wind turbines are generally regarded as the most critical component of the wind turbine system. Ultimately, the blades act as the prime mover of the whole system which interacts with the wind flow during the production of energy. During wind turbine operation the wind loading cause the deflection of the wind turbine blade which can be significant and affect the turbine efficiency. Such a deflection in wind blade not only will result in lower performance in electrical power generation but also increase of material degradation due high fatigue life and can significantly shorten the longevity for the wind turbine material. In harnessing stiffness of the blade will contribute massive weight factor and consequently excessive bending moment. To overcome this excessive deflection due to wind loading on the blade, it is feasible to use shape memory alloy (SMA) wires which has ability take the blade back to its optimal <b>operational</b> <b>shape.</b> This paper details analytical and experimental work being carried out to minimize blade flapping deflection using SMA. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new procedure, {{addressed}} as Interpolation Damage Detecting Method (IDDM), is investigated {{as a possible}} mean for early detection and location of light damage in a structure struck by an earthquake. Damage is {{defined in terms of}} the accuracy of a spline function in interpolating the <b>operational</b> mode <b>shapes</b> (ODS) of the structure. At a certain location a decrease (statistically meaningful) of accuracy, with respect to a reference configuration, points out a localized variation of the <b>operational</b> <b>shapes</b> thus revealing the existence of damage. In this paper the proposed method is applied to a numerical model of a multistory frame, simulating a damaged condition through a reduction of the story stiffness. Several damage scenarios have been considered and the results indicate the effectiveness of the method to assess and localize damage for the case of concentrated damage and for low to medium levels of noise in the recorded signals. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm {{is that it does not}} require a numerical model of the structure as well as an intense data post-processing or user interaction. The ODS are calculated from Frequency Response Functions hence responses recorded on the structure can be directly used without the need of modal identification. Furthermore the local character of the feature chosen to detect damage makes the IDDM less sensitive to noise and to environmental changes with respect to other damage detection methods. For these reasons the IDDM appears as a valid option for automated post earthquake damage assessment, able to provide after an earthquake, reliable information about the location of damage...|$|R

40|$|Modal filter {{is a tool}} {{to extract}} the modal {{coordinates}} of each individual mode from the system outputs by mapping the response vector from the physical space to the modal space [11]. In the field of damage detection modal filtration has many advantages, including: its autonomous operation (without the interaction of qualified staff), low computational cost and low sensitivity to changes in external conditions. However, {{the main drawback of}} this group of damage detection methods is its limited applicability to operational data. The modal filtration of the responses spectra (in place of frequency response functions), proposed in the literature, often does not give the expected results, working properly only for excitation in the form of white noise, or an ideal impulse. In other cases, for example in rotational machines, when in the response spectrum the rotational velocity harmonics dominate it can give wrong results. For such cases authors propose to use a new type of spatial filter, similar to modal filter with the difference that it has ability to filter the <b>operational</b> deflection <b>shape</b> components from the system response. Its application together with classical modal filter allows for damage detection using operational data with other type of excitation.

The acoustical optimization of this problem leads to the major goal conflict: improvement of the vibrational isolation of the rear axle versus excellent driving dynamics of the vehicle. A possible solution for this issue is in focus of a research project at Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU in cooperation with Mercedes AMG GmbH.

40|$|Presented is a dynamics-based {{boundary}} effect evaluation (BEE) {{method for}} pinpointing crack locations and estimating crack sizes using only <b>operational</b> deflection <b>shapes</b> (ODSs) {{measured by a}} scanning laser vibrometer. An ODS consists of central and boundary solutions. Central solutions are periodic functions, and boundary solutions are exponentially decaying functions due to boundary constraints. The BEE method uses a sliding-window curve-fitting technique to extract boundary solutions from an experimental ODS. Because cracks introduce localized small boundaries to a structure, boundary solutions exist around cracks as well as structural boundaries. Since crack-induced boundary solutions show characteristics {{different from those of}} actual boundaries, cracks can be easily located. A local strain energy method is derived for estimating crack sizes. In the method, the crack-induced strain energy extracted from an ODS is compared with the one calculated using stress intensity factors to determine the crack size. To verify the capability and accuracy of this BEE method, experiments are performed on six 2200 100 0 : 2500 2024 -T 4 aluminum beams each having a through-the-width Mode I crack at its midpoint.

40|$|Low-density {{cellular}} solids {{have demonstrated}} superior mechanical properties {{as well as}} multifunctional characteristics, which may {{provide a basis for}} the development of novel structured materials. In particular, cellular solids offer great design flexibility, owing to their topology, which can provide desired functionalities via targeted geometric design and proper selection of the constituent material. While stochastic configurations such as metallic foams have proven to be effective for both thermal insulation and mechanical-energy absorption, the topology of deterministic architectures is not constrained by physical processes. This allows for a variety of configurations to be tailored to simultaneously fulfill disparate tasks. An additional aspect of deterministic cellular structures is the possibility of assembling materials or structures by the spatial repetition of a unit cell. The resulting periodicity of such systems simplifies the characterization of physical properties, which can be established by analyzing the unit cell only, and will provide new opportunities in the fields of structural dynamics, where periodicity-induced impedance leads to the control of both constructive and destructive interference on propagating waves. The objective of this work is to investigate the application of the chiral cellular topology for the design of novel macrostructural, mesostructural and microstructural configurations. A truss-core airfoil, and a truss-core beam are employed as a basis to demonstrate both large-displacement capabilities within the elastic regime of the constituent material, as well as <b>operational</b> deflection <b>shapes</b> with localized dynamic deformations. Large deformation capabilities and unique <b>operational</b> deflection <b>shapes</b> are to be attributed to the unusual deformation mechanism of the chiral lattice. Mesostructural and microstructural configurations, on the other hand, are characterized by an unique mechanical behavior, complex geometry, as well as geometric design flexibility to control both static and dynamic phenomena. The propagation of elastic waves, moreover, is characterized by significant band-gap density as well as strong energy focusing dependent on frequency and wavenumber. These features suggest the chiral topology as a basis for the development of acoustic meta-materials. Ph. D.
