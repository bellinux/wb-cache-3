The period ended with the teams tied 2–2.|$|E
5|$|Ehrhoff {{is known}} as an {{offensive}} defenceman. He has strong skating ability, which allows him to quickly carry the puck up the ice, starting plays from his team's defensive zone, as well as join offensive plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He also possesses a hard shot, which earns him significant time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> play. Upon joining the NHL with San Jose, he had to adjust his game to be more defensive. He gradually became counted upon more in defensive situations and has been used on the penalty kill, as well.|$|E

The temperature may decrease by 3°C, and wind power potentially decreases as winds are reduced by 0.7m/s.|$|E

5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978.

5|$|Both teams {{scored a}} goal {{each in the}} second and third periods.

Ottawa received another penalty less than a minute later, which sent Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding. A Flyers penalty against Radovan Somik for slashing Martin Havlat resulted in a power play goal for the Senators' Zdeno Chara, closing the score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second penalty of the game, for high-sticking.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{recorded}} two assists {{during his}} October 30 debut with the Rangers AHL team, {{now called the}} Hartford Wolf Pack.

Fast scored his first goal of the season on December 26, notching the game winner <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> play against Bridgeport Sound Tigers goalie Anders Nilsson. The game was part of a four-game point streak (two goals, two assists) that stretched from December 21 to December 29. Fast also set a team record on January 24 for fastest goal to start a period, scoring in the first seven seconds of the game against Springfield, beating Hartford's previous record by two seconds.|$|E
