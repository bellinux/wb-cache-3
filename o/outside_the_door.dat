Edward follows a path through a swamp and discovers the secret town of Spectre, the cheery locals claiming he was expected.

In the present day, Joséphine speaks to the bed-ridden Edward and asks him to tell her the story of how he met his wife Sandra, with Will listening <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Returning to his reminisces, Edward reunites with Karl and they visit the Calloway Circus, where Edward {{falls in love with a}} beautiful woman.

5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 5, 1877, Crazy Horse and Lieutenant Lee, {{accompanied}} by Touch the Clouds {{as well as a}} number of Indian scouts, departed for Fort Robinson. Arriving that evening outside the adjutant's office, Lieutenant Lee was informed that he was to turn Crazy Horse over to the Officer of the Day. Lee protested and hurried to Bradley's quarters to debate the issue, but without success. Bradley had received orders that Crazy Horse was to be arrested and taken under the cover of darkness to Division Headquarters. Lee turned the Oglala war chief over to Captain James Kennington, in charge of the post guard, who accompanied Crazy Horse to the post guardhouse. Once inside, Crazy Horse struggled with the guard and Little Big Man and attempted to escape. Just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Crazy Horse was stabbed with a bayonet by one of the members of the guard.

25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something {{he did not like}} he made these noises <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E
25|$|The parish {{church of}} the San Andrés {{municipality}} was begun in the first third of the 16th century and finished {{in the first half}} of the 17th.

[...] However, Logan adamantly refused, saying [...] "I told you, I'm not going with you anywhere". Logan then ran up the {{staircase}} and went into his former bedroom, now used as a guest bedroom, and closed the door. Arnaud and Magruder followed him to the room and stood <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Arnaud tried to convince Logan {{to come out of the}} room, as Logan's parents and Magruder, who had joined the department in February 2001, stood by, watching. After Logan's parents left the scene and went to the house's master bedroom, Logan became belligerent and uncooperative. Partially hidden behind a closet door, Logan retrieved a semi-automatic 9mm-chambered handgun and fired at Arnaud, where a bullet struck him in the throat and severed his carotid artery. Logan then shot Arnaud fatally in the chest.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 January 1386, Dame Nicole de Carrouges {{departed}} her chateau at Capomesnil for the neighbouring town of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives where she had legal business to attend to. Although the journey was only a short one, she apparently took {{some or all of}} the household servants with her, leaving her daughter-in-law unattended during the day. Marguerite's testimony then alleged that a man-at-arms named Adam Louvel knocked on the chateau door, which Marguerite opened herself in the absence of servants. According to Marguerite, Louvel then made enquiries about a loan he owed Jean de Carrouges before suddenly announcing that Jacques Le Gris was <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and insisted on seeing her. At her refusal, Louvel exclaimed that [...] "he loves you passionately, he will do anything for you and he greatly desires to see you". Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris then forced his way into the house and propositioned her, offering money if she would remain silent of their affair. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris then violently raped her with the aid of Louvel and threatened her not to tell anyone what had occurred on pain of death.|$|E

However, the Doctor realises that it is Amy's trust in him that is being challenged; it is that faith that brought them to the hotel in the first place. Amy soon becomes possessed like the others.

Inside, they find the illusion of young Amy, Amelia, still waiting for the return of her [...] "raggedy Doctor" [...] ("The Eleventh Hour"). The Doctor asserts to Amy that he is [...] "not a hero" [...] but [...] "just a mad man with a box" [...] to break her blind trust in him; once this is done, the beast <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> collapses on the floor.|$|E
