500|$|Chess {{has a very}} {{extensive}} literature. In 1913, {{the chess}} historian H.J.R. Murray estimated {{the total number of}} books, magazines, and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5,000. B.H. Wood estimated the number, as of 1949, to be about 20,000. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that, [...] "Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> have been printed." [...] There are two significant public chess libraries: the John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library, with over 32,000 chess books and over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals; and the Chess & Draughts collection at the National Library of the Netherlands, with about 30,000 books. Grandmaster Lothar Schmid owned the world's largest private collection of chess books and memorabilia. David DeLucia's chess library contains 7,000 to 8,000 chess books, a similar number of autographs (letters, score sheets, manuscripts), and about 1,000 items of [...] "ephemera". Dirk Jan ten Geuzendam opines that DeLucia's collection [...] "is arguably the finest chess collection in the world".|$|E
500|$|The ZX81's {{popularity}} was publicly {{demonstrated in}} January 1982 when civil servant Mike Johnstone organised a [...] "ZX Microfair" [...] at Westminster Central Hall. Seventy exhibitors set up stalls {{with only a}} few hundred visitors expected in a hall with a capacity of 650 people. More than 12,000 people came and the police had to control the crowd. Thousands, many of whom had travelled long distances, queued outside for up to three hours to get into the hall; Clarke, who was only able to enter after identifying himself as a journalist, wrote that [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> gave up in despair". The exhibitors sold thousands of pounds' worth of software and hardware [...] "as fast as three pairs of hands on each stall could hand them over and stuff the fivers into improvised overflowing cash boxes", he added. The fair also showed Sinclair Research's relatively unimportant role in the computer's success, with only small crowds at its booth compared to the [...] "rugby scrum" [...] elsewhere. By August 1983 seven more ZX Microfairs were held.|$|E
2500|$|Congress had to {{consider}} how to restore to full status and representation within the Union those southern states that had declared their independence from the United States and had withdrawn their representation. Suffrage for former Confederates {{was one of two}} main concerns. A decision needed to be made whether to allow just some or all former Confederates to vote (and to hold office). The moderates in Congress wanted virtually all of them to vote, but the Radicals resisted. They repeatedly imposed the ironclad oath, which would effectively have allowed no former Confederates to vote. Historian Harold Hyman says that in 1866 Congressmen [...] "described the oath as the last bulwark against the return of ex-rebels to power, the barrier behind which Southern Unionists and Negroes protected themselves." [...] Radical Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens proposed, unsuccessfully, that all former Confederates lose the right to vote for five years. The compromise that was reached disenfranchised many Confederate civil and military leaders. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> temporarily lost the vote, but one estimate was that it was as high as 10,000 to 15,000 out of a total white population of roughly eight million.|$|E

6000|$|And so he did; for {{though he}} was no Augustine to turn in an hour from worldly hopes and climb to sainthood through long years of inward strife, yet in aftertimes no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> false steps had been saved, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> small sins repented of, {{through the power of}} the memory that far away a generous woman waited to respect him, and in his secret soul he owned that one of the best moments of his life was that in which little Debby Wilder whispered [...] "No," [...] and kissed him.|$|R

Negotiations between Tippoo and the English went on till March, when a treaty was signed. By its provisions, Tippoo should have handed back all his prisoners. He murdered large numbers of them, but 1000 British soldiers, and 1600 Sepoys obtained their liberty. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> were retained of the number, calculated at 200,000, of natives carried off from the countries overrun by Hyder's troops. Only 2000 were released.|$|E

Then it ain't like the plains, where a party {{travelling}} can be seen by an Indian scout miles and miles away. It is all broken ground, canons and valleys and rocks. Then again, when we get {{on the other side of}} the Wind River they tell me there are big forests. That is so, chief, isn't it?" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{independent}} candidate in Derringham {{said he would}} make a legal challenge to the result as the Returning Officer had said 3,540 ballot papers had been returned but that when the results were declared 140 ballot papers were missing. The independents claimed that these missing papers had ended up in counting rooms for other wards. They also said that people in Derringham had received ballots in the post that were intended for Marfleet ward and that no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people this had affected and were thus unable to vote.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems that}} he wiped it off very quickly;--and since {{that he has}} wiped off another mark. <b>One</b> doesn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> marks he has wiped off.

60|$|They rode on horses--stolen horses, of course. The leopard {{heard the}} clatter of hoofs and looked back. Junkie drew nearer to the gnarled tree; the leopard looked forward. Never was savage beast more {{thoroughly}} perplexed. Anxiety glared in his eyes; exasperation grinned in his teeth; indecision quivered in the muscles of his tail. Just at that moment Booby caught sight of his spotted skin. Had the leopard been less perturbed {{he would have been}} too wise to allow his carcass to appear. A poisoned arrow instantly quivered in his flank. It acted like a spur; with an angry growl and a clear bound of no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> feet, he re-entered the jungle and fled to the mountains.|$|E
60|$|So {{passed that}} first year, which many an {{intending}} missionary before Patteson {{has found a}} crucial test which he has not taken into his calculations. The soreness of the wrench from home is still fresh, {{and there is no}} settled or regular work to occupy the mind, while the hardships are exactly of the kind that have not been anticipated, and are most harassing, though unsatisfying to the imagination, and all this when the health is adapting itself to a new climate, and the spirits are least in time, so that the temper is in the most likely condition to feel and resent any apparent slight or unexpected employment. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> high hopes have sunk, how many intended workers have been turned aside, by this ordeal of the first year.|$|E
50|$|The Open Era, {{in which}} {{professional}} players {{are allowed to}} compete alongside amateurs, began in 1968. The first open tournament was the British Hard Court Championships in Bournemouth. At the first Open Wimbledon the prize fund difference was 2.5:1 in favour of men. Billie Jean King won £750 for taking the title while Rod Laver won £2,000. The total purses of both competitions were £14,800 for men and £5,680 for women. Confusion also reigned as no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> open tournaments there were supposed to be. The tournaments that {{did not want to}} provide prize money eventually faded out of the calendar, including the U.S. Eastern Grass Court circuit with stops at Merion Cricket Club and Essex county club.|$|R
50|$|Physical {{meaning of}} the eddy {{covariance}} method At one physical point on the tower, at Time1, Eddy1 moves parcel of air c1 down at the speed w1. Then, at Time2, Eddy2 moves parcel c2 up at the speed w2. Each parcel has gas concentration, pressure, temperature, and humidity. If these factors, along with the speed are known, we can determine the flux. For example, if <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> molecules of water went down with eddies at Time 1, and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> molecules went up with eddies at Time2, at the same point, one could calculate the vertical flux of water at this point over this time. So, vertical flux can be presented as a covariance of the vertical wind velocity and the concentration of the entity of interest.|$|R

60|$|Lord Ballindine's horse, Brien Boru, {{was destined}} to give the Saxons a {{dressing}} at Epsom, and put no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> thousands into his owner's hands, by winning the Derby; and arrangements had already been made for sending him over to John Scott, the English trainer, at an expense, which, if the horse should by chance fail to be successful, would be of very serious consequence to his lordship. But Lord Ballindine had made up his mind, or rather, Blake had made it up for him, and the thing was to be done; the risk was to be run, and the preparations--the sweats and the gallops, the physicking, feeding, and coddling, kept Frank tolerably well employed; though the whole process would have gone on quite as well, had he been absent.|$|E
6000|$|... "It sounds dreadful, doesn't it, Mary, {{to think}} that I should have laid hands upon a bishop, and such a bishop, a man who regards himself as the {{greatest}} in Portugal. However, {{there was no other}} way of getting the ring, and I could not see how, without it, I could persuade the lady superior to leave her convent with you all; and to tell you the truth, I would rather have got it that way than any other. The bishop is, in my opinion, a man who deserves no respect. He has terrorized all the north of Portugal, has caused scores of better men than himself to be imprisoned or put to death, and has now by his folly and ignorance cost the lives of no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> thousand men, and brought about the sack of Oporto." ...|$|E

There will be great changes, {{revolutions}} no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> nor of what sort, save that in the end the haole will possess the land and the rule. And in that day you may well be first lady of Hawaii, just as surely as George Castner will be ruler of Hawaii. It is written in the books.

50|$|The {{estimates}} {{for the destruction of}} European Jewry grew throughout 1942 and 1943. Chaim Weizmann urged a re-evaluation of the Biltmore program in June 1943. Chaim Weizmann’s earlier estimate of 25% destruction declared at the Biltmore conference now seemed wildly optimistic.

Humberto Rozas Bonuccelli, both said, according to the Center for Public Integrity, [...] "they ran the National Intelligence Service in name only and that Montesinos was its de facto chief. Montesinos had Fujimori's authority to manage his own state funds and personnel without any oversight, Rozas said. '"Montesinos had a very independent way of working and it was compartmentalized. He had his own private revenues...had {{a group of people}} that worked exclusively for him, even though no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> they were or who they were.'Rozas said he discovered Montesinos' role in the arms sale to the FARC with the help of unspecified 'American' intelligence agents, who provided him with photocopies of documents concerning the transaction. The Americans, Rozas said in court testimony, [...] "wanted an investigation to be carried out to determine if the Peruvian army had bought these arms.' U.S. Embassy officials told ICIJ that it was the CIA that provided documents about the arms deal to Rozas." ...|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} iconic stature, the ruby {{slippers}} worn by Judy Garland {{in the film}} are now among the most treasured and valuable film memorabilia in movie history.
