5|$|According to O'Brien, <b>only</b> <b>he,</b> Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where they {{would have been able to}} hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{came into}} the 1984 Australian Championships as the favourite, {{but this time he}} was on the {{receiving}} end of a close result. He placed third in the 100m freestyle behind Mark Stockwell and Delany, missing individual selection by 0.05s. The trio was separated by a total of only 0.15s. Selected as a relay swimmer <b>only,</b> <b>he</b> went to Los Angeles hoping to win the 4100m freestyle relay, an event that the United States had always won.|$|E

5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when <b>only</b> <b>he</b> and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's assassin Godse made {{no attempt}} to escape and was seized by the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his {{collaborators}} were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if <b>only</b> <b>he</b> had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was born}} in the small rural village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton, part of western Bolivia's Oruro Department, on 26 October 1959. One of seven {{children}} born to Dionisio Morales Choque and Maria Ayma, <b>only</b> <b>he</b> and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood. His mother almost died from a postpartum haemorrhage following his birth. Ethnically identifying {{as a member of the}} indigenous Aymara people, in keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the placenta produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion. His childhood home was a traditional adobe house, and he grew up speaking the Aymara language, although later commentators would remark that by the time he had become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.|$|E

Trepkos and O'Neil are officially unaccounted for and presumed dead; Trepkos is last seen carrying O'Neil's body as he disappears into the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{authority}} was undermined when Oliver Cowdery, Hiram Page, and other church members also claimed to receive revelations. In response, Smith dictated a revelation which clarified his {{office as a}} prophet and an apostle, and which declared that <b>only</b> <b>he</b> held the ability to give doctrine and scripture for the entire church. Shortly after the conference, Smith dispatched Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, and others {{on a mission to}} proselytize Native Americans. Cowdery was also assigned the task of locating the site of the New Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Tan {{and four}} blind friends auditioned for the inaugural season of Project SuperStar, but <b>only</b> <b>he</b> was {{accepted}} as a contestant. Throughout the competition, there was extensive debate over whether viewers were voting for him out of sympathy and whether a blind man who could not dance deserved the title. Further controversy arose when his home address was posted online and fans offered him sex services. Nevertheless, he emerged as the male champion and entered the grand final against female champion Kelly Poon. The judges gave Poon more favourable reviews, but Tan garnered 64% of the 533,000 telephone votes. Both finalists also released limited edition singles; Tan's cover of 童话 (Fairytale) by Michael Wong sold 12,239 copies, while Poon's cover of 遗失的美好 (Lost Goodness) by Angela Chang sold 11,319 copies. Thus Tan became the grand champion and was awarded a recording contract with Play Music (later acquired by Warner Music).|$|E

5|$|The First Test was a {{continuation}} of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge <b>only</b> <b>he</b> and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. Wisden's verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, and blamed the first innings batting for the failure to prevenet defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified and should have been continued.|$|E
5|$|The Hemingway scholar Allen Josephs {{thinks the}} novel is {{centered}} on the corrida (the bullfighting), and how each character reacts to it. Brett seduces the young matador; Cohn fails to understand and expects to be bored; Jake understands fully because <b>only</b> <b>he</b> moves between {{the world of the}} inauthentic expatriates and the authentic Spaniards; the hotel keeper Montoya is the keeper of the faith; and Romero is the artist in the ring—he is both innocent and perfect, and the one who bravely faces death. The corrida is presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment of existentialism or nada (nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{he began}} {{by focusing on the}} 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships, and he won the 60m at the UK trials in 6.50seconds (a time <b>only</b> <b>he</b> had bettered in the previous two seasons). His closest competitor, Ivory Williams, received a ban for marijuana usage, leaving Chambers as a strong favourite. He was the fastest in all rounds of World 60m competition and surged ahead of Mike Rodgers in the final to win his first world title with a time of 6.48seconds. Banned from the 2010 Commonwealth Games, he set his sights on making the team for the 2010 European Athletics Championships.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, <b>only</b> <b>He</b> could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E
5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not <b>only</b> <b>he,</b> {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{finishes}} {{viewing the}} footage, and expresses his disgust {{to the station}} executives regarding their decision to air the documentary. To convince them otherwise, he shows them the remaining, unedited footage, which <b>only</b> <b>he</b> has seen. The final two reels begin with the team locating a Ya̧nomamö girl, whom the men film and gang-rape. Faye only tries to intervene when Alan participates. Afterwards, they encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of virginity. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Ya̧nomamö in revenge for the girl's rape and death. Jack is hit by a spear, and Alan shoots him so the team can film how the natives mutilate his corpse. As the three surviving team members try to escape, Faye is captured. Alan initially insists that they try to rescue her, but ultimately decides not to. Mark continues to film as she is raped, beaten to death, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then pursues and kills the last two team members as the camera drops {{to the floor and}} ends showing Alan's bloody face. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order the footage to be destroyed.|$|E
