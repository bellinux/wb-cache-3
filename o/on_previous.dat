As with previous builds, users must still opt-in and grant permission for the software to perform data collection and tracking in order to fully enable Cortana's personalized features. If this functionality is not enabled, Cortana operates in a feature-limited mode with basic web and device search functionality, nearly identical to the non-Cortana search experience <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> builds.|$|E

5|$|A {{midshipman}} in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) holds a commission, {{which is}} usually not issued until promotion to sub-lieutenant or lieutenant. Officer candidates enter the RAN at various ranks depending <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> experience or degree qualifications; graduates from a three-year course, non-degree qualified entrants, and sailor changeovers below the rank of leading seaman enter as midshipman.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the window}} is the album title {{and at the top}} of the cover is the band's name in a {{typeface}} more crafty than <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> album covers. Though the general design of the cover is that of a 1930s hotel in style, the typeface juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{played in}} red and white shirts in an FA Cup final for the first time, <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> {{occasions}} in 1930 and 32 they wore fully red shirts. Additionally, before the 1967/68 season, Arsenal only wore team badges on their shirts on special occasions, such as FA Cup Finals. The 1936 cup final was the fourth occasion such a badge was worn. Sheffield United also wore crested red and white shirts, their vertical stripe design.|$|E
5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> days as the process of erasing her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E

Later, in [61] the approach was refined by considering the two preceding frames.|$|R

5|$|In August 2009, the facelifted E Series 2 was {{released}} which {{uses the same}} drivetrain as the W427 with an upgraded dual plate clutch not found <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> models.

5|$|In May 2008, Obama asked Lu {{to begin}} {{planning}} for a possible presidential transition. Obama warned him to tell no one about the nascent operation, even his own wife, so Lu quietly rented a small office in D.C. and secretly met with people who had worked <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> Democratic presidential transition efforts. The planning efforts produced policy options {{on a wide range}} of topics, compiled names of and began vetting potential political appointees for top jobs, arranged over 100 security clearances, and managed the logistics for expanding the operations after Election Day.|$|E

5|$|No Code is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on August 27, 1996 through Epic Records. Following a troubled tour for its previous album, Vitalogy (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> releases, incorporating elements of garage rock and worldbeat.|$|E

For Kill or Be Killed, he is using digital tools and the same panel layout he has used <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> works, but removed the frame from the outside edges because he felt the full bleed makes the images feel more claustrophobic. Breitweiser, an {{integral}} part of the team, is coloring Phillips' art in a moody palette with gritty textures and incorporating color psychology.|$|E
5|$|Post-production {{work was}} handled mostly by Framestore CFC, {{who had worked}} <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> Guinness campaigns Surfer and Dreamer, and had worked with Daniel Kleinman {{on a number of}} outside projects, {{including}} several commercials and James Bond title sequences. The project was overseen by William Bartlett, known for his visual effects work on the BBC television documentary Walking with Dinosaurs.

5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors {{are essential to}} Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. As he did with the people around him, Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes {{that he had made}} <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> visits.|$|E

All have worked <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> Bond films. Daniel Kleinman returned to design the film's title sequence after stepping aside to allow graphic design studio MK12 to create the Quantum of Solace sequence.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, {{they are based}} <b>on</b> <b>previous</b> art works, rather than on direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E
