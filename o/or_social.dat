5|$|Jolin {{spent most}} of 1918 in Copenhagen, where he showed his {{paintings}} at an art gallery at Nikolaiplads. They sold well {{enough for him to}} stay in Denmark almost a year. Jolin enjoyed life in the Danish capital, the social life was more spontaneous than in Stockholm and people from different professions, <b>or</b> <b>social</b> standings, mixed with each other in a way that appealed to him.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes {{that we know of}} and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order.

5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political <b>or</b> <b>social</b> forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E
5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working.

The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology.

5|$|All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, {{including}} {{memory and}} communication.

5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer.

Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
5|$|Belarus {{was once}} a major center of European Jews, with 10% of the {{population}} being Jewish. But since the mid-20th century, the number of Jews has been reduced by the Holocaust, deportation, and emigration, so that today {{it is a very}} small minority of less than one percent. The Lipka Tatars, numbering over 15,000, are predominantly Muslims. According to Article 16 of the Constitution, Belarus has no official religion.
