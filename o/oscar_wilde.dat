5|$|<b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde,</b> a {{critical}} study by Arthur Ransome {{was published in}} 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. The trial in April 1913 was in a way a re-run of the trials of <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde.</b> The trial resulted from Douglas's rivalry with Robbie Ross for Wilde (and his need of money). Douglas lost after a reading of De Profundis refuted his claims.|$|E
5|$|Wilde's charm {{also had}} a lasting effect on Parisian literati, who {{produced}} several original biographies and monographs on him. André Gide, on whom Wilde had such a strange effect, wrote In Memoriam, Oscar Wilde; Wilde also features in his journals. Thomas Louis, who had earlier translated books on Wilde into French, produced his own L'esprit d'Oscar Wilde in 1920. Modern books include Philippe Jullian's <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde,</b> and L'affaire <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde,</b> ou, Du danger de laisser la justice mettre le nez dans nos draps (The <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde</b> Affair, or, On the Danger of Allowing Justice to put its Nose in our Sheets) by , a French religious historian.|$|E

The book contains a timeline of <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde's</b> life, includes some of his drawings and his famous letter to his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, known as De Profundis. Expurgated editions of De Profundis had been published by Wilde's literary executor Robbie Ross from 1905, but the 1962 edition published by Rupert Hart-Davis was the first full and correct version, made from the original manuscript in the British Museum.|$|R

5|$|In 1895, the Marquess of Queensbury {{was charged}} at Vine Street Police Station with libel against <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde.</b> This {{ultimately}} led to Wilde's arrest and subsequent imprisonment. On 29 May 1901, the stonemason James Schulty reported he had information about the murder of Mary Ann Austin but refused to reveal details anywhere except the Vine Street Police Station. The information was discarded by the Metropolitan Police as little value.|$|E
5|$|Public {{interest}} in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and exploited {{by members of the}} upper class. This attitude reached its climax a few years later when <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde</b> was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas.|$|E

William Ewart Gladstone gave evidence in the court against a blackmailer who claimed Gladstone had frequented prostitutes in Leicester Square, while the Marquess of Queensbury's libel trial against <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde</b> took place here in 1895.|$|E
5|$|By 1900, Rodin's artistic {{reputation}} was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set {{up near the}} 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the 18th to 20th century, it {{was home}} to Vine Street Police Station, which grew from a watch-house {{into one of the}} busiest police {{stations}} in the world. The Marquess of Queensberry was charged with libel against <b>Oscar</b> <b>Wilde</b> here in 1895. There was also a court house in the 18th and early 19th century. The street's association with law has led to it being grouped with Bow Street and Marlborough Street on the standard British Monopoly board.|$|E
