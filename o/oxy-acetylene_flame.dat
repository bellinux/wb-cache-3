A two-step solution approach is used. In the first step, a lumped chemistry model {{is used to calculate}} the flame shape, temperatures and hydrodynamics. In the second step, a detailed, 27 species / 119 elementary reactions gas phase chemistry model and a 41 species / 67 elementary reactions surface chemistry model are used to calculate radicals and intermediates concentrations in the gas phase and at the surface, as well as growth rates. Important experimental trends are predicted correctly, but there are some discrepancies.

It is demonstrated that gas-phase diffusion limitations play a minor role in the diamond growth process, which is determined by surface kinetics. Except for atomic hydrogen, gas phase diffusion is also of minor importance for the transport of species in and behind the flame front.

The present PhD thesis proposes the synthesis of several carbon-based materials using a unique and quite simple technique: the <b>oxy-acetylene</b> combustion <b>flame</b> method. From crystalline sp 3 - diamond to planar sp 2 - graphite, from the unidirectional nanotubes, needles and rods to bidimensional petals, a large variety of carbon materials are synthesized under the atmospheric pressure. These various carbon forms have been produced using a set of different experimental parameters. Both the input gas ratio and the substrate temperature are found to {{play a key role in}} the synthesis of these new carbon materials. The high quality of the graphitic phases can be correlated to the large acetylene content in the gas and to the high temperature of the substrate. Some specific morphologies such as petal-like single graphite crystals have been synthesized. Their sizes reach up to 20 mm. These bidimensional carbon materials are of particular importance to investigate fundamental physics in ideal low-dimensional systems. Polyhedral graphite crystals, which exhibit a unidirectional morphology, have also been produced. Their crystal structure is found to be highly graphitic although they display a cylindrical/polyhedral shape. Preliminary measurements of their field emission properties reveal a huge emission current, which is higher than the emission current obtained for multi-wall carbon nanotubes. The latter have also been synthesized in large amount and high quality using our <b>oxy-acetylene</b> combustion <b>flame</b> technique. At last, using again the same experimental set-up, a crystalline carbon nitride phase has been synthesized for the first time using a specific molecule called "melamine" as an organic precursor. Several experimental techniques, such as Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray diffraction and Raman and infra-red spectroscopies have been used to analyze both the chemical composition and the crystalline structure of this new material, revealing a graphitic-C 3 N 4 phase.

The System has an 8 bit micro controller based embedded system, which assures stipulated time response. A new window based Application software was devised which takes a standard CAD file. DXF as input and converts it into numerical data required for the controller. It uses VB 6 as a front end whereas MS-ACCESS and AutoCAD as back end. The system is designed around AT 89 C 51 RD 2, powerful 8 bit, ISP micro controller from Atmel and is optimized to achieve cost effectiveness and also maintains the required accuracy and reliability for complex shapes. The backbone {{of the system is}} a cleverly designed mechanical assembly along with the embedded system resulting in an accuracy of about 10 microns while maintaining perfect linearity in the cut. This results in substantial increase in productivity. The observed results also indicate reduced inter laminar spacing of pearlite with an increase in the hardness of the edge region.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} behaviour of diffusion and overlay coating, manufactured by pack cementation and {{high velocity oxygen fuel}} (HVOF) techniques, was studied under isothermal condition at {{a temperature of}} 1100 °C for up to 500 hours. Detailed analysis on oxide thickness coupled with cross section microstructure observation was carried out. The results shown sub-parabolic oxide growth for all samples. To simulate a real operating condition for the thermal barrier coating (TBC) system, high temperature <b>oxy-acetylene</b> <b>flame</b> based burner rig was designed, manufactured and calibrated. A maximum surface temperature of 1400 °C detected by a single wavelength pyrometer with a 700 °C through sample thickness thermal gradient was achieved. A TBC system in which the ceramic top layer deposited by air plasma spray (APS) technique was tested under such condition. Several damage/failure types were identified in comparison with samples tested under isothermal loading. A novel physical based mathematical moving boundary problem model utilizing asymptotic analysis that predicts the growth of the oxide layer on a binary bond coat system was proposed. The governing equations were discretized and solved numerically using finite difference and Newton’s iteration method respectively. Numerical results obtained from this model had shown a good qualitative agreement from comparison with the experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|Atomization is {{the most}} common method for {{producing}} powders from metal. There are three atomization methods in powder fabrication : water atomization, gas atomization, and centrifugal atomization. Atomization was being developed to increase powder quality and process productivity. A new atomization method is possible to find by using another energy resources. Oxy-acetylene can be used as an energy resource in atomization. In this research, powders are made by oxy-acetylene atomization method. Material in wire form is melted in <b>oxy-acetylene</b> <b>flame,</b> which has operating temperature around 3480 oC, and atomized to form a fine spray. The fine molten droplets rapidly solidify forming a powders. This research investigate the variation of wire diameter and flame gun attacking angle on atomization process efficiency and production rate. Wire material which used in this research is commercial steel wire with 0. 75 mm; 1. 25 mm; 1. 50 mm in diameter. Flame gun attacking angle is varied 25 o, 30 o, 35 o, 40 o, and 45 o. Result shows that oxy-acetylene atomization method can be used to produce metal powders. The characteristic of powders which produced by this  atomization method have spherical shape, 75 m – 90 m in size, oxidized, and carburized. The efficiency and production rate of the atomization process are around 12. 2 % and 0. 1429 gram/minute. This efficiency and production rate are influenced by wire diameter. Bigger wire diameter results higher efficiency, but lower production rate. For 1. 25 mm diameter of commercial wire steel, an optimum efficiency of atomization process, 15. 1 %,  are resulted by 30 o of flame gun attacking angle...|$|E
40|$|In this work, powders {{of three}} {{different}} compositions, each having 34 SiO 2 - 14. 5 P 2 O 5 - 1 CaF 2 - 0. 5 MgF (% wt) and ratio of CaO/MgO varying from 11. 5 : 1 to 1 : 11. 5 were thoroughly mixed and melted under <b>oxy-acetylene</b> <b>flame</b> in a fire clay crucible that made the glass formation cheaper in time and cost. The melt of each composition was quenched in water to form three different glasses. Every glass was sintered at 950 °C to form three glass ceramics named G 1, G 2 and G 3 respectively. To study the dissolution behavior, each sample was immersed in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 2, 5, 10, 20 and 25 days at room temperature. Thin film XRD analysis revealed that the samples with larger CaO/MgO ratio exhibited better bioactivity. pH of SBF increased efficiently in case of G 1 whereas in case of G 2 and G 3, this increase was slower due to greater amount of MgO. The concentrations of Ca, P, Mg and Si ions were measured by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. EDS analysis showed the increase in P and Ca ions and presence of C in G 1 after 5 days immersion and after 10 days, in case of G 2 indicating the higher formation rate of hydroxycarbonate Apatite layer in G 1 as compared to G 2 due to greater CaO/MgO ratio whereas in G 3 Mg-hydroxycarbonate apatite (Ca(Mg) 5 (CO 3) (PO 4) 3 (OH)) (heneuite) layer was recognized after 20 days showing the least bioactivity due to very large amount of Mg and the least CaO/MgO ratio...|$|E
