40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>learning</b> <b>communities</b> are {{becoming}} an invaluable component of educator instruction. By providing educators {{with access to}} teaching resources and best practices shared by their peers, these communities {{have been shown to}} improve the instructional practices of educators and produce increases in student learning.

A better understanding of the aforementioned dynamics can also benefit agencies that support these communities.

I also demonstrate how an understanding of the triadic closure process can be used to improve the performance of traditional resource recommendation systems.
