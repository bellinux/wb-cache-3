Considering the idea <b>of</b> <b>power</b> present in Morgenthau’s political thought the author indicates the flexibility of this concept as well as some Morgenthau’s warnings against a narrow and single-factor understanding <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Discussing the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> Poland the article underlines both material and some less tangible factors, including the social reception of the liberal reforms. The relations of Poland with Russia and Germany illustrate the relative character <b>of</b> <b>power</b> as both neigbours remain much more powerful countries in any aspects <b>of</b> <b>power</b> defined by Morgenthau. Besides, the Morgenthau’s concept <b>of</b> <b>power</b> helps to identify some regional problems that may destabilize the political relations in Europe. Thus the effective Polish foreign policy should be based on the proper evaluation <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and intentions <b>of</b> its two key neigbours as well as the understanding of mechanisms accompanying the power relations in the region...|$|R
