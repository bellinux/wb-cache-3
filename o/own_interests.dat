5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} factors, the revolt was often considered to either be a {{manipulation of the}} commoners by a reactionary elite against modernization, a successful Ottoman bid to hamper Egypt's efforts to liberate and unify its Arab lands, or was sidelined. The concept that the revolt's diverse participants were acting based on their <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> and actual grievances rather than manipulation was largely ignored in Palestinian historiography until recent decades.|$|E
5|$|Seven years {{following}} the Grand War, a battle fought between three nations, the newest Skullgirl, Marie, has emerged and begun to terrorize the Canopy Kingdom.

5|$|In {{this way}} they congregated {{a group of}} Christian Indians in the {{location}} {{of what is now}} the town of Rabinal. Las Casas became instrumental in the introduction of the New Laws in 1542, established by the Spanish Crown to control the excesses of the conquistadors and colonists against the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas. As a result, the Dominicans met substantial resistance from the Spanish colonists, who saw their <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> threatened by the New Laws; this distracted the Dominicans from their efforts to establish peaceful control over the Land of War.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little {{influence}} with President Van Buren. His penchant for wielding his power for his <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> did not abate. He lobbied the Senate to promote Samuel Milroy, whom he owed a favor, {{to the position}} of Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E

Las Casas secretly sent messages to Briones, attempting to buy his support against Olid. Briones, looking out for his <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> delayed his return. At this point, Las Casas' fleet was caught in a sudden storm and wrecked upon the Honduran coast, killing some of Las Casas' men. The survivors were captured by Olid.|$|E

5|$|Robert rewarded Ranulf for {{his advice}} during the {{invasion}} by entrusting {{him with the}} administration of the see of Lisieux. After Robert's defeat by Henry at Tinchebray in 1106, the bishop {{was among the first to}} make his peace with Henry, and returned to Durham. He retired from political life. Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury an able financier who was infinitely more acceptable to the nation. Although some historians have theorised that Ranulf's time in Normandy was as an agent of Henry, it appears that Ranulf was mainly looking out for his <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> and those of his family.|$|E
5|$|Supervised by his father, Georg Forster first {{undertook}} {{studies of}} the zoology and botanics of the southern seas, mostly by drawing animals and plants. However, Georg also pursued his <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> which led to completely independent explorations in comparative geography and ethnology. He quickly learned the languages of the Polynesian islands. His reports {{on the people of}} Polynesia are well regarded today, as they describe the inhabitants of the southern islands with empathy, sympathy and largely without Western or Christian bias.|$|E
5|$|When he {{ascended to}} the throne, Pedro II was {{only five years}} old. Until he came of age and {{would be able to}} exert his {{constitutional}} powers, a regency was created. It proved to be weak and to have little effective authority, which led the nation into anarchy, ravaged by political faction struggles and countless rebellions. Exploited as a tool by rival political factions in pursuit of their <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> Pedro II was manipulated into accepting an early elevation to majority status on 22 July 1840 at age 14, thus putting an end to nine years of chaotic regency rule.|$|E

5|$|Charles trusted Isabeau {{enough by}} 1402 {{to allow her}} to {{arbitrate}} the growing dispute between the Orléanists and Burgundians, and he turned control of the treasury over to her. After Philip the Bold died in 1404 and his son John the Fearless became Duke of Burgundy, the new duke continued the political strife in an attempt {{to gain access to the}} royal treasury for Burgundian interests. Orléans and the royal dukes thought John was usurping power for his <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> and Isabeau, at that time, aligned herself with Orléans to protect the interests of the crown and her children. Furthermore, she distrusted John the Fearless who she thought overstepped himself in rank—he was cousin to the King whereas Orléans was Charles' brother.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{when the}} new {{communist}} regime outlawed the Greek-Catholic Church and forcibly merged it into the Orthodox Church, Agârbiceanu refused to join the latter denomination, thus setting himself up against the authorities. However, these found {{his reputation as a}} writer valuable for their <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> and preferred to try and co-opt him. In 1953, after a five-year marginalization for his refusal to turn Orthodox, Agârbiceanu joined the editorial board of Anatol E. Baconsky's semi-official literary magazine, Steaua. He was granted the Order of Labor the following year, and promoted to titular member of the Academy in 1955. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1962, he was also awarded the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic, first class.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} a loan and a {{guarantee}} of Danish protection, Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark the right to nominate the bishop of Ösel–Wiek, an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30,000 thalers. Frederick II nominated his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop, who then took possession in April 1560. Lest Danish efforts create more insecurity for Sweden, Denmark made another attempt to mediate a peace in the region. Magnus at once pursued his <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick's consent and trying to expand into Harrien–Wierland (Harju and Virumaa). This brought him into direct conflict with Eric.|$|E

5|$|Muhanna {{was first}} {{appointed}} amir al-ʿarab to replace his father Isa ibn Muhanna in 1284. He was imprisoned by Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil in 1293, but released two years later. In 1300, he commanded a {{wing of the}} Mamluk army in the Third Battle of Homs against the Mongol Ilkhanate. He defected to the latter {{in the early years}} of Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad's reign (1310–1341), ushering in a policy of playing off the Mamluks and the Mongols to further his <b>own</b> <b>interests.</b> An-Nasir eventually banished Muhanna and his tribe to the depths of the Syrian Desert. Through mediation by the Ayyubid prince, al-Afdal Muhammad, Muhanna reconciled with an-Nasir in 1330 and remained loyal to the Mamluks until his death five years later.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians much {{preferred}} {{an alliance}} with the United Kingdom. The British had entered the First World War {{in response to the}} German violation of Belgian neutrality. The Belgian Channel ports had offered the German Imperial Navy valuable bases, and such an attack would offer the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe bases to engage in strategic offensive operations against the United Kingdom in the coming conflict. But the British government paid little attention to the concerns of the Belgians. The lack of this commitment ensured the Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the day before the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The lack of opposition to the remilitarisation served to convince the Belgians that France and Britain were unwilling to fight for their own strategic interests, let alone Belgium's. The Belgian General Staff was determined to fight for its <b>own</b> <b>interests,</b> alone if necessary.|$|E
5|$|While {{the swift}} {{transfer}} of power following Domitian's death had prevented a civil war from erupting, Nerva's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable, and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority. Upon his accession, he had ordered a halt to treason trials, {{but at the same}} time allowed the prosecution of informers by the Senate to continue. This measure led to , as everyone acted in his <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> while trying to settle scores with personal enemies, leading the consul Fronto to famously remark that Domitian's tyranny was ultimately preferable to Nerva's anarchy. Early in 97, a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso Crassus Frugi Licinianus failed, but once again Nerva refused to put the conspirators to death, much to the disapproval of the Senate.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the war, the Swiss {{troops were}} no longer bound along the Rhine and in the Grisons. The cantons {{concluded}} new mercenary contracts, so called capitulations, with the Duchy of Milan and soon got deeply involved in the Italian Wars, where Swiss mercenaries ended up fighting on both sides. The involvement of the Old Swiss Confederacy, acting in its <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> in these wars, was brought to an end by the defeat against French forces in the battle of Marignano in 1515 and a subsequent peace treaty with the French king in 1516, the so-called Eternal Peace. However, Swiss mercenaries from individual cantons of the federation continued to participate in the Italian Wars well beyond (until the middle of the 16th century) in the service of various parties and, following that peace with France, in particular {{in the service of the}} French king.|$|E
5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their <b>own</b> <b>interests</b> rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|As the Nameless officially do not exist, {{the upper}} echelons of the Gallian Army exploit {{the concept of}} {{plausible}} deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war.

One such member, Gusurg, becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects {{into the ranks of}} Calamity Raven, attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader, Dahau. At the same time, elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their <b>own</b> <b>interests.</b> Hounded by both allies and enemies, and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks, the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive {{while at the same time}} fight to help the Gallian war effort. This continues until the Nameless's commanding officer, Ramsey Crowe, who had been kept under house arrest, is escorted to the capital city of Randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor, the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason.|$|E
