An increase in productivity (defined as the <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> input) increases the flow of goods and services in the economy. As a response, consumption also rises. Hence, underdeveloped economies should aim to raise their productivity levels in all sectors of the economy, in particular agriculture and industry.|$|E
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E
5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E

25|$|The {{total energy}} output, 17.6 MeV, is one tenth {{of that with}} fission, but the {{ingredients}} are only one-fiftieth as massive, so the energy <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> mass is approximately five times as great.

50|$|To {{simplify the}} {{interpretation}} of a production function, {{it is common to}} divide its range into 3 stages. In Stage 1 (from the origin to point B) the variable input is being used with increasing <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit,</b> the latter reaching a maximum at point B (since the average physical product is at its maximum at that point). Because the <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> of the variable input is improving throughout stage 1, a price-taking firm will always operate beyond this stage.|$|E
50|$|In Stage 2, output {{increases}} at a decreasing rate, and {{the average}} and marginal physical product are declining. However, the average product of fixed inputs (not shown) is still rising, because output is rising while fixed input usage is constant. In this stage, the employment of additional variable inputs increases the <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> of fixed input but decreases the <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> of the variable input. The optimum input/output combination for the price-taking firm will be in stage 2, although a firm facing a downward-sloped demand curve might find it most profitable to operate in Stage 1.In Stage 3, too much variable input is being used relative to the available fixed inputs: variable inputs are over-utilized {{in the sense that}} their presence on the margin obstructs the production process rather than enhancing it. The <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> of both the fixed and the variable input declines throughout this stage. At the boundary between stage 2 and stage 3, the highest possible output is being obtained from the fixed input.|$|E

Impact of {{irrigation}} on poverty and environment in Ethiopia: draft {{proceedings of the}} symposium and exhibition, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 27 - 29 November 2007. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI). Although performance evaluation of irrigated agriculture has gained momentum since late 1980 s worldwide such attempt is rarely carried out in Ethiopia. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the performance of 7 irrigation schemes some of which are expected to contribute much to the national economy. Sugar cane is grown by three of these schemes whereas cotton is grown by three schemes and the remaining single scheme grows tobacco. With regards to management types both government agency and community managed schemes are considered. The scheme level values of water supply performance indicators show that there was no constraint of water availability and supply at scheme level. In general, schemes that grow sugar cane were found to have attained higher <b>outputs</b> <b>per</b> <b>units</b> of land and water used which ranges from 7794 ? 10834 US$/ha and 0. 24 ? 0. 55 US$/m 3 respectively. On the other hand, whether state farm or community managed, schemes that grow cotton have shown low <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>units</b> of land and water, i. e. 310 ? 385 US$/ha and 0. 01 ? 0. 05 US$/m 3 respectively. Large productivity performance differences have been observed between irrigation schemes with same cropping and management types. From scheme level performance values it is not simple to identify the area where and what is going wrong which is responsible for low performance. Generally, problems casing low productivity derive both in management and deterioration of physical structures. Hence investment on improvements of physical structures, management and operation of the system at all levels will bring substantial improvement in the performances of cotton producing schemes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{comparative}} study of MEA-based post-combustion CO 2 capture has been performed for NGCC, coal and biomass power cycles. With particular focus on overall electric efficiency and electricity <b>output</b> losses <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> of captured CO 2, {{the performance of the}} power cycles in consideration have been calculated and compared with respect to variation in desorber pressure in the capture process. For each of the cases, overall efficiency is rather insensitive to desorber pressure, as no major energy gains are obtained in the trade-off between steam extraction pressure, reboiler duty and CO 2 compression ratio. Whereas NGCC shows the lower efficiency penalty (7. 2 – 7. 4 %-units) at 90 % CO 2 capture ratio, the coal and biomass cases still show lower specific electricity <b>output</b> losses <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> of captured CO 2 (20 – 25 % lower than for NGCC), despite higher efficiency penalties.
