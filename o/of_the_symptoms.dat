40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} clear up some {{principles}} to <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> by addressing <b>the</b> Freudian and Lacanian texts in order to elucidate <b>the</b> constitution <b>of</b> meaning in <b>the</b> <b>symptom,</b> its genesis, its unconscious status, its relation to <b>the</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drive, and thereby to understand <b>the</b> jouissance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptom.</b> This implies to turn the principles that both Freud and Lacan state in their theory and thus to understand these questions: Why does a symptom come alive? How does a symptom achieve to say something? And even more, why does a subject enjoy his/her symptom?

5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous.

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected if any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{associated with the}} condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, {{they are not as}} good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms.</b>|$|E

5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are the return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms,</b> for example the combination of headache, signs of raised intracranial pressure and focal neurological abnormalities, or when alternative causes of headache and neurological abnormalities, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage, have been excluded.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} excess thyroid hormone {{typically}} {{respond to the}} administration of a non-selective beta blocker, such as propranolol (as most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> are driven by increased levels of adrenaline {{and its effect on}} the β-adrenergic receptors). Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants, such as high salt or carbohydrate intake, until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated.|$|E

40|$|V magistrskem delu bo podano antropološko razumevanje simptoma in prikazano, kako se antropološko razumevanje simptoma razlikuje od klasičnega psihiatričnega razumevanja simptoma. Namen dela je nakazati, da simptom ni zgolj fiziološka manifestacija, temveč simbolna konstrukcija, ki v nekakšni miniaturni obliki predstavlja zgoščeno strukturo kulture. Tako bo v delu simptom prikazan, kot socio-somatična tvorba, ki povezuje subjektivno s kolektivnim v kontekstu patologije, kakor tudi normalnosti. Prav tako, delo obravnava nekatere epistemološke ovire antropološkega razumevanja simptoma. V nalogi bo predstavljen tudi Lacanov koncept »sintoma«, pri čemer bo nakazano, kaj pomeni aplikacija tega koncepta na področje antropološkega preučevanja simptoma. This master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis offers anthropological {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> {{and shows}} how this differs from classical psychiatric understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptom.</b> <b>The</b> {{aim is to}} indicate that <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> {{is not only a}} physiological manifestation, but a symbolic construction that in some sort of miniature form presents a dence structure of a culture. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> will be introduced as a socio-somatic entity connecting the subjective with the collective, this in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> pathology, as well as, normality. Further, the thesis deals with some epistemological barriers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anthropological understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptom.</b> <b>The</b> work also presents Lacan 2 ̆ 7 s concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 synthome, 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 indicating <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> this concept to <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> anthropological study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptom...</b>|$|R

5|$|The term {{rumination}} {{is derived}} from the Latin word ruminare, which means to chew the cud.

5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E

Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores <b>of</b> 1 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is not present at all; scores <b>of</b> 2 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is slightly present; scores <b>of</b> 3 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is mildly severe; scores <b>of</b> 4 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is moderately severe; scores <b>of</b> 5 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is severe; and scores <b>of</b> 6 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive.

50|$|One of Milton Erickson’s {{foremost}} students, Ritterman originated <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> as {{a trance}} {{state that is}} actually suggested by various people and social structures.

5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|In {{the common}} {{presentation}} of acute low back pain, pain develops after movements that involve lifting, twisting, or forward-bending. The symptoms may start {{soon after the}} movements or upon waking up the following morning. The description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> may range from tenderness at a particular point to diffuse pain. It {{may or may not}} worsen with certain movements, such as raising a leg, or positions, such as sitting or standing. Pain radiating down the legs (known as sciatica) may be present. The first experience of acute low back pain is typically between the ages of 20 and 40. This is often a person's first reason to see a medical professional as an adult. Recurrent episodes occur in more than half of people with the repeated episodes being generally more painful than the first.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of {{lung cancer}} (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the {{original}} site {{by the time they}} have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E

5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.|$|E
5|$|Since {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective in treating influenza if given early (see treatment section, below), it can be important to identify cases early. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> listed above, the combinations of fever with cough, sore throat and/or nasal congestion can improve diagnostic accuracy. Two decision analysis studies suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza, the prevalence will be over 70%, and thus patients {{with any of these}} combinations of symptoms may be treated with neuraminidase inhibitors without testing. Even {{in the absence of a}} local outbreak, treatment may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15%.|$|E
5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me in {{many ways}} was a pivotal film for the Bond franchise, and was plagued since its {{conception}} by many problems. The first was the departure of Bond producer Harry Saltzman, who was forced to sell his half of the Bond film franchise in 1975 for £20million. Saltzman had branched out into several other ventures of dubious promise and consequently was struggling through personal financial reversals unrelated to Bond. This was exacerbated by the twin personal tragedies of his wife's terminal cancer and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of clinical depression in himself.|$|E
