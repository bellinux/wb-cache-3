40|$|Floor-fractured craters (FFCs) are a {{class of}} lunar craters defined by their {{distinctly}} shallow, often plate-like floors, and combinations of radial, con-centric, and polygonal floor-fractures; {{a variety of other}} interior features are often observed, such as moats, ridges, small dark-haloed pits, and patches of mare material. They were first classified by Schultz [1], who recognized eight overall types of floor-fractured crater. These eight subtypes have widely differing appearances, a factor that could provide insight into formation mechanisms (different manifestations of the same mechanism, or indicators of varying formation mechanisms). Two formation mechanisms for FFCs were initially proposed: 1) magmatic intrusion [1], in which magma rising toward the surface in dikes encountered low-density breccia lenses beneath crater floors and spread laterally to form sills, raising and fracturing the crater floor. 2) viscous relaxation [2], in which the properties of the crust permitted viscous flow {{in the vicinity of the}} crater, causing long-wavelength relaxation of the topography and uplift and fracturing of the crater floor. Critical to distinguishing between these two end-member hypotheses and identifying others is a quantitative assessment of the topography of FFCs and knowledge of their regional and local settings. The purpose of this study is to use newly available Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) altimeter and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) image data to provide an updated global catalog of the locations, classes, morphometric and morphologic characteristics of all lunar floor-fractured craters. We use the excellent 8 -class system initially described in Schultz [1] as a starting point for classification and the enhanced LOLA/LROC data sets to examine and categorize all FFCs; we found evidence for a new FFC class, discernably different from the previously existing types. Our approach, and the global categorization of all FFCs, permits the spatial distribution of each FFC-subtype to be plotted and assessed allowing for further investigation into FFC formation mechanisms. Upon completion, the data set will be made available <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> <b>site</b> <b>at</b> [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{management}} of the midcontinent sandhill crane (Grus canadensis) population requires having detailed information available {{on the distribution of}} subspecies and subpopulations throughout the annual cycle. The current study is being undertaken in partnership with several federal and state agencies and private organizations to obtain key information not currently available. We are monitoring crane movements throughout the year by attaching Platform Transmitting Terminals (PTTs) to plastic leg bands and with the aid of equipment on board orbiting NOAA weather satellites relocating the radiomarked individuals at 4 - 10 day intervals throughout the year. Twenty-one cranes were captured and radio-marked in the Central Platte River Valley in early spring 1998 and 1999. Results to date indicate the technique is well suited for obtaining the types of information being sought. Most of the radio-marked cranes after departing from the Platte River in spring staged again at sites in southern Saskatchewan but those of the Canadian subspecies (G. c. rowan i) breeding in Manitoba and Ontario staged in northwestern Minnesota. Distnbution of radio-marked individuals on the breeding grounds suggests that northeastern Russia may be a more important breeding area for lesser sandhill cranes (G. c. canadensis) than previously thought; 50 % of lesser sandhill cranes tagged to date (6 of 12) migrated to locations in northeastern Siberia. Onset offall migration occurred from mid-August to mid-September depending on latitude; fall staging was centered primarily in 3 areas of southern Saskatchewan with fewer radio-marked cranes staging in southwestern Manitoba and central North Dakota. Most radio-marked cranes have spent winter in west Texas, 2 (both G. c. rowani) have occupied sites near the Texas Gulf Coast, and 1 each spent winter at sites in Arizona and New Mexico (both G. c. canadensis breeding in northeastern Siberia). Habitats occupied by cranes are being identified throughout the annual cycle with the aid of GIS methodology as are temporal and spatial patterns of use of the Central Platte River Valley. Information obtained from the study will be used to delineate breeding ranges, migration corridors, staging areas, and wintering grounds of subspecies and subpopulations to allow crane managers to better {{meet the needs of the}} midcontinent population. Current plans are to gather information on a total of 200 sandhill cranes over the study period with 42 cranes to be radio marked in 2000.

40|$|This final {{technical}} progress report summarizes work performed the project, 'Use of Polymers to Recover Viscous Oil from Unconventional Reservoirs. ' The {{objective of this}} three-year research project was to develop methods using water soluble polymers to recover viscous oil from unconventional reservoirs (i. e., on Alaska's North Slope). The project had three technical tasks. First, limits were re-examined and redefined for where polymer flooding technology can be applied with respect to unfavorable displacements. Second, we tested existing and new polymers for effective polymer flooding of viscous oil, and we tested newly proposed mechanisms for oil displacement by polymer solutions. Third, we examined novel methods of using polymer gels to improve sweep efficiency during recovery of unconventional viscous oil. This report details work performed during the project. First, using fractional flow calculations, we examined the potential of polymer flooding for recovering viscous oils when the polymer is able to reduce the residual oil saturation to a value {{less than that of}} a waterflood. Second, we extensively investigated the rheology in porous media for a new hydrophobic associative polymer. Third, using simulation and analytical studies, we compared oil recovery efficiency for polymer flooding versus in-depth profile modification (i. e., 'Bright Water') as a function of (1) permeability contrast, (2) relative zone thickness, (3) oil viscosity, (4) polymer solution viscosity, (5) polymer or blocking-agent bank size, and (6) relative costs for polymer versus blocking agent. Fourth, we experimentally established how much polymer flooding can reduce the residual oil saturation in an oil-wet core that is saturated with viscous North Slope crude. Finally, an experimental study compared mechanical degradation of an associative polymer with that of a partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide. Detailed results from {{the first two years of}} the project may be found in our first and second annual reports. Our latest research results, along with detailed documentation of our past work, can be found <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> <b>site</b> <b>at</b> [URL] As an overall summary of important findings for the project, polymer flooding has tremendous potential for enhanced recovery of viscous oil. Fear of substantial injectivity reduction was a primary hurdle that limited application of polymer flooding. However, that concern is largely mitigated by (1) use of horizontal wells and (2) judicious injection above the formation parting pressure. Field cases now exist where 200 - 300 -cp polymer solutions are injected without significant reductions in injectivity. Concern about costs associated with injection of viscous polymer solutions was a second major hurdle. However, that concern is reduced substantially by realization that polymer viscosity increases approximately with the square of polymer concentration. Viscosity can be doubled with only a 40 % increase in polymer concentration. Up to a readily definable point, increases in viscosity of the injected polymer solution are directly related to increases in sweep efficiency and oil recovery. Previously published simulation results - suggesting that shear-thinning polymer solutions were detrimental to sweep efficiency - were shown to be unfounded (both theoretically and experimentally) ...|$|E
