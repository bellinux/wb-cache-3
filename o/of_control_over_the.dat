5|$|In 1968, Richard Nixon, the United States Republican Party nominee, won {{the presidential}} election, {{defeating}} Democrat Hubert Humphrey by seven-tenths {{of a percent}} of the popular vote. Nixon appointed H. R. Haldeman as his Chief of Staff; this position granted Haldeman a relatively large degree <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> activities of the presidential administration. Haldeman had first worked for Nixon in 1956, during Nixon's successful bid for the vice-presidency under Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E
5|$|The Barroso Commission {{took office}} in late 2004 after being delayed by {{objections}} from the Parliament, which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the Commission, Barroso adopted a more presidential style <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> college, which earned him some criticism.|$|E
5|$|The issue <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} {{branch of}} the Silk Road by the Caliphate has been suggested as a further motive for the conflict, but G.

5|$|When Congress reconvened in July, {{it passed}} a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, {{waited for his}} veto, {{overruled}} it, and went home. In addition to clarifying {{the powers of the}} generals, the legislation also deprived the President <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Army in the South. With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General Philip Sheridan, who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support.|$|E
5|$|Author Edward Macan views British symphonic pop as a {{splinter}} of {{the progressive}} rock genre that relied on straightforward songwriting, rich vocal arrangements and quasi-orchestral fullness, citing Supertramp, ELO, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project, and Al Stewart as examples. By the late 1970s, the era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing had ended. Corporate artists and repertoire staff began exerting an increasing amount <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> creative process that had previously belonged to the artists. Some of the major progressive bands transitioned to a more commercial sound and deemphasized the evocation of art music. By the early 1980s, the prevailing view was that the progressive rock style had ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E
5|$|The Australian federal {{government}} retains some {{influence over the}} ACT government. In the administrative sphere, most frequently this is through {{the actions of the}} National Capital Authority which is responsible for planning and development in areas of Canberra which are considered to be of national importance or which are central to Griffin's plan for the city, such as the Parliamentary Triangle, Lake Burley Griffin, major approach and processional roads, areas where the Commonwealth retains ownership of the land or undeveloped hills and ridge-lines (which form part of the Canberra Nature Park). The national government also retains a level <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Territory Assembly through the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. This federal act defines the legislative power of the ACT assembly.|$|E
5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant must submit evidence showing that the applicant had adopted the mark in good faith, that the applicant had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E

5|$|The era {{of record}} labels {{investing}} in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited {{control over their}} content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> creative process that had previously belonged to the artists, and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound {{in the style of}} arena rock.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. The Memorize {{corporation}} has invented a new brain implant called Sensen, which enables 99% of the population to upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. This gives Memorize an immense degree <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> population and enables them to establish a surveillance state, which leads a small group of rebels by the name of Errorists to attempt to bring down Memorize. The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of Leapers, memory-addicted humans who have absorbed so many memories that their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into subhuman form, now living in the sewers of Neo-Paris.|$|E
5|$|Coghlan {{directed}} {{his attention to}} Northern Rhodesia. Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in Northern Rhodesia twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was {{on the issue of}} control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle trade. At the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> railway was granted to Southern Rhodesia. There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North entirely to the South or at least the reversionary right to it but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern Rhodesia the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.|$|E

This audit was conducted to determine if the Department established an effective system <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Fund.

5|$|In 1871, McCreary was re-elected to {{the state}} House without opposition. In the {{upcoming}} legislative session, the major question {{was expected to be}} the Cincinnati Southern Railway's request for authorization to build a track connecting Cincinnati, Ohio, with either Knoxville or Chattanooga, Tennessee, through Central Kentucky. The action was opposed by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, a bitter rival of the Cincinnati line. Appeals to the General Assembly to oppose the bill on grounds that an out-of-state corporation should not be granted a charter in the state were successful in 1869 and 1870, and an attempt by the federal Congress to grant the charter was defeated by states' rights legislators there. Moreover, newly elected governor Preston Leslie had opposed a bill granting Cincinnati Southern's request {{when he was in the}} state Senate in 1869. In the lead-up to the 1871 session, frustrated Central Kentuckians threatened to defect from the Democratic Party in future elections if the bill were not passed in the session. Supporters of Cincinnati Southern won a victory when McCreary, a staunch supporter of the bill to grant the line's request, was elected Speaker of the House. After approval of a series of amendments designed to give Kentucky courts some jurisdiction in cases involving the line and the Kentucky General Assembly some measure <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> line's activities, the bill passed the House by a vote of 59–38. The vote in the Senate resulted in a 19–19 tie; President Pro Tem John G. Carlisle—a native of Covington, through which the proposed line would pass—cast the deciding vote in favor of approving Cincinnati Southern's request. With the will of the people clearly expressed through the legislature, Governor Leslie did not employ his gubernatorial veto. McCreary was again returned to the House without opposition in 1873 and was again chosen Speaker of the House during his term.|$|E
5|$|While {{the killing}} of Hálfdan by the Orkney islanders is {{recorded}} independently in the Historia Norvegiæ, the manner of his death is unspecified. The blood eagle sacrifice may be a misunderstanding or an invention of the sagawriters as it does not feature directly in the earlier skaldic verses, which instead indicate that Hálfdan {{was killed by a}} volley of spears. The verses do mention the eagle as a carrion bird, and this may have influenced the saga writers to introduce the blood eagle element. The sagas then relate that Harald sought vengeance for his son's ignoble death, and set out on campaign against Einarr, but was unable to dislodge him. Eventually, Harald agreed to end the fight in exchange for a fine of 60 gold marks levied on Einarr and the allodial owners of the islands. Einarr offered to pay the whole fine if the allodial landowners passed their lands to him, to which they agreed. Einarr's assumption <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> islands appears well-attested and was considered by later commentators to be the moment at which the Earls of Orkney came to own the entire island group in fee to the King of Norway. Others have interpreted the payment of 60 gold marks as wergild or blood money.|$|E
