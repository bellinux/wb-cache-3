5000|$|The shell has an elevated-conical shape. The {{height of}} the shell varies between 10 mm and 35 mm. The shell is carinated at the periphery. It has a yellow or {{delicate}} flesh color, with <b>obscure</b> <b>clouds</b> or macula. It is alternately whitish and brown below the suture and painted on the peripheral rib in the same alternate manner. The surface of the shell is highly polished. The apical whorl is smooth, the next four or five whorls are densely granulate (granules in 4 or 5 series). The next whorl is generally spirally ribbed. [...] The following whorls are smooth, or with very obscure traces of spiral lines. The base of the shell is flat, smooth, save for 3 to 6 concentric articulated riblets around the axis. The outlines of the spire are straight. There are about 10 flat whorls, separated by a linear suture with a distinct narrow supra-sutural fasciole. The rhomboidal aperture is smooth within. The pearly columella is shorter and more knobbed at its base than in Calliostoma zizyphinum.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{complete}} {{analysis of the}} hard X-ray (2 - 10 keV) properties of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365, based on a 60 ks XMM-Newton observation performed in 2004 January. The two main results are as follows. (1) We detect an <b>obscuring</b> <b>cloud</b> with N(H) similar to 3. 5 x 10 (23) cm(- 2) crossing the line of sight in similar to 25 ks. This implies a dimension of the X-ray source not larger than a few 1013 cm and a distance of the <b>obscuring</b> <b>cloud</b> {{of the order of}} 1016 cm. Adopting the black hole mass M(BH) estimated from the M(BH) -velocity dispersion relation, the source size is D(S) < 20 R(G) and the distance and density of the <b>obscuring</b> <b>clouds</b> are R similar to 3000 - 10, 000 R(G) and n similar to 10 (10) cm(- 3), i. e., typical values for broad-line region clouds. (2) An iron emission line with a relativistic profile is detected with high statistical significance. A time-integrated fit of the line+continuum reflection components suggests a high iron abundance (approximately three times solar) and an origin of these components in the inner part (within similar to 10 R(G)) of the accretion disk, in agreement with the small source size inferred from the analysis of the absorption variability...|$|R

40|$|The {{photochemistry}} of two diatomic {{and eight}} polyatomic molecules is discussed quantitatively. For an interstellar molecule, the lifetime against photodecomposition {{depends upon the}} absorption cross section, the quantum yield or probability of dissociation following photon absorption, and the interstellar radiation field. The constant energy density of Habing {{is used for the}} unobserved regions of interstellar radiation field, and the field in <b>obscuring</b> <b>clouds</b> is estimated by combining the constant flux with the observed interstellar extinction curve covering the visible and ultraviolet regions. Lifetimes against photodecomposition in the unobscured regions and as a function of increasing optical thickness in <b>obscuring</b> <b>clouds</b> are calculated for the ten species. The results show that, except for CO, all the molecules have comparable lifetimes of less than one hundred years. Thus they can exist only in dense clouds and can never have been exposed to the unobscured radiation. The calculations further show that the lifetimes in clouds of moderate opacity are of the order of one million years...|$|R
