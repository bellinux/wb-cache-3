5|$|On special occasions, such as Uposatha day, {{an orange}} stole is placed around its {{shoulders}} by the presiding monk and is fanned. A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals; some men {{sit in the}} front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and rear end of the foyer. Devotees offer food and other items brought by them <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tray</b> to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed. During the winter season, the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order.|$|E
25|$|During Feasts of the Cross a {{cross is}} laid <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tray</b> covered by an Aër and {{decorated}} with basil leaves and flowers. This is carried by the priest from the Prothesis to the Holy Table, where it will remain until the Great Doxology {{near the end of}} Matins. At that point the priest will take it in procession {{to the center of the}} church where all the faithful will come forward to venerate the cross.|$|E
25|$|The four House dormitories have secret entrances, {{generally}} {{known only}} to members of that house and require a password (Gryffindor & Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) {{in order to gain}} entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete their homework, but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are notice boards in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and thick white pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has a jug of water and goblets <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tray.</b>|$|E

500|$|The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first {{printed in}} Vogue in 1959, and {{included}} in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way – and I shan't – my Christmas Day {{eating and drinking}} would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich {{with a glass of}} champagne <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tray</b> in bed in the evening." [...] The pattern of the book follows that of earlier ones, with recipes interspersed with more discursive essays on subjects such as avocado pears, persimmons, historical menus, and Christmas hampers, and extracts from prose by writers whom David admired, including Sybille Bedford and George Eliot.|$|E
500|$|The last of {{the books}} planned by David was Elizabeth David's Christmas (2003). She and Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as the}} 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out the author's papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. The Christmas recipes David had most often been asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page work. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks. The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first printed in Vogue in 1959, and included in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way—and I shan't—my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with a glass of champagne <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tray</b> in bed in the evening." ...|$|E

2500|$|Preliminary {{research}} {{also seems to}} indicate that Alex could carry over the concept of four blue balls of wool <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tray</b> to four notes from a piano.

2500|$|When {{moving the}} textile, it is {{important}} to maintain the flat, even support of the work space. [...] If the piece is small enough (a handkerchief or sampler, for instance), it may be placed on an acid-free board or similar support and carried as if <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tray.</b> [...] If the piece is too large for this (a carpet or tapestry, for example), the piece may be rolled around an acid-free tube and carried by two people to its new location.|$|E
2500|$|Alex could add, to {{a limited}} extent, {{correctly}} giving the number of similar objects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tray.</b> Pepperberg {{said that if he}} could not count, the data could be interpreted as his being able to estimate quickly and accurately the number of something, better than humans can. When he was tired of being tested, he would say [...] "Wanna go back", meaning he {{wanted to go back to}} his cage, and in general, he would request where he wanted to be taken by saying [...] "Wanna go...", protest if he was taken to a different place, and sit quietly when taken to his preferred spot. He was not trained to say where he wanted to go, but picked it up from being asked where he'd like to be taken.|$|E

50|$|Amalá, {{also known}} as amalá de Xangô, is the ritual dish offered to the orixá. It is a stew made of chopped okra, onion, dried shrimp, and palm oil.

Due to ritual prohibitions, the dish may not be offered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wooden <b>tray</b> or accompanied by bitter kola. Amalá de Xangô may also be prepared {{with the addition of}} beef, specifically an ox tail. Amalá de Xangô is different than àmàlà, a dish common to Yoruba areas of Nigeria.|$|R
