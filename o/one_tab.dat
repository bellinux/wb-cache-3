25|$|A new JavaScript engine called Carakan, {{after the}} Javanese alphabet, was {{introduced}} with version 10.50. According to Opera Software, Carakan makes Opera 10.50 {{more than seven}} times faster in SunSpider than Opera 10.10. On 16 December 2010, Opera 11 was released, featuring extensions, tab stacking (where dragging <b>one</b> <b>tab</b> over another allows you to create a group of tabs), visual mouse gestures, and changes to the address bar. Opera 12 was released on 14 June 2012.|$|E
25|$|A {{multi-process}} {{architecture is}} implemented in Chrome where, by default, a separate process is allocated to each site instance and plugin. This procedure is termed process isolation, and it prevents tasks from interfering with each other, raising security and stability. An attacker successfully {{gaining access to}} one application gains access to no others, and failure in one instance results in a Sad Tab screen of death, similar to the well-known Sad Mac, but only <b>one</b> <b>tab</b> crashes instead of the whole application. This strategy exacts a fixed per-process cost up front, but results in less memory bloat over time as fragmentation is confined to each instance and no longer needs further memory allocations. This architecture was adopted in Safari and Firefox.|$|E
2500|$|To {{facilitate}} typewriter use {{in business}} settings, a tab (tabulator) key was {{added in the}} late nineteenth century. Before using the key, the operator had to set mechanical [...] "tab stops", pre-designated locations to which the carriage would advance when the tab key was pressed. This facilitated the typing of columns of numbers, freeing the operator from the need to manually position the carriage. The first models had <b>one</b> <b>tab</b> stop and <b>one</b> <b>tab</b> key; later ones allowed as many stops as desired, and sometimes had multiple tab keys, each of which moved the carriage a different number of spaces ahead of the decimal point (the tab stop), to facilitate the typing of columns with numbers of different length ($1.00, $10.00, $100.00, etc.) ...|$|E

He has also written Always Aligned - an extension for Visual Studio which implements elastic tabstops. Elastic tabstops are also implemented in Go's tabwriter package which is used by the [...] "go fmt" [...] command.|$|E

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to study the usability of two search interfaces – <b>one</b> <b>tabbed</b> interface similar to the current UNC-CH library homepage and one with a single search bar similar to Google. The UNC-CH Libraries also developed a combined search tool that pulls library resources from the Serials Solutions Summon service and from the Endeca-powered catalog. The usability test involved several tasks to determine interface preference, autosuggest’s utility, and the optimal location for the “best bets” recommendation box within the results. The usability testing also included having participants respond to a proposed library homepage to gather feedback for a redesign project. The resulting data showed users preferred the tabbed widget, but overall were not averse {{to the use of}} the simple widget on the proposed library homepage since the information they found most important was still available. Researchers observed the adaptability of users to search tools as long as those tools provided them with the results they needed to perform research...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} these problems, some integrated development environments, such as recent versions of XEmacs and Microsoft's Visual Studio, provide a hybrid interface which allows splitting the parent window into multiple MDI-like [...] "panes," [...] each {{with their own}} separate TDI tab set.
