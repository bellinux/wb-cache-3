Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less.

40|$|Thick {{bonding wires}} {{are used in}} modern power modules as {{connectors}} between integrated circuits, carrying current from one circuit to another. They experience high values of current, which generates heat through Joule heating {{and can lead to}} various failure mechanisms. Typically used wire materials in industry are aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), and intermetallic compounds of Cu-Al. They are broadly used because of their strength, high thermal conductivity, and low resistivity. This study reports on the influence of thermal loading on the mechanical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires. Experimental techniques are developed and introduced in this thesis to analyze quasi-static and dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires 300 µm in diameter. First, an experimental technique is developed to measure the quasi-static displacement <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires carrying DC currents. It is then deployed to measure the displacement, as well as peak temperature, of three types <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires, Al, Cu and Aluminum coated Copper (CuCorAl) to study the response under DC current. Secondly, an experimental technique is established and deployed for modal analysis <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires under thermal loading. Experimental results demonstrate a drop in the natural frequency <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires with increased thermal loads. Moreover, a harmonic analysis technique using thermal excitation is developed and applied to analyze the mode shapes and frequency response <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires. Furthermore, an analytical model and a finite element model are used to analyze static and dynamic responses <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires.

These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill in 1333 and Humbleton Hill in 1402.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act greatly {{increased}} government purchases of silver. The government pledged {{to stand behind}} the silver dollars and treasury notes issued under the act by redeeming them in gold. Pursuant to this promise, government gold reserves dwindled over the following three years. Although the economic Panic of 1893 {{had a number of}} causes, President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman's act to be a major factor, and called a special session of Congress to repeal it. Congress did so, but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions. Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> which could only be purchased with gold, with little effect but to increase the public debt, as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency. Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers, not the nation. The bankers' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an inflated currency—the gold standard was deflationary, and as creditors, they preferred to be paid in such a currency, whereas debtors preferred to repay in inflated currency.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, Scottish armies were {{assembled}} {{on the basis}} of common service, feudal obligations and money contracts <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> of manrent. In 1513 these systems were successful in producing a large and formidable force, but there is evidence that by the mid-sixteenth century the authorities were experiencing increasing difficulty in recruitment. Individuals were expected to provide their own equipment. Heavy armour was abandoned after the Flodden campaign and noblemen became indistinguishable from the majority of troops. Highland lords tended to continue to use lighter chainmail and ordinary highlanders dressed in the plaid. Weapons included various forms of axes and pole arms. Highland troops brought bows and two-handed swords (claidheamh mór). The crown took an increasing role in the supply of equipment. The pike began to replace the spear or axe and the bow began to be replaced by gunpowder firearms. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies and the Scots fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the borders. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a gun foundry in 1511. Gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture from the mid-fifteenth century. In the period of French intervention in the 1540s and 1550s, Scotland was given a defended border of a series of earthwork forts and additions to existing castles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, Scottish armies were still largely {{assembled}} {{on the basis}} of common service and feudal obligations, with the addition of troops maintained by money contracts <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> or bands of manrent. Common service theoretically called all men between the ages of 16 and 60 for a maximum of 40 days in one year. Such troops were expected to serve at their own expense and to bring their own supplies, a factor that severely limited the ability of Scottish armies to take part in sustained campaigning. Feudalism had been introduced to Scotland in the twelfth century, meaning that knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis, particularly heavily armed noble cavalry. Bonds of manrent were similar to English indentures of the same period, used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. Scotland relied on these systems longer than was the case in England. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and major Scottish lords continued to bring contingents from their kindred. In 1513 for the Flodden campaign these systems were successful in producing a large and formidable force, but in the religious and politically divided mid-sixteenth century there is evidence that the authorities were experiencing increasing difficulty in recruitment.|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{contains two}} essays. It discusses the role <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenants in modern capital market {{and how they}} impact firms’ financial activities. Bond covenants are effective mechanism to mitigate the agency problems between bondholders and bond issuers. The design <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenants has extensive influence on firms’ financial activities. The first essay examines the effect <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenants on issue size. The agency problems can prevent bondholders from lending fund to issuers. The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenants in indenture can provide bondholder with protection by restricting issuers’ activities, indicating the potential relationship between bond issue size and covenants. My findings suggest that restrictiveness <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenants is positively related with the issue size. Due to different agency problem, the design <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenant put emphasis on different restriction covenant. As a result, the essay observes that for investment grade (below grade) issuers issue size is positively related with the restrictiveness of financing (investment) covenants. Meanwhile due to the severe agency problem in low quality issuers, low rating firms have to include more covenants to raise {{the same amount of}} capital. The findings in the first essay indicate that firms can sacrifice their management by including restrictive covenants to raise more capital. The second essay examines the effect <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenants on likelihood of CDS issuance and the level of CDS spreads. Like bond covenants, CDS contracts are also effective mechanism to mitigate the agency problem between bondholders and bond issuers. The issuance of CDS occurs after firms include bond covenants, indicating that one of reasons for CDS is bondholders’ feeling of insecurity due to the unrestrictive bond covenants. My findings indicate that the restrictiveness <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenant can affect the likelihood of CDS issuance. CDS serves as complement to bond covenants for investment grade bondholder to mitigate the agency problem by providing bondholder with extra protection in the case of default. At the same time, bond covenant can also influence the level of CDS spreads by influencing the issuers’ default risk because actual use <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenants can lower the default risk. My findings suggest the level of CDS spread is negatively related with the restrictiveness <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenants. The findings in essay 2 not only provide possible reasons for CDS issuance and an important factor influencing the level of CDS spread but also build a link between literature <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> covenants and CDS...|$|R
