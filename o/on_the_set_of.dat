40|$|Elliptic curves have a {{wide variety}} of {{applications}} in computational number theory such as elliptic curve cryptography, pairing based cryptography, primality tests, and integer factorization. Mishra and Gupta (2008) have found an interesting property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> elliptic curves in simplified Weierstrass form (or short Weierstrass form) over prime fields. The property is that one can induce metrics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> elliptic curves in simplified Weierstrass form over prime fields of characteristic greater than three. Later, Vetro (2011) has found some other metrics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> elliptic curves in simplified Weierstrass form over prime fields of characteristic greater than three. However, to our knowledge, no analogous result is known in the characteristic two case.
