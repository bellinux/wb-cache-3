Cox & Co, as the company was then known, was formed after Richard Cox was appointed agent to the Foot Guards (later the Grenadier Guards), and provided banking services for many regiments of the British Army {{by the end of}} the 18th century. The mansion was completely rebuilt after it burnt down in 1844 and later received a Grade II listing.|$|E
5|$|The house {{eventually}} {{passed to}} the Chetwynd family, who sold it to the Marchioness of Rockingham, widow of Prime Minister The Marquess of Rockingham, in 1786 for £9,000. The Marchioness lived there until her own death in 1804, upon which the estate passed to her stepsister Elizabeth, widow of William Weddell MP. Her husband had left her Newby Hall in Mayfair, therefore having no need of Hillingdon House, she sold it to Josias Du Pré Porcher in 1805. In 1810 the estate was sold to Richard Henry Cox, {{a member of the}} Cox banking family and the grandson of Richard Cox, founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> company Cox & Kings.|$|E

5|$|Ludvig G. Braathen died on 27 December 1976 {{while he}} was still CEO. He was succeeded by his son Bjørn G. Braathen, who had {{returned}} to the company a few years earlier. In 1977, Braathens SAFE made NOK10 million in profit on the Trondheim route and NOK4 million on the routes from Oslo to Kristiansand and Stavanger. At the same time, the airline lost NOK6 million on the routes to from Oslo to Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund, and NOK18 million on the coastal routes between Stavanger and Tromsø. From 1 October 1978, the company also introduced 50% youth discount for people under 26 years. From 1 May 1978, there was introduced a NOK100 tax on international charter flights. The same year, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of Bergenske Dampskibsselskab, that owned 51% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> agency Bennett Reisebureau. This was to try to secure influence over the chain, that was also owned 31% by SAS. A new, neutral ticketing system, SMART, was introduced in 1980 for all travel agents in Norway and Sweden. Following this, Braathens SAFE sold its stake in Bergenske with a profit.|$|E

Violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> ban could potentially result in a US$500 fine and 90days in jail, which was sufficient to limit the number of people ticketed to 97.

25|$|According to most historians, {{the core}} territories of Moravia {{were located in}} {{the valley of the}} river Morava in present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia. Archaeological {{findings}} of large early medieval fortresses and the significant cluster of settlements growing around them suggest that an important centre of power emerged in this region in the 9thcentury. Early sources (Alfred the Great's contemporaneous translation of Orosius's History of the World, which mentioned Moravia's neighbours, and the description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> of Constantine and Methodius from Moravia to Venice through Pannonia in the Life of Constantine) also substantiate the traditional view.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable aspects of the design is the stadium's retractable, fabric roof. The roof {{mechanization}} consists of two large panels that split apart at the 50yard line, lying over and above each end zone when fully retracted. 10 parallel, tri-chord trusses ride on two parallel rails, each supported by a large, -long super-truss. Roof operation is controlled in the stadium press box via computer, containing live images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> path of each roof panel; plus, furnishing live feedback from all roof components throughout the operation. The roof panels can be opened or closed {{in as little as}} 7minutes, moving at a speed of up to -per-minute.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{largely because}} of {{coordination}} of the contest by David Hawks, International Mr. Bootblack 2000, the Bootblack Competition has begun to develop adjunct activities. An IMrBB party is held in a hotel function room on Saturday night, offering food, music, and a silent auction, the proceeds of which go to the travel fund of the winner. Likewise, during the competition hours in the Leather Market, volunteers man a table to answer questions and sell IMrBB Travel Fund pins, which also adds to the travel fund. These sources of revenue have provided the various titleholders with significantly more money to aid their travel to distant events during their title years. The money {{is controlled by the}} contest coordinator, and any access to the funds must be accompanied by proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> outlay.|$|E

25|$|Pitt {{followed}} up the Rose Bowl winning 1936 {{season with a}} 9–0–1 record in 1937 that included five shutouts, including those over West Virginia, Wisconsin, and at Duke as well as additional victories against Penn State, Nebraska, and at Notre Dame. The only blemish on the record was the third consecutive tie at Fordham, which resulted when an apparent winning touchdown by Pitt's Marshall Goldberg was called back on a holding penalty. Pitt finished the 1937 regular season as repeat Eastern Champions and was ranked {{number one in the}} AP's final poll. Partly due to the developing rift with the university administration, and also due to the time and expense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>travel,</b> Pitt became the first team to publicly decline a Rose Bowl invitation following a vote of the players. Despite its decision to sit out the postseason, the 1937 Pitt team was widely regarded as consensus national champions.|$|E
25|$|The United States Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{performed}} {{indoor air}} quality testing for formaldehyde {{in some of the}} units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's preliminary evaluation of a scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR, division of the CDC) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm. Levels measured ranged from 0.003 ppm to 0.59 ppm.|$|E
25|$|Several labour-sending {{countries}} have issued travel bans or restrictions for Lebanon in recent years, among them Ethiopia, Nepal and the Philippines. However, the Lebanese {{government has been}} ineffective with implementing the migration workers ban from entering into Lebanon from the country of Nepal simply kept issuing pre-approved work permits and visas. Madagascar issued its Lebanon ban as {{a direct consequence of}} the death of 17 Madagascan domestic migrant workers in 2010 which in 2011 also led the Madagascar Government to fly out 86 domestic migrant worker. Ethiopian women have reportedly tried to bypass restrictions imposed by their government to work as domestic workers in Lebanon by first embarking on journeys to Sudan or Yemen. A figure presented by Anti-Slavery International explains the lack of proper implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> bans on migrant workers coming to Lebanon, as irregular channels of bringing the workers still operate. The figure in 2010 is 65%, this represents the amount of workers who received their work permits {{despite the fact that they}} come from countries which are in the travel ban.|$|E
