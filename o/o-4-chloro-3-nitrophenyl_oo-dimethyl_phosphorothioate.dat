40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{developing}} a nondestructive biomarker (serum ‘B’ esterases) for monitoring bird populations exposed to azamethiphos S((6 -chloro- 2 -oxooxazolo(4, 5 -b) pyridin- 3 (2 ~-yl) methyl) <b>O,O-dimethyl</b> <b>phosphorothioate</b> (SCl), parallel laboratory and field studies were performed. In Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix juponica) treated with azamethiphos at 10 mg kg-‘, serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and carboxylesterase (CE) activities were inhibited by 88 % and 35 %, respectively, after 24 h. A gradual recovery was observed after 48 and 72 h. With a higher dose (50 mg kg-‘), the birds died, or were killed 3 h after dosing. Serum BChE and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in birds that were sampled at 3 h, were inhibited by 98 % and 92 %, respectively. Hepatic microsomal and serum CEs were also inhibited. There was a statistically significant correlation (r = 0. 9808, p < 0. 001) between the activities of serum BChE and brain AChE. Swallows (Hirundo rustica) nesting in a stable treated with azamethiphos showed a drastic reduction in BChE (56 %) and CE (36 %) 24 h after treatment of the stable...|$|R
40|$|Kinetic {{studies for}} the {{reactions}} of <b>O,O-dimethyl</b> Z-S-aryl <b>phosphorothioates</b> with X-pyridines {{have been carried out}} in dimethyl sulfoxide at 85. 0 ºC. The Hammett and Brönsted plots for substituent X variations in the nucleophiles are biphasic concave upwards with a break point at X = H, while those for substituent Z variations in the leaving groups are linear. The negative sign of the cross-interaction constant (ρXZ) implies that the reaction proceeds through a concerted mechanism for both the strongly and weakly basic pyridines. The magnitude of ρXZ (= – 0. 35) for the strongly basic pyridines is greater than that (ρXZ = – 0. 15) for the weakly basic pyridines, indicating a change of the nucleophilic attacking direction from frontside for the strongly basic pyridines to backside for the weakly basic pyridines. The early transition state is proposed {{on the basis of the}} absence of positive deviations from both the Hammett and Brönsted plots for the strong π-acceptor, X = 4 -Ac, and small values of ρXZ and βX.

The hepatic disposition and biotransformation of methyl parathion in perfused livers were aftered markedly by changes in protein binding of methyl parathion to perfusate, but only slightly by changes In perfusate flow rates that maintained viable livers. Pretreatment of mice with phenobarbital daily for 4 days (80 mgI kg, ip) induced hepatic microsomal activation of methyl parathion to methyl paraoxon in vitro and increased the clearance of methyl parathion by perfused mouse livers.

40|$|Kinetic {{studies of}} the {{reactions}} of <b>O,O-dimethyl</b> Z-S-aryl <b>phosphorothioates</b> with X-benzylamines {{have been carried out}} in dimethyl sulfoxide at 85. 0 °C. The Hammett (log k 2 vs σX) and Brönsted [log k 2 vs pKa(X) ] plots for substituent X variations in the nucleophiles are discrete with a break region between 4 -Me and H, while the Hammett plots (log k 2 vs σZ) for substituent Z variations in the leaving groups are linear. The sign of the cross-interaction constant (ρXZ) is positive for both the strongly and weakly basic nucleophiles. Greater magnitude of ρXZ (= 2. 54) value is observed with the weakly basic nucleophiles compared to with the strongly basic nucleophiles (ρXZ = 0. 17). The deuterium kinetic isotope effects (kH/kD) involving deuterated benzylamines [XC 6 H 4 CH 2 ND 2] are primary normal (kH/kD> 1). The proposed mechanism is a stepwise with a rate-limiting leaving group expulsion from the intermediate involving a frontside nucleophilic attack with a hydrogen bonded, four-center-type transition state for both the strongly and weakly basic nucleophiles...|$|R
40|$|Using batch cultures, we {{determined}} transformation rates for low concentrations of two toxicants—an insecticide, methyl parathion (<b>O,O-dimethyl</b> O-p-nitrophenyl <b>phosphorothioate),</b> and a plasticizer, diethyl phthalate—by aufwuchs, aquatic microbial growth attached to submerged surfaces or suspended in streamers or mats. Aufwuchs {{samples were collected}} from field sites, an indoor channel, and a continuous-flow fermentor. Aufwuchs fungi, protozoa, and algae did not transform methyl parathion or diethyl phthalate, but bacteria rapidly transformed both chemicals. Second-order transformation rate coefficients, Kb, based on total plate counts of bacteria in aufwuchs, were determined for potential use in a mathematical model capable of predicting the transport and fate of chemicals in aquatic systems. Kb for both methyl parathion and diethyl phthalate decreased as the concentration of total bacteria, [B], increased in aufwuchs. This effect resulted from the proportion of nontransformer to transformer bacteria increasing as [B] increased and from the rate of transformation per transformer cell decreasing as [B] increased. First-order transformation rate coefficients, K 1, were relatively stable per unit of surface area colonized by aufwuchs, because Kb decreased as [B] increased (K 1 = Kb × [B]) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} pulse polarography {{technique was}} used to establish an electroanalytical procedure for {{the determination of the}} organophosphorous insecticide methyl parathion (<b>O,O-dimethyl</b> O-(4 -nitrophenyl) <b>phosphorothioate)</b> in soil samples. Three reduction peaks were observed in mercury electrodes {{as a function of the}} solution pH. The more cathodic peak (Ep= - 0. 55 V), only observed for pH values higher than 5. 0, was chosen for the analytical determinations. The limit of detection was 1. 93 x 10 - 8 mol L- 1 for pure water and about 8 x 10 - 8 mol L- 1 for soil suspensions with a scan rate of 2 mV s- 1 and a pH of 6. 75. The electroanalytical procedure developed was applied for the determination of sorption isotherms of methylparathion on 3 soils from São Paulo State, Brazil, at different pH and diverse amounts of clay and organic matter. The experimental data were fitted using the Freundlich isotherm model and the Freundlich coefficients (K F) obtained for each soil varied from 7 to 29 L kg- 1, representing a low to medium sorption capacity, according to the IBAMA (Brazilian Environmental Protection Agency) standards. The amounts of organic matter and clay were the most important soil parameters controling the sorption of methylparathion by these soils...|$|R
40|$|Although {{microbial}} {{communities have}} {{varying degrees of}} exposure to environmental stresses such as chemical pollution, little is known on how these communities respond to environmental disturbances and how past disturbance history affects these community-level responses. To comprehensively understand the effect of organophosphorus insecticide application on microbiota in soils with or without insecticide-spraying history, we investigated the microbial succession {{in response to the}} addition of fenitrothion (<b>O,O-dimethyl</b> O-(3 -methyl-p-nitrophenyl) <b>phosphorothioate,</b> abbreviated as MEP) by culture-dependent experiments and deep sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes. Despite similar microbial composition at the initial stage, microbial response to MEP application was remarkably different between soils with and without MEP-spraying history. MEP-degrading microbes more rapidly increased in the soils with MEP-spraying history, suggesting that MEP-degrading bacteria might already exist at a certain level and could quickly respond to MEP re-treatment in the soil. Culture-dependent and -independent evaluations revealed that MEP-degrading Burkholderia bacteria are predominant in soils after MEP application, limited members of which might play a pivotal role in MEP-degradation in soils. Notably, deep sequencing also revealed that some methylotrophs dramatically increased after MEP application, strongly suggesting that these bacteria {{play a role in the}} consumption and removal of methanol, a harmful derivative from MEP-degradation, for better growth of MEP-degrading bacteria. This comprehensive study demonstrated the succession and adaptation processes of microbial communities under MEP application, which were critically affected by past experience of insecticide-spraying...|$|R
