40|$|The thermal {{stability}} of a recombinant alpha-amylase from Bacillus halmapalus alpha-amylase (BHA) {{has been investigated}} using circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This alpha-amylase is homologous to other Bacillus alpha-amylases where previous crystallographic studies have identified the existence of 3 calcium binding sites in the structure. Denaturation of BHA is irreversible with a Tm of approximately 89 C, and DSC thermograms can be described using a one-step irreversible model. A 5 C increase in T(sub m) {{in the presence of}} 10 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> CaCl 2 was observed. However, a concomitant increase in the tendency to aggregate was also observed. The presence of 30 - 40 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> calcium chelator (EDTA or EGTA) results in a large destabilization of BHA corresponding to about 40 C lower T(sub m), as determined by both CD and DSC. Ten <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> EGTA reveals complex DSC thermograms corresponding to both reversible and irreversible transitions, which possibly originate from different populations of BHA:calcium complexes. The observations in the present study have, in combination with structural information of homologous alpha-amylases, provided the basis for the proposal of a simple denaturation mechanism of BHA. The proposed mechanism describes the irreversible thermal denaturation of different BHA:calcium complexes and the calcium binding equilibrium involved. Furthermore, the model accounts for a temperature induced reversible structural change associated with calcium binding...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The FAS and FASL system plays a {{key role}} in {{regulating}} apoptotic cell death and corruption of this signalling pathway has been shown to participate in immune escape and tumorigenesis. There is reduced expression of FAS but elevated expression of FASL in many types of human cancers including lung cancer. We recently reported an association between functional polymorphisms in FAS (- 1377 G [...] >A) and FASL (- 844 T [...] >C) and risk of oesophageal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of these polymorphisms to risk of developing lung cancer. METHODS: Genotypes of 1000 lung cancer patients and 1270 controls were analysed by PCR based restriction fragment length polymorphism. Associations with risk of lung cancer were estimated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Compared with non-carriers, there was a 1. 6 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> risk of developing lung cancer for carriers of the FAS - 1377 AA genotype (odds ratio (OR) 1. 59, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 21 to 2. 10; p = 0. 001), and 1. 8 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> risk (OR 1. 79, 95 % CI 1. 26 to 2. 52; p = 0. 001) for carriers of FASL - 844 CC. Gene-gene interaction of FAS and FASL polymorphisms increased risk of lung cancer in a multiplicative manner (OR for the carriers of both FAS - 1377 AA and FASL - 844 CC genotypes 4. 18, 95 % CI 2. 83 to 6. 18). Gene-environment interaction of FAS or FASL polymorphism and smoking associated with increased risk of lung cancer was also found. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with our initial findings in oesophageal cancer and further support the hypothesis that the FAS and FASL triggered apoptosis pathway plays an important role in human carcinogenesis. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
