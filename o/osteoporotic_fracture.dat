40|$|Background: The aim of {{the project}} is to {{identify}} the risk of <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> in women aged over 50, the evaluation of FRAX® BMD and FRAX® BMI in women with and without <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> and the proposal of therapeutic starting points for treatment of osteoporosis. Material and Methods: A group of 1014 women aged 50 - 89, living in the Kujawsko-Pomorskie province, was investigated. The analysis {{was based on the}} WHO definition of osteoporosis. Calculations of 10 -year absolute risk of major <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> (AR- 10 MOF Fx) and femoral neck fractures (AR- 10 FN Fx) were done using Polish 3. 3 version of FRAX® tool. The analysis of fracture risk employed the logistic regression method. Results: A statistically significant relationship was found between the risk of <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> and age, femoral neck BMD, a history of previous <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures,</b> estimated calcaneal BMD and vertebral column BMD. The differences between 10 -year absolute risk of major <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> BMD and BMI was small, which means that FRAX® BMI might be a useful tool for GPs and occupational medicine specialists. Conclusions: A high usefulness of the FRAX® BMI tool for evaluating the risk of major <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> provide a new possibility of identifying women at risk of such events. The mean value of 10 -year absolute risk of major <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> for FRAX® BMD and BMI was identified as 10 % and 12 %, respectively and these values were proposed as therapeutic starting points for treatment of osteoporosis in women living in the Kujawsko-Pomorskie province.

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{latitude}} affects risk of <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fracture.</b> Areas of higher latitude such as Northern Europe receive less Vitamin D through sunlight compared to regions closer to the equator, and consequently have higher fracture rates in comparison to lower latitudes. For example, Swedish men and women have a 13.% and 28.5% risk of hip fracture by age 50, respectively, whereas this risk is only 1.9% and 2.4% in Chinese men and women. Diet may also be a factor that is responsible for this difference, as vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and folate are all linked to bone mineral density.|$|E
25|$|Trabecular bone (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in {{the ends}} of long bones and vertebrae. Cortical bone is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active and is more subject to bone {{turnover}} and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fracture</b> sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.|$|E

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{the most}} common {{metabolic}} bone disease. In addition to morbidity, <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> also increase mortality risk in affected patients. Enough evidence is not available to indicate that, like western countries, osteoporosis is a public health problem in Iran. Therefore EMRC planned to estimate the burden of <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> in year 2001 based on existing sources of data. The EMRC study on bone density, the MOH study on unintentional injuries, and international literature on mortality risk following <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> were the main sources of information used for this study. To estimate burden of <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures,</b> the prevalence of osteoporosis, the incidence of <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures,</b> and the relative risk of mortality following these fractures were approximated. The mean duration of disability following major <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> was estimated through epidemiologic modeling. Assumptions on the disability weights of morbid conditions resulting from <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> were made through comparing these conditions with similar ones in Global Burden of Disease Study. Based on mortality and incidence rates, mean durations of disability, and disability weights; the DALYs indicator was calculated for Spine, Hip, and Forearm fractures. In women hip, spine, and forearm fractures were responsible for 15880, 1269, and 121 mortality- and morbidity-related lost years of life respectively. Similar figures in men were 16495, 2225, and 37 years. Collectively osteoporosis deprived Iranian population from 36026 healthy years of life (18757 in men and 17270 in women) in 2001. Higher burden of osteoporosis in men, mainly results from higher risk of mortality following fractures in male sex. The national study on unintentional injuries indicates that the incidence of <b>osteoporotic</b> hip <b>fractures</b> in Iranian population is much less than other populations. Higher bone mineral density and other probable differences between Iranians and other populations that affect fracture risk, like environmental conditions and life style, should be investigated as probable determinants of this difference.

40|$|Osteoporosis {{is defined}} as a {{systemic}} skeletal disorder that reduces the strength of bone, resulting in an increased risk of fracture. Fractures occur, even if an individual is subjected to minimal trauma such as a fall from own body height. The most common <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> are fractures of the vertebrae, femur neck and distal forearm but other peripheral fractures also play an important role. <b>Osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> are common and will affect at least a third of women over the age of 50 years. 1 It not only leads to significant morbidity, but also increased mortality. Osteoporosis is an age-related disease. In view of expectations that life expectancy is on the rise, the scope of the problem and the burden of the disease will escalate in future. The incidence of <b>osteoporotic</b> <b>fractures</b> in South Africa has not been recorded and most of our calculations are derived from Europe and North America.
