5|$|To the reader: {{whoever you}} are, your fears that this small clod of earth lies {{heavily on the}} buried Mercator are groundless; the whole Earth is no burden {{for a man who}} had the whole weight of her lands <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and carried her as an Atlas.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{advertising}} {{included the}} parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại {{through the streets}} of Saigon, depicted with bags of money <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> a deck of cards in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of cognac in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into his pockets, thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.|$|E

50|$|In {{early days}} the {{information}} is unclear. Based on the written pattayam, a person should bathe before lifting and placing the kavadi <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Once he started walking with kavadi <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> he should not drink water or urinate. If {{he needs to do}} that, he needs to bathe again before having the kavadi placed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The person carrying the kavadi should wear a white dhoti, and he should stay in the same dhoti until the kavadi is offered to Lord Murugan in Pazhani.|$|R

5|$|He had {{a liberal}} {{education}} {{by the standards}} of his age and learned French, German and Latin. He showed a special interest in history and astrology. A cleric from Wrocław, Nicholas, taught him the basic principles of Christian faith. However, Louis's religious zeal was due to his mother's influence. In a royal charter, Louis remembered that in his childhood, a knight of the royal court, Peter Poháros, often carried him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> His two tutors, Nicholas Drugeth and Nicholas Knesich, saved the lives of both Louis and his younger brother, Andrew, when Felician Záh attempted to assassinate the royal family in Visegrád on 17 April 1330.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) faced The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The {{advantage}} switched {{back and forth}} several times, as the Steiners threw The Headshrinkers with several suplex variations and used their aerial abilities to attack their opponents from the ring ropes. The Headshrinkers relied mainly on using their power to wear down the Steiners. At one point, Fatu picked Rick Steiner up <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> so that Samu could attack Rick from the top rope. Rick caught Samu instead and performed a bodyslam on Samu from Fatu's shoulders. The match ended when Scott Steiner performed a Frankensteiner to pin Samu and win the match.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders).</b> He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E

5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is usually}} {{depicted}} in the lotus position or kayotsarga, a standing posture of meditation. The distinguishing features of Rishabhanatha are his long locks of hair which fall <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and {{an image of a}} bull in sculptures of him. Paintings of him usually depict legendary events of his life. Some of these include his marriage, and Indra performing a ritual known as abhisheka (consecration). He is sometimes shown presenting a bowl to his followers and teaching them the art of pottery, painting a house, or weaving textiles. The visit of his mother Marudevi is also shown extensively in painting. He is also associated with his Bull emblem, the Nyagrodha tree, Gomukha (bull-faced) Yaksha, and Chakreshvari Yakshi.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated {{herself in}} the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to dance the Tāndava with Sati's body <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Knowing that the dance of {{destruction}} was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple {{on top of the}} peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Atlas– A four-armed Titan who {{was imprisoned}} in Tartarus after the Great War. In Chains of Olympus, Atlas was freed by the goddess Persephone and {{captured}} the god Helios on her behalf. Persephone directed Atlas to use Helios' power {{to destroy the}} Pillar of the World. Atlas, however, was chained to the weakened pillar by Kratos, and was doomed to carry {{the weight of the}} world <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> forever. After Kratos defeated Persephone, Atlas mocked Kratos and his choice to defend the gods. In God of War II, Atlas and Kratos met again, and although he was initially bitter towards Kratos, Atlas decided to help him reach the Sisters of Fate, providing him with the magic, Atlas Quake, and stated that they would meet again. This would be Atlas' final appearance, however, leaving his fate unknown. The character was voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in Chains of Olympus.|$|E

5|$|Consuls {{were each}} {{assigned}} {{two of the}} four legions to command, rarely employing all four legions at once to the same assignment. However, the Senate feared a real threat and not only deployed all four legions to the field but all eight, including allies. Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them to alternate their command on a daily basis. The traditional account puts Varro in command {{on the day of the}} battle, and much of the blame for the defeat has been laid <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> However, his low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a scapegoat by the aristocratic establishment. He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were willing and able to protect his reputation— most notably, Paullus was the grandfather of Scipio Aemilianus, the patron of Polybius (one of our main sources of this history).|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match. In an Iron Man match, a {{time-limit}} {{is set for}} a particular amount, in this case thirty-minutes. The match will continue until time runs out and the competitor who gained the most falls when time runs out by pinfall, submission, count-out, or disqualification is the overall winner of the bout. Daniels attempted to get Styles to submit early in the bout by using his Koji Clutch submission hold. Later on, Daniels earned a two-count after landing on Styles with his signature B.M.E. aerial maneuver. Styles also gained a near-fall by holding Daniels <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> before twisting him off and slamming him to the mat {{for what he calls}} a Rack Bomb. With only 13 seconds left in the match and the score still tied zero to zero, Styles performed his signature Styles Clash maneuver and followed with the pin. As time ran out, Styles had the most falls thus retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} a triple threat match, for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, in which {{champion}} Shelton Benjamin defended the title against Carlito and Johnny Nitro. The match began with Carlito performing a springboard moonsault from the ring apron hitting both Nitro and Benjamin in the process. A {{spot in the}} match saw Carlito set up Nitro in a Tree of Woe, a move in which a wrestler suspends his opponent upside down on a turnbuckle, with the opponent's back being up against it, Carlito stood on the turnbuckle, in which Benjamin followed by jumping up with Carlito. Nitro lifted Benjamin <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and threw him down, while Benjamin dropped Carlito, making both men hit the mat. Later in the match, Carlito performed a backcracker on Benjamin. Nitro, who {{was thrown out of}} the ring, returned and removed Carlito from making the cover on Benjamin. He instead covered Benjamin for the pinfall victory, thus becoming the new Intercontinental champion.|$|E

5|$|The leading staged rivalry {{written into}} the event was between Batista and King Booker. At Survivor Series, WWE's November {{pay-per-view}} event, Batista defeated Booker to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 1, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, one of WWE's primary television programs, King Booker and Finlay both demanded a match against Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. General Manager Theodore Long, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced that Booker and Finlay would instead form a tag team to compete against Batista and a partner of his choice at Armageddon. Later that night, Batista announced that his partner would be WWE Champion John Cena, {{a member of the}} Raw brand. The following week on an episode of SmackDown!, Batista defeated Finlay by disqualification after Booker interfered on Finlay's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, Cena defeated Finlay after lifting Finlay up <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and slamming him to the mat, a move that Cena dubbed the FU.|$|E
5|$|After {{locating}} the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos {{is given a}} choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power {{to be reunited with}} his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold {{the weight of the world}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes, its skyline {{dominated}} by the massive statue, the Colossus of Rhodes, is a war-torn city under assault by Kratos, the God of War, and his Spartan army. The Lair of Typhon, hidden in an unknown location, is a snow-topped mountain and prison of the Titans Typhon and Prometheus. The Island of Creation is a vast island located {{at the edge of}} the world and home to the Sisters of Fate. The island is host to deadly traps, puzzles, and monsters. On the outskirts of the island are the Steeds of Time, and on the island itself are the Temples of Lakhesis and Atropos, and the Bog of the Forgotten, which hides the Gorgon Euryale and is the site of Jason of the Argonauts' last battle. Beyond the Bog are the Lowlands and the Great Chasm: a huge divide that blocks the way to the Palace of the Fates. At the base of the Chasm is the realm of Tartarus—prison of the Titan Atlas, condemned to hold the world <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The Temple of the Fates is also filled with traps and monsters, while the final battle occurs on Mount Olympus, home to the gods.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} scripted into Taboo Tuesday was between John Cena and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship, in which Cena would also defend the title against the fans' choice of three {{possible}} opponents: Kane, The Big Show, and Shawn Michaels. The buildup to the match began at Unforgiven, Raw's previous pay-per-view event, in which Cena intentionally disqualified himself. In WWE, a championship cannot change hands via count-out or disqualification, as a result, Cena retained the title. On the October 17 episode of Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, General Manager Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, {{announced that a}} standard match involving three wrestlers, termed as a Triple Threat match, for the WWE Championship, would take place between Cena, Angle and the fans' choice at Taboo Tuesday. Bischoff was scripted to promote three series of qualifying matches, in which the winner would receive {{a spot on the}} ballot as a potential challenger to Cena and Angle. The winners were Kane, The Big Show, and Shawn Michaels. The following week, a Triple Threat match was scheduled between the three competitors. Michaels won the match after he delivered a superkick to Big Show and Kane and pinned the Big Show for the win. The following week, Bischoff announced a singles match between Cena and Michaels. Late in the match, Angle attacked both Cena and Michaels. Cena, however, retaliated and lifted Angle up <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> but Michaels managed to deliver a superkick to Cena.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kaz and Scott SteinerSteiner was {{accompanied}} by Petey Williams and Rhaka Khan. At {{the beginning of the}} bout, Joe placed Kaz and Steiner in various holds and submission maneuvers. Steiner countered this by placing Joe in his signature Steiner Recliner submission maneuver, which Joe escaped by lifting him in the air <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Kaz then jumped off of a turnbuckle and dropkicked Steiner. Later, Joe dove through the second rope onto Steiner. However, Steiner countered by hitting Joe {{in the head with a}} steel pipe while the referee was distracted by Khan. Near the end of the match, Kaz tried to perform his signature Flux Capacitor maneuver on Steiner from a turnbuckle, but Steiner countered by pushing him off to the ringside area. Joe then kicked Steiner in the head and then performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver, driving Steiner neck- and back-first into the mat, at fourteen minutes and thirty seconds to win the contest and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
