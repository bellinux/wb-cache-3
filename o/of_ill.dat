5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador.

On the pretext <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health, he began negotiations {{for the sale of}} his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E

5|$|At age ten, {{with her}} father's fortune disappearing in London, Singh {{attempted}} {{to move to}} India with her father and sisters but they were turned back in Aden by arrest warrants. Although her father disowned her, in 1896 Victoria gave her the three-story Faraday House and a £200 allowance for its maintenance. Singh, who styled herself the Queen of the Punjab, did not initially live in Faraday House; she stayed at the Manor House in Old Buckenham, near her brother Prince Frederick. After a period <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health, her father died in a rundown Paris hotel on 22October 1895 at age 55.|$|E

Simone's music teacher helped establish a special fund {{to pay for her}} education. Subsequently, a local fund was set up to assist her continued education. With the help of this scholarship money she was able to attend Allen High School for Girls in Asheville, North Carolina.|$|E

Abu Bakar married Mutahir's daughter in 1860 during a visit in Pahang, and the following year he signed a treaty of friendship, alliance and a guarantee of mutual support with Mutahir in 1861. Meanwhile, Temenggong Ibrahim was already suffering from a prolonged period <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health, and a bout of high fever resulted in his death on 31 January 1862.|$|E
5|$|Alexandra {{spent the}} spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health and visiting her brother King George of Greece. During the Russo-Turkish War, Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a {{revision}} of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks. Alexandra and her two sons spent {{the next three years}} largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully. In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister, who was now the Tsarina.|$|E

5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans {{to serve as}} officers in the United States military. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war. Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, Charles Young, on a pretense <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks {{that came from the}} camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted {{on the first day of}} the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{political}} career began in 1870, {{when he was}} elected prosecuting attorney of Garrard County. A Republican in the heavily Democratic Eighth District, Bradley was defeated by Milton J. Durham for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872. In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office. Nevertheless, he received the vote of every Republican in the state legislature. The following year, he again lost to Durham for a seat in the House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district. He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for state attorney general in 1879 because <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} as Secretary of War, Eaton returned to Tennessee. His wife suffered a period <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health after arriving. Jackson planned {{to replace him}} in the War Department with Tennessee senator Hugh Lawson White. This would vacate White's senate seat, which Eaton would presumably fill. However, White refused the cabinet position. Eaton attempted {{to return to the}} Senate by running against incumbent Felix Grundy in 1832. Jackson officially remained neutral during the election, as Grundy was also a Democrat. Eaton was defeated. He served as a delegate to the 1832 Democratic National Convention. In a letter to Jackson before the convention, Eaton declared his strong support for Jackson's choice of Van Buren for vice president. He also requested that several of his friends be given appointments in the administration.|$|E

40|$|Background: The actual {{financial}} situation <b>of</b> chronically <b>ill</b> {{people is not}} known. Methods: A postal questionnaire was conducted among {{a sample of the}} non-institutionalised population (4, 206 respondents). Results: Fourteen percent <b>of</b> chronically <b>ill</b> people were found to be poor as compared to 5 % of those not chronically ill. The higher prevalence of poverty is the result of medical expenses as well as a low net income. The lower net incomes <b>of</b> those chronically <b>ill</b> could be partly explained by sociodemographic factors. Conclusions: Governments should recognise the effects of policy measures on expenses {{as well as on the}} income <b>of</b> chronically <b>ill</b> peopl...|$|R

5|$|On March 30, 1780, Scott {{arrived in}} Charleston just as Clinton was laying siege to the city. He was {{captured}} {{when the city}} surrendered on May 12, 1780, and was held as {{a prisoner of war}} at Haddrell's Point near Charleston. Although he was a prisoner, he was given freedom to move within a six-mile radius and was allowed to correspond and trade with acquaintances in Virginia. With the death of William Woodford on November 13, 1780, he became primarily responsible for the welfare of the Virginia troops at Haddrell's Point. He requested his parole on account <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health on January 30, 1781, and in late March, Charles Cornwallis granted the request.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the royal family were {{similarly}} involved. Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), was commissioned in the Royal Navy and saw action as a turret officer aboard HMS Collingwood at the battle of Jutland but saw no further action in the war, largely because <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health. Princess Mary, the King's only daughter, visited hospitals and welfare organisations with her mother, assisting with projects to give comfort to British servicemen and assistance to their families. One of these projects was Princess Mary's Christmas Gift Fund, through which £162,000 worth of gifts was sent to all British soldiers and sailors for Christmas 1914. She took an active role in promoting the Girl Guide movement, the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD), the Land Girls and in 1918, she took a nursing course and went to work at Great Ormond Street Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} One Foot in the Grave were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because <b>of</b> <b>ill</b> health. Renwick persuaded her {{to return to work}} on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E

Emotional stability emerged as the strongest individual predictor <b>of</b> psychological <b>ill</b> health and predicted each of the subscales measured (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism) and overall symptoms. Although agreeableness predicted depression and anger-hostility only, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience did not predict any aspect <b>of</b> psychological <b>ill</b> health investigated. The findings contribute to the current literature and provide further information {{about the relationship between}} personality and symptoms <b>of</b> psychological <b>ill</b> health in adult male offender...|$|R
