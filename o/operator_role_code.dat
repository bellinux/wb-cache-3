The present paper describes the basic tenets of <b>operator</b> <b>role</b> theory and presents a method for using those tenets in the processes of system analysis and design. <b>Operator</b> <b>role</b> theory holds that there are four generic <b>operator</b> <b>roles</b> that are possible in a given function. These four roles (Direct Performer, Manual Controller, Supervisory Controller, and Executive Controller) describe different relationships between humans and automation. The concepts and methods have been used and proven useful in system analysis and design for two helicopter cockpit systems, a computer control system interface, and a traffic management center...|$|R

40|$|Key words: code switching, used, by bawean community. The {{background}} of this thesis, {{language is a}} tool we use to communicate with other people. It is a social aspect of human life, a fundamental part of human in society, and a form behavior. Obviously, language plays its important role in human life. In daily conversation, it is impossible that the people just speak with the regional people that used regional language. Sometimes they will face reality that force them to speak in varieties of language. By using the variants of languages can support the people to make the conversation or interaction more fluently. As a matter of fact, Bawean community in Tulungagung switch their language when they communicate to Javanese interlocutor. The formulation of the research problem: 1) What are the types of code switching used by Bawean community to their Javanese interlocutors? 2) What are the factors of Bawean community used code switching in their interaction to Javanese interlocutors? 3) What are the <b>roles</b> <b>code</b> switching of Bawean community in Tulungagung?

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} a key issue for human {{supervised}} “autonomous” systems, namely situation monitoring. The operator’s involvement within human-robot team is first described as the way they close the control and decision loops. Then a framework based on particle filtering and Petri nets is presented for hybrid numerical-symbolic situation monitoring and inconsistency and conflict prediction within the team. Human-robot team and the operator’s involvement Autonomy is not {{an end in itself}} in robotic systems. Autonomy is needed because we want robots to be able to cope with mission hazards when communications with the human operator are impossible (due to communication gaps, discretion requirements, or to the operator’s workload). Therefore adjustable autonomy must be considered to enable the robots to compensate for the operator’s neglect (Goodrich et al. 2001). The control of shared autonomy may be humaninitiated, a priori scripted or robot-initiated (Brookshire, Singh, & Simmons 2004). Whatever the case, implementing adjustable autonomy requires situation awareness (Endsley 2000) – including predicting what is likely to happen next – both from the operator’s and robot’s points of view (Drury, Scholtz, & Yanco 2003). A functional architecture that is worth considering when dealing with autonomy and <b>operator’s</b> <b>roles</b> within a humanrobot team is the double loop (Barrouil 1993), which parallels the symbolic decision loop (situation monitoring and replanning) with the classical numerical loop (estimation and control) - see Fig. 1. Many papers have suggested autonomy levels for robots (Huang et al. 2004), human-agent teamwork (Bradshaw et al. 2003), UAVs 1 (Clough 2002) and others have focused on the <b>operator’s</b> <b>roles</b> (Yanco & Drury 2002; Scholtz 2003). What we are suggesting here is that the operator’s involvement can be regarded as the way they “close ” the loops (Fong, Thorpe, & Baur 2003). Let us distinguish three main autonomy levels for a single robot or UAV agent...|$|R

Previous research on intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) is considered. The proposed design for OFMTutor is presented, and an experimental evaluation is described...|$|R
50|$|Implementation {{techniques}} differ across programming languages. What {{is common}} to many approaches is that Roles are represented by such constructs as generics, templates, classes, or traits. Code for the basic domain logic is implemented separately, following conventional object-oriented practice and most commonly using classes. Each <b>Role's</b> <b>code</b> is injected into the domain object that will play it during the use case enactment. To implement Roles, method injection is usually needed. Traits are one common programming language technique to support method injection. Some languages, such as Scala, have native support for traits, while other languages (e.g., Ruby and Python) allow run time injection of methods. In Java, pre-compiler tricks based on annotations are needed to support DCI.|$|R

40|$|Research {{over the}} last decade on {{interface}} design has suggested that "configural" or "direct perception" displays provide better support for complex operator tasks than single-sensor single-indicator displays. Ln this paper we focus on the development of displays to support the human <b>operator</b> <b>role</b> in nuclear power plant start-up procedures, which involve rule-based behavior. During start-up operators construct a functioning plant. This process can be characterized as climbing an "abstraction/aggregation hierarchy" from initiating low-level physical functions, combining them into generalized and abstract functions until the plant fulfills its functional purpose (Rasmussen, Pejtersen, & Goodstein, 1994). We introduce a graphical interface based on a visual lattice representation of the abstraction/aggregation hierarchy for nuclear power plant startup which (1) provides constant feedback through the lattice display about the level of abstraction/aggregation achieved, (2) provides feedback about system state through direct perception displays, and (3) promotes the correct sequence of actions...|$|R
