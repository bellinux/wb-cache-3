5|$|From Trinitatis Church, {{the fire}} {{continued}} down Landemærket towards Gothersgade. Here, the fire {{met up with}} the other branch of the fire which ate its way down present day Nørre Voldgade. Around midnight, the church Reformert Kirke was ablaze. The {{only place in the}} city where there was some control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was around Vandkunsten.|$|E
5|$|Morraine, Baelfire, and the Dark One are {{inspired}} by the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. A large Mickey Mouse figurine and small Minnie Mouse figurine are visible during Emma's confrontation with Gold <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Zoso, {{the name of the}} Dark One, is a reference to the band Led Zeppelin, as it is a nickname for the guitarist Jimmy Page.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1997, the 2000 MLS Cup final saw a new club reach the finals along with the Fire. This time the Kansas City Wizards won their first MLS Cup with a 1–0 victory <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fire.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thrust {{specifications}} {{are often}} given as average thrust or peak thrust, sometimes without qualifying which one. Even for a non-throttled engine {{at a fixed}} altitude, thrust can often vary somewhat <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> period due to several factors. These include intentional or unintentional mixture ratio changes, slight propellant density changes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> period, and variations in turbopump, nozzle and injector performance <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> period.|$|R
50|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} {{during the year}} of 2015-16 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> of a beloved faculty member.|$|R
50|$|On 31 January 1945 a RAAF Mosquito {{broke up}} in flight <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> range, killing both crew members.|$|R
25|$|As to the mutinous soldiers, {{they were}} {{motivated}} by despair, not by politics or pacifism. They feared that infantry offensives could never prevail <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> of machine guns and artillery. Pétain restored morale {{by a combination of}} rest periods, frequent rotations of the front-line units and regular home furloughs.|$|E
25|$|Other practical, {{though not}} {{commonly}} needed, applications for campfires include drying wet clothing, alleviating hypothermia, and distress signaling. Most campfires, though, are exclusively for recreation, {{often as a}} venue for conversation, storytelling, or song. Another traditional campfire activity involves impaling marshmallows on sticks or uncoiled wire coat hangers, and roasting them <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Roasted marshmallows may {{also be used for}} s'mores.|$|E
25|$|The $7 million lawsuit {{alleges that}} Mr. Fletcher and Wax Productions were grossly negligent <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> which {{destroyed}} {{part of the}} Gold Coast's Warner Bros. Movie World studios. The alleged grounds of negligence included not having firefighters on stand-by and using timber props near a naked flame. The set where the fire broke out has now been demolished and is a field kept for Movie World for future projects.|$|E
60|$|The kettles {{were soon}} steaming. These hung from tripods erected <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires.</b> Their {{contents}} were flour and pemmican, {{made into a}} thick soup called Rubbiboo.|$|R
60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour the several camps were completed, <b>the</b> kettles boiling <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> <b>the</b> men smoking in every variety of attitude, and talking loudly. It was a cheerful scene; and so Charley thought as he {{reclined}} in his canvas tent, the opening of which faced <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and enabled him to see all that was going on.|$|R
60|$|Hake's unerring bow had {{supplied}} the party with fresh venison and some wild-geese. While they sat <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> that night roasting steaks and enjoying marrow-bones, they discussed their prospects.|$|R
25|$|Resident {{committees}} {{were formed}} in September 2013, which {{announced that they}} would mount a petition drive to recall council members Michael Carrow and Everett Marshall, III, {{in the wake of}} a conflict between the borough council and the volunteer fire department, in which the council passed an ordinance giving the borough control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> department and in response the fire company threatened to close in October if the ordinance wasn't overturned.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the chimney, the hearth moved {{from the center of the}} room to one wall, and the first brick-and-mortar hearths were built. The fire was lit on top of the construction; a vault {{underneath}} served to store wood. Pots made of iron, bronze, or copper started to replace the pottery used earlier. The temperature was controlled by hanging the pot higher or lower <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> or placing it on a trivet or directly on the hot ashes. Using open fire for cooking (and heating) was risky; fires devastating whole cities occurred frequently.|$|E
25|$|The {{water or}} {{retardant}} is carried in three center-line belly tanks. The tanks have internal baffles to prevent fluid shift (and consequent shift {{in center of}} gravity) while in flight, and sit with a 15-inch (38cm) ground clearance. All three tanks can be filled simultaneously {{on the ground in}} eight minutes. The retardant is gravity-fed out of the tanks, and the entire load can be dumped in eight seconds, although the actual drop rate is computer controlled by the flight crew in order to produce the desired retardant spread <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> lines. The aircraft is capable of applying a line of retardant 300ft (91m) wide by 1 mile (1.6km) long.|$|E
50|$|There were {{expressions}} of dismay <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> from Howard Dean, U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren to New York State Republican Assemblymen Steve McLaughlin and Brian Kolb, the Assembly Leader.|$|R
5000|$|Expressing a {{contrary}} opinion, Robert Fisk derided CNN and {{its credibility}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing,</b> saying [...] "Poor old CNN goes on getting more cowardly by the hour. That's {{why no one}} cares about it any more." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{horses are}} hobbled and turned out, {{to pick up}} what {{substance}} they can find {{in addition to a}} slice or two of bread that most of their owners have set apart from the over-night baking. Kettles are soon hanging <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> and it is not long before most of the women have their dough ready and placed in iron baking-pots <b>over</b> <b>the</b> red-hot embers, a pile of which is raked <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cover so as to bake it evenly right through. Two or three deer {{had been shot in the}} morning by the hunters, and <b>the</b> joints hung <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> give an appetising odour very welcome to those whose chief article of diet for many weeks has been salt meat.|$|R
25|$|Price and I {{drove back}} to Panj-kiang to obtain extra food and water.... We had gone only five miles when we {{discovered}} {{that there was no}} more oil for our motor.... Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{relationship}} between the competing editor, Jacobin, and Bratlie's failed replacement, Benjamin, did not go well either. Jacobin reportedly vaunted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> victims. In addition, Benjamin authored a series of critical editorials attacking both cement plants of Concrete for dust pollution which led to a loss of advertising revenue for his paper. As a result, in September 1916, Benjamin sold his rebranded Skagit Valley News to Mrs. N.I. Wolbert, and purchased interest in another Washington local paper Wilkeson Record instead. The strains of the World War I and local competition eventually led to the indefinite suspension of Skagit Valley News, making Herald the only newspaper in Concrete by August 1918.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{contemporary}} culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas stovetops and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted game meat, the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the heating up of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods were mostly prepared by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order to infuse flavours together, yet preserve the original flavours. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and stewing. Meat was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Fia-faia is {{a celebration}} of the winter {{solstice}} dating from pre-Christian times which takes place in Bagà every Christmas Eve. A bonfire is set in the mountains {{to the west of the}} town, where the sun sets. After dark, inhabitants of the town set faies, or bundles of Cephalaria leucanta alight and carry them from the bonfire to the central square of the town, where they are left on the ground. Children then jump <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> singing “Fia-faia, Fia-faia, que nostro senyor ha nascut a la palla”, or ‘Fia-faia, for our Lord is born in the hay’. Afterwards, bread is toasted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> and eaten with all i oli or quince paste.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{there was}} a {{controversy}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> of a theologian, Carmel McEnroy, who taught at the school. She wrote {{an open letter to}} Pope John Paul II about the ordination of women, which caused outrage among bishops throughout the United States.|$|R
5000|$|On May 14, 2007 Paul McNulty, then Deputy Attorney General, {{announced}} his resignation {{in a letter}} to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. At the time, McNulty was considered [...] "the highest-ranking Bush administration casualty in <b>the</b> furor <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> of U.S. attorneys." [...] Later, Gonzales himself would resign.|$|R
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E
25|$|Campfires {{have been}} used for cooking since time immemorial. Possibly the {{simplest}} method of cooking over a campfire {{and one of the most}} common is to roast food on long skewers that can be held above the flames. This is a popular technique for cooking hot dogs or toasting marshmallows for making s'mores. This type of cooking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> typically consists of comfort foods that are easy to prepare. There is also no clean up involved unlike an actual kitchen. Another technique is to use pie irons—small iron molds with long handles. Campers put slices of bread with some kind of filling into the molds and put them over hot coals to cook. Campers sometimes use elaborate grills, cast iron pots, and fire irons to cook. Often, however, they use portable stoves for cooking instead of campfires. :For more information, see Campfire cooking.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Norr {{received}} a financial settlement with <b>The</b> Chronicle <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing,</b> which included his retirement, health benefits, and a statement {{published in the}} Chronicle. California law prohibits employers from <b>firing</b> employees on <b>the</b> basis of political activities. Norr said the settlement {{would allow him to}} continue freelance writing.|$|R
5000|$|Dunlap {{began working}} at the {{restaurant}} in May 1993, and was fired in July after a disagreement he had with his supervisor over schedule hours. Acquaintances of Dunlap said he was frustrated <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing,</b> and told a former coworker {{that he planned to}} [...] "get even" [...] about the termination.|$|R
25|$|Russell was {{a highly}} {{respected}} senatorial colleague and skilled legislator. Russell chaired the Senate investigation into <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> of General Douglas MacArthur. Conducted during a political firestorm <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing,</b> Russell's chairmanship prevented national rancor and layered political motivations surrounding <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> from interfering in a dignified and insightful investigation into the incident. Military historians have printed transcripts of the hearings to instruct on the proper relationship between civilian and military officials in a democracy.|$|R
500|$|The firemen {{made their}} way up an {{enclosed}} staircase with Serial 502 behind them. Dozens of rioters suddenly appeared {{at the top of}} the stairs, blowing whistles and throwing bottles. Pengelly ordered the officers and firefighters to retreat. They were forced to run backwards down the unlit narrow staircase, fearful of tripping <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> hoses, which had been flat before but were now full of water. PC Richard Coombes, armed with just a short truncheon, said the noise – [...] "Kill the pigs!" [...] – was deafening, and he could hardly see through the scratched Perspex visor on his helmet.|$|E
500|$|Jesse Washington {{was a black}} teenage farmhand who was lynched in Waco, Texas, on May 15, 1916, in {{what became}} a {{well-known}} example of racially motivated lynching. Washington was convicted of raping and murdering Lucy Fryer, the wife of his white employer in rural Robinson, Texas. He was dragged out of the court by observers and lynched in front of Waco's city hall. Over 10,000 spectators, including city officials and police, gathered to watch the attack. There was a celebratory atmosphere at the event, and many children attended during their lunch hour. Members of the mob castrated Washington, cut off his fingers, and hung him over a bonfire. He was repeatedly lowered and raised <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> for about two hours. After the fire was extinguished, his charred torso was dragged through the town and parts of his body were sold as souvenirs. A professional photographer took pictures as the event unfolded, providing rare imagery of a lynching in progress. The pictures were printed and sold as postcards in Waco.|$|E
500|$|Many basic {{variations}} of cooking utensils available today, such as frying pans, pots, kettles, and waffle irons, already existed, {{although they were}} often too expensive for poorer households. Other tools more specific to cooking over an open fire were spits of various sizes, and material for skewering anything from delicate quails to whole oxen. There were also cranes with adjustable hooks so that pots and cauldrons could easily be swung away from the fire {{to keep them from}} burning or boiling over. Utensils were often held directly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> or placed into embers on tripods. To assist the cook there were also assorted knives, stirring spoons, ladles and graters. In wealthy households {{one of the most common}} tools was the mortar and sieve cloth, since many medieval recipes called for food to be finely chopped, mashed, strained and seasoned either before or after cooking. This was based on a belief among physicians that the finer the consistency of food, the more effectively the body would absorb the nourishment. It also gave skilled cooks the opportunity to elaborately shape the results. Fine-textured food was also associated with wealth; for example, finely milled flour was expensive, while the bread of commoners was typically brown and coarse. A typical procedure was farcing (from the Latin farcio, [...] "to cram"), to skin and dress an animal, grind up the meat and mix it with spices and other ingredients and then return it into its own skin, or mold it into the shape of a completely different animal.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> pistol is <b>fired</b> by {{a single}} action hammer, and has a manual safety switch on the slide. The ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> pin, causing <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> pin and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|R
25|$|On July 11, 2008 union baristas in Minneapolis, Minnesota {{filed an}} unfair labor {{practice}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> of IWW barista Erik Forman. After an escalating campaign of direct action, including a petition and a work stoppage at the Mall of America location, Starbucks offered Forman his job back and later settled with the NLRB.|$|R
