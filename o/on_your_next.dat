500|$|At {{the start}} of the song, Harrison {{delivers}} a spoken dedication to Frank Sinatra, adding: [...] "we love you, Frank, and we hope you include this one at Caesars Palace <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>next</b> live album." [...] This message referred to Sinatra's adoption of the Harrison composition [...] "Something", which he lauded as [...] "the greatest love song of the past fifty years". On [...] "Far East Man", Inglis finds Scott's multiple horn parts [...] "reminiscent of the soul stylings" [...] of King Curtis, Junior Walker and the Funk Brothers. Unlike on the Wood recording, Harrison's slide guitar appears only midway through the Dark Horse version (overdubbed onto his rhythm guitar part), in a solo that author Elliot Huntley describes as [...] "wonderfully complement" [...] by Scott's [...] "bachelor-pad saxophones".|$|E
2500|$|However, both Benko and Webb {{advocate}} what Webb {{calls the}} [...] "barrage technique": analyze a forced sequence of moves, then play them quickly. Webb explains, [...] "For example, {{if you have}} an obvious exchange of pieces available, don't play it immediately, but first decide <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>next</b> move, and then play them both at once. ... The aim is to catch your opponent with a move he hasn't considered. He will probably have considered most sensible moves in the position on the board, but since he doesn't know what your first move is going to be, he can't prepare replies to your second or third moves. The effect of an unexpected second move bashed out instantaneously can be shattering, even if it isn't particularly good." [...] (Both Benko and Webb emphasize that a player who has a winning position should not play quickly in his opponent's time pressure. Likewise, GM Luděk Pachman remarks, [...] "It is best to continue with one's sound strategic plan, and if one has the better position, it is completely illogical to fish in the murky waters of the opponent's time trouble.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1904 Olympics, Rose bested Coe {{again at}} an event hosted by the Boston Athletic Association. [...] Coe {{reportedly}} became determined to break Rose's world record and [...] "labored faithfully to perfect his style." [...] In February 1905, a large crowd was drawn to watch Coe at the indoor games of the Lawrence Light Guard Athletic Association held in the armory at Medford, Massachusetts. [...] Rose attended the event as a guest and wished Coe luck before his first toss. [...] Coe fell short of the record on his first four throws. [...] As Coe prepared for his final throw, Rose said, [...] "Come on now, old boy, you are in grand form this evening, and {{with just a little}} more power <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>next</b> put, you ought to place my mark well in the shade." [...] The Boston Globe described the final throw as follows:"Coe smiled at the encouraging remark of his famous rival, and then made steady for his final put. [...] The padded shot was carefully poised in his right hand, a firm grip was secured and then, with a lightning-like hop and spring, he drove the ball down the half. [...] He secured splendid altitude, and when it dropped beyond his previous mark, Rose exclaimed, 'You've got it, Coe, and I congratulate you.'" ...|$|E

Jo Joyner, who plays the character, recently suggested that she should not have a fourth. However, speaking to PA, Booth commented: [...] "I'm sure kids would definitely be {{on the list of}} wants for Greg - everything that's secure and 2.4 and blissfully normal - but it's EastEnders, isn't it?

And now, sir, will you follow me?

6000|$|The {{following}} poem is {{the introduction}} to a somewhat longer one, for which I shall solicit insertion <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>next</b> open day. The use of the old ballad word 'Ladie' for Lady, is the only piece of obsoleteness in it; and as it is professedly a tale of ancient times, I trust that [...] "the affectionate lovers of venerable antiquity," [...] (as Cambden says) will grant me their pardon, and perhaps may be induced to admit a force and propriety in it. A heavier objection may be adduced against the Author, that in these times of fear and expectation, when novelties 'explode' around us in all directions, he should presume to offer to the public a silly tale of old-fashioned love; and five years ago, I own, I should have allowed and felt the force of this objection. But, alas! explosion has succeeded explosion so rapidly that novelty itself ceases to appear new; {{and it is possible}} that now, even a simple story wholly unspiced with politics or personality, may find some attention amid the hubbub of Revolutions, as to those who have remained a long time by the falls of Niagara, the lowest whispering becomes distinctly audible.|$|E
60|$|As he {{went downstairs}} Eames was still {{thinking}} of his meeting with Crosbie, and had as yet hardly {{said a word to}} his neighbour, and his neighbour had not said a word to him. Now Johnny understood dinners quite well enough to know that in a party of twelve, among whom six are ladies, everything depends <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>next</b> neighbour, and generally on the next neighbour who specially belongs to you; and as he took his seat he was a little alarmed as to his prospect for the next two hours. On his other hand sat Mrs. Ponsonby, the barrister's wife, and he did not much like the look of Mrs. Ponsonby. She was fat, heavy, and good-looking; with a broad space between her eyes, and light smooth hair;--a youthful British matron every inch of her, of whom any barrister with a young family of children might be proud. Now Miss Demolines, though she was hardly to be called beautiful, was at any rate remarkable. She had large, dark, well-shaped eyes, and very dark hair, which she wore tangled about in an extraordinary manner, and she had an expressive face,--a face made expressive by the owner's will. Such power of expression is often attained by dint of labour,--though it never reaches to the expression of anything in particular. She was almost sufficiently good-looking to be justified in considering herself to be a beauty.|$|E

I've always intended to ask Faith herself, but I've never happened to think of it just when I saw her. What influence could SHE have over Norman Douglas? He was in the store when I left, bellowing with laughter over that scandalous letter. You could have heard him at Four Winds Point. 'The greatest girl in the world,' he was shouting. 'She's that full of spunk she's bursting with it. And all the old grannies want to tame her, darn them. But they'll never be able to do it--never! They might as well try to drown a fish.
