5|$|The slate {{deposits}} of Wales belong to three geological series: Cambrian, <b>Ordovician</b> and Silurian. The Cambrian deposits run south-west from Conwy to near Criccieth; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries {{and in the}} Nantlle Valley. There are smaller outcrops elsewhere, for example on Anglesey. The <b>Ordovician</b> deposits run south-west from Betws-y-Coed to Porthmadog; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog. There is another band of <b>Ordovician</b> slate further south, running from Llangynnog to Aberdyfi, quarried mainly in the Corris area, with a few outcrops in south-west Wales, notably Pembrokeshire. The Silurian deposits are mainly further east in the Dee valley and around Machynlleth.|$|E
5|$|All {{the rocks}} of Helvellyn {{are part of}} the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, formed on the margin of an ancient {{continent}} during a period of intense volcanic activity during the <b>Ordovician</b> period, roughly 450 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Although corals first {{appeared}} in the Cambrian period, some , fossils are extremely rare until the <b>Ordovician</b> period, 100 million years later, when rugose and tabulate corals became widespread. Paleozoic corals often contained numerous endobiotic symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the rock}} {{formations}} found in Juniata County come from def <b>Ordovician</b> Period, seven come from the Silurian Period, and seven come from the Devonian Period.|$|E
5|$|The island {{consists}} of varied geological provinces. In the far west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, {{similar to the}} Scottish Highlands. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of <b>Ordovician</b> and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland. Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, {{is an area of}} granite intrusives into more <b>Ordovician</b> and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Underlying the Albany Pine Bush is a bedrock {{consisting}} of shale and siltstone, laid down 450 {{million years ago}} during the Middle <b>Ordovician.</b> The bedrock is covered by glaciolacustrine deposits which make up the sandy topsoils of the barrens.|$|E
5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the <b>Ordovician</b> to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant {{in almost all}} types of marine sediment across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.|$|E
5|$|The major Ordovician–Silurian {{extinction}} events 450 {{million years}} ago may {{have been caused by}} a GRB. The late <b>Ordovician</b> species of trilobites that spent portions of their lives in the plankton layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A possible explanation is that trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the fact that during the late <b>Ordovician,</b> burrowing bivalve species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks of}} which the mountain is made were formed in the caldera of an ancient volcano, {{many of them in}} violently explosive eruptions, about 450 million years ago during the <b>Ordovician</b> period. During the last ice age these rocks were carved by glaciers to create the landforms seen today.|$|E
5|$|A few mineralized fossils that {{resemble}} corals {{have been found}} in rocks from the Cambrian period, and corals diversified in the Early <b>Ordovician.</b> These corals, which were wiped out in the Permian-Triassic extinction about , did not dominate reef construction since sponges and algae also played a major part. During the Mesozoic era rudist bivalves were the main reef-builders, but they were wiped out in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , and since then the main reef-builders have been scleractinian corals.|$|E
5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early <b>Ordovician,</b> a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of climate changes during the Paleozoic era. When global temperatures were low, {{as in much}} of the <b>Ordovician,</b> the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such much of the Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to middle latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E
5|$|Exiting Bobcaygeon, {{the former}} highway serves cottages along the {{northern}} shore of Pigeon Lake and Little Bald Lake. After passing Nogies Creek, the highway descends a hill and encounters the Canadian Shield for the first time. The road runs along {{the border of the}} Precambrian shield and the <b>Ordovician</b> limestone plateau en route to Burleigh Falls. The shield lies to the north and is overlain by the plateau to the south.|$|E
5|$|Geologically {{the summit}} of the fell forms part of the Deepdale Formation, (principally volcaniclastic sandstone) {{underlain}} by the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Helvellyn Formation. The geology of much of the Lake District is the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, of which Nethermost Pike is part, and is late <b>Ordovician</b> in age. The eastern cliffs of the range, including those of Nethermost Pike, are rich in base minerals. When these rocks weather they form areas of fertile soil, which together with the area's inaccessibility and climate provide suitable conditions for plants of biological importance.|$|E
5|$|In the mid 19th century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick, used their {{studies of the}} geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. From the Latin name for Wales, Cambria (derived from Cymru), was derived {{the name of the}} earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian. After much dispute, the next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the <b>Ordovician</b> and Silurian, were named after pre-Roman Celtic tribes of Wales, the Ordovices and Silures.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick (who first proposed {{the name of}} the Cambrian period), independently used their studies of the geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the <b>Ordovician</b> and Silurian, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area based on Murchison's and Sedgwick's work.|$|E
5|$|Lapworth {{also had}} a {{prominent}} {{role to play in}} the fame of Dob's Linn, a small gorge in the Scottish Borders, which contains the 'golden spike' (i.e. the official international boundary or stratotype) between the <b>Ordovician</b> and Silurian periods. Lapworth's work in this area, especially his examination of the complex stratigraphy of the Silurian rocks by comparing fossil graptolites, was crucial in to the early understanding of these epochs.|$|E
5|$|Mountains in Juniata County include Tuscarora Mountain and Shade Mountain. Agricultural {{land and}} forested land make {{up most of}} the county's area. Major rivers and creeks in the county include the Susquehanna River, the Juniata River, Tuscarora Creek, and West Branch Mahantango Creek. It borders seven other counties. The county lies over 16 {{different}} rock formations (which are from the <b>Ordovician,</b> Silurian, and Devonian) and 51 different soils.|$|E
5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} <b>Ordovician</b> times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene. This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not a catastrophic extinction of diatoms, across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|The Chronister dig site {{is located}} atop the Ripley Formation. The land around the Chronister home and dig site sits atop {{sandstone}} from the Lower <b>Ordovician</b> Period or Canadian Epoch. It {{is located in}} a section of the Ozarks affected by erosion and filled with chert and sandstone debris. In addition, the region has been impacted by frequent faulting, leading to the combination of rocks from different geologic periods. As a result, it is difficult to create an accurate geologic map of the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} for starfish is ancient, {{dating back to}} the <b>Ordovician</b> around 450 million years ago, but it is rather poor, as starfish tend to {{disintegrate}} after death. Only the ossicles and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{next two}} periods of {{geologic}} history, the <b>Ordovician</b> and the Silurian, are {{missing from the}} Grand Canyon sequence. Geologists {{do not know if}} sediments were deposited in these periods and were later removed by erosion or if they were never deposited in the first place. Either way, this break in the geologic history of the area spans about 65million years. A type of unconformity called a disconformity was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) {{conducted an}} extensive three-year study and consultation with Canadians. In 2005, they recommended Adaptive Phased Management, {{an approach that}} emphasized both technical and management methods. The technical method included centralized isolation and containment of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository in a suitable rock formation, such as the granite of the Canadian Shield or <b>Ordovician</b> sedimentary rocks. Also recommended was a phased decision making process supported by a program of continuous learning, research and development.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks that}} form Snowdon were {{produced}} by volcanoes in the <b>Ordovician</b> period, and the massif {{has been extensively}} sculpted by glaciation, forming the pyramidal peak of Snowdon and the arêtes of Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd. The cliff faces on Snowdon, including Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, are significant for rock climbing, and the mountain was used by Edmund Hillary in training for the 1953 ascent of Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the <b>Ordovician.</b> The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E
5|$|During the Silurian period (444–419 Ma) the {{continent}} of Laurentia gradually collided with Baltica, joining Scotland to the area that would become England and Europe. Sea levels rose as the <b>Ordovician</b> ice sheets melted, and tectonic movements created major faults which assembled the outline of Scotland from previously scattered fragments. These faults are the Highland Boundary Fault, separating the Lowlands from the Highlands, the Great Glen Fault that divides the North-west Highlands from the Grampians, the Southern Uplands Fault and the Iapetus Suture, which runs from the Solway Firth to Lindisfarne and which marks {{the close of the}} Iapetus Ocean and the joining of northern and southern Britain.|$|E
5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} system active between 3.5 and 2mya that includes Ojos del Salado and Nevado Tres Cruces. It was the last volcanic centre formed in the region; subsequently, the shallowing of the subducting slab prevented volcanism east and south of it. Another volcanic trend considers Incapillo as part of a northeastsouthwest trend with Cerro Galan and Cerro Blanco. This trend may be related to delamination of the lower crust. Also, these centres are located between two domains of different rigidity, an <b>Ordovician</b> sedimentary domain of low rigidity and a higher rigidity basement.|$|E
5|$|It {{is presumed}} that the fungi colonized the land during the Cambrian (542–488.3Ma), long before land plants. Fossilized hyphae and spores {{recovered}} from the <b>Ordovician</b> of Wisconsin (460Ma) resemble modern-day Glomerales, and existed {{at a time when}} the land flora likely consisted of only non-vascular bryophyte-like plants. Prototaxites, which was probably a fungus or lichen, would have been the tallest organism of the late Silurian. Fungal fossils do not become common and uncontroversial until the early Devonian (416–359.2Ma), when they occur abundantly in the Rhynie chert, mostly as Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota. At about this same time, approximately 400Ma, the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged, and all modern classes of fungi were present by the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian, 318.1–299Ma).|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the Virginia Seismic Zone, located in the Piedmont region. The Virginia Piedmont area was formed originally {{as part of a}} zone of repeated continental collisions that created the ancestral Appalachian Mountains, a process that started during the <b>Ordovician</b> period with the Taconic orogeny and finished during the Carboniferous Period with the Alleghanian orogeny. The reverse faults formed during the various orogenies were partly reactivated as normal faults in extension during the Mesozoic Era as the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart. During the Cenozoic Era, compression from the opening and spreading of the Atlantic has caused some of these structures to be reactivated in a reverse sense.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two kinds}} of oil shale in Estonia, both of which are {{sedimentary}} rocks laid down during the <b>Ordovician</b> geologic period. Graptolitic argillite is the larger resource, but, because its organic matter content is relatively low, it is not used industrially. The other one is kukersite, which has been mined for almost a hundred years and is expected to last for another 25–30years. By the end of 2012, the total kukersite resource was 4.8billion tonnes, of which up to 650million tonnes was recoverable. Kukersite deposits in Estonia account for 1.1% of global oil shale deposits.|$|E
5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the <b>Ordovician</b> period.|$|E
5|$|White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale {{mountain}} region, {{entirely in}} the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of sedimentary <b>Ordovician</b> rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010 {{there are}} no indisputable body fossils of phoronids. There is good {{evidence}} that phoronids created trace fossils found in the Silurian, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and possibly in the <b>Ordovician</b> and Triassic. Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) have collectively been called lophophorates, because all use lophophores to feed. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and morphological features placed lophophorates among or as a sister group to the deuterostomes, a super-phylum which includes chordates and echinoderms. While a minority adhere to this view, most researchers now regard phoronids {{as members of the}} protostome super-phylum Lophotrochozoa. Although analysts using molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. Some analyses regard phoronids and brachiopods as sister-groups, while others place phoronids as a sub-group within brachiopoda.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of sharks dates from the <b>Ordovician</b> period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks {{can be traced back to}} around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.|$|E
5|$|Juniata County lies over 16 {{different}} rock formations, some {{of which}} contain limestone. These rock formations come from the <b>Ordovician</b> Period, the Silurian Period, and the Devonian Period. The northernmost {{part of the county}} contains rocks of the Juniata Formation, the Bald Eagle Formation, and undivided Juniata and Bald Eagle formations. All of these formations primarily consist of sandstone. South of these formations lie the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation undivided, the Clinton Group, and the Tuscarora Formation. The first two of these consist mainly of shale, while the third is composed of quartzite. The rock formations in the southwestern part of the county include the Brallier and Harrell Formations undivided, the Hamilton Group, the Irish Valley member of the Catskill Formation, and others. The eastern part of the county lies almost entirely over the Hamilton Group, the Tuscarora Formation, and the Irish Valley member of the Cataskill Formation.|$|E
5|$|Keswick {{is in the}} lee of the Skiddaw group, {{the oldest}} group of rocks in the Lake District. These fells were formed during the <b>Ordovician</b> period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they form a {{triangle}} sheltering the town, reaching a maximum height of 931m on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of Thornthwaite, is Whinlatter Forest Park and Grisedale Pike. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is St John's in the Vale, {{at the foot of the}} Helvellyn range, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick. In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested £100,000 to remove power lines and replace them with underground cables, to improve the quality of scenery in the vicinity.|$|E
