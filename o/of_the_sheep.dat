30|$|We {{will now}} apply our ABM {{framework}} and simulation tools {{proposed in the}} previous section on a real-world example. In particular we will model <b>the</b> spreading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wool-bearing <b>sheep</b> (as an innovation) among groups of herders (represented by agents) in the ancient world. Between 6200 BC and 3000 BC, <b>the</b> wool-bearing <b>sheep</b> appeared and spread in the area spanned from the Zagros Mountains in the south-east to the Carpathian Basin in the north-west. Prior to <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wool-bearing <b>sheep,</b> herders were already keeping other domestic animals, among them <b>the</b> hairy <b>sheep</b> [67]. <b>The</b> exact spreading path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wool-bearing <b>sheep</b> is a question <b>of</b> interest in <b>the</b> archaeological research community [47, 68]. Here, we will make the assumption that <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wool-bearing <b>sheep</b> in 6200 BC is Tell Sabi Abyad [69] and use forward-modeling to infer possible spreading scenarios. People at that time had a nomadic life-style and {{it has been shown that}} migration and technological change were strongly related [46]. Therefore, it is a reasonable approach to model <b>the</b> spreading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innovation via migration and exchange between herders.|$|R

5|$|The growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheep</b> {{industry}} in Australia was explosive. In 1820, the continent held 100,000 sheep, {{a decade later}} it had one million. By 1840, New South Wales alone kept 4 million sheep; flock numbers grew to 13 million in a decade. While much of the growth in both nations {{was due to the}} active support of Britain in its desire for wool, both worked independently to develop new high-production breeds: the Corriedale, Coolalee, Coopworth, Perendale, Polwarth, Booroola Merino, Peppin Merino, and Poll Merino were all created in New Zealand or Australia. Wool production was a fitting industry for colonies far from their home nations. Before the advent of fast air and maritime shipping, wool {{was one of the few}} viable products that was not subject to spoiling on the long passage back to British ports. The abundant new land and milder winter weather of the region also aided the growth of the Australian and New Zealand sheep industries.|$|E
5|$|In 737, Asad {{launched}} a campaign into the principality of Khuttal, whose rulers had supported the Turgesh and Harith's rebellion. Asad was initially successful, but the Khuttalan regent, Ibn al-Sa'iji, called upon the Turgesh for aid. While the Muslim army was scattered pillaging, the Turgesh khagan Suluk brought his army, allegedly 50,000 strong, from his capital Tokmok into Khuttal within 17 days. Ibn al-Sa'iji, who tried to play both sides off against each other, informed Asad of the Turgesh expedition only shortly before its arrival. Asad had time enough to send ahead his heavy baggage train, laden with the plunder and captives from Khuttal, back south {{under the command of}} Ibrahim ibn Asim al-'Uqayli, accompanied by the contingent from the allied principality of al-Saghaniyan. Asad with the main Muslim army remained behind, but at the arrival of the Turgesh host, Asad's troops broke into a headlong flight for the Oxus, which they managed to reach just ahead of the Turgesh. The crossing of the river was a confused affair, as Asad ordered each of his soldiers to carry across one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheep</b> the army had brought with it as provisions. In the end, the sheep had to be abandoned as the pursuing Turgesh attacked the Arab rearguard, composed of the Azdi and Tamimi tribal contingents, on the north bank. As the rear guard was thrown back, Asad's army hurried to cross the river in panic.|$|E
30|$|As a {{real-world}} scenario, we will demonstrate <b>the</b> applicability <b>of</b> our model and data-driven simulation tool {{to study the}} emergence and spreading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wool-bearing <b>sheep</b> from south-west Asia towards central Europe between 6200 BC and 3000 BC. During this time period human mobility and innovation spreading are considered closely related [46]. Thus, <b>the</b> spreading path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wool-bearing <b>sheep</b> as an innovation can be assumed {{to be linked to}} migration routes and mobility dynamics. Since <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> wool was an important driving force for the textile production and socio-economic development of past societies [47, 48] {{it is a question of}} interest to infer possible spreading patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wool-bearing <b>sheep.</b>|$|R
