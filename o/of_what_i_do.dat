25|$|But a lot {{of these}} songs on this album I kind of magpied. Magpies are this bird in Australia that takes shiny things from {{anywhere}} and builds its nest, and so that's kind <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I’ll take a little of my own experience of having some heavy party time with certain friends, and then I’ll hear some other stories about addicts or other intense relationships. I’ll put them into the mixing pot and make up these characters to explore different possibilities and emotional landscapes.|$|E
25|$|Hymes' {{later work}} focuses on poetics, {{particularly}} the poetic organization of Native American oral narratives. He and Dennis Tedlock defined ethnopoetics {{as a field}} of study within linguistic anthropology and folkloristics. Hymes considers literary critic Kenneth Burke his biggest influence on this latter work, saying, “My sense <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> probably owes more to KB than to anyone else”. Hymes studied with Burke in the 1950s. Burke's work was theoretically and topically diverse, {{but the idea that}} seems most influential on Hymes is the application of rhetorical criticism to poetry.|$|E
500|$|Having {{fulfilled}} {{his creative}} ambition with Instant Vintage, he sought a looser direction for a follow-up studio album. He {{said of the}} direction for Ray Ray in an interview for Rolling Stone, [...] "You only get to make a first statement one time, and I had definite ideas of how I wanted it to sound. Ray Ray represents a more fun side <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I {{wanted to have a}} good time with it." [...] In an interview for The Baltimore Sun, Saadiq discussed the inspiration behind the album's blaxploitation concept: ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, Jared Leto told MTV News {{that he was}} {{preparing}} to shoot a short film for [...] "City of Angels". While he did not reveal much about the music video concept, he added: [...] "It's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special." [...] The shooting took place from August 16–17 in Los Angeles, filming multiple monoliths and murals. Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. He also recruited Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators as well as homeless people {{in the production of}} the video. After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, [...] "Telling stories is a big part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> so it was a really natural and comfortable thing. I think because I did all the interviews myself—I talked to fellow artists and they felt really comfortable. They shared a side of themselves that we don't share very often." [...] Footage from the song's lyric video, which was shot atop the Hollywood Hills, was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{was very}} fond of Caillat's 2007 debut album, Coco. Swift explained, [...] "When it came out, I {{fell in love with}} the way that she makes music." [...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management and asked if she could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E

This is great, but I still like to make new stuff. I've kept my sanity {{over the years by}} doing new stuff and waiting for it to become old enough to be revived". He described how The Surrealists reformed in 2006, for a one-off concert at Azkena Festival, Spain. The Scientists also reunited in 2006 and recorded their performance at Shepherd's Bush, which was issued as a live album, Sedition in the following year.|$|E

On May 11, 2015, {{he received the}} California State Senate's Generational Icon Award from State Senator Isadore Hall III (D–Compton) who represents California's 35th district.

I have my own philosophy and I'm not ashamed of it. I gave the money because there is no other legal way to do it. I don't want to go through ten different corporations to hide my name.

At that time [...] "We thought that The Donnas and Karen O from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the ultimate women of the world". Her varied inspirations include Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens and Neil Young, which her father favoured as she was growing up, as well as Patti Smith, Regina Spektor, Clare Bowditch, Joanna Newsom, and later, Lou Reed and Velvet Underground. Mitchell also formed a duo with another Albury-based friend, Katherine Green, which was [...] "More along the lines <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> on my own now, only a lot folkier. We sang [...] colonial folk tunes actually. Quite traditional and harmony based. We had brilliant fun playing in the chalkboard tents at the folk festivals in Australia".

2500|$|...

When speaking to MTV News in 2009, Drake called the song's co-producer and rapper Kanye West, [...] "the most influential person on his sound", stating, [...] "Before I ever {{got the chance}} to meet him, Kanye West shaped a lot <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> as far as music goes, We always, always, always took the time to listen to Kanye's music and appreciate it beyond. We searched the samples and find out where his inspiration came from, because he has one of the best ears in music, period. He knows how to recognize great music that's not his. He knows how to utilize great sounds and great music. So before I met him, I had the utmost respect for Kanye West. I'd even go as far as to say he's the most influential person, as far as a musician, that I'd ever had in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the past, Cave {{identified}} as a Christian. In his recorded lectures on music and songwriting, he has claimed that any true love song is a song for God and has ascribed the mellowing of his music to a shift in focus from the Old to the New Testaments. He {{does not belong to}} a particular denomination and has distanced himself from [...] "religion as being an American thing, in which the name of God has been hijacked". He said in a Los Angeles Times article: [...] "I'm not religious, and I'm not a Christian, but I do reserve the right to believe in the possibility of a god. It's kind of defending the indefensible, though; I'm critical of what religions are becoming, the more destructive they're becoming. But I think as an artist, particularly, it's a necessary part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> that there is some divine element going on within my songs." [...] When asked in 2009 about whether he believed in a personal God, Cave's reply was: [...] "No". When interviewed by Jarvis Cocker on 12 September 2010, for his BBC Radio 6 show [...] "Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service", Cave stated: [...] "I believe in God in spite of religion, not because of it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Several years later, Noelle-Neumann's Nazi {{connection}} {{came under}} scrutiny from another American academic, {{but she never}} explicitly apologized for her past.
