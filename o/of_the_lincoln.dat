5|$|I-80 {{follows the}} routes {{of two major}} auto trails through the state. In western Utah, I-80 follows the {{historical}} route of the Victory Highway from Wendover at the Nevada state line to the junction of US-40 near Park City. Throughout Utah, I-80 is signed as the modern route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highwayexcept through Salt Lake City, where the Lincoln Highway is routed along State Route 201 and Parley's Way. The route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway across Utah was generally derived from {{the route of the}} Pony Express and the Central Overland Route. However, much of the original route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway west of Salt Lake City is inaccessible. The original route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway proceeded southwest from Tooele towards Ely, Nevada. This area is now used for military bases, such as the Dugway Proving Ground and Tooele Army Depot. The area was closed to the public when these bases were established. I-80 and US-93 are the modern signing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway between those two cities. East of Salt Lake City, I-80 closely parallels the original route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway.|$|E

5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he {{emerged as one of}} the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement.

In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E
