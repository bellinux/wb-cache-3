40|$|The {{connection}} of oil volumes of transformer and tap-changer offers several advantages and savings, {{such as a}} simplified piping construction and the omission of a second <b>oil</b> <b>conservator.</b> Combined oil volumes shall only be applied to vacuum type tap-changers, and the most simple, easy-to-apply and cost-effective solution is achieved by using the connecting bone...|$|E
50|$|Oil {{paint was}} often applied to tintypes, daguerreotypes, and ambrotypes. As with all photographs, the {{materials}} respond negatively to direct light sources, {{which can cause}} pigments to fade and darken, and frequent changes in relative humidity and temperature, which can cause the oil paint to crack. For photographs with substantial damage, the expertise of an <b>oil</b> paintings <b>conservator</b> might be required for treatment.|$|R
50|$|Oil filled {{transformers}} with a <b>conservator</b> (<b>oil</b> reservoir) {{may have}} a gas detector relay (Buchholz relay). These safety devices detect the buildup of gas inside the transformer due to corona discharge, overheating, or an internal electric arc. On a slow accumulation of gas, or rapid pressure rise, these devices can trip a protective circuit breaker to remove power from the transformer. Transformers without conservators are usually equipped with sudden pressure relays, which perform a similar function as the Buchholz relay.|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of metal soaps {{is a major}} problem for <b>oil</b> paintings <b>conservators.</b> The complexes of either lead or zinc and fatty acids are the product of reactions between common pigments and the oil binder, and they are associated with many types of degradation that affect the appearance and stability of oil paint layers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) reveals that a paint sample from The Woodcutter (after Millet) by Vincent van Gogh contains two distinct zinc carboxylate species, one similar to crystalline zinc palmitate and one that is characterized by a broadened asymmetric stretch COO- band shifted to 15701590 cm(- 1). This observation has been made in many paintings. Although several hypotheses exist to explain the shifted broad carboxylate band, these were not supported by experimental evidence. In this paper, experiments were carried out to characterize the second zinc carboxylate type. It is shown that neither variations in the composition of zinc soaps (i. e. zinc soaps containing mixtures of fatty acids or metals) nor fatty acids adsorbed on pigment surfaces are responsible for the second zinc carboxylate species. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR analysis indicate that the broad COO- band represents amorphous zinc carboxylates. These species can be interpreted as either non-crystalline zinc soaps or zinc ions bound to carboxylate moieties on the polymerized oil network, a system similar to ionomers. These findings uncover an intermediate stage of metal soap-related degradation of oil paintings, and lead the way to improved methods for the prevention and treatment of oil paint degradation...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Nautical archaeology can be loosely defined as the study of the material remains of ships and their contents as a component of a broader cultural system. The oceans and lakes of the world are replete with shipwrecks from all eras, and these sites have become the premier source of data for the nautical archaeologist. The inter-relationship between vessel, cargo, and crew is expressed in the assemblages recovered from these sites, and analysis of these remains serves to fill in the expansive gaps between human behavior and the material culture that they leave behind. The excavation of the French barque Belle, which had been part of La Salle's ill-fated expedition to the Mississippi in 1684, yielded several hundred leather artifacts, predominantly in the form of shoes. This thesis first proposes to analyze the Belle footwear assemblage both as a representation of seventeenth century French culture and as a facet of La Salle's final voyage. The harsh environment of the sea floor, however, affects remains from the Belle site in myriad ways. Metal artifacts are transformed into non-descript conglomerations of marine growth and sediments called encrustations, while organic remnants are preserved via chemical reactions with metals, or by quick burial in anaerobic soils. Equilibrium established between artifact and its benthic environment is disrupted upon recovery, and remains must be carefully treated to ensure long-term stability. This is the purview of the archaeological conservator. The role of the archaeological conservator is by no means limited to the stabilization of artifacts. They are also responsible for cleaning, documenting, and analyzing the objects that they treat. The recent introduction of polymer passivation technologies, which relies heavily on silicon <b>oils,</b> provides archaeological <b>conservators</b> with a new option concerning the treatment of organic artifacts. This thesis also proposes to examine this new methodology, particularly focusing on the treatment of the leather objects recovered from Belle...|$|R
