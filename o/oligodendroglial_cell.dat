High Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling in the ventral V-SVZ regulates the production of specific subtypes of neurons destined for the OB. Here we found a transient territory of high SHH signaling in the dorsal V-SVZ beneath the corpus callosum (CC). Using intersectional lineage tracing in neonates to label dorsal radial glial cells (RGCs) expressing the SHH target gene Gli 1, we demonstrate that this region produces many CC <b>cells</b> in the <b>oligodendroglial</b> lineage and specific subtypes of neurons in the OB.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{intracellular}} {{deposition of}} misfolded proteins {{is a common}} neuropathological hallmark of most neurodegenerative disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that these pathogenic proteins may spread to neighboring cells and induce the propagation of neurodegeneration. Results In this study, we have demonstrated that α-synuclein (αSYN), a major constituent of intracellular inclusions in synucleinopathies, was taken up by neuronal and <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Once incorporated, the extracellular αSYN was immediately assembled into high-molecular-weight oligomers and subsequently formed cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Furthermore, αSYN uptake by neurons and <b>cells</b> of the <b>oligodendroglial</b> lineage was markedly decreased by the genetic suppression and pharmacological inhibition of the dynamin GTPases, suggesting {{the involvement of the}} endocytic pathway in this process. Conclusions Our findings shed light on the mode of αSYN uptake by neuronal and <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> and identify therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the propagation of protein misfolding. </p...|$|R

In adult rat tissues, CTL 2 - 4 mRNAs are mainly detected in peripheral tissues, while CTL 1 is widely expressed throughout the nervous system. During rat post-natal development, CTL 1 is expressed in several subpopulations of neurones and in the white matter, where its spatio-temporal distribution profile recalls that of myelin basic protein, an oligodendrocyte marker. We identified two major rat splice variants of CTL 1 (CTL 1 a and CTL 1 b) differing in their carboxy-terminal tails with both able to increase choline transport after transfection in neuroblastoma cells. In the developing brain, CTL 1 a is expressed in both neurones and <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas CTL 1 b is restricted to <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells.</b> These findings suggest specific roles for CTL 1 splice variants in both neuronal and oligodendrocyte physiology...|$|R

We demonstrate biochemically that p 25 {alpha} is a constituent of myelin and a high-affinity ligand for myelin basic protein (MBP), and in situ immunohistochemistry revealed that MBP and p 25 {alpha} colocalize in myelin in normal human brains. Analysis of MSA cases reveals {{dramatic changes in}} p 25 {alpha} and MBP {{throughout the course of}} the disease. In situ immunohistochemistry revealed a cellular redistribution of p 25 {alpha} immunoreactivity from the myelin to the <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> soma, with no overall change in p 25 {alpha} protein concentration using immunoblotting. Concomitantly, an ~ 80 % reduction in the concentration of full-length MBP protein was revealed by immunoblotting along with the presence of immunoreactivity for MBP degradation products in oligodendroglia. The <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> bodies in MSA displayed an enlargement along with the relocalization of p 25 {alpha}, and this was enhanced after the deposition of {alpha}-synuclein in the glial cytoplasmic inclusions.

In situ hybridization histochemistry identified the presence of NGF mRNAs in 9 -day primary oligodendroglial cultures. Combined immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry colocalized NGF mRNA within primary cultured cells that immunostained for the oligodendrocyte marker galactocerebroside (GC). Double-immunofluorescence analysis also colocalized NGF protein within GC+ cells and within A 2 B 5 + cells, a marker for oligodendrocyte progenitors.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} of {{central nervous system}} caused by unknown multi-faceted disease inducing factors. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS, manifests various forms that parallel several aspects of MS. Kynurenine pathway is the major pathway for tryptophan metabolism producing number of catabolites along its route having neurotoxic [quinolinic acid (QUIN) ] and neuroprotective [kynurenic acid (KYNA) and picolinic acid (PIC) ] properties. Kynurenine pathway {{is thought to be}} involved in multiple sclerosis but its precise role and the mechanism involved is yet to be established. Hence, the main aim of this research was to characterize and analyze this pathway in MS mice model focusing therapeutic aspects. The major findings of this project are: (1) Kynurenine pathway enzyme expression was observed in <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> lines (N 19 and N 20. 1) (2) QUIN toxicity on <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> lines may be neutralized by treatment with QUIN monoclonal antibody.

After exposure of <b>oligodendroglial</b> OLN- 93 <b>cells</b> to BP-D-IONPs or D-IONPs {{in the absence of}} serum, the specific cellular iron content increased strongly to around 1, 800 nmol/mg.

The accumulation of both D-IONPs and BP-D-IONPs in the absence of serum was not affected by endocytosis inhibitors, whereas in the presence of serum inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis lowered the particle accumulation by around 50 %. These data demonstrate that <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> efficiently accumulate IONPs by an endocytotic process which is strongly affected by the temperature and the presence of serum and that BP-D-IONPs are a reliable tool to monitor by fluorescence microscopy the uptake and cellular fate of D-IONPs...|$|R
40|$|Missense {{mutations}} {{in the human}} PLP 1 gene lead to dysmyelinating diseases with {{a broad range of}} clinical severity, ranging from severe Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease (PMD) to milder spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG- 2). The molecular pathology has been generally attributed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of misfolded proteolipid protein (PLP) (and its splice isoform DM 20) and induction of the unfolded protein response. As opposed to previous studies of heterologous expression systems, we have analyzed PLP/DM 20 trafficking in <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells,</b> thereby revealing differences between PMD and SPG- 2 -associated PLP/DM 20 isoforms. PLPA 242 V and DM 20 (A 242 V) (jimpy-msd in mice), associated with severe PMD-like phenotype in vivo, were not only retained in the ER but also interfered with oligodendroglial process formation. In contrast, glial cells expressing SPG- 2 -associated PLPI 186 T or DM 20 (I 186 T) (rumpshaker in mice) developed processes, and mutant PLP/DM 20 reached a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Unexpectedly, PLP/DM 20 with either substitution exhibited impaired cholesterol binding, and the association with lipid raft microdomains was strongly reduced. Turnover analysis demonstrated that mutant PLP was rapidly degraded in <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells,</b> with half-lives for PLP > PLPI 186 T > PLPA 242 V. Protein degradation was specifically sensitive to proteasome inhibition, although PLP/DM 20 (I 186 T) degradation was also affected by inhibition of lysosomal enzymes. We conclude that, in addition to ER retention and unfolded protein response (UPR) induction, impaired cholesterol binding and lipid raft association are characteristic cellular defects of PLP 1 -missense mutations. Mutant protein is rapidly cleared and does not accumulate in <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells.</b> Whereas UPR-induced cell death governs the PMD phenotype of the msd mutation, we propose that impaired cholesterol and lipid raft interaction of the rsh protein may contribute to the dysmyelination observed in SPG- 2...|$|R
40|$|Objective Differentiation of <b>oligodendroglial</b> {{precursor}} <b>cells</b> {{is crucial}} for central nervous system remyelination and is influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Recent studies showed that human endogenous retrovirus type W (HERV-W) contributes significantly to brain damage. In particular, its envelope protein ENV can mediate injury to specific cell types {{of the brain and}} immune system. Here, we investigated whether ENV protein affects oligodendroglial differentiation. Methods Immunostaining and gene expression analyses were performed to establish the expression and regulation of the known ENV receptor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), on <b>oligodendroglial</b> precursor <b>cells</b> in human brain tissue and in culture. Cultured primary <b>oligodendroglial</b> precursor <b>cells</b> were stimulated with ENV protein {{to determine the effects of}} this ligand/receptor interaction. Results We demonstrated that the ENV protein is present in close proximity to TLR 4 -expressing <b>oligodendroglial</b> precursor <b>cells</b> adjacent to multiple sclerosis lesions. Human and rat <b>oligodendroglial</b> precursor <b>cells</b> expressed TLR 4, and the ENV-mediated activation of TLR 4 led to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase as well as the formation of nitrotyrosine groups and a subsequent reduction in myelin protein expression. Interpretation Our findings suggest that ENV-mediated induction of nitrosative stress via activation of TLR 4 results in an overall reduction of the oligodendroglial differentiation capacity, thereby contributing to remyelination failure. Therefore, pharmacological or antibody-mediated inhibition of ENV may prevent the blockade of myelin repair in the diseased or injured central nervous system. © 2013 American Neurological Association...|$|R

40|$|Cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor {{necrosis}} factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), can initiate dual effects {{resulting in}} either cell growth or cell death. In this study, the human <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> lines HOG and MO 3. 13 {{were used as}} a model to study the molecular mechanisms of cytokine-induced cell death in human oligodendrocytes. We have previously shown that TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma induce apoptosis in both <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> lines within 72 hr. In the present study, the cell death pathways operating within these cells were further investigated at the gene expression level. Both cell lines express a broad repertoire of caspases and apoptosis-related genes. Some of these genes are specifically up-regulated by cytokine treatment; e. g., caspase- 1 is up-regulated by IFN-gamma. In addition to direct cytotoxic effects, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha also enhance the expression of Fas, TNFR 1, and MHC class I molecules in both cell lines. This suggests that cytokines can make oligodendrocytes more vulnerable to different cell death pathways in an inflammatory environment. cDNA microarray analysis of the HOG cell line revealed that TNF-alpha induces genes that regulate apoptosis, survival, inflammation, cell metabolism, and cell signaling. The data suggest that oligodendroglial cells activate both death and survival pathways upon cytokine challenges. However, the survival pathways seem to be unable {{to compete with the}} death signal after more than 24 hr of cytokine treatment.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a common}} neurological disease,which affects young adults. Its course is unpredictable and runs over decades. It is considered as an autoimmune disease, and is neuropathologically characterized by demyelination, variable loss of <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells,</b> and axonal degeneration. Demyelination provides a permitting condition for axonal degeneration, {{which seems to be}} causative of permanent neurological deficits. Hence, the current treatment, which works preferentially immunmodulatory, should be complemented by therapeutics, which improves remyelination not only for restoring conduction velocity but also for preventing an irreversible axonal damage. One strategy to achieve this aim would be to promote remyelination by stimulating <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> remaining in MS lesions. While central nervous system neurons were already known to respond to neurotrophins (NT), interactions with glial cells became apparent more recently. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that NT influence proliferation, differentiation, survival, and regeneration of mature oligodendrocytes and oligodendroglial precursors in favor of a myelin repair. Two in vivo models provided direct evidence that NT can improve remyelination. In addition, their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory role would support a repair. Hence, a wealth of data point to NT as promising therapeutical candidates...|$|R

Here we investigate the role of Mash 1 in lineage commitment of neural progenitors and more specifically the mechanisms underlying Mash 1 activity in <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> fate specification. We use an in vitro cell culture system to perform Mash 1 locational analysis. Mouse OPCs were cultured as oligospheres that expressed Mash 1, a proportion of which also coexpressed the early OPC marker platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) and oligodendrocyte promoting TFs including the bHLH TF Olig 2 and the high mobility group (HMG) TF Sox 9. We use a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -on-chip strategy and found that Mash 1 protein binds to proximal genomic regions of early OPC genes such as Olig 1 and Sox 8, late oligodendrocyte genes including myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (Mog) and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (Omg), and other genes of interest including Brevican (Bcan), Notch 1 and Sulfatase 1 (Sulf 1). Mash 1 also bound distal genomic regions of Olig 2 and Sox 9 in oligosphere cultures. To formulate a TF combinatorial code for the activation of these putative enhancers, TF synergy were analysed with luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, to isolate genomic regions with activity in the oligodendroglial lineage in vivo we used mouse transient transgenics. We hypothesise that Mash 1 interacts with either neuronal- or oligodendroglial-specific cofactors, and that these interactions modulate Mash 1 activity. To address this question we performed Sox 9 and Olig 2 ChIP and found that some Mash 1 bound elements were also occupied by these TFs in oligosphere cultures. In conclusion, using an in vitro cellular system and ChIP-on-chip technology to interrogate proximal promoter regions bound by Mash 1, {{we can begin to}} elucidate the molecular mechanisms of Mash 1 function in <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> fate specification. ...|$|E

We investigated the combinatorial expression and function of Dlx 1 & 2, Olig 2, and Mash 1 transcription factors in the ventral telencephalon. We show that Dlx homeobox transcription factors, required for GABAergic interneuron production, repress oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) formation by acting on a common progenitor to determine neuronal versus <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> fate acquisition.

To explore its function, we initially studied the expression and localization of agnoprotein in both cultured cells and PML brain using immunohistochemical methods. Employing a speci�c polyclonal antibody, agnoprotein was found mostly in the cytoplasm of persistently infected JCI cells and in the �nely elaborated cytoplasmic processes of <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> in PML brain. The immunohistochemistry indicated that the cytoplasm of <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> was relatively well-preserved in the demyelinated foci. Agnoprotein coprecipitated with tubulin in immunoprecipitation assays and the colocalization of agnoprotein with cytoplasmic tubulin was veri�ed by double immunostaining with confocal microscopy. Transfection of an agnogene deleted JCV Mad 1 strain (Mad 1 D agno) into the susceptible cell line failed to produce not only agnoprotein but also VP 1 and large T mRNAs, whereas the wild-type JCV Mad 1 resulted in the expression of both large T and VP 1 mR-NAs. The cytoplasmic agnoprotein was phosphorylated and when coexpressed with GST-EGFP, was also localized in the cytoplasm. Inhibition of protein kinase A by its inhibitor H- 89, however, reversed the cytoplasmic localization of agnoprotein to the nuclear compartment.

40|$|Abstract Background During the {{development}} of the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes generate large amounts of myelin, a multilayered insulating membrane that ensheathes axons, thereby allowing the fast conduction of the action potential and maintaining axonal integrity. Differentiation of oligodendrocytes to myelin-forming cells requires the downregulation of RhoA GTPase activity. Results To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed microarray expression profiling of the <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> line, Oli-neu, treated with the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y- 27632 or with conditioned neuronal medium. This resulted in the identification of the transmembrane protein 10 (Tmem 10 /Opalin), a novel type I transmembrane protein enriched in differentiating oligodendrocytes. In primary cultures, Tmem 10 was abundantly expressed in O 4 -positive oligodendrocytes, but not in oligodendroglial precursor cells, astrocytes, microglia or neurons. In mature oligodendrocytes Tmem 10 was enriched in the rims and processes of the cells and was only found to a lesser extent in the membrane sheets. Conclusion Together, our results demonstrate that Tmem 10 is a novel marker for in vitro generated oligodendrocytes. </p...|$|E

To investigate the transcriptional regulation of MOG, 657 bp of the 5 '-flanking sequence of the murine MOG gene, previously shown to induce {{the highest level of}} transcription in an <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> line, was analyzed by in vitro footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

In this system, L-MAG was the predominant isoform before the stimulation of cells with cAMP, whereas upon cAMP treatment the S-MAG isoform was predominantly expressed in cells with a high degree of morphological differentiation.

40|$|Proinflammatory {{mediators}} {{have been}} implicated in demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis, whereas it has been proposed that the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin- (IL-) 4 and IL- 10 participate in disease recovery. The present study analysed the effect of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) on proliferation and survival of progenitors and differentiated oligodendrocytes. We also investigated the presence of receptors for IL- 4 and IL- 10 in <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> and explored a possible protective action of IL- 4 and IL- 10 in cultures following LPS/IFN-γ. Finally, the role of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) on cell viability and the modulatory action of IL- 4 and IL- 10 on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression were also analysed. We report that LPS and/or IFN-γ reduced proliferation and viability of <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells.</b> Cell death, presumably by apoptosis as evidence by TUNEL and Annexin V binding, was observed following LPS/IFN-γ, progenitors being more sensitive than differentiated cells. At both developmental stages, LPS/IFN-γ-treated cultures expressed iNOS protein and released micromolar concentrations of NO. In progenitors, LPS/IFN-γ-mediated cell damage was partially dependent on endogenous NO production, whereas NO was fundamental for cytotoxicity of differentiated oligodendrocytes. Both cell types expressed mRNA for IL- 4 and IL- 10 receptors and expression of IL- 10 receptors at the protein level was also demonstrated. Treatment with either cytokine inhibited the expression of iNOS resulting from the proinflammatory stimulation. IL- 10 was more effective than IL- 4 in suppressing iNOS expression and, interestingly, IL- 10 conferred protection against oligodendroglial death evoked by LPS/IFN-γ. Our data {{raise the question of}} whether IL- 10 may play a protective role in demyelinating diseases, not only downregulating the function of inflammatory cells but also promoting survival of progenitors and differentiated oligodendrocytes.

50|$|Diseases {{that result}} in injury to the <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> include demyelinating {{diseases}} such as multiple sclerosis and various leukodystrophies. Trauma to the body, e.g. spinal cord injury, can also cause demyelination. Cerebral palsy, (sometimes developing from periventricular leukomalacia), is largely congenital and caused by damage to the newly forming brain. In cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke and possibly multiple sclerosis, oligodendrocytes {{are thought to be}} damaged by excessive release of the neurotransmitter, glutamate. Damage has also been shown to be mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Oligodendrocyte dysfunction may also be implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{progress}} has been made in identifying the extracellular signalling pathways that regulate neural stem and precursor cell biology in the central nervous system (CNS). The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), in particular BMP 4, are key players regulating neuronal and glial cell development from neural precursor cells in the embryonic, postnatal, and injured CNS. Here we review recent studies on BMP 4 signalling in the generation of neurons, astrocytes, and <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> in the CNS. We also discuss putative mechanisms that BMP 4 may utilise to influence glial cell development following CNS injury and highlight some questions for further research. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Carnosine is a {{dipeptide}} that scavenges free radicals, inhibits inflammation in {{the central}} nervous system, and protects against ischemic and hypoxic brain damage through its anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic actions. Therefore, we hypothesized that carnosine would also protect against white matter damage caused by subcortical ischemic injury. White matter damage was induced by right unilateral common carotid artery occlusion in mice. The animals were treated with 200, 500 or 750 mg/kg carnosine by intraperitoneal injection 30 minutes before injury and every other day after injury. Then, 37 days later, Klüver-Barrera staining, toluidine blue staining and immunofluorescence staining were performed. Carnosine (200, 500 mg/kg) substantially reduced damage to the white matter in the corpus callosum, internal capsule and optic tract, and it rescued expression of myelin basic protein, and alleviated the loss of oligodendrocytes. However, carnosine at the higher dose of 750 mg/kg {{did not have the}} same effects as the 200 and 500 mg/kg doses. These findings show that carnosine, at a particular dose range, protects against white matter damage caused by chronic cerebral ischemia in mice, likely by reducing <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> loss...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} melatonin treatment in a rat model of white matter damage (WMD) in the developing brain. Additionally, we aim to delineate the cellular mechanisms of melatonin effect on the <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> lineage. Methods: A unilateral ligation of the uterine artery in pregnant rat at the embryonic day 17 induces fetal hypoxia and subsequent growth restriction (GR) in neonatal pups. GR and control pups received a daily intra-peritoneal injection of melatonin from birth to post-natal day (P) 3. Results: Melatonin administration {{was associated with a}} dramatic decrease in microglial activation and astroglial reaction compared to untreated GR pups. At P 14, melatonin prevented white matter myelination defects with an increased number of mature oligodendrocytes (APC-immunoreactive) in treated GR pups. Conversely, melatonin was not found to be associated with an increased density of total oligodendrocytes (Olig 2 -immunoreactive), suggesting that melatonin is able to promote oligodendrocyte maturation but not proliferation. These effects appear to be melatonin-receptor dependent and were reproduced in vitro. Interpretation: These data suggest that melatonin has a strong protective effect on developing damaged white matter through decreased microglial activation and oligodendroglial maturation leading to a normalization of the myelinatio...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{identification}} of new pathways governing myelination provides innovative avenues for remyelination. Liver X receptors (LXRs) a and beta are nuclear receptors activated by oxysterols that originated from the oxidation of cholesterol. They are crucial for cholesterol homeostasis, a major lipid constituent of myelin sheaths that are formed by oligodendrocytes. However, {{the role of}} LXRs in myelin generation and maintenance is poorly understood. Here, we show that LXRs are involved in myelination and remyelination processes. LXRs and their ligands are present in oligodendrocytes. We found that mice invalidated for LXRs exhibit altered motor coordination and spatial learning, thinner myelin sheaths, and reduced myelin gene expression. Conversely, activation of LXRs by either 25 -hydroxycholesterol or synthetic TO 901317 stimulates myelin gene expression at the promoter, mRNA, and protein levels, directly implicating LXR alpha/beta in the transcriptional control of myelin gene expression. Interestingly, activation of LXRs also promotes <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cell</b> maturation and remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelination of organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. Together, our findings represent a conceptual advance in the transcriptional control of myelin gene expression and strongly support a new role of LXRs as positive modulators in central (re) myelination processes...|$|E
50|$|Iron {{deposition}} is {{prevalent in}} siderotic brain tissues, with iron concentrations of 1.79 to 8.26 times normal levels. Ferritin, an iron storage protein, is over-produced {{in response to}} excess heme by glial cells in order to sequester iron, with production ranging from 20.1 to 27.4 times normal levels. Excess iron, ferritin, and red blood cells may result in xanthochromia of the cerebrospinal fluid. Amongst neuronal cells types, iron deposition appears to be preferential for <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells,</b> which {{is supported by the}} belief that they can act as iron sinks in the central nervous system. Schwann cells are also frequently damaged, contributing to demyelination.|$|R
50|$|Without myelin to {{insulate}} neurons, nerve signals quickly lose power. Diseases that attack myelin, such as multiple sclerosis, result in nerve signals that cannot propagate to nerve endings {{and as a}} consequence lead to cognitive, motor and sensory problems. Transplantation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which can successfully create myelin sheaths around nerve cells, is a promising potential therapeutic response. Direct lineage conversion of mouse and rat fibroblasts into <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> provides a potential source of OPCs. Conversion by forced expression of both eight or of the three transcription factors Sox10, Olig2 and Zfp536, may provide such cells.|$|R
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} demyelinating {{diseases such as}} multiple sclerosis (MS) is the degeneration and loss of previously established functional myelin sheaths, which results in impaired signal propagation and axonal damage. However, at least in early disease stages, partial replacement of lost oligodendrocytes and thus remyelination occur {{as a result of}} resident <b>oligodendroglial</b> precursor <b>cell</b> (OPC) activation. These cells represent a widespread cell population within the adult central nervous system (CNS) that can differentiate into functional myelinating glial cells to restore axonal functions. Nevertheless, the spontaneous remyelination capacity in the adult CNS is inefficient because OPCs often fail to generate new oligodendrocytes {{due to the lack of}} stimulatory cues and the presence of inhibitory factors. Recent studies have provided evidence that regulated intracellular protein shuttling is functionally involved in oligodendroglial differentiation and remyelination activities. In this review we shed light on the role of the subcellular localization of differentiation-associated factors within <b>oligodendroglial</b> <b>cells</b> and show that regulation of intracellular localization of regulatory factors represents a crucial process to modulate oligodendroglial maturation and myelin repair in the CNS...|$|R
