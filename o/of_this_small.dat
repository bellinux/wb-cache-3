5|$|Members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> {{group have}} either a single divided sucker or {{a row of}} suckers that cover the underside. They infest the guts of bony or {{cartilaginous}} fish and of turtles, and the body cavities of marine and freshwater bivalves and gastropods. Their eggs produce ciliated swimming larvae, and the life cycle has one or two hosts.|$|E
5|$|The Neocallimastigomycota were earlier {{placed in}} the phylum Chytridomycota. Members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> phylum are {{anaerobic}} organisms, living in the digestive system of larger herbivorous mammals and in other terrestrial and aquatic environments enriched in cellulose (e.g., domestic waste landfill sites). They lack mitochondria but contain hydrogenosomes of mitochondrial origin. As in the related chrytrids, neocallimastigomycetes form zoospores that are posteriorly uniflagellate or polyflagellate.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, several disappearances at an idyllic planned community lead Mulder and Scully to go undercover as a married couple. They find {{that the members of}} the community strictly abide by every single subdivision rule, no matter how inconsequential a rule may seem. What Mulder and Scully soon discover is that the ruler <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> community has enforced his rule with a Tulpa creature from Tibet.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Varaklani, a {{relatively}} small town, had about 540 remaining Jews when the Germans gained control. They were shot into graves {{they were forced to}} dig on August 4, 1941.

25|$|Because of {{the limited}} number of {{starting}} hands, most strategy guides include a detailed discussion of each of them. This distinguishes hold 'em from other poker games where the number of starting card combinations forces strategy guides to group hands into broad categories.

The low mountain ranges around Wetzlar to the northwest, northeast and south, on the other hand, are heavily wooded and very thinly populated.|$|E
25|$|Most {{elemental}} silicon produced {{remains as}} a ferrosilicon alloy, {{and only about}} 20% is refined to metallurgical grade purity (a total of 1.3–1.5 million metric tons/year). An estimated 15% of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity. However, the economic importance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> very high-purity fraction (especially the ~ 5% which is processed to monocrystalline silicon for integrated circuits) is disproportionately large.|$|E
25|$|The Caucasian Albanian {{tribes of}} Hereti were {{converted}} to Eastern Orthodoxy by Dinar, Queen of Hereti in the 10th century.

In 1010, Hereti became absorbed into the neighbouring Georgian kingdom of Kakheti.

25|$|A multi-locus {{molecular}} {{study by}} Jörger et al. (2010), included {{six out of}} seven acochlidian families. It confirmed Acochlidiacea in a pulmonate relationship, as sister to Eupulmonata. Euthyneura, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata as traditionally defined were found non-monophyletic. The enigmatic amphibious and insectivorous Aitengidae clusters within Acochlidiacea, as sister to meiofaunal and brackish Pseudunelidae and limnic Acochlidiidae. Inclusion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> acochlidian group resulted in redefinition of major groups within Heterobranchia, {{that has led to}} creation of the new clades Euopisthobranchia and Panpulmonata.|$|E

This contains a number of offices, including that of the Ringmaster, accessed from a walkway at the rear.|$|E
25|$|Pitting {{results when}} a small hole, or cavity, forms in the metal, usually {{as a result of}} de-passivation of a small area. This area becomes anodic, while part of the {{remaining}} metal becomes cathodic, producing a localized galvanic reaction. The deterioration <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> area penetrates the metal and can lead to failure. This form of corrosion is often difficult to detect {{due to the fact that}} it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds.|$|E

25|$|Cemeteries take {{up another}} large part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> neighborhood, {{although}} they are separated from residential areas for the most part. The Mount Olivet Cemetery, the largest cemetery in the neighborhood, is located on a high hill in Maspeth and {{used to be an}} outer-borough vacation site. Mount Olivet Cemetery was planned on March 26, 1850, when James Maurice held a meeting at his Maspeth house to discuss the formation of the cemetery. Notable interments in the cemetery include cosmetics magnate Helena Rubinstein Courielli and sixteen victims of the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.|$|E
25|$|After {{completion}} of his bachelor's degree, Elkins joined the ANARE team that wintered over at Mawson Station in Australian Antarctic Territory, East Antarctica in 1960. The wintering party comprised 33 expeditioners including 12 {{members of the}} RAAF Antarctic Flight; the Officer-in-Charge was Hendrick Geysen. That year, Elkins {{was part of a}} mechanised and sledging field party that travelled from Mawson Station to the Napier Mountains in Enderby Land, East Antarctica. The men of this expedition, led by fellow Antarctic explorer Syd Kirkby, conducted the first geological surveys of that area of the continent. The highest <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> group of mountains, Mount Elkins, was subsequently named after Dr. Elkins.|$|E
25|$|The village {{which was}} built around the castle took {{advantage}} of its strategic position {{as well as the}} protection of the Viscounts of Béarn to widely develop over the following centuries. Pau became the capital of Béarn in 1464, thus becoming the political, cultural and economic centre <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>small</b> State which continued to defend its independence from the neighbouring French, English and Spanish peoples. The town and its castle took on a new dimension by becoming the seat of the Kings of Navarre, at the capture of Pamplona, by the Kingdom of Castile in 1512. Pau became a leading political and intellectual centre under the reign of Henry d'Albret and his wife Marguerite.|$|E
