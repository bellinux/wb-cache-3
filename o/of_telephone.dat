5|$|Along the coast, large waves damaged 15 to 20boats in Falmouth, Maine harbor. Total boat {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at $250,000. Coastal residents in low-lying beach areas of Cumberland and York counties were evacuated in Maine. Several counties lost power during the storm. In Southwest Harbor, lightning struck the Dirigo Hotel, causing a fire that resulted in $100,000 in damages. Winds caused a lost <b>of</b> <b>telephone</b> and electrical services in the Auburn-Lewiston area due to falling trees or tree branches. Television antennas were damaged, as were several signs, including a Sears sign. In addition, 25% to 40% of the apple crop was destroyed.|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth <b>of</b> <b>telephone</b> channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, {{a special}} {{branch of the}} Kempeitai under Lieutenant Colonel Haruzo Sumida was charged with finding the culprits {{responsible}} for acts of sabotage in Singapore, mainly the cutting <b>of</b> <b>telephone</b> lines and the burning of warehouses. Sumida strongly suspected that the saboteurs were being organised by internees in Changi Prison, and made preparations for a raid on the prison to catch the ringleaders. Sumida's chief suspect was British barrister Rob Heeley Scott, a prominent Foreign Office employee who had previously been detained for his anti-Japanese propaganda, released by the Kempeitai, and then later sent to Changi Prison.|$|E

5|$|The {{unusually large}} wind field uprooted many {{thousands}} of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands <b>of</b> <b>telephone</b> poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. Two {{people in the region}} died due to falling trees—one in New Kent County and one in the city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor car accidents. Additionally, most gas stations were closed, due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable. Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues, the longest it has ever been closed during a school term. Likewise, Norfolk State University, Regent University, Tidewater Community College and Eastern Virginia Medical School all experienced significant closing times due to both storm damage and a lack of electricity.|$|E

5|$|The 47th Division {{planned to}} attack with two brigades, each {{reinforced}} by a battalion from the reserve brigade, along {{either side of}} the Ypres–Comines Canal. Large numbers of machine-guns were organised to fire offensive and defensive barrages and signal detachments were organised to advance with the infantry. An observation balloon was reserved for messages by signal lamp from the front line, as insurance against the failure <b>of</b> <b>telephone</b> lines and message-runners. The divisional trench mortar batteries were to bombard the German front line opposite the 142nd Brigade, where it was too close for the artillery to shell without endangering British troops. Wire-cutting began in mid-May, against considerable local retaliation by German artillery. At the end of May the two attacking brigades began training at Steenvoorde, on practice courses built to resemble the German positions to be attacked, using air reconnaissance photographs to mark the positions of machine-gun posts and hidden barbed wire. Divisional intelligence summaries were used to plan the capture of German company and battalion headquarters. The 140th Brigade with four tanks attached, was to occupy White Château and the adjacent part of , while the 142nd Brigade attacked the spoil heaps and the canal bank to the left. On 1 June, the British artillery began the intense stage of preparatory bombardment for trench-destruction and wire cutting and the two attacking brigades assembled for the attack from 4 to 6 June.|$|E
5|$|The Parsons family spent mid-1929 {{on a tour}} of Europe before {{returning}} to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper El Universitano and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the Hercules Powder Company, where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel rocket engine, and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had hours <b>of</b> <b>telephone</b> conversations about rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.|$|E

40|$|The {{advancement}} {{of modern technology}} shapes and develops new expressions of psychopathology and accompanying treatments. This is most apparent with the <b>telephone,</b> an instrument <b>of</b> contact and communication for the patient, and assessment and intervention for the therapist. The telephone both constrains and creates unique constellations of patient symptomatology. This paper will examine one such telephone symptom complex-the habitual over use <b>of</b> the <b>telephone</b> by non-bipolar patients. The frequent monopolization of the phone seen in some bipolar patients will not be considered, though the elements of intrusion and aggression discussed in this paper are probably shared by manic patients. A review of the psychiatric literature reveals a surprising paucity of writing about the psychodynamic significance of patient 2 ̆ 7 s use <b>of</b> the <b>telephone,</b> even {{in the area of}} sexual paraphilias and sexually obscene phone calls. Freud describes the telephone as a representation of the body, and as a metaphor for psychoanalysis (1, 2). Stekel (3) discusses the telephone as a sexual symbol, and Harris (4) relates phobic anxiety <b>of</b> the <b>telephone</b> to castration anxiety. Fliess (5) is the first to write <b>of</b> <b>telephoning</b> as a symbol for masturbation, an idea elaborated by Shengold in his paper The Symbol <b>of</b> <b>Telephoning</b> (6). Alman si, Socarides, and others have written of the use <b>of</b> the <b>telephone</b> in sexual paraphilias (7, 8). The bulk of writing in the mental health literature, however, focuses on the use <b>of</b> the <b>telephone</b> in counseling services and suicide hotlines. With the ever increasing utilization <b>of</b> the <b>telephone</b> by patient and therapist alike, this limited analysis of the meaning and uses <b>of</b> the <b>telephone</b> in the psychiatric literature is an intriguing deficiency in the understanding of patient behavior...|$|R

Aspects of formal aesthetics ("design 2 ̆ 7 in a more narrow but common understanding) <b>of</b> <b>telephones</b> (and other products) are looked at in this broader perspective which could be labelled "phenomenology of embodied technology 2 ̆ 7. — The first chapter puts telephones {{in the context of the}} general trend to small, compact, mobile, and multifunctional devices.
