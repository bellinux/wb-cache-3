The work is basically an overview of <b>optical</b> CDMA <b>and</b> <b>optical</b> coding <b>and</b> their major technical concerns. Comparison has been done for various OCDMA concerns such as optical coding techniques, Encoders/Decoders, multiple user interferences, optical sources, <b>optical</b> noises <b>and</b> <b>optical</b> threshold techniques...|$|R
40|$|<b>Optical</b> {{differentiation}} <b>and</b> <b>optical</b> Hilbert transformation play {{important roles}} in communications, computing, information processing and signal analysis in optical domain which offering huge bandwidth. Meanwhile, silicon-based photonic integrated circuits are preferable in all-optical signal processing due to their intrinsic advantages of low power consumption, compact footprint and ultra-high speed. In this study, we analyze the interrelation between first-order <b>optical</b> differentiation <b>and</b> <b>optical</b> Hilbert transformation <b>and</b> then experimentally demonstrate a feasible integrated scheme which can simultaneously function as first-order <b>optical</b> differentiation <b>and</b> <b>optical</b> Hilbert transformation based on a single microdisk resonator. This finding may motivate the development of integrated optical signal processors. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5|$|In 1964, Bell Labs {{formulated}} {{their own}} set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X. Working with the Army, Air Force, Lincoln Labs and ARPA, the Nike-X Reentry Measurements Program (RMP) ran {{a long series of}} reentry measurements with the Project PRESS radars, especially TRADEX. Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with <b>optical</b> <b>and</b> infrared telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical reentry vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, {{with a wide variety of}} vehicle shapes and penetration aids.|$|E
5|$|In theory, {{if enough}} {{satellites}} were created and deployed around their star, they would compose a non-rigid {{version of the}} Dyson shell mentioned below. Such a shell would not suffer from the drawbacks of massive compressive pressure, nor are the mass requirements of such a shell {{as high as the}} rigid form. Such a shell would, however, have the same <b>optical</b> <b>and</b> thermal properties as the rigid form, and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion (see below).|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the first}} p-block noble gas, and the first element with a true octet of electrons. It is inert: {{as is the case}} with its lighter analogue, helium, no {{strongly}} bound neutral molecules containing neon have been identified. The ions +, +, and + have been observed from <b>optical</b> <b>and</b> mass spectrometric studies. Solid neon clathrate hydrate was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures 0.35–0.48 GPa and temperatures ca. –30°C. Ne atoms are not bonded to water and can freely move through this material. They can be extracted by placing the clathrate into a vacuum chamber for several days, yielding ice XVI, the least dense crystalline form of water.|$|E

5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for <b>optical</b> <b>and</b> electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E

5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution <b>optical</b> <b>and</b> infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E

The unit cells are materials that are ordered in geometric arrangements with dimensions that are fractions of the wavelength of the radiated electromagnetic wave.
