50|$|The English word 'Thug' {{is in fact}} {{borrowed}} from the Hindi word 'Thag'. The thugs were covert members of a group, and the term 'Thugee' typically referred to an act of deceitful and <b>organised</b> <b>robbery</b> and murder.|$|E
50|$|The European Union's law {{enforcement}} agency, Europol, set up Operation Oakleaf in 2011 {{at the request}} of the Irish Police, in order to gather intelligence on the group.

In the early 19th century, the armoury was altered by the British with the addition of Egyptian style column-like supports. These were removed and returned to England in 1855.|$|E

5000|$|Tipu Sultan [...] "Islamized" [...] {{the place}} names across Malabar; Mangalapuram (Mangalore) {{was changed to}} Jalalabad, Cannanore (Kanwapuram) to Kusanabad, Beypore (Vaippura) to Sultanpatanam or Faruqui, and Calicut to Islamabad. It was only {{after the death of}} Tipu Sultan that the local people reverted to old names; however, only one of the names is intact, Feroke. In Cherunad, Vettathunad, Eranad, Valluvanad, Thamarassery and other {{interior}} areas, local Mappilas unleashed a reign of terror on the Hindu population, mainly to retain the occupied land of Hindu landlords and to establish their domination over Hindus.

50|$|Other {{residents}} of the street were regularly harassed by men employed by Theeman, as he attempted to have them evicted from their houses. The men were led by Fred Krahe, a former detective with the New South Wales Police.

50|$|According to the Eurojust Decision, Eurojust may {{act when}} {{two or more}} Member states are {{affected}} crimes in which Europol is entitled to act, including organised crime, terrorism {{and other forms of}} serious crime (unlawful drug trafficking, illegal moneylaundering activities, crime connected with nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings, motor vehicle crime, murder, grievous bodily injury, illicit trade in human organs and tissue, kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage taking, racism and xenophobia, <b>organised</b> <b>robbery,</b> illicit trafficking in cultural goods, including antiquities and works of art, swindling and fraud, racketeering and extortion, counterfeiting and product piracy, forgery of administrative documents and trafficking therein, forgery of money and means of payment, computer crime, corruption, illicit trafficking in arms, ammunition and explosives, illicit trafficking in endangered animal species, illicit trafficking in endangered plant species and varieties, environmental crime, illicit trafficking in hormonal substances and other growth promoters). It may also act on other types of crime if they are committed together with one of the above or if it is requested by a member state. In 2010, about 10% of the cases handled by Eurojust fell into this category.|$|E
5000|$|The Indian Subcontinent {{has had a}} {{long and}} {{documented}} history of <b>organised</b> <b>robbery</b> for millennia. Most famous of these were the Thuggees, a quasi-religious group that robbed travellers on Indian roads until the cult was systematically eradicated in the mid-1800s by British colonial administrators. Thugees would befriend large road caravans, gain their confidence, strangle them to death at the right moment, and then rob them of their valuables. According to some estimates the Thuggees murdered 1 million people between 1740 and 1840. More generally, armed bands known colloquially as [...] "dacoits" [...] have long wreaked havoc on many parts of the country. In recent times this has often served as a way to fund various regional and political insurgencies that includes the Maoist Naxalite movement.Kayamkulam Kochunni was also a famed highwayman who was active in Central Travancore in the early 19th century. Along with his close friend Ithikkarappkki from the nearby Ithikkara village, he is said to have stolen from the rich and given to the poor. With the help of an Ezhava warrior called Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker, Kochunni was arrested and sent to the infamous Poojappura Central Jail. Legends of his works are compiled in folklore and are still read and heard today.|$|E
5000|$|The playoff {{match was}} played at Serra Dourada Stadium, in Goiânia, a venue {{selected}} by Flamengo. Atlético elected the referee, José Roberto Wright who, until the match, {{was considered the}} best in the country. At the 33rd minute of the match, Atlético forward and star player Reinaldo received a straight red card from the referee after fouling Flamengo's Zico, in what was described by the press as a [...] "normal" [...] foul and [...] "without much violence". After the foul, Atlético player Éder was sent off for complaining, and the game was stopped. A turmoil started, and Atlético players Palhinha and Chicão were also sent off for insulting the referee. Left with seven players, Atlético's goalkeeper João Leite claimed he was injured when the match was restarted, but Wright did not stop the game. Atlético defender Osmar then held the ball with his hands, preventing the restart, and was also sent off. The match ended as a goalless draw at the 37-minute mark because Atlético had fewer than seven players on the field. The result meant qualification for Flamengo, as it had the best goal difference in the group stage. Here in Goiânia, what happened? Expecting to watch a great game, expecting to watch Reinaldo, Zico, Cerezo, Éder and other big aces of Brazilian and world football, a multitude completely crowded the Serra Dourada and ended up watching this shame of our football. The match transformed itself in one of the biggest robberies of recent times. It was an <b>organised</b> <b>robbery.</b> João Saldanha (journalist and former head coach of the Brazil national team). Jornal do Brasil, 22 August 1981. After the match, Atlético unsuccessfully appealed to a CONMEBOL court for its annulment. According to Wright, Reinaldo's foul was indeed [...] "normal", but he was sent off because of a previous verbal warning. He also stated that Éder, Palhinha and Chicão continued to be undisciplined and that he had to send Éder off to not lose control of the match. The episode and referee Wright's performance were described by Brazilian and South American media at the time as [...] "shameful", [...] "deplorable" [...] and [...] "disgraceful". Flamengo advanced to the semi-finals and {{went on to win the}} competition.|$|E
50|$|In the {{subsequent}} {{investigation by the}} Garda following Guerin's murder, Traynor {{was found to be}} involved {{in a wide variety of}} criminal enterprises. Second in command to Gilligan, the gang had operations from <b>organising</b> armed <b>robberies</b> to drug smuggling, embezzlement and prostitution. The Criminal Assets Bureau was later successful in the High Court, when a judgment mortgage was registered on the Arbour Hill shop, and seizure of a significant portion of the disposal of a property owned by Traynor in Waterford.|$|R

She reached the height of her career in England, when she was taken up by aristocrat Sir Sidney Hamilton Gore, who is said to have proposed marriage to her - shortly before he shot himself.|$|R
50|$|Gad's Hill {{was once}} notorious as a haunt of robbers. As {{far back as}} 1558 there was a ballad {{entitled}} The Robbers of Gad's Hill.

50|$|Over {{the years}} accusations {{of a range}} of {{criminal}} activity not linked to football has been levelled towards the CCS as a whole as well as individuals within it. The police have been quoted in the Scottish press as stating the gang (or its members) have carried out or are responsible for <b>organising</b> armed <b>robberies,</b> shoplifting sprees, street muggings, housebreakings, protection rackets, extortionism, drug dealing and murders as well as continuous public order offences around night life in pubs and clubs.

He suggests that they <b>organise</b> a <b>robbery.</b> When Falstaff and the others agree, Poins says to Hal that the pair of them should play trick on Falstaff by letting them rob the travellers, but then robbing the robbers of their haul. The point of the jest will be to hear the [...] "incomprensible enormous lies" [...] Falstaff will tell to excuse himself. Poins and Hal disguise themselves. When they surprise Falstaff, he and his followers instantly run away.|$|R

50|$|Loitering has {{historically}} been treated as an inherent preceding offense {{to other forms of}} public crime and disorder, such as prostitution, begging, public drunkenness, dealing in stolen goods, scams, <b>organised</b> crime, <b>robbery,</b> harassment/mobbing, etc. Especially when criminal intent is suspected but not observed, loitering provides a lesser offense that can be used by police to confront and deter suspect individuals from lingering in a high-crime area. Local areas vary on the degree to which police are empowered to arrest or disperse loiterers; limitations on their power are sometimes made over concerns regarding racial profiling and unnecessary use of police force. The offense remains highly subjective: in many places, loitering is a crime in and of itself, while in others it is not, and serious criminal activity must be observed before police can confront any suspect.|$|R

5000|$|In 1817 O'Connor {{and his son}} Arthur {{were arrested}} {{on a charge of}} having <b>organised</b> a mail <b>robbery</b> five years earlier, during which a guard was shot and killed. Two of the robbers had been apprehended after {{attempting}} to pass some of the stolen property, and had implicated O'Connor. The robbers were labourers employed on O'Connor's estate. It was alleged that O'Connor's steward Martin McKeon had conspired with him to <b>organise</b> the <b>robbery,</b> with McKeon recruiting the robbers. O'Connor was allegedly motivated by debt. Both men were put on trial. Arthur was also arrested, but later released. O'Connor stated that his only connection to the robbery was that his son had found the abandoned mailbags on his land. An endorsement of O'Connor's moral character was given by O'Connor's close friend the MP Sir Francis Burdett, who stated that he was happy to lend any sum of money to O'Connor. O'Connor and McKeon were both acquitted, as the accusers' evidence was not considered credible. O'Connor and his supporters pointed out that the robbers had been spared the death penalty for testifying against him. O'Connor published his version of events, in which he argued {{that there had been a}} conspiracy to have him convicted. He claimed this was only the most recent of ten conspiracies to kill him, [...] "being the first against my character—the tenth against my life in the past twenty-four years".

The rest of the crew plan to use the exchange to rescue Mal, but they are interrupted by the Drone Operator, who attacks both groups from his ship. Robots deployed by the ship are dealt with by the Serenity crew and Ephraim's assistants, while Mal and Ephraim team up to successfully destroy the ship. The two groups go their separate ways, but upon returning to Serenity, the crew find that they have been robbed.

25|$|From 1903–1912, Kamo, {{a master}} of disguise, carried {{out a number of}} militant {{operations}} on behalf of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, mostly in Georgia, then part of the Russian Empire. He {{is best known for his}} central role in the 1907 Tiflis bank <b>robbery,</b> <b>organised</b> by Bolshevik leaders to raise funds for their party activities. For his militant activities he was arrested in Berlin in 1907 but simulated insanity both in German and later Russian prisons, eventually escaping from prison and fleeing the country. He was recaptured in 1912 after another attempted armed robbery and sentenced to death. The death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment as part of the celebrations of the Romanov dynasty tricentennial.|$|R
50|$|O'Connor's father Roger {{was known}} for his eccentricities. After his wife died in 1806, he became {{increasingly}} erratic. Matters worsened in 1809 when there was a serious fire that destroyed part of the house. Francisco wrote in his autobiography 60 years later that he had accidentally started the fire himself when melting lead to create bullets. In 1817 his father was arrested for allegedly <b>organising</b> a mail <b>robbery.</b> He was acquitted, but local rumours continued to blame him for the crime. The family no longer felt welcome in the area. Francis and his brother Feargus decided to leave, stealing horses from their brother Roderic, travelling to London and asking to be taken in by family friend M.P. Francis Burdett. Burdett looked after them, and Francisco later added his name to his surname.|$|R
5000|$|He soon {{joined the}} Irish Republican Brotherhood. He fought in Marrowbone Lane in the 1916 Easter Rising.

60|$|I have {{mentioned}} H.I.H. the Princess Frederica Amelia, who {{was affected by}} my success, and shall always think with gratitude of the protection with which that exalted lady honoured me. She was passionately fond of play, as indeed were the ladies of almost all the Courts in Europe in those days, and hence would often arise no small trouble to us; for the truth must be told, that ladies love to play, certainly, but not to PAY. The point of honour is not understood by the charming sex; and {{it was with the}} greatest difficulty, in our peregrinations to the various Courts of Northern Europe, that we could keep them from the table, could get their money if they lost, or, if they paid, prevent them from using the most furious and extraordinary means of revenge. In those great days of our fortune, I calculate that we lost no less than fourteen thousand louis by such failures of payment. A princess of a ducal house gave us paste instead of diamonds, which she had solemnly pledged to us; another <b>organised</b> a <b>robbery</b> of the Crown jewels, and would have charged the theft upon us, but for Pippi's caution, who had kept back a note of hand 'her High Transparency' gave us, and sent it to his ambassador; by which precaution I do believe our necks were saved. A third lady of high (but not princely) rank, after I had won a considerable sum in diamonds and pearls from her, sent her lover with a band of cut-throats to waylay me; and it was only by extraordinary courage, skill, and good luck, that I escaped from these villains, wounded myself, but leaving the chief aggressor dead on the ground: my sword entered his eye and broke there, and the villains who were with him fled, seeing their chief fall. They might have finished me else, for I had no weapon of defence.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{extensive}} redevelopment, {{throughout the}} 1980s and 1990s the area experienced chronic poverty, deprivation and unemployment. This social deprivation led to {{increased levels of}} gang crime linked to illegal narcotics, firearms and <b>robberies.</b> <b>Organised</b> crime in Salford, particularly in Ordsall and Pendleton, [...] "began to have a disturbing effect on grass roots democracy. Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives announced they would not contest certain Salford wards" [...] because they regarded them as [...] "unsafe" [...] and would put their [...] "party workers at risk". Salford's social amenities and the night-time economy folded amid criminal [...] "intimidation", [...] "drug use, fights and demands for money". In early 2005, the Government of Latvia appealed to the European Union to advise people against travelling to Salford after a Latvian people man was stabbed in the head in Lower Broughton. However, a crackdown by Greater Manchester Police coupled with investment in, and structural changes to the housing stock, began the change in Salford's fortunes; population decline has slowed, and Salford's city councillors have insisted it is {{a safe place to}} visit. In August 2005, a survey by Channel 4 television rated the city as the 9th worst place to live in the United Kingdom, based on criteria of crime, education, environment, lifestyle and employment.|$|R
6000|$|There are {{few things}} more poignantly humiliating than being handled {{by a man}} who does not intend to strike. The head of the {{syndicate}} began to breathe heavily.
