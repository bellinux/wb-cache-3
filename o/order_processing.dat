25|$|Karl Pribram's holonomic brain theory (quantum holography) invoked quantum {{mechanics}} to explain higher <b>order</b> <b>processing</b> by the mind. He argued that his holonomic model solved the binding problem. Pribram collaborated with Bohm {{in his work}} on the quantum approaches to mind and he provided evidence on how much of the processing in the brain was done in wholes. He proposed that ordered water at dendritic membrane surfaces might operate by structuring Bose-Einstein condensation supporting quantum dynamics.|$|E
25|$|Neurons in both Field L and CM have {{sophisticated}} filter properties, selective {{for both}} the spectral-temporal modulations and phase relationships of conspecific songs. Furthermore, different neurons are selective for different features of syllables and songs. In Field L, neurons have one of four different tuning strategies—they are either tightly tuned a particular frequency, or they are sensitive to frequency edges, frequency sweeps or combined frequencies. When exposed to natural song as a stimulus, different ensembles of these of neurons respond to different components of sound, and together they demonstrate the ability to perform sensitive discrimination between conspecific and heterospecific syllable types. As in nucleus ovoidalis, the spectral-temporal filter properties of Field L and CM neurons are {{a function of the}} particular ion channels and receptor proteins driving their synaptic dynamics. The complex and sophisticated tuning of these higher <b>order</b> <b>processing</b> centers for conspecific sounds may rely on the integrated inputs from the entire ascending auditory pathway, from the hair cells through the thalamus and forebrain, but this challenging synthetic question remains to be investigated.|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of sensor networks in scientific and engineering applications leads to increased demand on the efficient computation of the collected sensor data. Recent research in sensor and stream data systems adopts the notion of sliding windows to process continuous queries over infinite sensor readings. <b>Ordered</b> <b>processing</b> of input data is essential during query execution for many application scenarios. In this paper we present three approaches for ordered execution of continuous sliding window queries over sensor data. The first approach enforces <b>ordered</b> <b>processing</b> at the input side of the query execution plan. In the second approach we utilize the advantage of out-of-order execution to optimize query operators and enforce an ordered release of the output results. The third approach is adaptive and switches {{between the first and}} second approaches to achieve the best overall performance with current input arrival rates and level of multiprogramming. We study the performance of the proposed approaches both analytically and experimentally and under a variety of conditions such as the asynchronous arrival of input data, and various levels of multiprogramming. Our performance study is based on an extensive set of experiments using a realization of the proposed approaches in a prototype stream query processing system. 1...|$|R
