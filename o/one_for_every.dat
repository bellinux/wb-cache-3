5|$|A {{number of}} culinary and medical {{advances}} {{have been developed}} in Oldham. There are claims that Oldham was {{the birthplace of the}} first chip shop. The sometimes disputed claim of trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes {{is said to have been}} started around 1858–60 from an outlet owned by a John Lees, on what is the present site of Oldham's Tommyfield Market. In 1900 Oldham had the highest concentration of chip shops in the country, <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> 400 people. Rag Pudding is a savoury dish said to be native to Oldham. Yates Wine Lodge was founded in Oldham by Peter and Simon Yates in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Hilary Minc, {{the third}} in command in Bolesław Bierut's {{political}} triumvirate of Stalinist leaders, became the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Industry, Industry and Commerce, and the Economic Affairs. He was personally assigned by Stalin first to Industry and than to Transportation ministries of Poland. His wife, Julia, became the Editor-in-Chief of the monopolized Polish Press Agency. Minister Jakub Berman – Stalin's right hand in Poland until 1953 – held the Political propaganda and Ideology portfolios. He {{was responsible for the}} largest and most notorious secret police {{in the history of the}} People's Republic of Poland, the Ministry of Public Security (UB), employing 33,200 permanent security officers, <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> 800 Polish citizens.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 Mark Wallinger, {{an artist}} {{associated}} with the YBA movement, was invited to produce an artwork to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground. He devised a scheme which in which panels with designs of labyrinths in vitreous enamel were installed on all 270 Underground stations. The works are numbered according to {{the order in which}} their stations were visited in a particular record-breaking journey of 2009, which took in every station on the network. In all there 32 works in the series in the City of Westminster, <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> station except Paddington, where there are two panels.|$|E

5|$|The reverse has at centre equestrian figures {{meant to}} be Wellington and Blücher, with Victory between them, guiding them to battle. They are in the Grecian style, similar to Pistrucci's earlier St George and the Dragon design for the {{sovereign}} coin. At {{the top of the}} reverse is Jupiter. Taking {{up the rest of the}} circumference of the medal are 19 figures of giants whom Jupiter has struck down; they are the defeated enemy and number <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> year of the war.|$|E
5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured and cheap anti-tank weapon, costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector. The Prime Minister approved of the weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced on a scale of <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> Home Guard platoon.|$|E

Business method patent applications, however, only get <b>one</b> allowance <b>for</b> <b>every</b> 20 rejections.|$|R

5|$|Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan are {{considered}} attractive destinations by those seeking employment as domestic workers. According to Quartz, Hong Kong {{has one of}} the highest densities of foreign domestic workers in the world and its pay scale is a benchmark for other jurisdictions. Since the mid-1970s, when the foreign-domestic-helper policy was initiated, the number of workers has increased to around 300,000. At the end of 2013, there was an average of one foreign domestic worker for every eight households overall; in households with children, the average is <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> three. Foreign domestic helpers are about 10 percent of the working population. In December 2014 the number of migrant workers employed as helpers was over 330,000, 4.6 percent of the total population; the vast majority were female.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the marauding Company, some 8,000 strong, in Thessaly caused concern to the region's Greek ruler, John II Doukas. Having just availed himself {{of the death of}} Guy II to throw off the tutelage of the Dukes of Athens, John turned to Byzantium and the other Greek principality, Epirus, for aid. Defeated by the Greeks, the Catalans agreed to pass peacefully through Thessaly to the south, towards the Frankish principalities of {{southern}} Greece. Walter of Brienne, who in his youth had fought against the Catalans in Italy, spoke Catalan and had gained the Catalans' respect, now hired the Company for six months against the Greeks, at a high price: four ounces of gold for every heavy cavalryman, two for every light cavalryman and <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> infantryman, with two months' payment in advance. Turning back, the Catalans captured the town of Domokos and some thirty other fortresses, and plundered the rich plain of Thessaly, forcing the Greek states {{to come to terms with}} Walter.|$|E

25|$|The {{imbalance}} in representation in that House is apparent when considering population size.
