After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals. As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants. About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe, and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans.|$|E

50|$|The Lee-Boot {{effect is}} a {{phenomenon}} concerning the suppression or prolongation of <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> of mature female mice (and other rodents), when females are housed in groups and isolated from males. It {{is caused by the}} effects of an oestrogen-dependent pheromone, released via the urine, that acts on the vomeronasal organ of recipients. This pheromone lowers the concentration of luteinizing hormone and elevates prolactin levels, synchronising or stopping the recipient’s cycle. This effect goes some way to explain why spontaneous pseudopregnancy can occur in mice. The same response is invoked from isolated females when brought into contact with urine-soaked bedding from other females’ cages. Removing the vomeronasal organ of recipients causes an ineffective response - indicating that the cues are not mediated by the vomeronasal system.|$|E

The following observations were obtained: the morning plasma corticosterone levels in control rats did not differ with the stage of the oestrous cycle; plasma corticosterone levels increased significantly following LPS administration (2 mg/kg, ip) or following acute exposure to cold (4 °C) -swimming or ether stress. However, this increase in plasma corticosterone levels was not related to the stage of the oestrous cycle; synthetic CRF injection induced an increase in plasma corticosterone levels constant on di-oestrus-I and pro-oestrus; plasma corticosterone response to LPS administration or acute cold-swimming stress showed diurnal changes, with the lowest values at 18. 00 h. which was independent of the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle.</b> By showing the unchanged corticosterone response to LPS, to acute stress and to exogenous CRF throughout the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle,</b> and the independence of the diurnal pattern of stress response on the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle,</b> the present study suggests that the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> has no influence on the HPA activity under the present experimental conditions in rats...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess whether}} the mediobasal {{hypothalamus}} (MBH) {{is necessary for}} photoperiodic control of <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> and prolactin secretion, we tested intact female Syrian hamsters (controls) and those that had sustained unilateral or bilateral lesions of the MBH. All hamsters displayed 4 -day <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> postoperatively in the long-day photoperiod (14 h light/day); control females and those with unilateral MBH damage ceased to undergo <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> approximately 8 weeks after transfer to a short-day photocycle (10 h light/day), whereas 12 of 15 females with bilateral MBH lesions continued to generate 4 -day <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> throughout 22 weeks in short days. Serum prolactin concentrations were either undetectable or low in all hamsters 8 or 14 weeks after the transfer to short-day lengths, but increased above long-day baseline values by week 22. We conclude that melatonin-binding sites in the MBH mediate suppression of <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> but not prolactin secretion by short-day lengths; recovery of prolactin secretion in females during prolonged exposure to short-day lengths reflects development of refractoriness to melatonin in a substrate distinct from the MBH.

40|$|AIM: During each <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle,</b> the {{mammary gland}} {{is subject to}} changes in ovarian hormone levels.

To understand the processes resulting in these changes, particularly the regulation of cell death, we examined protein levels in mammary epithelium during the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> of the Sprague-Dawley rat. METHODS: Studies of serum hormone levels, vaginal smears, uterine weight and morphology, mammary gland morphology, proliferation and apoptotic indices, and protein levels during the stages of the Sprague-Dawley rat <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> were {{used to examine the}} response of mammary epithelium to the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle.</b> RESULTS: Proliferation of mammary epithelium was greater in diestrus and proestrus, while apoptosis was increased in metestrus and diestrus. Growth factor-, hormone- and anchorage-mediated cell survival signalling, indicated by activation of Stat 5 A, FAK and Akt 1 and expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 family members, was greater in proestrus and reduced in metestrus. In contrast, the levels of pro-apoptotic Bcl- 2 family members and proteins associated with apoptosis in mammary epithelium (TGFbeta 3, pStat 3) were increased during metestrus and diestrus. CONCLUSION: Decreases in growth factor, hormone and cell attachment survival signals corresponded with increased apoptosis {{during the second half of}} the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle.</b> The protein levels detected during oestrus suggest parallels to apoptosis in mammary involution...|$|R

40|$|Ovarian {{follicle}} development {{continues in}} a wave-like manner during the bovine oestrous cycle giving rise to variation in the duration of ovulatory follicle development. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to determine whether a relationship exists between the duration of ovulatory follicle development and pregnancy rates following artificial insemination (AI) in dairy cows undergoing spontaneous <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles,</b> and to identify factors influencing follicle turnover and pregnancy rate and the relationship between these two variables. Follicle development was monitored by daily transrectal ultrasonography from 10 days after oestrus until the subsequent oestrus in 158 lactating dairy cows. The cows were artificially inseminated following the second observed oestrus and pregnancy was diagnosed 35 days later. The predominant pattern of follicle development was two follicle waves (74. 7 %) with three follicle waves in 22. 1 % of <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> and four or more follicle waves in 3. 2 % of <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles.</b> The interval from ovulatory follicle emergence to oestrus (EOI) was 3 days longer (P < 0. 0001) in cows with two follicle waves than in those with three waves. Ovulatory follicles from two-wave <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> grew more slowly but were approximately 2 mm larger (P < 0. 0001) on the day of oestrus. Twin ovulations were observed in 14. 2 % of <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> and occurred more frequently (P < 0. 001) in three-wave oestrous cycles; consequently EOI was shorter in cows with twin ovulations. Overall, 57. 0 % of the cows were diagnosed pregnant 35 days after AI. Linear logistic regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between EOI and the proportion of cows diagnosed pregnant, among all cows (n = 158; P < 0. 01) and amongst those with single ovulations (n = 145; P < 0. 05). Mean EOI was approximately I day shorter (P < 0. 01) in cows that became pregnant than in non-pregnant cows; however, pregnancy rates did not differ significantly among cows with different patterns of follicle development. These findings confirm and extend previous observations in pharmacologically manipulated cattle and show, for the first time, that in dairy cows undergoing spontaneous <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles,</b> natural variation in the duration of post-emergence ovulatory follicle development has a significant effect on pregnancy rate, presumably reflecting variation in oocyte developmental competence...|$|E

Cows were ovariectomised following the third synchronised oestrus and then retreated to induce oestrus (Round 4). Oestrus was monitored by continuous visual observation and radiotelemetry between 24 and at least 60 h after removal of inserts at Rounds 1 – 4. Significant differences (P< 0. 001) were obtained between the mean number of mounts (42. 7 versus 17. 8), duration of oestrus (14. 4 h versus 10. 9 h), total duration of mounts (223. 9 s versus 33. 1 s), mean duration per mount (5. 6 s versus 1. 9 s), the number of mounts per hour (3. 5 versus 2. 0) and the interval to oestrus (41. 2 h versus 42. 8 h) between values determined by visual observation compared with radiotelemetry, respectively.

The 25 kDa osteopontin was the most prevalent isoform in oviductal fluid except in isthmic fluid during the non-luteal phase of the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle.</b> RT–PCR was performed with RNA from oviductal cells collected from cows in the post-ovulatory, early to mid-luteal, late luteal or pre-ovulatory stages of the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> to reveal the oviduct as a site of osteopontin and integrin synthesis. Only one osteopontin mRNA transcript was detected, and amounts did not vary throughout the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle.</b> In contrast, the relative expression of the integrin subtypes v and 1 during the late luteal phase was lower compared with the other <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> phases. Integrin 3 mRNA content increased significantly from the lowest level during the late luteal phase to the highest level before ovulation. In conclusion, differential presence of osteopontin isoforms and integrins in the bovine oviduct throughout the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> indicate that osteopontin–integrin interactions have functional roles in normal oviduct physiology which may potentially influence interactions between the gametes, the embryo, and the epithelium...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that the dominant follicle {{in the growing}} phase limits (directly or indirectly) {{the growth of the}} other follicles in the same wave (Guilbault et al., 1993). It has been shown that the injection of a GnRH agonist induces the emer-gence of a new follicular wave within 3 to 4 days after treatment and eliminates the large follicles by ovulation or luteinization (Thatcher et al., 1989; Twagiramungu et al., 1994; Pursley et al., 1995). In addition, the puncture of medium and large follicles in heifers at random stages of the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> results in an FSH surge the next day and synchro-nous emergence of a new follicular wave 2 days after ablation (Bergfelt et al., 1994; Kohram et al., 1998; Cavalieri et al., 2001). The initiation of a follicular wave using these treatments allows the start of su-perstimulation at a random stage of the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> (Kohram et al., 1998; Andrade et al., 2002). GnRH treatment and follicle ablation at any stage of the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> offer the advantage of initiat-Superovulation following follicular synchronization with GnRH at random stages of the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> in heifers: oocyte competence and in vitro embryo productio...|$|R
