5|$|As {{the size}} of train increased, so did the locomotives. The 4-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} became popular for passenger and mixed traffic work with the D3 and A2 classes, and the 2-8-0 arrangement on goods with the K, J and C classes lasting into the 1960s. These were then followed by the 4-6-2 S class Pacifics for the Spirit <b>of</b> <b>Progress</b> express, and the single 4-8-4 H class locomotive H220, the biggest Victorian Railways steam locomotive. The final steam locomotives built for the Victorian Railways were the 4-6-4 R class and 2-8-0 J classes. Although they were of more modern design, their advantages were overshadowed by the simultaneous arrival of the first diesels.|$|E

By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit <b>of</b> <b>Progress</b> was made, a streamlined all air conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by the matching S class steam locomotives.|$|E
