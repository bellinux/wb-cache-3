Rams, especially unfamiliar <b>ones,</b> <b>will</b> also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely. During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{occurred}} at York Park when, {{in a game}} between St Kilda and Fremantle, the final siren was too quiet to be heard {{by any of the}} umpires; play was restarted in error, and in the subsequent confusion St Kilda levelled the scores. After a protest, the AFL Commission convened and overturned the result, awarding Fremantle the victory. The stadium's sirens have since been replaced, and the old <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> be put on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants {{will try to}} appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.|$|E

25|$|The 13Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule {{of thumb}} rather than {{something}} of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> burn only a little, and the 13Jupiter mass value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt also depends to some extent on the composition of the object, specifically on the amount of helium and deuterium present and on the fraction of heavier elements, which determines the atmospheric opacity and thus the radiative cooling rate.|$|E
25|$|The table below {{highlights}} some of {{the challenges}} with decision making and prognostication in thyroid cancer. While there is general agreement that stage I or II papillary, follicular or medullary cancer have a good prognosis, {{it is not possible}} when evaluating a small thyroid cancer to determine which <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> grow and metastasize and which will not. As a result, once a diagnosis of thyroid cancer has been established (most commonly by a fine needle aspiration), it is likely that a total thyroidectomy will be performed.|$|E

25|$|The {{extent to}} which a {{language}} is valued also has an effect on language acquisition in bilingual children. Languages that are deemed more useful or more important will dominate the bilingual mental lexicon while the less valued <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> not be acquired as fully. Studies have shown that children showed slower receptive vocabulary development in what they termed the 'minority' language while the children showed monolingual-like development in the 'majority' language. This has been attributed to the lack of opportunities bilinguals had available for the acquisition and development of their 'minority' language.|$|E
25|$|In {{contemporary}} British and American publishing markets, most authors receive {{only a small}} monetary advance before {{publication of}} their debut novel; in the rare exceptions when a large print run and high volume of sales are anticipated, the advance can be larger. However, once an author has established themselves in print, some authors can make steady income {{as long as they}} remain productive as writers. Additionally, many novelists, even published <b>ones,</b> <b>will</b> take on outside work, such as teaching creative writing in academic institutions, or leave novel writing as a secondary hobby.|$|E
25|$|Uncompressed digital {{component}} signals are transmitted. Data is encoded in NRZI format, and a linear feedback shift register {{is used to}} scramble the data to reduce the likelihood that long strings of zeroes or <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> be present on the interface. The interface is self-synchronizing and self-clocking. Framing is done by detection of a special synchronization pattern, which appears on the (unscrambled) serial digital signal to be a sequence of ten ones followed by twenty zeroes (twenty ones followed by forty zeroes in HD); this bit pattern is not legal anywhere else within the data payload.|$|E

50|$|Limbe Provincial Hospital is {{referred}} to by locals as Mile 1 Hospital since it is exactly one mile away from the Atlantic Ocean.

Continuing straight ahead, <b>one</b> <b>will</b> reach an area called Down Beach, which is right by the ocean. Moving away from the ocean from the hospital, one passes other parts of Limbe (Mile 2, Mile 3, Mile 4, etc.) and eventually leaves the town. A few miles later, one reaches the town of Mutengene.

25|$|All Muni lines {{except for}} cable cars are {{wheelchair}} accessible. All bus lines have bicycle racks, but streetcars and cable cars do not. Because of San Francisco's geographical makeup (the city having neighborhoods located on hilltop-like areas, {{making it difficult}} for vehicles to drive up or down the streets), Muni operators are banned from using low-floor buses on certain routes with streets requiring buses or trolleybuses that are capable of reaching steep grades. But, as of 2013, high-floor vehicles are no longer available to be purchased by Muni; come 2019, all low-floor <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> be in service.|$|E
25|$|Three {{years after}} {{beginning}} the course, {{and two weeks}} before its completion, a special committee meets to examine all the cadets and determines which <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> be completing the course. While rare, it is not unknown for some cadets to be dropped from the course even at this late stage. After the special committee completes its deliberations, the cadets who will be graduating begin preparing for the ceremony. Since two flight courses graduate every year, there are therefore two ceremonies. One of the graduates' final tasks is to act as the induction cadre for the next class of cadets arriving to begin their gibush, introducing them to military service via a series of punishing physical and mental challenges.|$|E
25|$|As an {{initiation}} new recruits, especially forced <b>ones,</b> <b>will</b> {{be encouraged}} or forced {{to participate in}} atrocities, such as torture, rape and murder, unwilling recruits {{will be forced to}} do this against their own communities and families or be killed themselves. The goal of these atrocities is to divorce the new recruit from his or her previous life and bind them to the insurgency; criminals in their own eyes and in the eyes of society, such recruits will be led to believe that they cannot go back to their previous lives and have no other family other than the insurgency. In order to break the hold the insurgency may hold over such members, the authorities may offer amnesties and pardons for crimes committed.|$|E

25|$|Nest refoundation by colonies that {{lose the}} {{original}} one is pretty common, and allows this species of wasps {{to thrive in}} highly disturbed landscapes, that face frequent fires or other disturbances. When the nest is destroyed or goes lost, the swarm just moves to a near point (a branch or else) and begins another nest. Sometimes, when {{there are lots of}} wasps, the swarm may break up and create several new little nests. Only the one with the foundress in it will produce female offspring and complete the cycle, while the other <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> end up producing worker males. If one of those secondary nests is lost, its workers will rather rejoin a near group of other sisters instead of trying to found it again.|$|E

After the resulting confrontation with Minna, Wagner left ZÃ¼rich alone, bound for Venice, where he rented {{an apartment in the}} Palazzo Giustinian, while Minna returned to Germany. Wagner's attitude to Minna had changed; the editor of his correspondence with her, John Burk, has said that she was to him [...] "an invalid, to be treated with kindness and consideration, but, except at a distance, [...] a menace to his peace of mind." [...] Wagner continued his correspondence with Mathilde and his friendship with her husband Otto, who maintained his financial support of the composer. In an 1859 letter to Mathilde, Wagner wrote, half-satirically, of Tristan: [...] "Child! This Tristan is turning into something terrible. This final act!!!â€”I fear the opera will be banned... only mediocre performances can save me! Perfectly good <b>ones</b> <b>will</b> be bound to drive people mad." ...|$|E
