5|$|Despite Beaumont's {{importance}} {{during the}} early boom period, the nearby and already-established commercial center <b>of</b> <b>Houston</b> became the leading city of the period. Houston's status was boosted by the 1914 completion of the Houston Ship Channel, allowing the Port <b>of</b> <b>Houston</b> to service large ships. Refineries and related operations were built along the Houston Ship Channel between Houston and Goose Creek. Heavy industry grew {{in the area and}} gradually created one of the world's largest industrial complexes. By the 1930s, Houston emerged as the state's largest city and the hub of the rail and road network. The effects of the petroleum-related growth helped offset the effects of the Great Depression substantially, particularly after the discovery of the East Texas field. Texans who became wealthy from the boom established upscale communities including River Oaks, which became a model for community planning in the U.S. Oil-related growth {{led to the creation of}} many new institutions, including the University <b>of</b> <b>Houston,</b> the Museum of Fine Arts, Hermann Park, the Houston Zoo, and the Houston Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
