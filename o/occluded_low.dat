50|$|For a brief time, the {{portions}} of the cyclone at the 300 and 200 mbar pressure levels moved southeastward over Lake Huron. The greatest intensification occurred below the 500 mbar level. As the cyclone's tilt was neutral, or stacked with height, the storm was in the occlusion (or warm seclusion) stage of cyclone development. As the cyclone proceeded through this stage, the cold front, which {{was connected to the}} surface low, became an occluded front as it caught up with the surface warm front. The occluded front extended from Lake Huron to Pennsylvania on September 13. A 155-mile (250 km) swath of showers and thunderstorms was positioned across the frontal zone.

30|$|Most possibly, the {{presence}} of low molecular n-alkanes in the asphaltenes is caused by their being trapped by porous structure of asphaltenes, while {{the presence}} of high molecular weight homologs in asphaltenes is a result from coprecipitating when the standard procedure of deasphalting by low molecular weight n-alkanes is used. The decrease in the share of low molecular weight n-alkanes in asphaltenes {{with the increase of}} the age of oil reservoir may result from: (1) decrease in the share of low molecular weight n-alkanes in greater depth crude oils and/or (2) compression of asphaltene aggregates: when the occurrence depth of oil reservoirs increases, the asphaltene aggregates in oil become denser and their ability to <b>occlude</b> <b>low</b> molecular weight oil hydrocarbons reduces. The increase in the share of high molecular weight n-alkanes in asphaltene with increasing age of oil reservoir is explained by the increase in their share in the oils, from which asphaltenes are precipitated (Ganeeva et al. 2010).|$|R
30|$|The {{research}} found that asphaltenes contain paraffin hydrocarbons {{with a wide}} MMD from 12 to 60. On {{the example of the}} oils of different ages from the Samara region, Russia, it is shown that the composition of paraffin hydrocarbons in asphaltenes depends on the age of the oil reservoir from which oil is produced. The higher the age of oil reservoir, the smaller the share of low molecular weight n-alkanes in asphaltenes. That {{may be due to the}} decrease in the share of low molecular weight n-alkanes in oil and the fact that with increasing depth of occurrence of the oil reservoir, the asphaltenes become denser and their ability to <b>occlude</b> <b>low</b> molecular weight hydrocarbons reduces.

40|$|The weather over {{central and}} eastern United States during November 1950 was notable in several respects. The most {{outstanding}} was the rapid intensification of a small Low {{into one of the}} most destmctive storms ever recorded in northeast United States. This report describes the life history, contributions to deepening, and effects of this storm. LIFE HISTORY OF THE STORM The storm of November 25 - 27 was first noted on the surface weather map of 1230 GMT, November 24 as a small Low- developing over North Carolina and western Virginia (fig. 1). The cold front on which the Low formed had moved rapidly southward and eastward from a position on November 22 through Montana and North Dakota. The old <b>occluded</b> <b>Low</b> in the Great Lakes region, which had been one of the major factors in the weather situation, was filling rapidly. By 0030 GMT, November 25 (fig. 2), it was obvious that the deepening Low over North Carolina had completely captured a place of prominence over the Low in the Lakes region. Some factors contributing to that change can be seen in the 500 -mb. charts. Figure 3, the 500 -mb. chart for 0300 GMT, November 24, shows the well-developed upper level Low associated with the filling surface storm over the Lakes region. Prior to that time the 500 -mb. contours and isotherms had been nearly concentric indicating a cold-core Low with but little temperature advection. The past positions in figure 3 show that the movement of the Low had been quite regular. By 0300 GMT, November 24 (fig. 3), however, the isotherms showed the coldest air over Iowa southwest of the center. The 500 -mb. chart for 0300 GMT, November 25 (fig. 4) shows that the cold air was swept rapidly around the Low and was associated with a sudden southward elongation of the center.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} scientific publications addressing dynamical aspects of the formation and intensification of polar lows. Polar lows are small scale, intense, short-lived cyclones developing over ice-free oceans at high latitudes. In the first paper, environmental atmospheric conditions during polar low genesis are identified. These environmental conditions are classified based on the direction between the thermal wind and the mean flow in the lower troposphere. If the thermal wind and mean flow are in opposite direction the environment is classified as reverse shear, if they are in the same direction the environment is classified as forward shear. The two types of pre-polar low environments exhibit distinctly different features in terms of synoptic scale patterns, baroclinicity, configurations of sea surface temperature, depth and stratification of the troposphere, polar low propagation directions, and surface fluxes. The ambient polar low environment during forward shear conditions resembles typical mid-latitude baroclinic cyclogenesis, whereas the reverse shear conditions are characterized by the presence of a synoptic scale, <b>occluded</b> <b>low</b> over the genesis location, and a strong low-level jet. In the second paper, a method to initialize baroclinic channel models is devised. The initial conditions are hydrostatically and geostrophically balanced, which makes them particularly suitable for studying rapid cyclogenesis. Furthermore, the method allows the definition of an arbitrary windfield, hence the initialization method exhibits a large degree of freedom in defining the initial conditions. We performed an unperturbed simulation which features minimal gravity wave activity, illustrating the balanced initial conditions. We also performed a perturbed simulation to examplify the utility of the setup. In this simulation baroclinic instability is triggered resulting in perturbation growth with time- and length-scales in agreement with observed polar low development. In the third paper, an idealized baroclinic channel model is utilized to investigate the role of latent heating during polar low development in forward shear conditions. Within this idealized setup, a low-level, weak, cyclonic perturbation is able to amplify in absence of upper-level forcing, radiation, or surface fluxes. Crucial for rapid development is sufficient latent heat release in the north-eastern quadrant of the cyclone. The potential for latent heat release to occur depends on the environmental relative humidity, baroclinicity and static stability. Due to the Arctic configuration of the setup, the perturbation depth is relative shallow, which in turn improves the effectiveness of latent heat release on cyclone amplification. </p...|$|E
40|$|Computation This paper {{describes}} a novel learning-based approach {{for improving the}} performance of stereo computation. It {{is based on the}} observation that whether the image matching scores lead to true or erroneous depth values is dependent on the original stereo images and the underlying scene structure. This function is learned from training data and is integrated into a depth estimation algorithm using the MAP-MRF framework. Because the resultant likelihood function is dependent on the states of a large neighboring region around each pixel, we propose to solve the high-order MRF inference problem using the simulated annealing algorithm combined with a Metropolis-Hastings sampler. A segmentation-based approach is proposed to accelerate the computational speed and improve the performance. Preliminary experimental results show that the learning process captures common errors in SSD matching including the fattening effect, the aperture effect, and mismatches in <b>occluded</b> or <b>low</b> texture regions. It is also demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of the depth computation. ...|$|R

These habituation displays {{are referred to as}} LN (low spatial frequency grating and narrow <b>occluder),</b> LB (<b>low</b> and broad), HN (high and narrow), and HB (high and broad) displays. Posthabituation-test displays consisted of a complete grating (CG) of the same frequency as the habituated grating along with a separate grating (SG) whose central portion was replaced with a black gap of the same height as the occluder in the habituation displays. Infants habituated to the LN display looked significantly longer at the SG than the CG display during posthabituation-test trials. Infants habituated to the LB and HN displays looked at the CG and SG displays, almost equally. In contrast, infants habituated to the HB display looked longer at the CG than the SG display. These results show that infants under 1 month of age can perceive the continuation of the grating behind the occluder, and that their visual completion on habituation displays can be evoked according to the interaction between the spatial frequency of the grating and the occluder height...|$|R
40|$|Stereo vision {{systems are}} often {{employed}} in robotics {{as a means}} for obstacle avoidance and navigation. These systems have inherent depth-sensing limitations, with significant problems in occluded and untextured regions, leading to sparse depth maps. We propose using a monocular depth estimation algorithm to tackle these problems, in a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework. The algorithm learns online from the sparse depth map generated by a stereo vision system, producing a dense depth map. The algorithm is designed to be computationally efficient, for implementation onboard resource-constrained mobile robots and unmanned aerial vehicles. Within that context, {{it can be used to}} provide both reliability against a stereo camera failure, as well as more accurate depth perception, by filling in missing depth information, in <b>occluded</b> and <b>low</b> texture regions. This in turn allows the use of more efficient sparse stereo vision algorithms. We test the algorithm offline on a new, high resolution, stereo dataset, of scenes shot in indoor environments, and processed using both sparse and dense stereo matching algorithms. It is shown that the algorithm’s performance doesn’t deteriorate, and in fact sometimes improves, when learning only from sparse, high confidence regions rather than from the computationally expensive, dense, occlusion-filled and highly post-processed dense depth maps. This makes the approach very promising for self- supervised learning on autonomous robots. Aerospace EngineeringControl and OperationsControl & Simulatio...|$|R

40|$|Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) {{control the}} output of the {{striatum}} by mediating feed-forward GABAergic inhibition of projection neurons. Their neuromodulation can therefore critically affect the operation of the basal ganglia. We studied the effects of 5 - hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT, serotonin), a neurotransmitter released in the striatum by fibres originating in the raphe nuclei, on FSIs recorded with whole-cell techniques in rat brain slices. Bath application of serotonin (30 lm) elicited slow, reversible depolarizations (9 ± 3 mV) in 37 ⁄ 46 FSIs. Similar effects were observed using conventional whole-cell and gramicidin perforated-patch techniques. The serotonin effects persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin and were mediated by 5 -HT 2 C receptors, as they were reversed by the 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist ketanserin and by the selective 5 -HT 2 C receptor antagonist RS 102221. Serotonin-induced depolarizations were not accompanied by a significant change in FSI input resistance. Serotonin caused the appearance of spontaneous firing in a minority (5 ⁄ 35) of responsive FSIs, whereas it strongly increased FSI excitability in each of the remaining responsive FSIs, significantly decreasing the latency of the first spike evoked by a current step and increasing spike frequency. Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that serotonin suppressed a current that reversed around) 100 mV and displayed a marked inward rectification, a finding that explains the lack of effects of serotonin on input resistance. Consistently, the effects of serotonin were completely <b>occluded</b> by <b>low</b> concentrations of extracellular barium, which selectively blocks Kir 2 channels. We concluded that the excitatory effects of serotonin on FSIs were mediated by 5 -HT 2 C receptors and involved suppression of an inwardly rectifying K + current. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{real-time}} Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) {{system is}} a significant component of security applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). A highly accurate and real-time VMMR system significantly reduces the overhead cost of resources otherwise required. In this thesis, we present a VMMR system that provides very high classification rates and is robust to challenges like low illumination, occlusions, partial and non-frontal views. These challenges are encountered in realistic environments and high security areas like parking lots and public spaces (e. g., malls, stadiums, and airports). The VMMR problem is a multi-class classification problem with a peculiar set of issues and challenges like multiplicity, inter- and intra-make ambiguity among various vehicles makes and models, which need to be solved in an efficient and reliable manner to achieve a highly robust VMMR system. To reliably overcome the ambiguity challenges, a global features representation approach based on the Bag-of-Features paradigm is proposed. We extract key features from different make-model classes in an optimized dictionary, through two different dictionary building strategies. We represent different samples from each class {{with respect to the}} learned dictionary. We also present two classification schemes based on multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) : (1) Single multi-class SVM and (2) Attribute Bagging-based Ensemble of multi-class SVMs. These classification schemes allow simultaneous learning of the differences between global representations of different classes and the similarities between different shapes or generations within a same make-model class, to further overcome the multiplicity challenges for real-time application. Extensive experiments conducted using our approaches yield superior results for images that were <b>occluded,</b> under <b>low</b> illumination, partial camera views, or even non-frontal views, available in a recently published real-world VMMR dataset.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the five sites of Early Miocene aged cold seep {{carbonate}} deposits (Wanstead, Wilder Road, Haunui, Ugly Hill, and Ngawaka) in the southern East Coast Basin, North Island, New Zealand, which archive paleo-hydrocarbon seafloor seepage in a convergent margin setting. Seep deposits are hosted within calcareous slope mudstones of the Ihungia Fm and provide an important analogue to modern seep sites in the East Coast Basin. Individual fossilised seep sites have revealed, through mapping and logging, differences in outcrop extent, morphology, and lithology, while petrology has uncovered a complex array of textures, fabrics, and mineralogies within the methane derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC). Fabrics are diverse and often comprise chaotic multi-phase assemblages of various mineralogies in original and/or altered states. Enclosed within the carbonates are the fossilised remnants of chemosynthesis-based communities, particularly macro-invertebrates, which includes lucinid and vesicomyid clams, modiolid mussels, corals, gastropods, and worm tubes. These fossil types, and their distribution throughout the deposit, not only reflect the variations in fluid conditions but also the maturity of the seep system. Veining and (micro) brecciation are common {{at a variety of}} scales with multiple generations of cements forming thick fill sequences representing cyclic episodes of fracturing and sealing through carbonate formation. Detailed analysis of MDAC deposits has led to the identification of thirteen mineral fabrics, four fracturing and/or corrosion phases, and two alteration phases. Relationships between the various fabrics and phases has led to the elucidation of a generalised paragenetic sequence while appreciating that some local variation occurs. The paragenetic sequence is divided into two diagenetic stages: an early stage that includes all mineralisation and events that occurred in the (near) seafloor environment, and a late stage that includes all mineralisation and events that occurred in the burial realm. Early diagenesis (8 events) involved precipitation of mainly aragonite phases, including clotted and peloidal microcrystalline carbonate (micarb), fibrous and radiating crystal forms (often hydrocarbon inclusion-bearing) occasionally encase thrombolites between successive isopachous generations, and anhedral crystal masses and layers. Early destructive episodes of fracturing, (auto) brecciation, and dissolution via corrosive fluids significantly modified the deposits, ultimately increasing surface area available for further mineral growth. Late diagenesis (9 events) occurred within the burial realm and resulted in the addition of late stage pore and fracture <b>occluding</b> <b>low</b> magnesium calcite (LMC) and some minor dolomite and silica forms. Some of the early metastable aragonite forms remained pristine and unaltered, while others underwent varying degrees of fabric retentive to destructive neomorphic change generally resulting in stable LMC mineralogies. Later uplift and exhumation brought the carbonate deposits into their present-day positions. Distinctly depleted stable δ 13 C isotope signatures indicate carbonate carbon was largely sourced from thermogenic methane, with some of the migrating fluids likely affected by methane pool oxidation, and mixing with marine water and residual CO 2. Stable δ 18 O isotope signatures suggest that the ascending hydrocarbon-rich fluids experienced slight temperature fluctuations, possibly due to contact with warmer advecting fluids, and were also influenced by local gas hydrate formation and dissociation events. Preliminary lipid results importantly confirm the presence of microbes which carry out the anaerobic oxidation of methane (e. g. PMI and biphytanic diacid) and sulphate reduction (e. g. iso-and anteiso fatty acids). The complexity revealed within these cold seep carbonates, and more particularly their cement stratigraphy, reflects the temporally and spatially dynamic nature of the fluids reaching the paleo sea floor of the East Coast Basin. Many of the features observed within these southern East Coast Basin cold seep deposits have a striking similarity with the Miocene deposits of the Italian Apennines, while others, particularly the occurrence of microbial mats (thrombolites), are an interesting feature more atypical of worldwide occurrences...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} on human pose {{estimation}} using Convolutional Neural Networks. Our main contribution is a CNN cascaded architecture {{specifically designed for}} learning part relationships and spatial context, and robustly inferring pose even for the case of severe part occlusions.

The benefits of the proposed architecture are multi-fold: It guides the network where to focus in the image and effectively encodes part constraints and context. More importantly, it can effectively cope with occlusions because part detection heatmaps for <b>occluded</b> parts provide <b>low</b> confidence scores which subsequently guide the regression part of our network to rely on contextual information in order to predict the location of these parts. Additionally, we show that the proposed cascade is flexible enough to readily allow the integration of various CNN architectures for both detection and regression, including recent ones based on residual learning.

40|$|Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) {{has evolved}} into a {{significant}} subject of study due to its importance in numerous Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), such as autonomous navigation, traffic analysis, traffic surveillance and security systems. A highly accurate and real-time VMMR system significantly reduces the overhead cost of resources otherwise required. The VMMR problem is a multi-class classification task with a peculiar set of issues and challenges like multiplicity, inter- and intra-make ambiguity among various vehicles makes and models, which need to be solved in an efficient and reliable manner to achieve a highly robust VMMR system. In this dissertation, facing the growing importance of make and model recognition of vehicles, we present a VMMR system that provides very high accuracy rates and is robust to several challenges. We demonstrate that the VMMR problem can be addressed by locating discriminative parts where the most significant appearance variations occur in each category, and learning expressive appearance descriptors. Given these insights, we consider two data driven frameworks: a Multiple-Instance Learning-based (MIL) system using hand-crafted features and an extended application of deep neural networks using MIL. Our approach requires only image level class labels, and the discriminative parts of each target class are selected in a fully unsupervised manner without any use of part annotations or segmentation masks, which may be costly to obtain. This advantage makes our system more intelligent, scalable, and applicable to other fine-grained recognition tasks. We constructed a dataset with 291, 752 images representing 9, 170 different vehicles to validate and evaluate our approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the localization of parts and distinguishing their discriminative powers for categorization improve the performance of fine-grained categorization. Extensive experiments conducted using our approaches yield superior results for images that were <b>occluded,</b> under <b>low</b> illumination, partial camera views, or even non-frontal views, available in our real-world VMMR dataset. The approaches presented herewith provide a highly accurate VMMR system for rea-ltime applications in realistic environments.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, human {{movement}} has been captured primarily by motion capture systems. These systems are costly, require fixed cameras in a controlled environment, and suffer from occlusion. Recently, the availability of low-cost wearable inertial sensors containing accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers have provided an alternative means to overcome the limitations of motion capture systems. Wearable inertial sensors can be used anywhere, cannot be <b>occluded,</b> and are <b>low</b> cost. Several groups have described algorithms for tracking human joint angles. We previously described a novel approach based on a kinematic arm model and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Our proposed method used a minimal sensor configuration with one sensor on each segment. This paper reports significant improvements in both the algorithm and the assessment. The new model incorporates gyroscope and accelerometer random drift models, imposes physical constraints on the range of motion for each joint, and uses zero-velocity updates {{to mitigate the effect}} of sensor drift. A highprecision industrial robot arm precisely quantifies the performance of the tracker during slow, normal, and fast movements over continuous 15 -min recording durations. The agreement between the estimated angles from our algorithm and the high-precision robot arm reference was excellent. On average, the tracker attained an RMS angle error of about 3 ° for all six angles. The UKF performed slightly better than the more common Extended Kalman Filter...|$|R
30|$|The {{segmentation}} method {{presented in}} this paper is an extension of our previous work [7, 8] based on active contour. In this paper, we propose to estimate the movement of the tomato between two consecutive images, by comparing SIFT descriptors computed at points of the contour. This leads to a more accurate estimate of the position of the tomato than with the pattern matching approach presented in [7, 8]. The improvement is more prominent in the images with significant occlusion (between 30 and 50 %) and poor contrast. For instance, the descriptor-based approach correctly detects the position in 96.5 % of the images where occlusion is between 30 and 50 %, which is an improvement of + 5 % compared to the previous approach. Moreover, a high accuracy is reached for 85 % of these images against 59 % with the previous approach. The precision is also significantly improved for <b>low</b> <b>occluded</b> images (97 % against 65 %). This is very important since a more accurate estimation of the tomato position results in a more reliable estimation of the candidate contour points, which in turn leads to a better initialization of the elliptic active contour model. So, the entire segmentation procedure benefits from this new algorithm. The average error (expressed as the percentage of tomato size) is now around 4 % even for tomatoes with a degree of occlusion as high as 50 %.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to gain insight in the oral health of persons aged 65 years or more. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were {{obtained}} from 652 vulnerable older persons (≥ 65) by means of a clinical oral examination. Additional demographic data were gathered including age, gender, residence, and care dependency. RESULTS: The mean age of the total study sample was 83 (7. 7) years and 71 % was female. Nearly 33 % of the sample was living at home with support, and 67 % was residing in nursing homes. The number of <b>occluding</b> pairs was <b>low</b> and the proportion of edentulous people was highest among persons with the highest care dependency. The mean Decay-missing-filled teeth index (DMFT) was 20. 3 (9. 0). A prosthetic treatment need and inadequate oral hygiene levels were observed in 40 % and more than 60 % of the subjects, respectively. The highest treatment need was observed in the oldest age group and the highest mean dental plaque in older persons with the highest care dependency. CONCLUSIONS: The oral health in frail older people in Belgium is poor. The restorative and prosthetic treatment need is high and oral hygiene levels are problematic. Age, residence, and care dependency seemed to have some influence on oral health parameters. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In the long term, the most important future challenge of oral health care policies is to identify older adults before they begin to manifest such oral health deterioration. Regular dental visits should be strongly promoted by all (oral) health care workers during the lifespan of all persons including older adults. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a facial feature point tracker {{that can be}} used in {{applications}} such as human-computer interfaces, facial expression analysis systems, driver fatigue detection systems, etc. is proposed. The proposed tracker is based on a graphical model framework. The position of the facial features are tracked through video streams by incorporating statistical relations in time and the spatial relations between feature points. In many application areas, including those mentioned above, tracking is a key intermediate step that has a significant effect on the overall system performance. For this reason, a good practical tracking algorithm should take into account real-world phenomena such as arbitrary head movements and occlusions. Many existing algorithms track each feature point independently, and do not properly handle occlusions. This causes drifts in the case of arbitrary head movements and occlusions. By exploiting the spatial relationships between feature points, the proposed method provides robustness in a number of scenarios, including e. g. various head movements. To prevent drifts because of occlusions, a Gabor feature based occlusion detector is developed and used in the proposed method. The performance of the proposed tracker has been evaluated on real video data under various conditions. These conditions include <b>occluded</b> facial gestures, <b>low</b> video resolution, illumination changes in the scene, in-plane head motion, and out-of-plane head motion. The proposed method has also been tested on videos recorded in a vehicle environment, in order to evaluate its performance in a practical setting. Given these results it can be concluded that the proposed method provides a general promising framework for facial feature tracking. It is a robust tracker for facial expression sequences in which there are occlusions and arbitrary head movements. The results in the vehicle environment suggest that the proposed method has the potential to be useful for tasks such as driver behavior analysis or driver fatigue detection...|$|R
40|$|This {{study of}} an {{abandoned}} cutover bog aims to understand the processes controlling moisture conditions {{that have led to}} distinct spatial patterns of Sphagnum recolonization, and also how substrate conditions may have changed since abandonment and the implications for plant establishment. Two (unreplicated) symmetrical 12 ð 3 Ð 5 m 2 quadrats either side of the centre-line of a block-cut trench were treated by removing all recolonized vegetation, including Sphagnum, from one quadrat (REMOV), examining Sphagnum-covered (SPHAG) peat in the other, and bare peat (BARE) in both. Average volumetric soil moisture contents in the peat (2 cm below the surface) of the SPHAG and REMOV substrates were similar (86 %), but greater than in BARE peat (78 %). In a location not manipulated for this experiment, where Sphagnum cushions have re-established on bare cutover peat, beneath the cushions was 5 – 14 % greater than in bare cutover peat directly adjacent to it, indicating that cushions can regulate local substrate water storage, and benefit from it during periods of increased water demand. This may have assisted in the lateral expansion of Sphagnum. A loosely structured 0 Ð 5 to 1 Ð 0 cm thick organic litter layer (chiefly Ericaceae) overlying the BARE peat substrate slowed the rate of drying of bare peat in a laboratory sample. The laboratory tests found the capillary fringe to be up to 26 cm above the water table. The dry conditions and the larger pore structure of this litter layer hindered upward capillary flow and, therefore, plant water availability. In (<b>occluded)</b> ditches and <b>low</b> areas, the capillary fringe remained within 5 cm of the surface, and these locations supported the most complete Sphagnum cover. In slightl...|$|R
30|$|An {{alternative}} {{option to}} GPS mapping uses remotely sensed data to delineate fire edges. On a daily basis, {{this is accomplished}} using aerial infrared photographs captured before dawn to locate active fire areas, or “hot spots.” On a coarser spatiotemporal scale, space-borne sensors with infrared bands can provide data {{that have been used}} extensively for BAER analysis of burn severity over the last decade (Lentile et al. 2006). The satellite platforms with the most useful spatiotemporal resolution include Landsat (30 -m pixels, 16 day revisit cycle) and SPOT (20 -m pixels, 26 day revisit cycle). The change in infrared and red reflectance between burned and unburned vegetation is quantified as the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) to empirically gauge the level of burn severity across a burned area (Key 2005). Just as the manual mapping methods have associated potential sources of error, the ability of remotely sensed methods to adequately capture areas of low burn severity in some regions has been questioned by many (Cocke et al. 2005, Epting et al. 2005, Holden et al. 2005). Remotely sensed burn severity mapping depends upon the ability of the sensor to see the burned area, and in regions and vegetation types where an unburned overstory canopy <b>occludes</b> a <b>low</b> severity understory burn, the sensor may not detect significant change, and low severity burns may be classified as unburned (Cocke et al. 2005). In some soil types, changes in reflectance and brightness may also distort the ability to discriminate burned versus unburned areas (Chafer et al. 2004). Perhaps the greatest mechanism for error in delineating burn severity, however, lies in the variability of solar angle and shadow effects during image acquisition. As noted in two Australian studies, a low sun angle during image acquisition results in misclassification of burned areas, particularly in regions that are topographically complex, both from shadowing effects and from reduced or highly variable solar intensity depending on the surface aspect and albedo (Hammill and Bradstock 2006, Walz et al. 2007). Much of the misclassification in these cases occurs in the low and moderate burn severity areas, with some burned areas classifies as unburned, which is problematic for delineation of fire perimeters since areas misclassified as unburned areas would be excluded. Holden et al. (2005) noted, however, that despite the potential sources of error associated with deriving burn severity from Landsat imagery, accuracy of perimeter delineation should be highest in areas of high burn severity, and Chafer et al. (2004) noted that discrimination of burned areas is easier in xeric regions based on soil reflectivity. Since the study region assessed here is xeric and most fires burn entirely at high severity (USDI 2000), the potential for error is significantly reduced.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{advantages}} of the cyanoacrylates in cutaneous synthesis have been often demonstrated in the literature. However, these products have been underutilized in Brazil due to {{the high costs of}} the 2 -octil-cyanoacrylate. Besides, few studies have been done with the more economically accessible form, the 2 -etil-cyanoacrylate, as a cutaneous tissue adhesive. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the closing of cutaneous lesions using ECA. METHOD: This was a prospective study in which 46 wounds were <b>occluded</b> using the <b>low</b> cost ECA as an alternative to intradermal suture. RESULTS: Excisions (97, 8 %) and traumatic wounds (2, 2 %) were treated with 2 -etil-cyanoacrylate and deep relaxed sutures as synthesis method. Unaesthetic scars (22 %), infection (2, 1 %), dehiscence (2, 1 %) and contact allergic dermatitis (2, 1 %) were the problems we found. There were no cases of necrosis or keloids. The results were considered satisfactory in most cases (97, 3 %). CONCLUSION: The use of 2 -etil-cyanoacrylate was shown to be safe and with satisfactory cosmetic results in this group of patients. FUNDAMENTOS: As vantagens dos cianoacrilatos em síntese cutânea têm sido sobejamente mostradas na literatura.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used indwelling urinary catheter design is the one proposed by Foley in 1930 s. This is a closed system, consisting of a tube inserted through the urethra {{held in place by}} an inflatable balloon. The catheter is connected to a drainage system which allows drainage of urine from the bladder. These devices were originally designed for short-term use, but they are currently used for long-term treatments. The design has been changed little so far and it is considered obsolete by the scientific community. These catheters are vulnerable to encrustation and consequent blockage due to biofilm crystal deposition. The aim {{of this study is to}} characterise the effect of catheter design on urinary flow and to explore the potential role of urodynamics on biofilm development and encrustation. This study focused firstly on the correlations between catheter design, urodynamics and the phenomenon of encrustation using an idealized geometry to validate the CFD model with experimental data; subsequently it was used on a real geometry to study the role of the catheter design on the flow properties. The research hypothesis is that catheter design may affect internal urodynamics, and, as a consequence, the process of biofilm formation. A computer model, mimicking the physics of flow through a catheter, was used to predict and investigate flow near its tip. Model geometries were created based on measurements obtained from μCT scans of a Foley catheter. The fluid solver used was ANSYS-CFX, and the physical problem was simplified by using water as a fluid which has similar properties of urine during the first stage. During the second part of the study the fluid solver used was a fluid modelling the rheological behaviour of human urine. Predicted values of volumetric flow rate were validated with data previously obtained experimentally. The results showed flow discontinuities in the proximity of the areas were encrustation is believed to start <b>occluding</b> the catheter. <b>Low</b> velocity values were found in proximity of the tip and near the lower edge of the eyelets. Wall shear stress value were also lower where encrustation commonly develops. These results are in good agreement with experimental data in the literature, indicating a possible correlation between urodynamics and encrustation. A parametrized study was also performed to understand the correlations between catheter design and flow behaviour. All the results obtained were then exhaustively analysed and discussed. To conclude this study provides a methodology which could be used to analyse the influence of catheter design and their potential role on the biofilm formation...|$|R
