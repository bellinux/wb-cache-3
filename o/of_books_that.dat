5|$|In November 1888, he {{lost his}} post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was {{discovered}} drowned in the River Thames. His death, which {{was found to be}} a suicide, roughly coincided {{with the end of the}} murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication <b>of</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.|$|E
5|$|Wills Library and Keats Room: Situated in the Hodgkin Building at Guy's Campus, it was {{originally}} the main library for the Guy’s Hospital Medical School. The Wills Library was a gift in 1903 by {{the former governor of}} Guy's Hospital, the late Sir Frederick Wills and it was opened as the Medical School Library. Many books, archives and documents that were kept in the Wills Library, such as Guy's committee minute books, have been moved to the King's College London Archives in 2004, although the library still contains a collection <b>of</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> can be retrieved by request. The Wills Library also incorporates the Keats Room named after King's alumni John Keats, who was a medical student at Guy's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Fingleton divided {{his time}} between Canberra, where until his {{retirement}} in 1978 he was political correspondent for Radio Australia, and cricket journalism. He forged close relationships with several Prime Ministers. In particular, Sir Robert Menzies, Australia's longest serving Prime Minister, provided him with a laudatory foreword in his book, Masters of Cricket. Fingleton's Test coverage resulted in a number <b>of</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> placed him at the forefront of Australian cricket writers. The books included Cricket Crisis (mainly an account of the 1932–33 Bodyline series), Brightly Fades the Don (the 1948 Invincibles tour), Brown & Company: The Tour in Australia (the English tour of Australia in 1950–51), The Ashes Crown the Year (the Australian tour of England in 1953), Masters of Cricket, Four Chukkas to Australia (the English tour of Australia in 1958–59), The Greatest Test of All (the Tied Test of 1960), Fingleton on Cricket and The Immortal Victor Trumper. His final book, the autobiographical Batting From Memory, was to have its Australian launch during the week in which he died of a heart attack. His cricket writing, {{regarded as one of the}} most stylish by an Australian, often left a sour taste with observers because of the persistent anti-Bradman jibes.|$|E

5|$|Until its repeal, most {{extensions}} to {{copyright law}} were based around provisions {{found in the}} Statute of Anne. The one successful bill from the lobbying in the 1730s, which came into force on 29 September 1739, extended the provision prohibiting the import of foreign books to also prohibit the import <b>of</b> <b>books</b> <b>that,</b> while originally published in Britain, were being reprinted in foreign nations and then shipped to England and Wales. This was intended to stop the influx of cheap books from Ireland, and also repealed the price restrictions in the Statute of Anne. Another alteration was over the legal deposit provisions of the Statute, which many booksellers found unfair. Despite an initial period of compliance, the principle of donating copies of books to certain libraries lapsed, {{partly due to the}} unwieldiness of the statute's provisions and partly {{because of a lack of}} cooperation by the publishers. In 1775 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, succeeded in passing a bill that reiterated the legal deposit provisions and granted the universities perpetual copyright on their works.|$|E

25|$|Books {{were not}} subject to prior censorship, but could be confiscated after being published.

The Inspecção Superior de Bibliotecas e Arquivos (Library and Archive Inspection) would also forbid the reading of certain documents, namely those concerning Portuguese India after the War of Baçaim (1732/1739).

The book's direct predecessor was Patterns of Adjustment in Deviant Populations, a 1967 survey of white gay men in Chicago designed by Bell and Gebhard and funded by NIMH. This pilot study contained many questions identical to those used in Homosexualities, which was a survey of gay men and lesbians carried out in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1969 and 1970.|$|E

40|$|Reference {{books and}} other books Physical {{libraries}} {{tend to have}} a reference section. The chances are that this section of the library will be close the entrance, close to the librarian and close to the catalogue. The reference section will also be highly heterogenous comprising: atlases, dictionaries, bibliographies, directories, encyclopedia etc. Big books and little books; new books and old books, possibly in several languages. Let us also note that special treatment is given to the books in the reference section. As a general rule the reference books cannot be borrowed, even in a lending library. Why should this be? Is it because the reference books are too valuable, too heavy or too fragile? Or because they are in general not the kind <b>of</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> users need to read from cover to cover? Or because they are the kind <b>of</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> other readers will need to consult when reading other books? Or is it because they are the kind <b>of</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> the librarian herself may wish to consult? Or is it because they are more useful if they are in proximity to other reference books? Is it a combination of all of the above? It is not clear that any of these considerations will apply when libraries are primaril...|$|R

25|$|The {{institutionalization of}} science {{occurred}} throughout the 18th century. In 1731, Benjamin Franklin established the Library Company of Philadelphia, the first library {{owned by a}} group of public citizens, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of scientific experiment, and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments. Benjamin Franklin invested a town in Massachusetts with a collection <b>of</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> the town voted to make available to all free of charge, forming the first Public Library. Academie de Chirurgia (Paris) published Memoires pour les Chirurgiens, generally considered to be the first medical journal, in 1736. The American Philosophical Society, patterned on the Royal Society (London), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded, Alois Senefelder developed the concept of lithography for use in mass printing work in Germany in 1796.|$|E
