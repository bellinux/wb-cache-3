5000|$|A float (not to be {{confused}} with a drifter) is an <b>oceanographic</b> <b>instrument</b> platform used for making subsurface measurements in the ocean. Common sensors carried by floats include temperature, conductivity, and pressure (from which salinity can be calculated), and, for acoustically tracked floats, a hydrophone, though a wide range of other sensors have been deployed on floats as well. Often, floats are treated as disposable, as the expense of recovering them from remote areas of the ocean is prohibitive; when the batteries fail, a float ceases to function, and drifts at depth until it runs aground or floods and sinks. In other cases, floats are deployed for a short time and recovered.|$|E

Deep FOCE (dpFOCE) was the first platform, which was deployed in 950 meters of water in Monterey Bay. After the conclusion of dpFOCE, MBARI developed an open source shallow water FOCE (swFOCE) platform located at around 250 meter of water to facilitate worldwide shallow water experiments on FOCE [1][2]. A shallow water platform can be more ubiquitous than a deep-water platform as shallow water instruments are less expensive (as it {{does not have to be}} designed to withstand the pressure at deep ocean depths) and more easily deployed (they can be deployed right along the coast). The swFOCE experiment is an open source platform, and MBARI has made the plans available online to anyone interested in studying shallow water carbon enrichment. There is a gateway node what is connected to four sensor nodes within the swFOCE. In order to test the sensor node individually, an idea of designing an <b>Oceanographic</b> <b>Instrument</b> Simulator is purposed.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work has been to {{investigate}} how miniaturization, such as microsystems technology, can potentially increase the scientific throughput in exploration of hard-to-reach underwater environments, such as the subglacial lakes of Antarctica, or other challenging environments, including cave systems and wrecks. A number of instruments and subsystems applicable to miniature submersibles have been developed and studied, and their potential to provide a high functionality density for size-restricted exploration platforms has been assessed. To provide an onboard camera system with measurement capabilities, simulation and design tools for diffractive optics were developed, and microoptics realized to project reference patterns onto objects to reveal their topography. The influence of murky water on the measurement accuracy was also studied. For longer-range mapping of the surroundings, and under conditions with even less visibility, {{the performance of a}} very small, high-frequency side-scanning sonar was investigated using extensive modeling and physical testing. In particular, the interference on the acoustic beam from tight mounting in a hull was investigated. A range in excess of 30 m and centimeter resolution were obtained. Besides these systems, which can be used to navigate and map environments, a two-dimensional, thermal sensor for minute flows was developed. Measuring speed and direction of water flows, this sensor can aid in the general classification of the environment and also monitor the submersible’s movement. As the flow of waters in subglacial lakes is estimated to be minute, the detection limit and sensitivity were investigated. Measurements of water properties are facilitated by the chip-based conductivity, temperature, and depth sensor system developed. Macroscopically, this is an essential <b>oceanographic</b> <b>instrument</b> with which salinity is determined. Contrary to what was expected, MHz frequencies proved to be advantageous for conductivity measurements. Finally, sampling of water using an acoustically enriching microdevice, and even enabling return of pristine samples via the use of integrated latchable, high-pressure valves, was realized and evaluated. Particularly, investigations of the device’s ability to capture and hold on to microorganisms, were conducted. Further developed and studied, these devices – as subsystems to miniature submersibles, or as stand-alone instruments – should enable exploration of previously unreachable submerged environments.

40|$|The {{coastal zone}} {{is of great}} {{societal}} and economic value. Understanding anthropogenic impacts and natural processes is a prerequisite to effective management of coastal resources, and {{a key part of}} this understanding is the prediction (both past and future) of the coastal zone's hydrodynamics. Methods of predicting the hydrodynamics of coral reef systems, which tend to be morphologically complex and subject to a variety of oscillatory and non-oscillatory motions over a large range of space and time scales, remain poorly developed. Recent advances in numerical modeling have allowed the practical solution of the two- and three-dimensional shallow water Navier-Stokes equations at spatial scales on the order of tens of meters. This has allowed unprecedented prediction of coastal hydrodynamics, and its use is expanding, particularly in mid- to high latitude continental margins regions. Few researches have yet applied these advances to coral reef systems, however. The goal of this work is to improve the understanding and prediction of relevant hydrodynamic processes in coral reef systems. This is accomplished by the combined analysis of in situ <b>oceanographic</b> <b>instrument</b> data and climate information, as well as the application of a coupled wave-flow numerical model at two different study sites. The study sites, Hanalei Bay and Midway Atoll, both in the Hawaiian Islands (Figure 1. 1), constitute two fundamentally different reef morphologies, a fringing reef embayment and an atoll, respectively. Both are subjected {{to a wide range of}} wind-wave energy, which is shown to force the most energetic hydraulic motions at both sites. Results include an evaluation of the numerical models used, a statistical analysis of wind-wave climate that identifies major modes of coastal circulation, and the calculation of flushing times and other coastal hydrodynamic metrics under different conditions. Model evaluation shows that if the spatially varying hydraulic roughness and wave dissipation approximations presented here are used, coupled wave/flow numerical model skill for steep and morphologically complex coral reefs may approach that of milder sloped mid-latitude continental margin coasts. The results also highlight important hydrodynamic differences between prevailing (wind and wave) conditions and episodic storm wave events. These events incur water levels, current velocities, flushing rates, and inferred sediment transport several orders of magnitude greater than those of prevalent conditions. For instance, flushing (residence) times at both study sites are on the order of 1 - 3 days during prevalent conditions, whilst during large storm wave events flushing time may reduce to several hours. The high near-bed flows and associated shear stresses episodically mobilize and transport seafloor sediment and heavily impact the benthic biological community. The number and magnitude of these episodic events are shown to exhibit high interannual variability linked to climate indices for El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Pacific Index (NPI). The historically small (but variable) number of these events (between 0 and approximately 20) indicate that annual differences in net sedimentation and water quality are very large at both sites, and most likely sensitive to long-term changes in annual recurrence. Additionally, large changes in sea level anomaly during these large wave events, evident in model predictions and confirmed by tide gauge data at Midway Atoll, introduce an unaccounted for variable in contemporary sea-level trend analyses, possibly at many in situ sea level monitoring sites in the Pacific and Indian Oceans...|$|E
