5|$|During {{the course}} of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less {{frequently}} treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a witch. Still later, with the rise of the witch persecution {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for the witch and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been conceived of as a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who is blamed for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that cuts down the corn with sickles that are fastened to its feet. He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strangest</b> and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect the concerns of a farm culture, and it serves to explain the eerie appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.|$|E

She was not surprised to discover that ASIO had shown interest in her membership of the Communist Party while at university; what she was not prepared for was a detailed investigation the organisation had made in 1963, after becoming concerned that John Zakharov was a bigamist. A less-than-impressed Zakharov speculated at the time that the contents of her file may have cost her at least one public service position during the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the five}} living species of monotreme occur in Australia: the platypus and the short-beaked echidna.

When it was first presented by Joseph Banks to English naturalists it {{was thought to be}} so strange that it was a cleverly created hoax.

500|$|The Witham's {{course is}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strangest</b> of British rivers, {{the result of}} {{glaciation}} (and possibly isostatic rebound) redirecting older rivers.

[...] The upper waters are important for agricultural water extraction, and for coarse fish such as roach, common bream and pike; small mammals like water voles, and native crayfish. A gap in the limestone scarp (see Lincolnshire Wolds) near Ancaster may represent an earlier, straighter course of the river towards Boston, a proto-River Slea.|$|E

Elizabeth, as she had wished, concluded the inquiry with a verdict that nothing was proven, either against the confederate lords or Mary. For overriding political reasons, Elizabeth wished neither to convict nor acquit Mary of murder, and {{there was never any}} intention to proceed judicially; the conference was intended as a political exercise.

500|$|In 1961, O'Hara portrayed Kit Tilden in {{the western}} The Deadly Companions, Sam Peckinpah's feature-film debut. Playing against {{stereotype}} as the strong, aggressive redhead, she plays a character who is vulnerable to rape and violence from men. The plot involves her traveling across Apache territory with an ex-Sergeant (Keith) to bury her young son to be buried next to his father in the desert. Malone considered her character in the film to be [...] "radically underdeveloped". While O'Hara acknowledged that Peckinpah later [...] "reached icon status as a great director of westerns", {{she thought he was}} [...] "just awful" [...] and [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strangest</b> and most objectionable people I had ever worked with". Later that year she starred in The Parent Trap, one of her most popular films, opposite a young Hayley Mills. O'Hara credits Mills for the success of the film, remarking that [...] "she really did bring two different girls to life in the movie" [...] and wrote that [...] "Sharon and Susan were so believable that I'd sometimes forget myself and look for the other one when Hayley and I were standing around the set". Malone notes that this was the film that she [...] "made a transition from comely maiden to trendy mother", one which received some of the best critical plaudits of her career. O'Hara was subsequently involved in a legal dispute with Walt Disney, backed by the Screen Actors Guild, over billing for the film. She never worked for Disney again.|$|E
