The operational health district is the lowest organizational level in the Cambodian health system, providing services through health centres and a single referral hospital. An <b>equity</b> <b>fund</b> involves a third party identifying the poor and paying user fees on their behalf by reimbursing the service provider, thus relieving health staff of such responsibility.
