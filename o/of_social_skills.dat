5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored.

A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills,</b> intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E

Strong <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> can facilitate interpersonal interactions, which can in turn lead to effective job outcomes. Although the change in organizational structures and the importance <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> have heightened awareness <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> in organizational outcomes, little is known about what <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> is and its role in influencing work outcomes. In this study, I provide some insight into the definition and measurement <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> and how <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> influences job and career success outcomes. Based on my review <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> literature, I defined <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> as a learnable social behavior used to achieve social goals. Further, I proposed an integrated <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> framework that theorized <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> as a higher-order construct with three sub-factors: social presentation, social scanning, and social flexibility. I conducted three studies to develop a measure <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> and examine the antecedents and outcomes <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill.</b> The results, based on over 400 employees, show that personality factors, such as self-monitoring and extraversion, {{have a positive effect on}} <b>social</b> <b>skill.</b> The findings also suggest that <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> successfully predicts the number of mentors, mentoring received, social support, organizational citizenship behavior, and job performance. Finally, the findings indicate that <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> should be operationalized as a higher-order construct. The study provides both theoretical and practical implications for researchers and organizations interested in the development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although {{the concept}} <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> is not new, {{organizational}} behavior scholars have just recently started {{to study the}} role <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> in career success. <b>Social</b> <b>skills</b> are important because they allow us to {{interact with each other}} with predictability, so that we can more readily understand each other and be understood. Strong <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> can facilitate interpersonal interactions, which can in turn lead to effective job outcomes. <b>Social</b> <b>skills</b> also allow an individual the opportunity to express both positive and negative feelings in interpersonal situations without losing social reinforcement.

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to address the}} performance inhibition hypothesis by assessing nonverbal social performance in socially anxious individuals during a task where verbal content was standardized, thereby decreasing the overall performance requirements, thus theoretically decreasing their social distress. Fifty-nine subjects were identified as high or low socially anxious and participated in two behavioral role-play tasks. Both role-plays included a standard heterosocial conversation task; however during the second task subjects were provided their verbal content through a bug-in-the-ear wireless transmitter. Results showed no significant within or between-group differences on measures <b>of</b> nonverbal <b>social</b> <b>skill.</b> However, a global rating <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> revealed a significant group difference. These results {{do not support the}} performance inhibition hypothesis and support the notion that isolated behaviors aren’t enough to distinguish socially anxious and non-socially anxious individuals from one another. Rather, it’s the unique combination of all elements <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> that allows for this differentiation...|$|R
5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{symptoms}} of autism spectrum disorders {{can interfere with}} the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a lack <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills.</b> Children with autism {{have been found to be}} more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. Additionally, they are more likely to be close friends of other children with some sort of a disability. A sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with one's parents compensates for a lack <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> that would usually inhibit friendships.|$|E

25|$|Although {{lessons and}} {{training}} may help peers {{of children with}} autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of The New York Times, bullying {{is most likely to}} occur against autistic children who have the most potential to live independently, such as those with Asperger syndrome. Such children are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and lack <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> as children with full autism, but {{they are more likely to}} be mainstreamed in school, since they are on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Children with autism have more difficulty attending to social cues, and so may not always recognize when they are being bullied.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all other}} {{students}}, {{students with disabilities}} experience sexual harassment in school as both victims and perpetrators. Some disabilities could cause a lack of control over impulses, a lack of awareness {{of the effects of}} their words and actions, and a lack <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> needed to avoid sexually harassing behavior. In some circumstances, a student with disabilities could exhibit a behavior that would constitute sexual harassment without intentionally trying to be malicious or inappropriate. In these cases, where a disability could lead to sexually harassing behaviors, positive behavior intervention plans are often put into place by a team often including parents, school administrators, general education teachers, special education teachers, school psychologists, and counselors. These types of plans could also be made during Individualized Education Programmeetings regarding the student.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between parental attitudes and a child’s self-concept is crucial during the preschool years. It {{has been reported}} that elevated stress levels in mothers correlated with reduced social skills in their children. Strong parent support networks may help to prevent the development of negative self-concept in children with cleft palate. In the later preschool and early elementary years, the development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> is no longer only impacted by parental attitudes but is beginning to be shaped by their peers. A cleft lip or cleft palate may affect the behavior of preschoolers. Experts suggest that parents discuss with their children ways to handle negative social situations related to their cleft lip or cleft palate. A child who is entering school should learn the proper (and age-appropriate) terms related to the cleft. The ability to confidently explain the condition to others may limit feelings of awkwardness and embarrassment and reduce negative social experiences.|$|E
25|$|Supportive {{psychotherapy}} is {{also used}} in an inpatient or outpatient setting by a trained professional that focuses on areas such as coping skills, improvement <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> and social interactions, communication, and self-esteem issues. People with SPD {{have a tendency to}} miss differences that causes an inability to pick up environmental cues and limits their experience. The perception of varied events only increases their fear for intimacy and limits them in their interpersonal relationships. Their aloofness may limit their opportunities to refine the social skills and behavior necessary to effectively pursue relationships. Socialization groups may help people with SPD. Educational strategies in which people who have SPD identify their positive and negative emotions also may be effective. Such identification helps them to learn about their own emotions and the emotions they draw out from others and to feel the common emotions with other people with whom they relate. This can help people with SPD create empathy with the outside world.|$|E

25|$|Hearing loss {{among the}} aged {{community}} lessens elders' ability {{to compensate for}} other age related social and/or physical problems. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems {{are more important than}} changes in linguistic knowledge. The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis {{is an example of a}} hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear. This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> because they may have trouble keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.|$|E
