Pairs of traders are randomly matched and bargaining a price under rules that offer the freedom to quit the match at any time. Market equilbria, prices and trades over time, are characterized. The asymptotic behavior of prices and trades as frictions (search costs and impatience) vanish, and the conditions for (non) convergence to walrasian prices are explored.

40|$|The paper reconsiders the hold-up {{problem in}} {{long-term}} bilateral trade with specific investments. In our framework, the parties face several trading opportunities (goods) whose characteristics cannot be described {{at the start}} of the relationship. Specifically, there exists an investment responsive `innovative' good, and (at least one) non-responsive `standard' good. In line with Hart and Moore (1988), renegotiation takes place as outside <b>option</b> <b>bargaining.</b> We first establish a first-best outcome for the case where trading the innovation is always efficient. This results contrasts with findings in Segal (1999) and Hart and Moore (1999) who adopt an alternative view of renegotiation. Then, we consider a setting where final trade is not always efficient, and show that a properly chosen at-will contract still implements the first best for a non-empty set of parameterizations. Finally, we show that at-will contracts strictly outperform option or specific-performance contracts. ...|$|R

Sellers closely follow the equilibrium strategy of exiting the auction at their costs and then accepting strictly profitable offers. Buyers generally exercise their <b>option</b> to <b>bargain</b> according to their equilibrium strategy, but their take-it-or-leave-it o ers vary positively with auction prices {{when they should be}} invariant.

In these settings a seller agent {{can take advantage}} from the competition among sev-eral buyer agents and vice versa. In this paper we focus on one-sided competition situations wherein there are one seller and several buyers (the analysis of the reverse situa-tions is analogous). We provide two original contributions. Firstly, we extend state-of-the-art models to satisfactorily capture competition among buyers. More precisely, we en-rich the alternating-offers protocol by allowing the seller agent to exploit the outside option, namely, the option to leave the negotiation she is carrying on and choose a dif-ferent buyer with whom to negotiate.

40|$|Abstract — Bargaining is a {{fundamental}} activity in social life. Game-theoretic methodology has provided perfect solutions for certain abstract models. Even for a simple model, this method demands substantial human intelligent effort in order to solve game-theoretic equilibriums. The analytic complexity increases rapidly when more elements {{are included in the}} models. In our previous work, we have demonstrated how co-evolutionary algorithms are used to find approximations to game-theoretic equilibriums of bargaining models that consider bargaining costs only. In this paper, we study more complicated bargaining models, in which outside option is taken into account besides bargaining cost. Empirical studies demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms are efficient in finding near-perfect solutions. Experimental results reflect the compound effects of discount factors and outside <b>options</b> upon <b>bargaining</b> outcomes. We argue that evolutionary algorithm is a practical tool for generating reasonable good strategies for more realistic bargaining models. I...|$|R
40|$|Parties often {{regulate}} {{their relationships}} through “continuing” contracts that are neither long-term nor short-term but usually roll over: a leading {{example is a}} standard employment contract. We argue that what distinguishes a continuing contract from a short-term (or fixed-term) contract is that parties apply notions of fairness, fair dealing, and good faith as they revise {{the terms of the}} contract: specifically, they use the previous contract as a reference point. We show that a continuing contract can reduce (re) negotiation costs relative to a short-term or long-term contract when there is uncertainty about future gains from trade. However, fair dealing may limit the use of outside <b>options</b> in <b>bargaining</b> and as a result parties will sometimes fail to trade when this is efficient. For-cause contracts, where termination can occur only for a good reason, can reduce this inefficiency.

The corporation bears the initial investment and earns as a return a share on the profits. The host country provides access and guarantee conditions of operation. Being the investment totally sunk, the corporation must account in its plan {{not only for}} uncertainty on market conditions {{but also for the}} threat of nationalization. In a real options framework where the government holds an American call option on nationalization we show under which conditions a Nash bargaining is feasible and leads to attain a cooperative agreement maximizing the joint venture surplus. We find that the threat of nationalization does not affect the investment time trigger but only the feasible bargaining set. Finally, we show that the optimal sharing rule results from the way the two parties may differently trade off rents with option value.

40|$|In this study, we analyse {{changes in}} market {{power in the}} Dutch {{supermarket}} chain and discuss the effects on welfare. The supermarket chain includes consumers, supermarkets, buyer groups and food manufactures. We look at the theoretical background of market power. �Special {{attention has been paid}} to recent theories of buyer power of retailers in the vertical chain. Theory suggests that supermarkets can enhance their buyer power by, for instance, using own private brands as an outside <b>option</b> in <b>bargaining</b> with manufacturers. Using firm-level data, indicators reveal that profit margins of both supermarkets and of manufacturers have declined between 1993 and 2005. Hence, competition on these markets seems to have become tougher and mark-ups lower over time. Furthermore, we find no significant empirical indications that supermarkets were able to use their buyer power to shift profits from manufacturers to supermarkets after 1993. Finally, all else equal, in terms of welfare consumers have benefited from fiercer competition in terms of lower prices. ...|$|R

This paper analyzes a sequential bargaining model in which players may hold different beliefs about which player will make an offer and when.

This result is also extended to other canonical models of optimism. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002. ...|$|R

40|$|Some workers {{bargain with}} {{prospective}} employers before accepting a job. Others could bargain, but find it undesirable, because {{their right to}} bargain has induced a sufficiently favorable offer, which they accept. Yet others perceive that they cannot bargain over pay; they regard the posted wage as a take-it-or-leave-it opportunity. Theories of wage formation point to substantial differences in labor-market equilibrium between bargained and posted wages. The fraction of workers hired away from existing jobs is another key determinant of equilibrium, because a worker with an existing job has a better outside <b>option</b> in <b>bargaining</b> than does an unemployed worker. Our survey measures the incidences of wage posting, bargaining, and on-the-job search. We find that {{about a third of}} workers had precise information about pay when they first met with their employers, a sign of wage posting. We find that another third bargained over pay before accepting their current jobs. And about 40 percent of workers could have remained on their earlier jobs at the time they accepted their current jobs. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{increased}} health insurer competition on negotiated hospital prices. Insurer competition can lead to lower premiums holding fixed hospital prices; however, hospitals may also leverage each insurer’s weaker outside <b>option</b> when <b>bargaining</b> to negotiate higher prices. We use a theoretical bargaining model to derive a regression equation where price is expressed in terms of changes in the following variables when a hospital is dropped from an insurer’s network: (i) the insurer’s premiums, demand, and payments to other hospitals, and (ii) the hospital’s costs and reimbursements from other insurers. We estimate a model of consumer demand for hospitals and use it to derive many of the independent variables specified in the regression equation, and use the presence of Kaiser Permanente in the hospital’s market to proxy for the level of insurer competition. Leveraging a unique dataset on negotiated prices between hospitals and commercial insurers in California in 2004, we find that increased insurer competition has a positive and empirically meaningful effect on the prices of high utility generating hospitals. This effect is relevant for policymakers as it can offset anticipated premium reductions, and has not been emphasized in the recent literature on hospital-insurer bargaining. ...|$|R

An equilibrium point for any game is defined here {{as a set of}} strategy choices for the players, such that no change in the choice of any single player will increase the overall payoff of all the players. Determining equilibrium for multi-player games is a complex problem. An intuitive conceptual tool for reducing the complexity, via the idea of spatially representing strategy <b>options</b> in the <b>bargaining</b> problem is proposed. Based on this geometry, an equilibrium condition is established such that the product of their gains over what each receives is maximal.
