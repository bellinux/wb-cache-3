While she was Senior Assistant Mistress, she began studying phonetics in the evenings part-time at the University College Phonetics Department in order to improve her teaching of French pronunciation. In 1917, Armstrong received a Diploma with Distinction in French Phonetics; she got a Diploma with Distinction in English phonetics the following year.|$|E

5|$|Despite precautions, the {{post-production}} faced significant delays {{owing to}} the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in {{the completion of the}} visual effects. The post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.|$|E

The position was frequently of cabinet level. The office was renamed Minister <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> <b>and</b> Buildings <b>and</b> First Commissioner <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> in 1940, Minister <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> <b>and</b> Planning in 1942, Minister <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> in 1943 <b>and</b> finally Minister <b>of</b> Public Buildings <b>and</b> <b>Works</b> in 1962.

5|$|Frampton {{resigned}} from the project through pressure <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> Drury and Pomeroy carried out the project, each contributing four monumental statues, which were installed in late 1907. On the upstream piers are Pomeroy's Agriculture, Architecture, Engineering and Pottery, whilst on the downstream piers are Drury's Science, Fine Arts, Local Government and Education. Each statue weighs approximately two tons. Despite their size, the statues are little-noticed by users of the bridge as they are not visible from the bridge itself, but only from the river banks or from passing shipping.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1816, a {{group of}} 56{{residents}} met at The Globe Inn in Littleport to discuss the lack <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> rising grain costs. Fuelled by alcohol, the residents directed their anger at local farmer Henry Martin. He had been overseer of the poor in 1814 and was not well liked by the parishioners. One man went to get a horn from Burgess, the lighterman, and started blowing it outside The Globe Inn, gathering hundreds of villagers to join the first group, and the riot commenced.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December 1955, during the stations' construction, {{switchgear}} exploded in the South station's substation, closing down the generators. Dunston power station could not take the extra load and it also shut down, creating a total blackout on Tyneside. Around 400,000 people were affected by the fault, including 20,000 miners trapped in over a hundred collieries. Power was fully reconnected by that evening. but the failure caused an interruption <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> services worth more than £1,000,000, {{as well as the}} loss of 300 megawatts of electricity.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, design {{management}} {{was seen as}} limited to the management of design projects, but over time, it evolved to include other aspects of an organization at the functional and strategic level.

This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> an abductive mode of inference, compared to practices associated with the more traditional management paradigm.|$|E

5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E
5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{was made}} {{chairman}} of the Town Planning Committee. Under Chamberlain's direction Birmingham soon adopted {{one of the first}} town planning schemes in Britain. The start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans. In 1915, Chamberlain became Lord Mayor of Birmingham. Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlain's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Joseph's brother Richard Chamberlain, William and George Kenrick, Charles Beale, who had been four times Lord Mayor and Sir Thomas Martineau. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.|$|E

5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of his {{personal}} loss, Morris, known for his sincerity and high personal values, received many offers <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> financial assistance. With a reference from English cricketer Doug Insole, Morris joined British engineering company George Wimpey for a few years. He then moved back to Sydney to take up a public relations job with security group Wormald International where he worked until his retirement in the late 1980s. He was appointed to the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust in 1965 and served there for 22 years, eight of them as deputy chairman. During this time, the ground was modernised and the Bradman Stand erected. In 1968, Morris met and married his second wife Judith Menmuir. He was awarded the MBE in 1974 for services to sport. In late 1989, Morris and his wife retired to the town of Cessnock in the Hunter Region, north of Sydney. He continued to play tennis into his late seventies and enjoyed watching Test cricket although he refused to watch one-day cricket, introduced after his playing days, due to his preference for tradition.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{imposing}} palaces {{were built}} in the main Mycenaean centers of the mainland. The earliest palace structures were megaron-type buildings, such as the Menelaion in Sparta, Lakonia. Palaces proper are datable from c. 1400 BC, when Cyclopean fortifications were erected at Mycenae and nearby Tiryns. Additional palaces {{were built in}} Midea and Pylos in Peloponnese, Athens, Eleusis, Thebes and Orchomenos in Central Greece and Iolcos, in Thessaly, the latter being the northernmost Mycenaean center. Knossos in Crete became also a Mycenaean center, where the former Minoan complex underwent a number of adjustments, including the addition of a throne room. These centers were based on a rigid network of bureaucracy where administrative competencies were classified into various sections and offices according to specialization <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> trades. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax (Linear B: wa-na-ka) in Mycenaean Greek terms. All powers were vested in him, as the main landlord and spiritual and military leader. At the same time he was an entrepreneur and trader and was aided by a network of high officials.|$|E
