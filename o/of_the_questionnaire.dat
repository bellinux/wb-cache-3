25|$|The main {{interest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> {{was to see}} if {{a participant}} answered yes to the first question, implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as likely to believe the fallacy than adults 40–49, confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.|$|E
25|$|Galton's {{inquiries}} {{into the}} mind involved detailed recording of people's subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as mental imagery. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.|$|E

25|$|Having {{established}} the facts, Gordon {{turned to the}} law. He applied the test from Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, a 1977 Supreme Court decision overturning the firing of a teacher for, among other things, sharing a proposed dress code with the media. First, Myers would {{have to prove that}} her distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was constitutionally protected speech, and that her firing was a result. If she could establish that, the burden would then be on Connick to show that she would have been fired whether she had distributed the questionnaire or not.|$|E

2500|$|White {{rejected}} Gordon's analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> as less subversive than outright criticism. [...] "Questions, no {{less than}} forcefully stated opinions and facts, carry messages and it requires no unusual insight {{to conclude that the}} purpose, if not the likely result, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> is to seek to precipitate a vote of no confidence in Connick and his supervisors." [...] Following Givhan, he also found the time, place and manner relevant, since Myers had distributed her questionnaire in the office during work hours, shortly after her meeting with Connick, timing Myers said was intentional on her part. [...] "When employee speech concerning office policy arises from an employment dispute concerning the very application of that policy to the speaker, additional weight must be given to the supervisor's view that the employee has threatened the authority of the employer to run the office." ...|$|E

2500|$|The group [...] {{produced}} a 20 question [...] "alternate" [...] survey, saying that [...] "the [...] questionnaire {{is far too}} complex and, with its abstract language and juridical views of marriage, it is largely incomprehensible {{to even the most}} well educated Catholics." [...] Call to Action called the lanquage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> [...] "hard to get into" [...] and released their own version that was not as [...] "prescriptive" [...] as that the simplified version produced by the bishops of England and Wales.|$|E
2500|$|... "When all {{factors are}} considered, it cannot {{be said that}} the defendant's {{interest}} in promoting the efficiency of the public services performed through his employees was either adversely affected or substantially impeded by plaintiff's distribution of the questionnaire", Gordon concluded. He thus found Myers had met her first test, and reiterated his finding of fact that she had been fired for the distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> which satisfied the second. Since that was the only possible reason he had found for her termination, it could not be alleged that she would have been fired without having done it, and thus she had won.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1981 Gordon issued his decision. After {{recounting the}} facts of the case, he found for Myers. [...] "The {{preponderance}} of the evidence in this case," [...] he wrote," [...] indicates that the plaintiff was fired by the defendant because of her circulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> within the District Attorney's Office." [...] He noted in support that another ADA testified that she had been preparing for her new cases with him, and that Connick had returned home after their morning meeting, satisfied with her answer. Only after Waldron's call about the questionnaire did he return and fire her.|$|E

2500|$|Gordon {{called the}} last area, the purported effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> on {{relations}} between superiors and supervised, [...] "the defendant's most forceful argument." [...] He agreed it was important, {{but did not}} believe, as Connick did, that the mere act of distributing a questionnaire which asked, among other things, whether respondents trusted four named supervisors, was as prejudicial to discipline as a negative statement about those individuals would be. He cited a similar case where a college professor had alleged his contract was not renewed because of his role in disseminating a questionnaire. [...] " [...] not a statement of fact but the presentation and solicitation of ideas and opinions" [...] and thus even more clearly protected.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{all five}} of the {{supervisors}} named in the questionnaire had testified at trial that they could continue working with Myers were she to return, the majority had given greater weight to what it held to be Connick's reasonable belief that the distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> would adversely affect his authority. [...] "Such extreme deference to the employer's judgment is not appropriate" [...] for public employment, Brennan responded. He pointed to Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the landmark free-speech {{case in which the}} Court had upheld the right of high-school students to wear black armbands to school in protest against the Vietnam War. In that case a majority had held that the school officials' fear that the armbands would be disruptive, without any other evidence, did not justify prohibiting them. He did not see a difference in this case.|$|E
2500|$|While most camp inmates simply {{answered}} [...] "yes" [...] to both questions, {{several thousand}} — 17 {{percent of the}} total respondents, 20 percent of the Nisei — gave negative or qualified replies out of confusion, fear or anger at the wording and implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> In regard to Question 27, many worried that expressing a willingness to serve would be equated with volunteering for combat, while others felt insulted at being asked to risk their lives for a country that had imprisoned them and their families. An affirmative answer to Question 28 brought up other issues. Some believed that renouncing their loyalty to Japan would suggest that they had at some point been loyal to Japan and disloyal to the United States. Many believed they were to be deported to Japan no matter how they answered; they feared an explicit disavowal of the Emperor would become known and make such resettlement extremely difficult.|$|E

2500|$|The KSADS-P was {{the first}} version of the K-SADS, {{developed}} by Chambers and Puig-Antich in 1978 as a version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia adapted for use with children and adolescents 6–19 years old. This version rephrased the SADS to make the wording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> pertain to a younger age group. For example, mania symptoms in children might be manifest differently than in adulthood (e.g., children might have not have the same opportunity to spend money impulsively, nor would they likely have access to credit cards or checking accounts; instead, they might give away all their favorite toys or empty their parent's wallet to gain spending money). [...] The KSADS-P is a structured interview given by trained clinicians or clinical researchers who interview both the child and the parent. This original version assesses symptoms that have occurred in the most current episode (within the week preceding the interview), as well as symptoms that have occurred within the last 12 months. [...] The KSADS-P has many limitations: it does not assess lifetime symptoms and history, does not include many psychiatric diagnoses of interest in childhood (such as autistic spectrum disorders), and does not include diagnosis specific impairment ratings.|$|E
