Our approach guarantees confidentiality {{and integrity of}} transferred files, <b>originator</b> <b>authentication,</b> and non-repudiation. We achieve these goals through the usage of DES, MD 5 -RSA, ANSI X 9. 17 and a distributed scheme for the validation of public component certificates (similar to X. 509.) 1 Introduction Our goal {{is to build a}} secure file transfer protocol between user agents that guarantees the following features: ffl confidentiality of the file contents, ffl integrity of the file contents, ffl <b>originator</b> <b>authentication,</b> and ffl non-repudiation. Integrity, <b>originator</b> <b>authentication,</b> and non-repudiation are achieved by applying a digital fingerprint, or message digest to the transferred file. We are using MD 5 1 -RSA 2 for the digital signature. Confidentiality is achieved by DES 3 encryption of the file with a different private key for each message that is generated according to ANSI X 9. 17 4. The security of [...] ...|$|E
