5|$|<b>On</b> <b>Nothing,</b> Meshuggah {{abandons}} {{the fast}} tempos of Chaosphere and concentrates on slow, tuned down tempos and grooves. The album {{was intended to}} be recorded using custom-made Nevborn eight-string guitars, but the prototypes were faulty so Thordendal and Hagström used detuned Ibanez seven-string guitars instead. This technique, which involved keeping the instruments untuned during the sessions, created additional problems. When Ibanez provided Meshuggah with special eight-string guitars with two extra-low strings that worked properly after the initial release, the band re-recorded the guitar parts for Nothing and re-released it in 2006. Hagström notes that this allowed the band to go lower sonically and to attain bass sounds on guitars.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{his adult}} life, Cage was also active as {{lecturer}} and writer. Some of his lectures {{were included in}} several books he published, {{the first of which}} was Silence: Lectures and Writings (1961). Silence included not only simple lectures, but also texts executed in experimental layouts, and works such as Lecture <b>on</b> <b>Nothing</b> (1949), which were composed in rhythmic structures. Subsequent books also featured different types of content, from lectures on music to poetry—Cage's mesostics.|$|E

25|$|Möngke's {{death in}} 1259 {{led to the}} {{four-year}} Toluid Civil War between his two younger brothers, Kublai Khan and Ariq Böke. Though Kublai Khan eventually won, the succession war and the subsequent Kaidu–Kublai war essentially resulted in the permanent division of the Mongol Empire. It was not until 1304, when all Mongol khans submitted to Kublai's successor, Temür Khan, that the Mongol world again acknowledged a single paramount sovereign, although {{the authority of the}} late Khagans rested <b>on</b> <b>nothing</b> like the same foundations as that of Genghis Khan and his first three successors.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Kaidu, the Chatagai ruler Duwa {{initiated}} a peace proposal and persuaded the Ögedeids to submit to Temür Khan. In 1304, all khanates approved a peace treaty and accepted Yuan emperor Temür's supremacy. This established the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty over the western khanates. While this supremacy based <b>on</b> <b>nothing</b> like the same foundations {{as that of the}} earlier Khagans (such as the continued border clashes among them) and each of the four khanates continued to develop separately and function as different states, the nominal supremacy did last for a few decades.|$|E

It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in.

25|$|Cage was {{affiliated}} with Wesleyan University and collaborated {{with members of}} its Music Department from the 1950s {{until his death in}} 1992. At the University, the philosopher, poet, and professor of classics Norman O. Brown befriended Cage, an association that proved fruitful to both. In 1960 the composer was appointed a Fellow on the faculty of the Center for Advanced Studies (now the Center for Humanities) in the Liberal Arts and Sciences at Wesleyan, where he started teaching classes in experimental music. In October 1961, Wesleyan University Press published Silence, a collection of Cage's lectures and writings {{on a wide variety of}} subjects, including the famous Lecture <b>on</b> <b>Nothing</b> that was composed using a complex time length scheme, much like some of Cage's music. Silence was Cage's first book. He went on to publish five more. Silence remained his most widely read and influential book. In the early 1960s Cage began his lifelong association with C.F. Peters Corporation. Walter Hinrichsen, the president of the corporation, offered Cage an exclusive contract and instigated the publication of a catalog of Cage's works, which appeared in 1962.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time, Kaidu and Duwa of the Chagatai Khanate mobilized a large army to attack Karakorum (then under Yuan control) around 1300 during {{the final stage of}} the Kaidu–Kublai war. The Yuan army {{suffered}} heavy losses while both sides could not make any decisive victory in September. Duwa was wounded in the battle and Kaidu died soon thereafter. After that, Duwa, Kaidu's son Chapar, Tokhta of the Golden Horde and Ilkhan Oljeitu (Ghazan's successor) negotiated peace with Temür Khan in 1304 in order to maintain trade and diplomatic relations, and agreed him to be their nominal overlord. This established the nominal suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty over the western khanates. However, the peace was short-lived. The fighting between Duwa and Chapar soon broke out over the question of territory. Temür backed Duwa and sent a large army under Khayisan in the fall of 1306, and Chapar finally surrendered. The territory controlled by Chapar was divided up by the Chagataids and the Yuan dynasty. The nominal supremacy of the Yuan, while based <b>on</b> <b>nothing</b> like the same foundations as that of the earlier Khagans (such as the continued border clashes among them), did last for a few decades, until the Yuan dynasty fell in China (1368). The four khanates continued to interact with one another {{in the first half of}} the 14th century, but they did so as sovereign states. They formed alliances, fought one another, exchanged envoys, and traded commercial products. In the case of the Yuan dynasty based in China and the Ilkhanate based in Iran, there was an extensive program of cultural and scientific interaction. But they never again pooled their resources in a cooperative military endeavor.|$|E

500|$|The {{argument}} is outlined in Avicenna's various works. The most concise and influential form {{is found in}} the fourth [...] "class" [...] (fasl) of his Remarks and Admonitions (Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat). It is also present in BookII, Chapter12 of the Book of Salvation (Kitab al-najat) and throughout the Metaphysics section of the Book of Healing (al-Shifa). The passages in Remarks and Admonitions draw a distinction between two types of proof for the existence of God: the first is derived from reflection <b>on</b> <b>nothing</b> but existence itself; the second requires reflection on things such as God's creations or God's acts. Avicenna says that the first type is the proof for [...] "the truthful", which is more solid and nobler than the second one, which is proof for a certain [...] "group of people". According to the professor of Islamic philosophy Shams Inati, by [...] "the truthful" [...] Avicenna means the philosophers, and the [...] "group of people" [...] means the theologians and others who seek to demonstrate God's existence through his creations. The proof then became known in the Arabic tradition as the [...] "Proof of the Truthful" [...] (al-burhan al-siddiqin).|$|E

Robert Copsy of Digital Spy also noted a significant growth in confidence, and called the song: [...] "a piece of atmospheric self-reflection that sets up his current mindset: an artist with plenty of ambition but with a constant nagging fear about losing his way." ...|$|E
