The defect was subaortic, subpulmonary, or doubly committed in 55 specimens. In a further 8 specimens, the defect opened into the <b>outlet</b> <b>portion</b> of the right ventricle, but the distance between the ventricular septal defect and the semilunar orifice was extensive, either because of extreme dextroposition of the aorta or a broad ventriculoinfundibular fold, which, in some cases, was associated with a long-outlet septum.

An atrioventricular septal defect without extension to the outlet was present in 3 cases, and a ventricular septal defect limited to the inlet was found in another case. The ventriculoinfundibular fold, part of the outlet septum and septal band or septomarginal trabeculation, had fused to form a crestlike structure. The septomarginal trabeculation is a useful landmark in the right ventricle to differentiate the inlet from the outlet in different forms of double-outlet right ventricle.

30|$|In DCRV, {{a muscular}} band {{is present in}} the mid-right {{ventricular}} region, the band divides the chamber into two parts and creates obstruction between the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>portions.</b> The diagnosis of double-chambered right ventricle, which is commonly associated with ventricular septum defect, is usually made by echocardiography. The prognosis of the untreated cases of DCRV with right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction at sub-infundibular level is similar to that for valvular pulmonary stenosis.

30|$|Proximity to the aortic, {{pulmonary}} and tricuspid {{valves and}} the atrioventricular conduction bundle determines {{the suitability of}} a defect for percutaneous closure. Muscular defects are usually {{at a safe distance}} from these structures making them ideally suited for catheter device closure. Doubly committed and juxta-arterial defects are bordered by aortic and pulmonary valves, making them unsuitable for catheter closure. Perimembranous outlet defect is closest to the aortic valve and a confluent defect that extends to both inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>portions</b> is close to both the atrioventricular and aortic valves [40]. However, device closure can be done in some perimembranous defects that are not complicated by septal malalignment or valvular prolapse with careful evaluation of defect size, shape, and distance from vital structures and optimal device selection. The area of fibrous continuity between tricuspid, mitral and aortic valve is crucial to avoid atrioventricular dissociation [41].|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to demonstrate that streaming blood flow patterns exist in the early embryonic heart and that fluid surface stresses change significantly with anomalous alterations in fetal heart lumen shape. Stages 10 and 11 early human embryo hearts were digitized as calibrated two-dimensional (2 D) cross-sectional sequential images. A 3 D surface was constructed from the stacking of these 2 D images. CFD flow solutions were obtained (steady and pulsatile flow). Particle traces were placed in the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>portions</b> of these two stages. Sections of the embryonic heart were artificially reshaped. CFD flow solutions were obtained and surface stress changes analyzed.

Shear stress changes (stage 10) occur in the altered lumens. Streaming exists in steady and pulsatile flow scenarios in the embryonic heart models.

Methods Thirty hearts with EA were studied. The alterations of each portions of the RV were described. Fifty adult patients with this anomaly were studied by echocardiography. Results Anatomy: All hearts had atrial situs solitus, 27 had concordant atrioventricular connection and 3 discordant, of these 2 had transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and one double outlet right ventricle (DORV). The degree of tricuspid valve (TV) displacement showed a spectrum from I to III. The inlet of the RV was markedly thin in 27. The trabecular portion had multiples muscular bands in all. The <b>outlet</b> <b>portion</b> was dilated in 20 and stenotic in 5. In 25 atrial septal defects were found. Echocardiography: All patients had atrial situs solitus, 42 with concordant atrioventricular connection and 8 with discordant, of these last patients 5 had TGA and 3 DORV. The degree of TV displacement varied from I to III. The inlet of RV was markedly thin in 42. The trabecular portion had muscular bands in 45. The <b>outlet</b> <b>portion</b> was dilated in 31 and stenotic in 11. In 30 atrial septal defects were found.

40|$|The normal left {{ventricle}} comprises an inlet, apical trabecular, and an <b>outlet</b> <b>portion</b> although these portions {{do not have}} discrete anatomical borders.

Transmurally through the ventricular wall, the myoarchitecture has a typical arrangement of myocardial strands that change orientation from being oblique in the subepicardium to circumferen-tial in the middle and to longitudinal in the subendocardium.

40|$|A {{striking}} {{example of}} the relationship between regulation of transcription and phenotype is the central role of the Y-chromosomal gene Sry in mammalian sex determination. Sry is the founding member of a large family of so-called Sox genes. During murine embryogenesis, the transcriptional activator Sox- 4 is expressed at several sites, but in adult mice expression is restricted to immature B and T lymphocytes. Using targeted gene distruption, we have found that SOX- 4 (-/-) embryos succumb to circulatory failure at day E 14. This was a result of impaired development of the endocardial ridges (a specific site of Sox- 4 expression) into the semilunar valves and the <b>outlet</b> <b>portion</b> of the muscular ventricular septum. The observed range of septation defects is known as 'common arterial trunk' in man. We studied haemopoiesis in lethally irradiated mice reconstituted with SOX- 4 (-/-) fetal liver cells and found that a specific block occurred in B-cell development at the pro-B cell stage.

40|$|Heart {{morphogenesis}} comprises 2 major consecutive steps, viz. chamber formation {{followed by}} septation. Septation is the remodeling {{of the heart}} from a single-channel peristaltic pump to a dual-channel, synchronously contracting device with 1 -way valves. In the human heart, septation occurs between 4 and 7 weeks of development. Cardiac looping and chamber formation bring the contributing structures into position to engage in septation. Cardiomyocytes that participate in chamber formation do not materially contribute to septation. The (re) discovery {{of the role of}} extracardiac mesenchymal tissue in atrioventricular septation, the appreciation that the formation of the right atrioventricular connection is more than a mere rightward expansion of the atrioventricular canal, the awareness that myocardium originating from the so-called anterior heart field regresses after its function as outflow-tract sphincter ceases, and the recent finding that the myocardialized proximal portion of the outflow-tract septum becomes the supraventricular crest have all significantly enhanced our understanding of the morphogenetic processes that contribute to septation.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} Navier-Stokes solver {{developed for}} {{detailed study of}} wave rotor flow dynamics is described. The CFD model is helping characterize important loss mechanisms within the wave rotor. The wave rotor stationary ports and the moving rotor passages are resolved on multiple computational grid blocks. The finite-volume form of the thin-layer Navier-Stokes equations with laminar viscosity are integrated in time using a four-stage Runge-Kutta scheme. The Roe approximate Riemann solution scheme or the computationally less expensive Advection Upstream Splitting Method (AUSM) flux-splitting scheme are used to effect upwind-differencing of the inviscid flux terms, using cell interface primitive variables set by MUSCL-type interpolation. The diffusion terms are central-differenced. The solver is validated using a steady shock/laminar boundary layer interaction problem and an unsteady, inviscid wave rotor passage gradual opening problem. A model inlet port/passage charging problem is simulated and key features of the unsteady wave rotor flow field are identified. Lastly, the medium pressure inlet port and high pressure <b>outlet</b> port <b>portion</b> of the NASA Lewis Research Center experimental divider cycle is simulated and computed results are compared with experimental measurements.

Deforestation leads to ongoing gully erosion during the rainy season (June to September) and thus the hydrology of a watershed changes as dense gully networks cause direct drainage of rain water. To better understand watershed scale gully processes in the Ethiopian Highlands, three gauging stations were installed in the 56 km 2 large Gumara-Maksegnit catchment in the northern Amhara region, to monitor discharge and sediment load in the gullies during rainy season. Various weirs respectively a fixed cross section was installed: Two v-notched weirs were built in two approximately 30 ha large sub catchments. Discharge was determined based on continuously logged water level data (ultrasonic sensor respectively pressure sensor) and using a calibrated weir equation. Sediment concentration was estimated based on continuously logged turbidity sensor data. In the main outlet discharge was calculated based on water level data (pressure sensor) and by using a calibrated rating curve which was derived by means of spatial distributed flow velocity measurements within the fixed and rectangular shaped cross section. Sediment concentration was estimated by turbidity sensor equipment. To validate the continuously logged turbidity sensors data additional manually taken runoff samples were used. Additionally, rainfall data was logged at three gauging stations distributed in the watershed. Observed data from the rainy season 2012 showed that the runoff in the sub catchments {{as well as in the}} main outlet was mainly controlled by heavy single storm events. Although baseflow and interflow was observed in the main <b>outlet,</b> the <b>portion</b> of surface runoff dominated the runoff in the gully.

The constructed wetland, built near the town of Mystic, Southern Quebec, consists of a sedimentation basin, a sinuous subsurface horizontal flow section and an open water body or pond that continuously receives up to 5 % of Walbridge Creek. Flow into and through the system is controlled by gravity. There is a gate on the intake structure, which allows inflow into the wetland to be adjusted, along with three composite weirs; located at the outlet of each section of the wetland. Water samples were analyzed for orthophosphates (PO 4), dissolved phosphorus (DP), total phosphorus (TP), ammonium (NH 4 +) and nitrates (NO 3 -) The study occurred from May to December 2003 and from May to December 2004. In 2003, there was a 33. 6 % reduction in TP load from intake to outlet with a retention rate of 2. 23 g m- 2 year- 1. The greatest reduction in TP load during 2003 took place during the summer months (32. 2 %). In 2004, there was a further reduction of 42. 8 % in TP load from intake to outlet with a retention rate of 1. 56 g m- 2 year- 1 compared to 2003. The largest reduction in TP load during the operational year of 2004 took place during the summer months (43. 7 %). Within the wetland, both the submerged flow section and open water basin showed similar and significant reductions of TP load in 2003 and 2004 annually and seasonally.

In 2004, there was a 22 % annual load reduction from intake to outlet with a retention rate of 43. 9 g m- 2 year- 1. The largest reduction in NO 3 - load during 2004 took place during the summer months (25. 6 %). Within the wetland, the submerged flow section showed the greatest reduction in NO 3 - concentrations annually and during the summer months of 2004. These results confirm the range of treatment efficiencies that can be achieved using a constructed wetland for NPS pollution in a Nordic climate...|$|R
