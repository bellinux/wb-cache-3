5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet,</b> and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E

25|$|Yet the dynasty rallied. Chinese {{generals and}} {{officials}} such as Zuo Zongtang led {{the suppression of}} rebellions and stood behind the Manchus. When the Tongzhi Emperor came to the throne {{at the age of}} five in 1861, these officials rallied around him in what was called the Tongzhi Restoration. Their aim was to adopt western military technology in order to preserve Confucian values. Zeng Guofan, in alliance with Prince Gong, sponsored the rise of younger officials such as Li Hongzhang, who put the dynasty back <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> financially and instituted the Self-Strengthening Movement. The reformers then proceeded with institutional reforms, including China's first unified ministry of foreign affairs, the Zongli Yamen; allowing foreign diplomats to reside in the capital; establishment of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service; the formation of modernized armies, such as the Beiyang Army, as well as a navy; and the purchase from Europeans of armament factories.|$|E
50|$|The eastern long-beaked echidna can be {{distinguished}} from {{other members of the}} genus by the number of claws on the fore and hind feet: it has five claws <b>on</b> <b>its</b> fore <b>feet</b> and four <b>on</b> <b>its</b> hind <b>feet.</b> Its weight varies from 5 to 10 kg; its body length ranges from 60 to 100 cm; it has no tail.

50|$|In 1965, the {{skeleton}} of an animal probably {{closely related to the}} trackmaker of Chirotherium was found, called Ticinosuchus. It had the external toe <b>on</b> <b>its</b> hind <b>feet</b> but not <b>on</b> <b>its</b> front <b>feet</b> and was possibly a more derived descendant, whose gait did not require a stabilizing front toe. Footprints of different size and proportions occurring together on one and the same bedding plane probably reflect a gender difference (sexual dimorphism) within the trackmaker species.|$|R
25|$|Cadbury {{has enjoyed}} a {{substantial}} fan base in India. The Dairy Milk primarily is a huge success. Initially, the company had appointed Amithabh Bhachan as the brand ambassador in 2004. However the brand soon faced a significant backlash with worms being spotted in the chocolate bars. With its new campaigns however the company did get back <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet.</b> Cadbury {{is known for its}} marketing campaigns in India that have known to instill a sense of playfulness and innocence with its campaigns. One campaign that promoted the product by using the country's love for cricket was very successful. The ad is noted to be the best advertisement made in India by the Times of India. Another famous campaign hosted by the company in the past was the 'Shubh Aarambh' Campaign. This campaign made use of the traditional practice of Indian households of having something sweet before every auspicious occasion. It is a traditional belief that this leads to a favourable outcome for the people. This campaign was also a huge hit and positioned Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolates as part of a family name. Cadbury today holds 70% of the market share of the chocolate industry in the country.|$|E

I am {{well aware that}} this may seem incredible to the reader, but nevertheless I insert it in my veracious work because it is true: This banner was woven of the cleanest and whitest silk and no picture of any figures was found on it. In case of war, however, a raven was always to be seen, {{as if it were}} woven into it. If the Danes were going to win the battle, the raven appeared, beak wide open, flapping its wings and restless <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet.</b> If {{they were going to be}} defeated, the raven did not stir at all, and its limbs hung motionless.|$|E

500|$|The {{gestation}} period is about {{eight and a}} half months and between 80 and 90% of the calves are born within a three-week time period. Female wildebeest give birth {{in the middle of a}} herd rather than alone, and typically in the middle of the day. This allows time for the newborn to become steady <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> before night falls and the predators become more active. Calves weigh about [...] at birth, and can usually stand on their own within a few minutes of birth. To escape predation, calves remain close to their mothers for a significant time, and may continue suckling until the next year's calf is nearly due. Some calves leave their mother at about eight months and form herds with other juveniles. In large female herds, 80% of the wildebeest offspring survive the first month, compared to a 50% survival rate in smaller herds.|$|E
500|$|The cavalry {{attack against}} {{fortified}} positions had failed.

[...] Despite the apparent futility, the Prussian infantry repeatedly attacked the Spitzberge, each time with greater losses; the 37th Infantry lost 992 men and 16 officers, more than 90 percent of its force. The King himself led two attacks of the 35th Infantry, and lost two of his horses in the effort. [...] He was mounting a third when the animal was shot in the neck and fell to the ground, nearly crushing the King. [...] Two of Frederick's adjutants pulled him from under the horse as it fell. A ball smashed the gold snuff box in his coat, and this box, plus his heavy coat, probably saved his life.|$|E
500|$|Spies {{canceled}} {{their contract}} with Trans Polar on 21 May 1971. Simon Spies {{stated that they}} had been [...] "endlessly generous" [...] towards the Norwegian airline, and that they had suffered numerous delays ultimately caused by the airline's financial shortcomings. Conair had taken delivery of five equivalent aircraft and the company was therefore able to operate its own flights. Trans Polar had plans to quickly return to operations: the two remaining aircraft would be returned to Aer Lingus and three new aircraft would be purchased. This would be financed through conversion of debt to share capital and new investments from various shipping companies. Borgen emphasized that the market price for leasing aircraft had fallen and that the airline therefore could operate at a lower cost with new leasing contract. Once the airline was back <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>feet,</b> he believed Spies would return as a customer. Trans Polar informed its remaining customers on 22 May that it would terminate its flights.|$|E

500|$|The Frieze of the Dream Lords (also {{known as}} the Frieze of the Four Suns or Frieze of the Four Eras) was {{uncovered}} by archaeologists during excavations in 1992.

It represents a complex supernatural scene divided into four by a feather-covered scaffold from which hang the severed heads of sacrificial victims.
