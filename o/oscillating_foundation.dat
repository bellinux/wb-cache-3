40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to test the response of an <b>oscillating</b> <b>foundation</b> platform, which is positioned on soil and submerged by water. The oscillating platform is modeled as a linear spring-damper-mass oscillator with two perpendicular degrees of freedom. The platform is mounted so it can rotate around the directions corresponding to its main bending axis. A specially designed flume, which is 3000 mm long and 400 mm wide, allows for the investigation of different soil conditions and various flow depths. The oscillating platform is mounted elastically on a structure over the test section of the flume. Three synchronous linear drive motors apply the dynamic loads. Complex plane representation of the dynamic moments is used to identify the nonlinear fluid and soil moments. Additional goals are to detect the nonlinear fluid and soil coupling moments...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{efficient}} method {{to study the}} (two-dimensional) in-plane nonstationary (transient) problem for a rigid rectangular structure above the <b>oscillating</b> <b>foundation.</b> A massive structure is perfectly coupled with the foundation, whose oscillations are caused by an oblique plane seismic wave incoming from below to the boundary surface. The structure {{is assumed to be}} considerably more rigid than the foundation. The mathematical formulation admits application of the Laplace transform over time and Fourier transform along the horizontal coordinate. By satisfying the boundary conditions over the contact zone between the rectangle and the foundation, the problem is reduced to a system of two integral equations for normal and tangential contact stress, which contain the Laplace parameter. To solve this system, we apply a numerical method to arising Volterra`–Fredholm integral equations. Then the dynamic properties of the structure is studied for various combinations of physical and geometrical parameters...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we study an anti-plane nonstationary (transient) problem for a massive {{structure}} above the <b>oscillating</b> <b>foundation.</b> The latter is taken as an elastic half-space with an oblique plane seismic wave incoming from below to the boundary surface. The structure {{is assumed to be}} considerably more rigid than the foundation. The analytical treatment is achieved by applying the Laplace transform over time. After that the solution in the half-space is constructed by using the Fourier transform along the horizontal coordinate. By satisfying the joining boundary conditions between the rectangle and the foundation, the problem is reduced to an integral equation along the contact zone, which contains the Laplace parameter. We propose a new numerical approach to solve the dual Volterrà-Fredholm integral equations of the arising type. Then we investigate the dynamic properties of the structure for various combinations of physical and geometric parameters...|$|E
