5|$|The Skyfleet S570 {{aircraft}} in the film was an ex-British Airways 747-200B G-BDXJ which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner. The plane used {{can be seen on}} the BBC motoring programme Top Gear on the Test Track.|$|E
25|$|The {{powerplant}} {{arrangements were}} unorthodox, {{with the two}} <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> housed inside the fuselage, each driving a pusher propeller via shafts and bevel gearboxes, and a central pusher engine in a nacelle between the wings.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{shutdown}} procedure was {{changed for the}} launch of Skylab to avoid damage to the Apollo Telescope Mount. Rather than shutting down all four <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> at once, they were shut down {{two at a time}} with a delay to reduce peak acceleration further.|$|E

25|$|Yanmar of Japan {{produced}} some small, charge-cooled rotor engines for chainsaws and <b>outboard</b> <b>engines.</b> One {{of its products}} is the LDR (rotor recess in {{the leading edge of}} combustion chamber) engine, which has better exhaust emissions profiles, and reed-valve controlled intake ports, which improve part-load and low rpm performance.|$|E
25|$|Early on, the {{decision}} to adopt four engines for a feeder airliner rather than two was viewed as atypical by some commentators. Advantages of adopting the four engine configuration include greater redundancy and superior takeoff performance from short runways, {{as well as in}} hot and high conditions. Electrical power is primarily provided by generators located on each of the <b>outboard</b> <b>engines.</b> For ease of maintenance and reduced operator costs, the ALF 502 is of a modular design and makes minimum use of specialist tooling.|$|E
25|$|The American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (sometimes {{abbreviated}} as AHM) is a North American {{subsidiary of}} the Honda Motor Company, Ltd. It was founded in 1959. The company combines product sales, service and coordinating functions of Honda in North America, and is responsible for distribution, marketing and sales of Honda and Acura brand automobiles, Honda power sports products, including motorcycles, scooters and all-terrain vehicles, and Honda power equipment products, including lawnmowers, tillers, string trimmers, snow blowers, generators, small displacement general-purpose engines and marine <b>outboard</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|E

25|$|Saltwater {{fishing boats}} vary widely {{in size and}} can be {{specialized}} for certain species of fish. Flounder boats, for example, have flat bottoms for a shallow draft and are used in protected, shallow waters. Sport fishing boats range from 25 to 80 feet or more, and can be powered by large <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> or inboard diesels. Boats used for fishing in cold climates may have space dedicated to a cuddy cabin or enclosed wheelhouse, while boats in warmer climates {{are more likely to}} be open.|$|E
25|$|At 2340 GMT, {{when the}} DC-4 was {{cruising}} at 9,000ft and roughly 10 {{miles east of}} the international air corridor line off Hainan Island and only 31 minutes from Hong Kong, two Lavochkin La-11 fighters (of the 85th Fighter Regiment, People's Liberation Army Air Force), appeared behind VR-HEU, one above it on the DC-4's starboard rear side and the other on its port side. At approximately 2344 GMT, the fighters opened fire and the two <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> (numbers 1 and 4) were hit and caught fire. The number 4 engine's auxiliary and main fuel tanks were also ablaze.|$|E
25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E

50|$|At 23:09, as the {{aircraft}} was on course to the Trinidad Intersection, {{the left wing}} and number one (left <b>outboard)</b> <b>engine</b> separated from {{the aircraft}}. Pieces of the wing, blown back by the wind-blast, struck and dislodged the horizontal stabilizer. The right wing's planking then broke away and the number four (right <b>outboard)</b> <b>engine</b> tore away. The right wing outboard of the number four engine broke away as well, causing structural damage to the fuselage and triggering {{the breakup of the}} aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The Rs.I was {{completed}} by October 1915 and rolled out at Seemos for trials. On 23 October, during a taxi test, the port propeller and/or gearbox parted company with the aircraft, causing damage to the gearbox mountings and the upper wing. The opportunity was taken to move the <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> into nacelles identical to that of centre engine, and mount them between the wings on an independent structure with catwalks to enable engineers to attend to engines in flight. This gave much better clearance from spray for the propellers, which was probably {{the cause of the}} port gearbox/propeller failure. Taxiing trials recommenced, but with little success. On 21 December 1915 a Foehn wind blew up during trials. Unable to beach the giant flying boat, attempts were made to ride out the storm on the lake, but the moorings gave and the Rs.I was dashed to pieces on the lakeside rocks.|$|E
500|$|In October 1918, she {{was sold}} to the Belgian firm of Lloyd Royal Belge (LRB) and {{converted}} to a freighter under the name Péruvier by Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde. A conventional bow was built up over her pseudo-ram and the space was used to accommodate her crew. The two <b>outboard</b> <b>engines,</b> their associated boilers and propeller shafts were removed as were the two forward funnels. The ship's side and deck armour was removed wherever it did not compromise structural strength. Péruvier was delivered in December 1919 and she began her first voyage carrying [...] of coal from Cardiff to Rio de Janeiro on 20 January 1920. Engine repairs {{had to be made}} at Falmouth the next day and were not completed until 14 February. Her engine broke down again in the mid-Atlantic and she was towed to Las Palmas by a Spanish merchantman. Arriving there on 20 March, she was towed by another LRB ship to Pernambuco. After her arrival there on 1 June, the coal in her No. 3 hold was found to be on fire. This was not extinguished until 19 June and the ship remained in harbour until 14 October. Péruvier was towed to Antwerp, arriving on 18 November, and lay idle there until she was sold for scrap. On 4 March 1923, she was towed to the shipbreakers in Flushing.|$|E
2500|$|According to the FAO, {{at the end}} of 2004, {{the world}} fishing fleet {{consisted}} of about 4 million vessels, of which 2.7 million were undecked (open) boats. While nearly [...] all decked vessels were mechanized, only one-third of the undecked fishing boats were powered, usually with <b>outboard</b> <b>engines.</b> The remaining 1.8 million boats were traditional craft of various types, operated by sail and oars.|$|E
50|$|The {{critical}} engine of a multi-engine, fixed-wing aircraft is the engine {{a failure of}} which would most adversely affect the performance or handling abilities of an aircraft(§1.1). On propeller aircraft, {{there is a difference}} in the remaining yawing moments after failure of the left or the right (<b>outboard)</b> <b>engine</b> when all propellers rotate in the same direction due to the P-factor. On turbojet/turbofan aircraft, there usually is no difference between the yawing moments after failure of a left or right (<b>outboard)</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1916, Egnell {{bought the}} company and the name changed to AB Pentaverken. Production was {{concentrated}} on engines, mostly for maritime applications. The years immediately after World War I were economically harsh, but a new product was introduced: a small two cylinder U2 <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> designed by Carl-Axel Skärlund. The U2 was slightly improved in 1926, and renamed U21 and remained in production until 1962. The U2/U21 was a great success and exported worldwide. In many countries, U21 is still synonymous with <b>outboard</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ideally, {{the length}} of the painter should be no longer than {{the length of}} the boat, {{especially}} on small craft, to prevent fouling the propeller of an <b>outboard</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
2500|$|When {{oxidizer}} or fuel depletion was sensed in the suction assemblies, {{the remaining}} four <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> were shut down. First stage separation occurred {{a little less than}} one second after this to allow for F-1 thrust tail-off. Eight small solid fuel separation motors backed the S-IC {{from the rest of the}} vehicle at an altitude of about [...] The first stage continued ballistically to an altitude of about [...] and then fell in the Atlantic Ocean about [...] downrange.|$|E
2500|$|Aircraft {{with four}} or more engines have not only a VMCA (often called VMCA1 under these circumstances), where the {{critical}} engine alone is inoperative, but also a VMCA2 that applies when the engine inboard of the critical engine, on the same wing, is also inoperative. Civil aviation regulations (FAR, CS and equivalent) no longer require a VMCA2 to be determined, [...] although it is still required for military aircraft with {{four or more}} engines. On turbojet and turbofan aircraft, the <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> are usually equally critical. Three-engine aircraft such as the MD-11 and BN-2 Trislander {{do not have a}} VMCA2; a failed centerline engine has no effect on VMC.|$|E
2500|$|The wing was of NACA 23018 {{section at}} the root, {{and was a}} five-piece, all-metal, {{twin-spar}} structure. The untapered centre section carried the inboard engines and main undercarriage, while {{the inner and outer}} sections were tapered on their leading and trailing edges, with the inner sections carrying the <b>outboard</b> <b>engines.</b> The ailerons were fitted with trim and balance tabs, and there were hydraulically operated split flaps in three sections {{on each side of the}} trailing edges of the centre section and inner wings. A [...] fuel capacity was given by eight bag tanks, one on either side of the fuselage in the centre section and three in both inner wings.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the 10-foot model gave the {{appearance}} of a racing boat with extremely shallow V-hull. Power was exclusively <b>outboard</b> <b>engine.</b> Seating was either a bench seat or 2 bucket seats.|$|R
25|$|On 8 February 2005, {{on board}} an Airbus A340-600 {{aircraft}} (G-VATL) {{en route from}} Hong Kong to Heathrow, the fuel control computer system caused a loss of automatic fuel transfer between tanks. The left <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> lost power, and shortly afterwards the right <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> also began to falter until the crew began to crossfeed fuel manually. The crew diverted to Amsterdam and landed safely. The interim accident report made four safety recommendations addressed to the primary certification bodies for large transport category aircraft (EASA and the FAA), advising {{on the need for}} a low-fuel warning system for large aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Because of Bessie's poor health, the Evinrudes {{sold their}} company in 1913, and Ole agreed to not {{re-enter}} the outboard motor business for five years. His inventive mind kept busy, however, and during his [...] "retirement", he devised a much-improved, two-cylinder <b>outboard</b> <b>engine.</b> In 1921 he and Bessie formed the ELTO Outboard Motor Company (ELTO standing for Evinrude's Light Twin Outboard). This new <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> {{was also very}} successful, and in 1929 the ELTO company merged with the original Evinrude company (since renamed the Outboard Marine Corporation) and the Lockwood Motor Company, with Evinrude the president of this new company.|$|R
2500|$|Traditionally, many {{different}} kinds of boats have been used as fishing boats to catch fish in the sea, or on a lake or river. Even today, many traditional fishing boats are still in use. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), at the end of 2004, the world fishing fleet consisted of about 4 million vessels, of which 2.7 million were undecked (open) boats. While nearly [...] all decked vessels were mechanised, only one-third of the undecked fishing boats were powered, usually with <b>outboard</b> <b>engines.</b> The remaining 1.8 million boats were traditional craft of various types, operated by sail and oars.|$|E
2500|$|The little {{flying boat}} had a {{conventional}} stepped hull and was stabilized {{on the water}} {{by a pair of}} floats, attached under the [...] <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> and retracting into their cowlings. Its enclosed, tandem seat cockpit was shaped to reproduced the form of the 161's nose, though the full sized aircraft had proportionally shorter glazing. [...] The 161 had a twin fin empennage with a N-strut braced, parallel chord tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage on a short pillar with marked dihedral. [...] The fins were of the endplate type, with curved leading edges and roughly symmetric above and below the tailplane; on each, the rudder was split into an upper and lower part. All of these features appeared on the final, full size airliner.|$|E
2500|$|The Potez XVIII airliner, {{displayed}} at the 1922 Paris Salon, was a development of the Potez X colonial transport. It was an unequal span biplane largely built of wood, though with metal engines mountings and other fittings, engine nacelles and tail surfaces. [...] The rectangular plan wings were fabric covered. [...] On each side, towards the wing tips a parallel pair of interplane struts leaned outwards. [...] Closer to the fuselage a parallel pair of V-form interplane struts formed a cradle for the <b>outboard</b> <b>engines,</b> mounted between the wings. [...] These, and the third in the nose, were Lorraine 8Bds, water-cooled V-8 engines, each producing cooled by cylindrical radiators hung beneath each engine nacelle. Ailerons with aerodynamic balances extending past the wing-tips were fitted on the lower wing only.|$|E
