5|$|The {{absolute}} monarch <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City, the Pope, {{is elected}} by the College of Cardinals. The current ruler is Pope Francis.|$|E
5|$|The pope is also Sovereign <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City, a small {{city-state}} entirely enclaved {{within the}} city of Rome, which is an entity distinct from the Holy See. It is {{as head of the}} Holy See, not as head <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City State, that the pope receives ambassadors of states and sends them his own diplomatic representatives. The Holy See also confers orders, decorations and medals, such as the orders of chivalry in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|This rule of {{tincture}} {{is often}} broken in clerical arms: {{the flag and}} arms <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City notably have yellow (gold) and white (silver) placed together. In Byzantine tradition, colors have a mystical interpretation. Because gold and silver express sublimity and solemnity, {{combinations of the two}} are often used regardless of the rule of tincture.|$|E
50|$|The current Prefect <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Apostolic Library is Monsignor Cesare Pasini (who is {{also the}} Director <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> School <b>of</b> Library Science). The Vice Prefect <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Apostolic Library is Doctor Ambrogio M. Piazzoni. The Prefect <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Secret Archives is a Barnabite Bishop {{by the name of}} Sergio Pagano. The Vice Prefect <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Secret Archives is Father Marcel Chappin, S.J. The Archives also is {{responsible}} for the <b>Vatican</b> School <b>of</b> Paleography.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> II, an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world. Benedict resigned due to advanced age in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly six hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The Papal Tiara or triregnum is the three-tiered crown {{used by the}} Pope as a {{sovereign}} power. It is first found as an independent emblem in the 13th century, though at that time with only one coronet. In the 15th century, the tiara was combined with the keys above the papal shield. The tiara and keys together within a shield form the arms <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City. In heraldry, the white tiara is depicted with a bulbous shape and with two attached red strips called lappets or infulae. The coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI sparked controversy by displaying a mitre and pallium instead of the customary tiara.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn was {{considered}} the most secular of the four Ngô brothers who controlled Vietnam's domestic affairs. With the appointment of elder brother Thục as the Archbishop of Huế in 1961, Cẩn became less influential as Thục aggressively blurred the distinction between church and state. In early 1963, Nhu sent an emissary from Saigon telling Cẩn to retire and leave for Japan. Unrest erupted {{in the summer of}} 1963. After the flying <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> flags was permitted at a celebration for the anniversary of Thục's consecration as a bishop, the flying of Buddhist flags on 8 May to commemorate Vesak — the birth of Gautama Buddha — was banned. Cẩn's subordinates ordered government forces to fire on the unarmed Buddhist crowd protesting the ban, killing nine. Cẩn believed the United States, whose relations with South Vietnam had become strained, caused an explosion during the Vesak shootings, to destabilise his family's regime.|$|E
50|$|Jorge María Mejía, 91, Argentine Roman Catholic prelate, cardinal, Archivist <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Secret Archives (1998-2003), Librarian <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Library (1998-2003).|$|R

50|$|In 1917, he was {{appointed}} Archivist <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Secret Archives. In 1924, he {{was appointed}} Librarian <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Library and elevated to Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria in Portico.|$|R
5|$|Italy, {{being one}} of Catholicism's seminal nations, {{has a long history}} of music for the Roman Catholic Church. Until {{approximately}} 1800, it was possible to hear Gregorian Chant and Renaissance polyphony, such as the music of Palestrina, Lassus, Anerio, and others. Approximately 1800 to approximately 1900 was a century during which a more popular, operatic, and entertaining type of church music was heard, to the exclusion of the aforementioned chant and polyphony. In the late 19th century, the Cecilian Movement was started by musicians who fought to restore this music. This movement gained impetus not in Italy but in Germany, particularly in Regensburg. The movement reached its apex around 1900 with the ascent of Don Lorenzo Perosi and his supporter (and future saint), Pope Pius X. The advent <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> II, however, nearly obliterated all Latin-language music from the Church, once again substituting it with a more popular style.|$|E
5|$|The red {{and gold}} striped ombrellino or {{pavilion}} was originally a processional canopy or sunshade {{and can be found}} so depicted as early as the 12th century. The earliest use of the ombrellino in heraldry is in the 1420s when it was placed above the shield of Pope Martin V. It is more commonly used together with the keys, a combination first found under Pope Alexander VI. This combined badge represents the temporal power <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City between Papal reigns, when the acting head of state is the cardinal Camerlengo. The badge first appeared with a cardinal's personal arms on coins minted by order of the Camerlengo, Cardinal Armellini, during the inter-regnum of 1521. During the 17th and 18th centuries, it appeared on coins minted sede vacante by papal legates, and on coins minted in 1746 and 1771 while a pope reigned. The ombrellino appears in the arms of basilicas since the 16th century, with ornamentation for major basilicas. If found in a family's coat of arms, it indicates that a relative had been pope.|$|E
25|$|The {{coat of arms}} of the Holy See {{and that}} <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City also use this papal emblem. The arms of the Holy See are blazoned: gules, two keys in saltire or and argent, {{interlacing}} in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or. This means: on a red field are placed two keys, crossed as in the letter X, one gold, the other silver, bound by a gold cord placed through the rings, and, above the keys, a silver (white-coloured) tiara with gold (yellow-coloured) crowns. The arms <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City are identical, except that the gold and silver keys are reversed and the cord is red ("gules") and interlaced {{at the intersection of}} the two keys, as illustrated in Appendix B of the Fundamental Law <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City State, 7 June 1929.|$|E
50|$|In September 2016, the High Authority <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> {{approved}} {{the creation of}} Donne in Vaticano, the first women-only association <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican.</b> The members <b>of</b> the association are journalists, theologists, and economists.|$|R

50|$|He was {{appointed}} Vice-Prefect <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Secret Archives by Pope John Paul II on 30 January 1995, {{and a few}} days later he {{was appointed}} Vice-Director <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> School <b>of</b> Paleography, Diplomatics and Archives Administration.|$|R
25|$|Marian devotions {{were the}} {{hallmark}} of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II and he reoriented the Catholic Church towards the renewal of Marian veneration. In March 1987 he went further than Paul VI in extending the Catholic views on Mary beyond Vatican II by issuing the encyclical Redemptoris Mater. Rather than being just a new presentation of the Marian views <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> II, Redemptoris Mater was in many aspects a re-reading, re-interpretation and further extension of the teachings <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> II.|$|E
25|$|The {{yellow and}} white flag <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City also {{makes use of}} this emblem on the right hand side in the white half of the flag. The yellow and white colours were first adopted in 1808 as {{the flag of the}} {{personal}} guard of Pius VII, when the other forces of what had been the Papal States were brought under Napoleon's control. The previous flag was red and gold, the traditional colours of the city of Rome. The 1808 flag was of course not that <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City, which did not come into existence until 1929.|$|E
25|$|The {{asteroid}} 8661 Ratzinger {{was named}} {{in his honor}} for the role he played in supervising the opening <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> archives in 1998 to researchers investigating judicial errors against Galileo and other medieval scientists. The name was proposed by the asteroid's first discoverers, L. D. Schmadel and F. Borngen at Tautenburg.|$|E
5000|$|He had {{performed}} important {{services for the}} diffusion of classical authors when Nicholas V, the true founder <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican</b> Library, became pope. He devoted fourteen years to collecting the library of Federico da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino, organizing it in a more modern manner; it contained the catalogues <b>of</b> the <b>Vatican,</b> <b>of</b> San Marco, Florence, of the Visconti Library at Pavia, and Oxford.|$|R

25|$|The {{college has}} no ruling power except during the sede vacante (papal vacancy) period, {{and even then}} its powers are {{extremely}} limited {{by the terms of}} the current law, which is laid down in the Apostolic constitution Universi Dominici gregis (1996) and the Fundamental Law <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City State.|$|E
25|$|The pope {{resides in}} Vatican City, an {{independent}} state within the city of Rome, {{set up by the}} 1929 Lateran Pacts between the Holy See and Italy. As popes were sovereigns of the papal states (754–1870), so do they exercise absolute civil authority in the microstate <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> City since 1929.|$|E
