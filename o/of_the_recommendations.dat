5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1974, the Army decided to {{implement}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendations</b> of the Howze Board and created an air cavalry combat brigade. The assets of the 2d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division were used to create the 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat).

The brigade served as a test bed for new concepts involving the employment of attack helicopters on the modern battlefield. In 1985-85, the brigade consisted of 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry; 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment (4-9 CAV); and 5th and 7th Squadrons, 17th Cavalry Regiment (5-17 CAV and 7-17 CAV), all flying attack helicopters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In 2001, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} exclusive breastfeeding for {{the first}} six months <b>of</b> life. <b>The</b> objectives <b>of</b> this study are to assess awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WHO <b>recommendation</b> among first-time mothers (women at 24 to 34 weeks of pregnancy) and to explore the relationship between this awareness and mothers' intention to exclusively breastfeed for six months. Methods This study was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Healthy Beginnings Trial (HBT) conducted in southwest Sydney, Australia. We analysed cross-sectional baseline data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial conducted in 2008, including 409 first-time mothers at 24 to 34 weeks <b>of</b> pregnancy. <b>The</b> mothers' awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recommended duration <b>of</b> exclusive breastfeeding and their intention to meet <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> were assessed through face-to-face interviews. Socio-demographic data were also collected. Factors associated with awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation,</b> or <b>the</b> intention to meet <b>the</b> <b>recommendation,</b> were determined by logistic regression modeling. Log-binomial regression was used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (ARR). Results Sixty-one per cent <b>of</b> mothers knew <b>the</b> WHO <b>recommendation</b> <b>of</b> exclusive breastfeeding for six months. Only 42 % of all mothers intended to meet <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> (breastfeed exclusively for six months). Among the mothers who knew <b>the</b> <b>recommendation,</b> 61 % intended to meet <b>the</b> <b>recommendation,</b> compared to only 11 % among those mothers who were not aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation.</b> <b>The</b> only factor associated with awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> was mother's level of education. Mothers who had a tertiary education were 1. 5 times more likely to be aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> than those who had school certificate or less (ARR adjusted for age 1. 45, 95 % CI 1. 08, 1. 94, p = 0. 02). Mothers who were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> were 5. 6 times more likely to intend to breastfeed exclusively to six months (ARR adjusted for employment status 5. 61, 95 % CI 3. 53, 8. 90, p Conclusion Awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> to breastfeed exclusively for six months is independently associated with the intention to meet this recommendation. A substantial number of mothers were not aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation,</b> particularly among those with low levels of education, which is of concern in relation to promoting breastfeeding. Improving mothers' awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> could lead to increased maternal intention to exclusively breastfeed for six months. However, whether this intention could be transferred into practice remains to be tested.

5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and {{to begin the process}} of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendations.</b> Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we perform an {{analysis}} of probabilistic approaches to recommendation upon a different validation perspective, which focuses on accuracy metrics such as recall and precision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> list. Traditionally, state-of-art approches to <b>recommendations</b> consider <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> process from a “missing value prediction” perspective. This approach simplifies the model validation phase {{that is based on}} <b>the</b> minimization <b>of</b> standard error metrics such as RMSE. However, recent studies have pointed several limitations of this approach, showing that a lower RMSE does not necessarily imply improvements in terms of specific recommendations. We demonstrate that the underlying probabilistic framework offers several advantages over traditional methods, in terms <b>of</b> flexibility in <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> list and consequently in <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>recommendation...</b>|$|R
