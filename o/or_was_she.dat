2500|$|Since her death, many tributes {{have been}} made to Denny, both in music and elsewhere. Dave Pegg of Fairport Convention {{recorded}} the tribute [...] "Song for Sandy" [...] on his 1983 solo album The Cocktail Cowboy Goes It Alone. Dave Cousins of Strawbs wrote [...] "Ringing Down the Years" [...] in memory of Sandy Denny shortly after her death. Songs more specific to the death were Bert Jansch's [...] "Where Did My Life Go" [...] and Richard Thompson's [...] "Did She Jump <b>or</b> <b>Was</b> <b>She</b> Pushed?". Fellow Brit folk pioneers Spriguns changed the title of their 1978 album to Magic Lady after hearing of Denny's death while recording. In 1998, a variety of Daylily was named after her.|$|E
6000|$|I {{confess that}} Shakespeare {{has left the}} {{character}} of the Queen in an unpleasant perplexity. Was she, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> not, conscious of the fratricide? ...|$|E
5000|$|The calf's {{role in the}} {{painting}} is two-fold. First, it explains why the farmer {{has come to the}} city. But more importantly, its situation as [...] "an innocent animal trapped and on its way to be sold" [...] parallels the woman's and raises questions on the woman's state of mind. [...] "Is the prostitute rejecting salvation <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> accepting it; <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> repentant but unable to escape her fate, like the calf?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Where is Vesory’s chief {{taking her}} in the sports car—and why? Does she really love Versory <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> only using him? ...|$|R
6000|$|At last {{our patient}} stirred faintly, as in a dream; her breath faltered. We bent over her. Was it death, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{beginning}} to recover? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid Miss Ferguson {{has her own}} ideas." [...] Running through Hodder's mind, {{a troubled}} current, were certain {{memories}} connected with Mrs. Warren. Was she the divorced daughter, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> not? ...|$|E
6000|$|His Mother, too, no doubt, above [...] Her other Children him did love: [...] For, was she here, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> there, [...] She {{thought of}} him with {{constant}} care, [...] And more than Mother's love. [...] 30 ...|$|E
5000|$|Kerry in the Clouds: Kerry {{dreams of}} {{becoming}} an actress. But does she {{have what it takes}} <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> just a dreamer? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may be of}} some use, Miss Jillgall, if you stay," [...] {{my sister}} suggested. [...] "Eunice seems to <b>be</b> trembling. Is <b>she</b> angry, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> ill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No more thou com'st with lover's speed, [...] Thy once beloved bride to see; [...] But <b>be</b> <b>she</b> alive, <b>or</b> <b>be</b> <b>she</b> dead, [...] I fear, stern Earl, 's {{the same}} to thee.|$|R
60|$|She listened eagerly. Was it my fancy, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{indeed a}} little paler? Her {{eyes seemed to}} gleam with a strange {{softness}} in the twilight. Her head drooped a a little as she resumed her former thoughtful attitude.|$|E
60|$|Was she sad, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> really laughing? Rachel {{could not}} tell, {{and she felt}} for the moment very uncomfortable between Helen and Terence. Then she turned away, saying merely that she would go with Terence, on {{condition}} that he did all the talking.|$|E
6000|$|This was herself, then. Did {{she really}} justify her {{reputation}} for beauty, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> just a cult, the passing craze {{of a world}} a little weary of the ordinary standards? Or, again, was it only her art that had focused the admiration of the world upon her? ...|$|E
6000|$|But he only {{walked up}} and down the room, after <b>she</b> <b>was</b> gone, in unheedful distress. [...] "Gay times in America! Good heavens! Is the child utterly heartless, Celia, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> merely obtuse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|No more thou com'st with wonted speed, [...] Thy once beloved bride to see; [...] But <b>be</b> <b>she</b> alive, <b>or</b> <b>be</b> <b>she</b> dead, [...] I fear, stern Earl, 's {{the same}} to thee. [...] CUMNOR HALL, by WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{forgot to}} say," [...] she whispered, [...] "that {{all the windows}} in Miriam's room are open. Do you think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too sleepy to notice that, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> {{accustomed}} to so much night air?" ...|$|R
6000|$|As the {{question}} occurred to me, I saw her head move. She looked along the bridge, first {{on one side}} of her, then on the other. Was she waiting for some person who was to meet her? <b>Or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> suspicious of observation, and anxious to make sure that she was alone? ...|$|E
6000|$|And he failed. Was it the champagne? Was it Mary's sharp words {{which had}} ruffled him? Was {{it that he}} had not allowed enough time for the energy which came from him {{enabling}} her to appear before his mortal eyes, to gather afresh in the life-springs of his own nature? <b>Or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> also angry with him? ...|$|E
6000|$|Was Bathsheba {{altogether}} {{blind to}} the obvious fact that {{the support of a}} lover's arms is not of a kind best calculated to assist a resolve to renounce him? <b>Or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> sophistically sensible, with a thrill of pleasure, that by adopting this course for getting rid of him she was ensuring a meeting with him, at any rate, once more? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About Miss Vinrace," [...] he began,--"oh, look here, do let's be St. John and Helen, and Rachel and Terence--what's she like? Does she reason, does <b>she</b> feel, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> {{merely a}} kind of footstool?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And doos she set store by her uncle? <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> {{one of the}} flaunty {{sort that}} thinks more of herself and gownd than she does of her own flesh and blood? Can you tell me that, Zeph?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{any other}} time the imminence of this {{survival}} of a lawless barbarism {{of which he had}} heard so much would have impressed Courtland; now he was only interested in it on account of the inconceivable position in which it left Miss Sally. Had she {{anything to do with this}} baleful cousin's return, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> only to be a helpless victim of it? ...|$|E
6000|$|She was silent. What did {{her silence}} mean? Was she confused, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> still {{at a loss}} to {{understand}} him? That morbid sensitiveness, {{which was one of the}} most serious signs of his failing health, was by this time sufficiently irritated to hurry him into extremities. [...] "Did you ever hear," [...] he asked, [...] "of such a thing as love at first sight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|That first failure {{gave me a}} clue, however, as to {{the best}} way of {{applying}} Hilda's own methods. [...] "What would such a person do under the circumstances?" [...] that was her way of putting the question. Clearly, then, I must first decide what WERE the circumstances. Was Sebastian speaking the truth? Was Hilda Wade, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> not, the daughter of the supposed murderer, Dr. Yorke-Bannerman? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is she {{young and}} pretty {{and all that}} sort of thing, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> just a good sort with a {{sympathetic}} manner and nice eyes? As a rule that's the kind that goes with a lot of money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The weary time passes, {{and still}} {{there is no}} reply. Is Frances angry? <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> hesitating how to answer me--personally or by writing? No! she has too much {{delicacy}} of feeling to answer in her own person.|$|R
6000|$|Our hostess enters wreathed in smiles. Is {{she really}} {{pleased to see}} us, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> saying to herself, [...] "Drat the man! Why must he choose the very morning I had {{intended}} to fix up the clean curtains?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Agnes looked closer at her. She had not fainted. Her {{breathing}} was audible, {{rising and falling}} in deep heavy gasps. At intervals she ground her teeth savagely. Beads of perspiration stood thickly on her forehead. Her clenched hands rose and fell slowly {{from time to time}} on her lap. Was she in the agony of a dream? <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> spiritually conscious of something hidden in the room? ...|$|E
60|$|But what, in good sooth, {{had become}} of the Veiled Lady? Had all her {{existence}} been comprehended within that mysterious veil, and was she now annihilated? <b>Or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> a spirit, with a heavenly essence, but {{which might have been}} tamed down to human bliss, had Theodore been brave and true enough to claim her? Hearken, my sweet friends,--and hearken, dear Priscilla,--and you shall learn the little more that Zenobia can tell you.|$|E
6000|$|Feeling oddly {{detached}} from it all, Terence remembered how Helen {{had said that}} whenever anything happened to you this was how people behaved. Was she right, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> wrong? He was too little interested to frame an opinion of his own. He put things away in his mind, as if {{one of these days}} he would think about them, but not now. The mist of unreality had deepened and deepened until it had produced a feeling of numbness all over his body. Was it his body? Were those really his own hands? ...|$|E
5000|$|Ethel Bosinny - Ethel is Jane's tutor {{and comes}} {{from a long line}} of tutors to the Penvellyn Clan. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> very mysterious; her oh-so-charming {{demeanor}} has an edge that hints at something deeper. Is there something painful in her past, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> hiding a secret? ...|$|R
6000|$|He rose on a sudden, fierce {{return of}} self-mastery, {{and went to}} Mrs. Lambert's door and knocked, and when she opened to him demanded of her a full explanation. [...] "What is the matter? Is <b>she</b> sick <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> hatefully {{avoiding}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I think Peg Bowen is a witch? My dear Sara, what do YOU {{think of}} a woman who can turn herself into a black cat {{whenever}} she likes? Is <b>she</b> a witch? <b>Or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> not? I leave it to you." ...|$|R
