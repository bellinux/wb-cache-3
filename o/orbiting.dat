5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered <b>orbiting</b> the red dwarf Gliese 876. At {{the time of its}} discovery, the planet had the lowest mass of any known extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets <b>orbiting</b> PSR B1257+12. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.|$|E

25|$|The {{commonly}} used altitude classifications of geocentric <b>orbit</b> are Low Earth <b>orbit</b> (LEO), Medium Earth <b>orbit</b> (MEO) and High Earth <b>orbit</b> (HEO). Low Earth <b>orbit</b> is any <b>orbit</b> below 2,000 km. Medium Earth <b>orbit</b> is any <b>orbit</b> between 2,000 and 35,786km. High Earth <b>orbit</b> is any <b>orbit</b> higher than 35,786km.|$|R
50|$|A {{graveyard}} <b>orbit,</b> {{also called}} a junk <b>orbit</b> or disposal <b>orbit,</b> is an <b>orbit</b> that lies away from common operational <b>orbits,</b> typically a supersynchronous <b>orbit</b> well above synchronous <b>orbit.</b> Satellites are moved into such <b>orbits</b> {{at the end}} of their operational life to reduce the probability of colliding with operational spacecraft or generating space debris.|$|R

5|$|WASP-44, its {{recently}} discovered planet, the planets <b>orbiting</b> WASP-45 and WASP-46, and a discussion exploring {{the validity of}} the common assumption amongst scientists that closely <b>orbiting</b> Hot Jupiter planets have highly circular orbits unless proven otherwise, were reported in a single discovery paper that was published on May 17, 2011 by the Royal Astronomical Society. The paper was submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on May 16, 2011.|$|E
5|$|A {{search of}} this star by the Hubble Space Telescope {{revealed}} no stellar companions, although {{this does not}} preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet <b>orbiting</b> within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate {{the lack of a}} debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of this star using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise indicate the presence of an <b>orbiting</b> companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to detect the gravitational perturbations massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two <b>orbiting</b> bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two <b>orbiting</b> neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
25|$|Higher <b>orbits</b> include medium Earth <b>orbit</b> (MEO), {{sometimes}} called intermediate circular <b>orbit</b> (ICO), and further above, geostationary <b>orbit</b> (GEO). <b>Orbits</b> higher than low <b>orbit</b> {{can lead to}} early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation.|$|R
50|$|Nilpotent <b>orbits</b> form a {{partially}} ordered set: given two nilpotent <b>orbits,</b> O1 {{is less than}} or equal to O2 if O1 is contained in the Zariski closure of O2. This poset has a unique minimal element, zero <b>orbit,</b> and unique maximal element, the regular nilpotent <b>orbit,</b> but in general, it is not a graded poset. If the ground field is algebraically closed then the zero <b>orbit</b> is covered by a unique <b>orbit,</b> called the minimal <b>orbit,</b> and the regular <b>orbit</b> covers a unique <b>orbit,</b> called the subregular <b>orbit.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Both Geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> (GSO) and Geostationary <b>orbit</b> (GEO) are <b>orbits</b> around Earth {{matching}} Earth's sidereal rotation period. [...] All geosynchronous and geostationary <b>orbits</b> have a {{semi-major axis}} of [...] All geostationary <b>orbits</b> are also geosynchronous, {{but not all}} geosynchronous <b>orbits</b> are geostationary. A geostationary <b>orbit</b> stays exactly above the equator, whereas a geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> may swing north and south to cover more of the Earth's surface. Both complete one full <b>orbit</b> of Earth per sidereal day (relative to the stars, not the Sun).|$|R

5|$|Aries {{contains}} several {{stars with}} extrasolar planets. HIP 14810, a G5 type star, is orbited by three giant planets (those {{more than ten}} times the mass of Earth). HD 12661, like HIP 14810, is a G-type main sequence star, slightly larger than the Sun, with two <b>orbiting</b> planets. One planet is 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter, {{and the other is}} 1.57 times the mass of Jupiter. HD 20367 is a G0 type star, approximately the size of the Sun, with one <b>orbiting</b> planet. The planet, discovered in 2002, has a mass 1.07 times that of Jupiter and orbits every 500 days.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the {{measurement}} of the stellar wobble of nearby stars was used to detect large extrasolar planets <b>orbiting</b> those stars.|$|E
50|$|A super{{synchronous}} <b>orbit</b> {{is either}} an <b>orbit</b> with a period {{greater than that}} of a synchronous <b>orbit,</b> or just an <b>orbit</b> whose apsis (apogee {{in the case of the}} earth) is higher than that of a synchronous <b>orbit.</b> A synchronous <b>orbit</b> has a period equal to the rotational period of the body which contains the barycenter of the <b>orbit.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{specialized}} terms for synchronous <b>orbits</b> {{depending on the}} body <b>orbited.</b> The following {{are some of the}} more common ones. A synchronous <b>orbit</b> around Earth that is circular and lies in the equatorial plane is called a geostationary <b>orbit.</b> The more general case, when the <b>orbit</b> is inclined to Earth's equator or is non-circular is called a geosynchronous <b>orbit.</b> The corresponding terms for synchronous <b>orbits</b> around Mars are areostationary and areosynchronous <b>orbits.</b>|$|R

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{differs from}} classical mechanics {{in a number}} of predictions concerning <b>orbiting</b> bodies. It predicts an overall rotation (precession) of planetary orbits, as well as orbital decay caused by the emission of gravitational waves and effects related to the relativity of direction.|$|E
5|$|However, {{they are}} not thought to be {{favorable}} locations {{for the survival of}} planetary systems. Planetary orbits are dynamically unstable within the cores of dense clusters because of the perturbations of passing stars. A planet <b>orbiting</b> at 1 astronomical unit around a star that is within the core of a dense cluster such as 47 Tucanae would only survive on the order of 108 years. There is a planetary system <b>orbiting</b> a pulsar (PSR B1620−26) that belongs to the globular cluster M4, but these planets likely formed after the event that created the pulsar.|$|E

5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the <b>orbiting</b> body's closest {{approach}} to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the <b>orbiting</b> body as a test particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E

5|$|Launched in 1983, {{the space}} {{telescope}} IRAS detected infrared emissions from stars near to the Sun, including an excess infrared emission from Epsilon Eridani. The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained cosmic dust was <b>orbiting</b> the star; this debris disk has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring.

Despite this hurdle to habitability, its solar analog (Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star.
