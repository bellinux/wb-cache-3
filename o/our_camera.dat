40|$|Abstract: The {{project is}} to design and {{implement}} a framework for <b>our</b> smart <b>camera</b> network, to effectively identify an object when given {{a certain amount of}} continuous frames of such object. An enhanced local feature descriptor is used to represent detected objects in <b>our</b> smart <b>camera</b> network. We select stable and distinctive SIFT features from an object as well as maintain the viewpoint relations existing amongst different features. The matching algorithm takes into consideration not only the appearance of SIFT features but also those viewpoint relations. Such descriptors are constructed in in‐camera scenarios with the support from tracking algorithms, and can provide useful information about the object matching when solving tracking in cross‐camera scenarios. This project aims to provide the searching functionality to <b>our</b> smart <b>camera</b> network so that the user can query by example. Therefore, we need to figure out the effective way to represent detected objects in our network and do object matching, which will also help get better results in cross‐camera tracking.

40|$|Introduction In {{the real}} world, the scene may contain some well-illuminated {{areas as well}} as some areas that are in the darkness. The dynamic range of the scene, or the {{radiance}} ratio between the brightest and the darkest spots, can be quite big [...] it can span several orders of magnitude in some cases. This is a lot wider range than the range that our digital camera can adequately capture, and that our monitor can adequately display. The areas that are too bright for the dynamic range of <b>our</b> <b>camera</b> are going to be saturated on our image, and the areas that are too dark will be under-exposed. In both cases, all the information about these areas will be lost in the image. A way to solve this problem is to combine different shutter speeds of <b>our</b> <b>camera.</b> Smaller shutter speeds can give us good information about the bright areas (because we won't have saturation), and longer shutter speeds effectively capture the dark areas. So by alternating the shutter speeds and by combining the two ima...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method to convert a digital single-lensreflex (DSLR) camera into a high {{resolution}} consumer depth and light field camera by affixing an external aperture mask to the main lens. Compared to the existing consumer depth and light field cameras, <b>our</b> <b>camera</b> is easy to construct with minimal additional costs and our design is camera and lens agnostic. The main advantage of our design is the ease of switching between an SLR camera and a native resolution depth/light field camera. Using an external mask is an important advantage over current light field camera designs since {{we do not need}} to modify the internals of the camera or the lens. <b>Our</b> <b>camera</b> sequentially acquires the angular components of the light field of a static scene by changing the location of the aperture in the mask. A consequence of our design is that the external aperture causes heavy vignetting in the acquired images. We calibrate the mask parameters and estimate multi-view scene depth under vignetting. In addition to depth, we show light field applications such as refocusing and defocus blur at the sensor resolution. 1...|$|E
