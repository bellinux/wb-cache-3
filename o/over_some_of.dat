5|$|The Senate's control <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Roman provinces helped {{maintain}} a republican façade for the autocratic Principate. Also, Octavian's control of entire provinces followed Republican-era precedents for {{the objective of}} securing peace and creating stability, in which such prominent Romans as Pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability.|$|E
5|$|The fort's {{armament}} {{was reduced}} {{during the war}} as other forts and batteries took <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its duties. Two of the six-inch guns were shipped across the river to Cliffe Fort in 1914 and the QF guns on the roof were withdrawn. An anti-aircraft battery was established north-west of the fort for defence against Zeppelins and enemy bombers.|$|E

5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} {{spent too much}} time in political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce the influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor and her {{daughter}} Anna became estranged after she took <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her mother's social duties at the White House. The relationship was further strained because Eleanor desperately wanted {{to go with her}} husband to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna instead. A few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna took care of her mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Raja of Panagal {{introduced}} the Hindu Religious Endowments Bill. As per this bill, trusts were established to maintain temple funds and given complete {{power over the}} administration of temples. This act evoked severe protests from some sections of the assembly which {{felt that this was}} an intrusion in the religious affairs of the populace. However, the Shankaracharya of Kanchi gave his support to the bill even while expressing his concern <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its provisions.|$|E

5|$|The Turkic-speaking Bulgars {{arrived in}} the territories west of the river Dniester around 670. At the Battle of Ongal they {{defeated}} the Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) Emperor Constantine IV in 680 or 681 and occupied Dobruja. They soon imposed their authority <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the neighboring tribes. The great variety in burial rites evidences the multi-ethnic character of the Bulgarian Empire. Even the Bulgars were divided in this respect; some of them practiced inhumation and others cremation. Initially, a sharp distinction existed between the Bulgars and their subjects, but the Slavicization of the Bulgars soon began.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Æthelberht's {{granting}} {{of freedom of}} worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated {{by a number of}} other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium (overlordship) south of the River Humber. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting {{as a representative of the}} Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.|$|E

5|$|Composer Engelbert Humperdinck, after {{attending}} {{the debut of}} his opera Königskinder at the Metropolitan Opera, sailed on George Washington in early January 1911 in order to attend the opera's Berlin premiere. American sculptor George Grey Barnard returned to New York in April amidst controversy <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his works. An organization called the National Society for Protection of Morals was protesting the presence of nude figures in sculptures he executed for the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. July saw George Washington transporting a menagerie of sorts. The liner was carrying a shipment from India of 6 white peacocks, 2 lions, 2 elephants, 150 monkeys, and some 2,000 canaries destined for the recently organized Saint Louis Zoological Park. In August, two men of note—both headed for Berlin—sailed on George Washington. Nathan Straus, co-owner with his brother Isidor of R.H. Macy & Company, sailed as the U.S. delegate {{to the third world}} congress for the protection of infants held in Berlin. Congressman Richard Bartholdt, charged by President Taft to deliver a statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben to the German government, sailed with the statue, which was a gift from the American people.|$|E
5|$|Eastman Kodak sued Apple and Research In Motion (RIM) in January 2010, filing two {{lawsuits}} against Apple and {{a complaint with}} the U.S. International Trade Commission against both Apple and RIM after the companies refused to pay royalties for use of Kodak's patents for digital cameras. Kodak alleged Apple's and RIM's phones infringed on patented Kodak digital imaging technology. Kodak sought an injunction against further imports into the United States of Apple's iPhone and RIM's BlackBerry. After Kodak filed an additional suit in January 2012 against Apple and another against HTC claiming infringement of four of its key patents, Apple filed a countersuit with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to block Kodak's efforts to use the disputed patents as collateral for loans. In the January complaint Kodak claimed violations of the same image preview technology at issue in the original dispute between Kodak, Apple, and RIM that is, as of 2012, pending before ITC. In March 2012, bankruptcy court judge Allen Gropper, overseeing Kodak's restructuring, denied Apple's request to file a patent complaint with the ITC <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Kodak's cameras, photo frames, and printers. In July 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Kodak did not infringe on Apple's patent technology for digital cameras, although a few days earlier Kodak lost its case before the ITC against Apple and RIM; Kodak announced it would appeal that decision.|$|E
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Burnet {{scaled back}} his {{laboratory}} work, taking one day off per week {{to concentrate on}} writing. In 1963, Autoimmune Diseases: Pathogenesis, Chemistry and Therapy, which he authored with Ian Mackay, was published. He also oversaw {{an expansion of the}} Hall Institute and secured funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the space taken up by pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.|$|E
5|$|Louisy {{had become}} Prime Minister {{thanks to a}} secret {{agreement}} with Odlum that he would resign, allowing Odlum to take over, within 6 months. When the time came Louisy refused, backed by the Americans, who wanted to keep Odlum out of office at all costs. This saw Odlum turn against his own government and even vote against the budget. A second proposal that Louisy resign was rejected on 30 December 1980, with the power struggle continuing despite his agreement to hand <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his portfolios. The dispute continued into 1981, with Odlum attracting controversy by announcing on 3 March {{that he had not}} ignored the possibility of his grouping within the Labour Party splitting and joining the United Workers Party.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1996, an {{enormous}} alien mothership, that has one fourth {{the mass of}} the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying gargantuan assault fortress saucers, each fifteen miles wide, that take positions <b>over</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Earth's major cities and military bases. David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Thomas orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Thomas, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the saucers are positioned.|$|E
