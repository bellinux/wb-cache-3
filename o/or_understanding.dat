5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little appreciation <b>or</b> <b>understanding</b> of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E

25|$|According to the Buddha {{the path}} to liberation is one of {{progressively}} coming out of delusion (Pali: Moha). This path is therefore regarded as a path of awakening. Progressing along {{the path to}}wards Nirvana one gains insight into {{the true nature of}} things. A Buddha is one who has attained liberation and an understanding of the causal mechanism by means of which sentient beings come into existence. This mechanism is called pratitya samutpada or dependent origination. The knowledge <b>or</b> <b>understanding</b> of this is called bodhi.|$|E
25|$|Others, like Mark Bauerlein, {{argue that}} professors in the {{humanities}} have increasingly abandoned proven methods of epistemology (I care only {{about the quality of}} your arguments, not your conclusions.) in favor of indoctrination (I care only about your conclusions, not the quality of your arguments.). The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, <b>or</b> <b>understanding</b> of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.|$|E

25|$|Buddhist {{meditation}} of {{two main}} types, Samatha {{is meant to}} calm and relax the mind, as well as develop focus and concentration by training attention on a single object.

Though the ultimate goal of these practices are nirvana, the Buddha stated that they also bring mundane benefits such as relaxation, good sleep and pain reduction.|$|E

25|$|Villepin {{then became}} {{director}} of Chirac's successful 1995 presidential campaign and {{was rewarded with}} the key job of Secretary-General of the Élysée Palace during Chirac's first term as President of the Republic (1995–2002). He advised the president to hold an early general election in 1997, while the French National Assembly was overwhelmingly dominated by the president's party. This was a risky gamble, and Chirac's party went on to lose the elections. Villepin offered Chirac his resignation afterwards, but it was turned down. Villepin's flawed advice on the election increased the perception among many politicians on the right that Villepin had no experience <b>or</b> <b>understanding</b> of grassroots politics, and owed his enviable position only to being Chirac's protégé.|$|E

25|$|SLI is {{diagnosed}} {{when a child}} has difficulties with understanding or producing spoken language for no obvious cause. The problems cannot be {{explained in terms of}} peripheral hearing loss. The child is typically late in starting to talk, and may have problems in producing speech sounds clearly, and in producing <b>or</b> <b>understanding</b> complex sentences. Some theoretical accounts of SLI regard it as the result of auditory processing problems. However, this view of SLI is not universally accepted, and others regard the main difficulties in SLI as stemming from problems with higher-level aspects of language processing.

25|$|Anosognosia {{is a lack}} of {{awareness}} <b>or</b> <b>understanding</b> of the loss of function caused by the brain injury and is common in individuals who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke. Because patients with anosognosia may be unaware of their deficits, they may be less likely to seek treatment once they are released from the hospital. The lack of proper treatment could lead to higher levels of dependency later on. In order to make functional recovery gains, right hemisphere stroke survivors should receive rehabilitation services, so patients with anosognosia should be encouraged to seek out additional treatment. However, due to the anosognosia, these patients often report a higher perceived quality of life than other right hemisphere stroke survivors because of the unawareness of the resulting deficits (Daia et al., 2014). Patients with smaller lesions often recover faster from anosognosia than patients with larger lesions resulting in anosognosia (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{for each}} of the above {{definitions}} there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function {{in the context of a}} body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ <b>or</b> <b>understanding</b> of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.|$|E
