The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this {{struggle}} of nature against its <b>own</b> <b>self.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} a price to be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his <b>own</b> <b>self.</b>|$|E

In Udita, the risen form, the focus is projected on the Self (atman) of one's lover– a state associated with immanence.|$|E

25|$|Dnyaneshwar's moral {{philosophy}} {{comes out in}} his exposition of the 13th of Bhagavad Gita, in his commentary on the book Dnyaneshwari. He considers humility; non–injury in action, thought and words; forbearance {{in the face of}} adversity; dispassion towards sensory pleasures; purity of heart and mind; love of solitude and devotion towards one's Guru and God as virtues; and their corresponding moral opposites as vices. A pessimistic view of one's life is considered as a necessary condition for spiritual growth in Dnyaneshwari. Dnyaneshwar writes that saints do not perceive distinctions and are humble because they identify all objects, animate or inanimate, with their <b>own</b> <b>Self.</b>|$|E

25|$|Saint-Exupéry {{may have}} drawn {{inspiration}} for the prince's character and appearance from his <b>own</b> <b>self</b> as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him le Roi-Soleil (the Sun King) because of his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in Quebec City in 1942, Thomas De Koninck, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck. Another possible {{inspiration for the}} little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh Jr. and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom he met during an overnight stay at their Long Island home in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Campbell and Foster (2007) {{argue that}} self-regulatory {{strategies}} are {{of paramount importance}} to understanding narcissism. Self-regulation in narcissists involves such things as striving to make one's self look and feel positive, special, successful and important. It comes in both intra-psychic, such as blaming a situation rather than self for failure, and interpersonal forms, such as using a relationship to serve one's <b>own</b> <b>self.</b> Some differences in self-regulation between narcissists and non-narcissists can be seen with Campbell, Reeder, Sedikides & Elliot (2000) who conducted a study with two experiments. In each experiment, participants took part in an achievement task, following which they were provided with false feedback; it was either bogus success or failure. The study found that both narcissists and non-narcissists self-enhanced, but non-narcissists showed more flexibility in doing so. Participants were measured on both a comparative and a non-comparative self-enhancement strategy. Both narcissists and non-narcissists employed the non-comparative strategy similarly; however, narcissists {{were found to be}} more self-serving with the comparative strategy, employing it far more than non-narcissists, suggesting a greater rigidity in their self-enhancement. When narcissists receive negative feedback that threatens the self, they self-enhance at all costs, but non-narcissists tend to have limits.|$|E
25|$|Antero {{stands at}} the head of modern Portuguese poetry after João de Deus. His {{principal}} defect is monotony: his <b>own</b> <b>self</b> is his solitary theme, and he seldom attempts any other form of composition than the sonnet. On the other hand, few poets who have chiefly devoted themselves to this form have produced so large a proportion of really exquisite work. The comparatively few pieces in which be either forgets his doubts and inward conflicts, or succeeds in giving them an objective form, are among the most beautiful in any literature. The purely introspective sonnets are less attractive, but equally finely wrought, interesting as psychological studies, and impressive from their sincerity. His mental attitude is well described by himself as the effect of Germanism on the unprepared mind of a Southerner. He had learned much, and half-learned more, which he was unable to assimilate, and his mind became a chaos of conflicting ideas, settling down into a condition of gloomy negation, save for the one conviction of the vanity of existence, which ultimately destroyed him. A healthy participation in public affairs might have saved him, but he seemed incapable of entering upon any course that did not lead to delusion and disappointment. The great popularity acquired, notwithstanding, by poetry so metaphysical and egotistic is a testimony to the artistic instinct of the Portuguese.|$|E

500|$|Bush's music, {{at least}} from the mid-1930s, often carried {{political}} overtones. His obituarist Rupert Christiansen writes that, as a principled Marxist, Bush [...] "put the requirements of the revolutionary proletariat {{at the head of the}} composer's responsibilities", a choice which others, such as Tippett, chose not to make. [...] However, Vaughan Williams thought that, despite Bush's oft-declared theories of the purposes of art and music, [...] "when the inspiration comes over him he forgets all about this and remembers only the one eternal rule for all artists, 'To thine <b>own</b> <b>self</b> be true'." ...|$|E
500|$|Betts' condition, {{in which}} he is [...] "riddled with cancer" [...] but can [...] "see the {{sickness}} within people", according to Amy Donaldson, is a metaphor for someone who [...] "has let sin or evil become the regular course of life". Although Betts can detect and consume the illness, his motives are derived from [...] "his <b>own</b> <b>self</b> appetite". Donaldson contrasts him with the soul eater, from eight season entry [...] "The Gift". In the episode, Agent John Doggett, played by Robert Patrick, stumbles upon a creature that altruistically absorbs the diseases and ailments of others. The soul eater is the polar opposition of Betts, in that takes the illness to help others, rather than to harm them and keep living, which is Betts' mode of operation.|$|E

That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, telling the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demanding that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to [...] "put an antic disposition on," [...] or act as though he has gone mad, and forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret. Privately, however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.|$|E
