5000|$|Opponents {{of direct}} primary care models assert that direct primary care is unethical, {{primarily}} benefitting providers and not patients. Opponents {{believe that the}} direct primary care model targets patients {{who do not have}} health insurance, as some insurance plans are more costly than entering into such a DPC arrangement. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires that DPC practices offering such services must include in their plans a secondary qualifying health plan (QHP) that covers <b>other</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> that the DPC provider may not offer if they choose to offer their DPC arrangement in the healthcare marketplace. Therefore, in cases where the DPC provider has chosen to participate in the healthcare marketplace, the patient would be required to carry and pay for an additional insurance coverage plan for catastrophic and hospital services in addition to the DPC arrangement for primary health care access if he/she purchases this plan from the healthcare marketplace. It is argued that DPC plans can be more expensive in the long term, since by design none of the payments made to the DPC provider practice are counted towards insurance deductibles because the provider neither accepts insurance nor participates in the submission and management of the insurance claims process, potentially resulting in a higher out of pocket catastrophic or hospital services cost to the patient because deductibles would not necessarily have been reached when these services are provided.|$|E

40|$|Intensive care {{macroeconomics}} may {{be defined}} as the study of fiscal relationships between service organization and the processes and outcomes of care. There are substantial international variations in funding intensive care services, which cannot be explained by differences in case mix or population health, Some of the variance may be attributed to the absence of explicit criteria for intensive care resource allocation and utilization at the level both of whole populations and within individual hospital services. This can result in inefficiencies either from excessive funding of unnecessary care, or inadequate funding with too little being delivered too late. Managed care is seen as a method for driving cost-efficiency, but will fail if quality issues are ignored. Intensive care needs to become much more proactive in its relationships with <b>other</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>services.</b> It should promote research into the processes and outcomes of care, with particular emphasis on factors that may predispose to, and prevent, critical illness, The planning of intensive care services would be facilitated by a common terminology and uniform methods of needs assessments...|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1989 National Health Service review health authorities are likely to take a greater interest in patterns of use of secondary care services by patients of different general practitioners.

For both groups of patients distance from an accident and emergency department was an important factor in the rate of attendance. It was possible to examine the effect of several socioeconomic variables in the analysis by electoral ward: these were not associated significantly with attendance rates.

This was a retrospective study of community and <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> use, needs and costs based on structured questionnaires administered by trained interviewers and costing information obtained from the service purchasers and providers, based on two Genito-urinary Medicine clinics in London: the Jefferiss Wing at St. Mary's Hospital and Patric Clements at the Central Middlesex Hospital, London, England. The subjects were 225 HIV infected patients (105 asymptomatic, 59 symptomatic non-AIDS and 61 AIDS). We found that over and above well established determinants of health care costs for HIV infected people such as disease stage and transmission category, social and economic factors such as employment and support of a living-in partner significantly reduced community services costs. Private health insurance had a similar effect, though only {{a small proportion of}} HIV people had such cover. The cost of community services for HIV infected non-European Union nationals, mainly of African origin, was one quarter that for the European Union nationals. Community services costs were highest for heterosexually infected women and lowest for heterosexually infected men after adjusting for <b>other</b> factors. <b>Hospital</b> <b>services</b> costs were significantly higher for HIV infected people lacking educational qualifications and employment. We conclude that access to community care for HIV infected non-EU nationals appears to be very poor as the cost of their community services was one quarter that for the EU nationals after adjusting for the effects of transmission category, disease stage, living with a partner, employment and having a private health insurance. Additional incentives for informal care for HIV infected people could be a cost-effective way to improve their community health service provisions.

The wide utilisation of antimicrobial therapy in this population renders these medications particularly vulnerable to errors and adverse events. To analyse the characteristics of antimicrobial therapy-related incident reports across a group of secondary care hospitals. Reports for antimicrobial-related incidents from April 2010 to December 2013 were obtained from a regional area of hospitals in National Health Service (NHS) Scotland. Reports were analysed at-large, with subset analyses of incidents resulting in patient harm/injury and those included in a multivariable regression adjusted by occupied bed days (OBD) and defined daily doses (DDD) to better ascertain areas to target for antimicrobial safety. A total of 1345 incidents were reported at a crude rate of 0. 98 reports/day (95 % CI: 0. 93 - 1. 03 reports/day). Penicillins (371 reports; 27. 6 %), aminoglycosides (358; 26. 6 %) and glycopeptides (210; 15. 6 %) were the most commonly involved classes of medications. Most incidents involved no injury/harm (514; 38. 2 %), but 72 reports (5. 4 %) did result in patient harm. Rehabilitation/Assessment (RR: 2. 61, 95 % CI: 1. 70 - 4. 03) and Women/Childrens (RR: 2. 61, 95 % CI: 1. 70 - 4. 03) had higher incident reporting rates compared to <b>other</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>services,</b> likely {{as a function of}} at-risk patient populations.

This review aims to evaluate the current literature and discuss assessment/admission word functionality in terms of organisation, admission criteria, special patient care, and cost effectiveness. Methods: Search of the literature using the Medline and BIDS databases, combined with searches of web based resources. Critical assessment of the literature and the data therein is presented. Results: The advantages and disadvantages of the use of assessment/admission wards were assessed from the current literature. Most articles suggest that these wards improve patient satisfaction, are safe, decrease the length of stay, provide earlier senior involvement, reduce unnecessary admissions, and may be particularly useful in certain diagnostic groups. A number of studies summarise their organisational structure and have shown that strong management, staffing, organisation, size, and location are important factors for efficient running. There is wide variation in the recommended size of these words. Observation words may produce cost savings largely relating to the length of stay in such a unit. Conclusion: All types of assessment/admission wards seem to have advantages over traditional admission to a general hospital ward. A successful ward needs proactive management and organisation, senior staff involvement, and access to diagnostics and is dependent on a clear set of policies in terms of admission and care. Many diagnostic groups benefit from this type of unit, excluding those who will inevitably need longer admission. Vigorous financial studies have yet to be undertaken in the UK.
