5|$|The {{original}} {{core of the}} Mundo Perdido was an E-Group astronomical complex.

5|$|The initial Russian position, which {{stretched}} {{south of}} the new Smolensk Highway (Napoleon's expected route of advance), was anchored on its left by a pentagonal earthwork redoubt erected on a mound {{near the village of}} Shevardino. The Russian generals soon realized that their left wing was too exposed and vulnerable. So the Russian line was moved back from this position, but the Redoubt remained manned, Kutuzov stating that the fortification was manned simply to delay the advance of the French forces. Historian Dmitry Buturlin reports that it was used as an <b>observation</b> <b>point</b> to determine the course of the French advance. Historians Witner and Ratch, and many others, reported it was used as a fortification to threaten the French right flank, despite being beyond effective reach of guns of the period.|$|E

5|$|Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00, E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, {{arrived on}} top of Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter. North Korean fire, killing several of the porters, turned it back. Shortly after the E Company platoon joined Vandygriff, the North Koreans {{attacked}} again unsuccessfully. The American units, out of ammunition, relied on captured North Korean equipment. At 13:30 Gay ordered the 8th Cavalry Regiment to withdraw its men off Ka-san. Gay believed he had insufficient forces to secure and hold it and that the North Koreans had insufficient ammunition to exploit its possession as an <b>observation</b> <b>point</b> for directing artillery and mortar fire. Rain started falling again and heavy fog closed in on the mountain top and severely reduced visibility there. Again the North Koreans attacked as the final units began their withdrawal.

5|$|With no attacks {{during the}} night, the German command {{believed}} that the British offensive had been contained. During {{the early hours of}} 27 June, II SS Panzer Corps was ordered to resume preparations for its counter-offensive towards Bayeux. On the right of the British advance, the I SS Panzer Corps launched a counter-attack with 80 tanks, which was disorganised by artillery fire, before foundering on the anti-tank guns of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, who then resumed their attempt to secure VIII Corps flank. Rauray was taken by the 49th Division at 1600 on 27 June, after further heavy fighting against the 12th SS Panzer Division. German forces had been diverted from opposing VIII Corps advance and the fall of Rauray denied the Germans an important <b>observation</b> <b>point,</b> although they remained in control of an area of high ground to the south.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{most common}} {{predictable}} approach to land subsidence is to choose, analyze and forecast a representative deformation <b>observation</b> <b>points.</b> If an uneven land subsidence (settlement) comes into being, the settlement {{rate of deformation}} <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> will be different. The analysis of the individual subsidence <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> can not reflect the true ground subsidence in the region. Instead, the comprehensive analysis of the information about all the deformation <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> can more objectively reflect the overall settlement of the region. This study makes use of all the <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> to establish a triangular mesh deformation, and uses the superposition of the Terrain surface TIN model and the design surface TIN model to obtain the earthvolume in the two surface triangular elements. Through the earthvolume, {{the size of the}} overall settlement of the ground situation can be indirectly reflected in order to adopt appropriate preventive measures. This paper studies the Earthvolume as a research object, employs Gompertz curve model to fit the data and design the forecast model to make accurate assessments. The research shows that this method can reflect the overall total ground settlement,and explore the laws of the land subsidence when an uneven settlement arises...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{inspection}} planning algorithm, called Random Inspection Tree Algorithm (RITA). Given a perfect {{model of a}} structure, sensor specifications, robot 2 ̆ 7 s dynamics, and an initial configuration of a robot, RITA computes the optimal inspection trajectory that observes all points on the structure. Many inspection planning algorithms have been proposed, most of them consist of two sequential steps. In the first step, they compute a small set of <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> such that each point on the structure is visible. In the second step, they compute the shortest trajectory to visit all <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> at least once. The robot 2 ̆ 7 s kinematic and dynamic constraints {{are taken into account}} only in the second step. Thus, when the robot has differential constraints and operates in cluttered environments, the <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> may be difficult or even infeasible to reach. To alleviate this difficulty, RITA computes both <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> and the trajectory to visit the <b>observation</b> <b>points</b> simultaneously. RITA uses sampling-based techniques to find admissible trajectories with decreasing cost. Simulation results for 2 -D environments are promising. Furthermore, we present analysis on the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of our algorithm...|$|R

25|$|The {{village of}} Kamara {{was the most}} easterly picket for Allied soldiers, {{providing}} a useful <b>observation</b> <b>point</b> for Lucan's vedettes.

First to discover that the Russians had moved up under cover of dark was the duty field officer of the day, Captain Alexander Low of the 4th Light Dragoons. The picket in Kamara had not seen the advancing Cossacks (there is some suggestion that they were sleeping), and it was only through Low's timely arrival and his shouts that they managed to escape and {{make their way to the}} nearest redoubt on the Causeway Heights. Behind the Cossacks and uhlans came the Dnieper Regiment along with the artillery.

500|$|Most breeds of cat have a noted {{fondness for}} {{settling}} in high places, or perching. In the wild, a higher place {{may serve as}} a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a leopard. Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better <b>observation</b> <b>point,</b> allowing it to survey its territory. During a fall from a high place, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This is known as the cat righting reflex. An individual cat always rights itself in the same way, provided it has the time to do so, during a fall. The height required for this to occur is around [...] Cats without a tail (e.g. Manx cats) also have this ability, since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing, and the tail is little used for this feat.|$|E
