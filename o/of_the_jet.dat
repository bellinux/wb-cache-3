5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the jet stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are {{one example of how}} airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft {{were used}} for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was {{advanced}} considerably. Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war). Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> GRS 1915 + 105 carry a {{considerable}} energy {{away from the}} central source into the interstellar medium (ISM). <b>The</b> similarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> this source and jets in radio galaxies or radio-loud quasars suggests that we should detect large-scale, synchrotron-emitting radio structures surrounding GRS 1915 + 105. However, these large structures have not been found. We show that by adapting a model for <b>the</b> radio lobes <b>of</b> extragalactic jet sources we predict a radio surface brightness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equivalent structures <b>of</b> GRS 1915 + 105 below the current detection limits. The model uses an energy transport rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jets</b> averaged over <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> lifetime. This transport rate {{is found to be}} considerably lower than <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jets</b> during <b>the</b> rare major ejection events. Thus, the lobes contain less energy than would be inferred from these events and produce a lower radio luminosity. The model also predicts a lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> order 106 yr and a gas density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ISM in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> GRS 1915 + 105 of 150 cm- 3. <b>The</b> impact sites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jets</b> are identified with two IRAS regions with a flat radio spectrum located on either side of GRS 1915 + 105. Observations of molecular lines and dust emission from these objects are consistent with our interpretation. Distance estimates for the IRAS regions give 6. 5 kpc, and our model implies that this is also the distance to GRS 1915 + 105. This low distance estimate in combination with <b>the</b> observed motions <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> ejections on small scales yields a jet velocity of about 0. 7 c and an angle of 53 ° <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jets</b> to our line of sight...|$|R
5|$|In 1947, a {{prominent}} radio source was identified overlapping {{the location of}} M87, and this was labeled Virgo-A. This source was confirmed to be M87 by 1953, and the linear relativistic jet emerging from {{the core of the}} galaxy was suggested as the cause. This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jet.</b>|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|In the {{modified}} Hubble sequence galaxy morphological classification scheme of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. The E0 designation {{is used for}} an elliptical galaxy that displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A 'p' suffix indicates a peculiar galaxy that does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity denotes the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jet</b> emerging from the core. M87 is considered a type-cD galaxy, which is a supergiant D class galaxy. The latter category, first proposed by American astronomer William W. Morgan in 1958, is a galaxy that has an elliptical-like nucleus surrounded by an extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope.|$|E

5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate.

5|$|Jet streams {{are fast}} flowing, narrow, {{meandering}} air currents in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth.
