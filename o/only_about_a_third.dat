The division returned to the front on 29 August 1942 with 109 R-2s. By the eve of the Soviet Stalingrad Counter-offensive on 19 November the division could only muster 84 serviceable R-2s with as many as 37 unserviceable tanks stationed in the rear.

30|$|Given the {{inability}} to explain the decline by shifts {{in the composition of}} individual and business characteristics, we explored a few additional methods of explaining the decline. The distribution of establishment-level employment change has been narrowing during the last 10 to 15 years, fully accounting for the decline in job creation and job destruction, yet this narrowing <b>only</b> explains <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> of the decline in hires and separations. This tells us that the explanation for the decline in hires and separations will be different than the explanation for the decline in job creation and job destruction. We also find that the decline in hires and separations is being driven by the decline in job-to-job flows and the disappearance of short-duration jobs in the U.S. economy.|$|R

30|$|In section IV, we {{analyze the}} decline in gross worker flows (hires and separations), {{employing}} some helpful identities that relate gross worker flows to gross job flows (job creation and job destruction), {{as well as to}} job-to-job flows.

This implies that whatever economic forces are driving the declines in gross job flows, there are different forces that are driving the declines in gross worker flows. Analyzing the relationship between gross worker flows and job-to-job flows, we find that declines in both short-duration jobs and job-to-job flows are driving the declines in gross worker flows.|$|R

As this continued, more opioid prescriptions were written, for more days per prescription, in higher doses. Taking opioids {{for longer periods of}} time or in higher doses increases the risk of addiction, overdose, and death.

However, recent {{investigations}} suggest such gaze-following behavior during natural interactions occurs relatively infrequently, <b>only</b> in <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> of available instances. Here we investigated if a similar frequency of orienting {{is also found}} in laboratory tasks that measure covert attentional orienting using manual responses. To do so, in two experiments, we analyzed responses from a classic gaze cuing task, with arrow cues serving as control stimuli. We reasoned that the proportions of attentional benefits and costs, defined as responses falling outside of 1 standard deviation of the average performance for the neutral condition, would provide a good approximation of individual instances of attentional shifts. We found that although benefits and costs occurred in less than half of trials, benefits emerged on a greater proportion of validly cued relative to invalidly cued trials. This pattern of data held across two different measures of neutral performance, as assessed by Experiments 1 and 2, as well as across the two cue types. These results suggest that similarly to gaze-following in naturalistic settings, covert orienting within the cuing task also appears to occur relatively infrequently...|$|R
