5|$|Slavery in Greek antiquity {{has long}} been an object of apologetic {{discourse}} among Christians, who are typically awarded the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a History <b>of</b> <b>Slavery</b> <b>in</b> Antiquity among his works for the abolition <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> the French colonies.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After the abolition <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers {{in return for a}} share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following the abolition <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly {{took the form of}} anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E

5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|John Wilkes Booth (May 10, 1838 – April 26, 1865) was an American {{actor and}} assassin, who murdered President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1865. Booth {{was a member}} of the {{prominent}} 19th-century Booth theatrical family from Maryland and, by the 1860s, was a well-known actor. He was also a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and strongly opposed to the abolition <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> the United States.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, White was in support of preserving the United States. In the United States presidential election of 1860, White supported Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett. The Constitutional Union Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism over the issue <b>of</b> <b>slavery.</b> <b>In</b> 1861, White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention, one of which was his son-in-law Colonel E.M.

500|$|The {{abolition}} <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> {{was prepared}} <b>in</b> Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation <b>of</b> 1862–63. <b>Slavery</b> <b>in</b> the United States was eventually abolished when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified on December 6, 1865.

5|$|The Dominican Republic had {{its second}} war for {{independence}} in 1844, which {{was successful in}} obtaining independence from Haiti. Spain reannexed {{the country at the}} request of its then-dictator, Gen. Pedro Santana (who attempted to benefit personally from the event), in 1861. A third revolt, the War of Restoration, sought independence from the Spanish in 1863. Its leaders used Haiti as a guerrilla base, since the Haitian government feared a Spanish takeover and the restoration <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> the occupied territories, and was thus sympathetic to their cause. Their stronghold, however, was the Cibao valley in the northeastern part of Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} study <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> ancient Greece is {{beset by}} significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing {{primarily on the}} city-state of Athens. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested in slavery only inasmuch as it provided a source of revenue. Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|The lumber {{used in the}} {{construction}} of Fort Jackson was either sold for salvage or scavenged by squatters, most of whom were freed slaves traveling north in a search for new lives following the ending <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> the United States.

5|$|William Henry Seward (May 16, 1801 – October 10, 1872) was United States Secretary of State from 1861 to 1869, {{and earlier}} served as Governor of New York and United States Senator. A {{determined}} {{opponent of the}} spread <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> the {{years leading up to}} the American Civil War, he was a dominant figure in the Republican Party in its formative years, and was praised for his work on behalf of the Union as Secretary of State during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|As {{the country}} {{continued}} to expand, the issue <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could {{be moved to}} the territories like all other forms of property. The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the Wilmot Proviso was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexican–American War; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.|$|E
