Flournoy was later president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mortgage</b> Exchange Corporation of Charleston. In his role as president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mortgage</b> Exchange Corporation, Flournoy {{was involved in the}} establishment of a local association of mortgage businesspeople in February 1952.

Flournoy was educated at Fishburne Military School, Hampden–Sydney College, and West Virginia University College of Law. He was admitted to the Kanawha County bar in 1911 and at various times during his law career, Flournoy was appointed special master, arbitrator, or commissioner for several high-profile court cases. In 1935, Flournoy was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for an at-large seat on the Charleston City Council. In 1937, Flournoy was selected by Governor Homer A. Holt {{as a member of the}} Charleston Civil Service Board, which regulated the appointments of police and fire personnel. Flournoy served as an incorporator of the New Homes Corporation of Charleston in 1931 and was later president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mortgage</b> Exchange Corporation.

25|$|This is {{sometimes}} called a loan policy and it is issued only to mortgage lenders. Generally speaking, it follows the assignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> loan, meaning that the policy benefits the purchaser of the loan if the loan is sold. For this reason, these policies greatly facilitate the sale of mortgages into the secondary market. That market {{is made up of}} high volume purchasers such as Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation as well as private institutions.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{pricing and}} rate {{analysis}} of adjustable rate mortgage in the finance industry is done through various computer simulation methodologies like Monte Carlo method or Sobol sequences. In these techniques, {{by using an}} assumed probability distribution of future interest rates, numerous (10,000–100,000 or even 1,000,000) possible interest rate scenarios are explored, mortgage cash flows calculated under each, and aggregate parameters like fair value and effective interest rate over the life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> are estimated. Having these at hand, lending analysts determine whether offering a particular mortgage would be profitable, and if it would represent tolerable risk to the bank.|$|E

The winning bidders were Thomas Munford and Henry Augustine Tayloe II who paid $5,100 but the contingency remained on the deed and Rosalie Ogle remained in the house. When tenant farmers moved in the mansion alongside Rosalie, she took them to court stating {{that she could not}} live in a house with people so far below her station. In 1877, she was awarded a cash settlement, and the last of the Ogle family retreated to Baltimore.|$|E
50|$|A {{special case}} of {{parallel}} tranching {{is known as}} the IO/PO split. IO and PO refer to Interest Only and Principal Only. In this case, one tranche would have a coupon of zero (meaning that it would get no interest at all) and the other would get all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interest. These bonds could be used to speculate on prepayments. A principal only bond would be sold at a deep discount (a much lower price than <b>the</b> underlying <b>mortgage)</b> and would rise in price rapidly if many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>mortgages</b> were prepaid. <b>The</b> interest only bond would be very profitable if few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgages</b> prepaid, but could get very little money if many mortgages prepaid.|$|R

50|$|Clauses {{not to be}} {{included}} are the forfeiture clause (pactum commissorium) and the summary execution clause (parate executie). The former provides that, if the mortgagor defaults, the mortgagee may keep the property for his own. The latter provides that, if the mortgagor defaults, the mortgagee may take possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgaged</b> property and arrange for a private sale.

The church assumed all debts associated with the mortgage on the property, which were considerable; it was agreed the church would take title to the land upon repayment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgage.</b> Zarephath was named from a phrase in 1 Kings 17, because White saw a parallel with relocation to a farm {{and the story of}} Elijah and a widow.|$|E
25|$|In a February 23, 2004 speech, Greenspan {{suggested}} that more homeowners should consider taking out adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) where {{the interest rate}} adjusts itself to the current interest in the market. The Fed's own funds rate was at a then all-time-low of 1%. A few months after his recommendation, Greenspan began raising interest rates, {{in a series of}} rate hikes that would bring the funds rate to 5.25% about two years later. A triggering factor in the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis {{is believed to be the}} many subprime ARMs that reset at much higher interest rates than what the borrower paid during the first few years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgage.</b>|$|E
25|$|On January 11, 2008, Bank of America {{announced}} that it would buy Countrywide Financial for $4.1billion. In March 2008, it was reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating Countrywide for possible fraud relating to home loans and mortgages. This news did not hinder the acquisition, which was completed in July 2008, giving the bank a substantial market share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> business, and access to Countrywide's resources for servicing mortgages. The acquisition was seen as preventing a potential bankruptcy for Countrywide. Countrywide, however, denied that it was close to bankruptcy. Countrywide provided mortgage servicing for nine million mortgages valued at $1.4trillion as of December 31, 2007.|$|E
50|$|From 1938 to 1968, <b>the</b> Federal National <b>Mortgage</b> Association (Fannie Mae) was {{the sole}} {{institution}} that bought mortgages from depository institutions, principally savings and loan associations, which encouraged more mortgage lending and effectively insured <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>mortgages</b> by <b>the</b> US government. In 1968, Fannie Mae split into a private corporation and a publicly financed institution. The private corporation was still called Fannie Mae and its charter continued to support <b>the</b> purchase <b>of</b> <b>mortgages</b> from savings and loan associations and other depository institutions, but without an explicit insurance policy that guaranteed <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgages.</b> <b>The</b> publicly financed institution was named <b>the</b> Government National <b>Mortgage</b> Association (Ginnie Mae) and it explicitly guaranteed <b>the</b> repayments <b>of</b> securities backed by mortgages made to government employees or veterans (<b>the</b> <b>mortgages</b> themselves were also guaranteed by other government organizations).|$|R

40|$|Information {{asymmetry}} {{exists between}} the lender and the borrower regarding <b>the</b> holding period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgaged</b> real estate; <b>the</b> lender {{does not know how}} long the borrower plans to own the house. This information asymmetry allows <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> obtaining a mortgage to deviate from its value to the borrower. As a result, <b>the</b> exercise price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> option to refinance becomes the cost to <b>the</b> borrower <b>of</b> obtaining a new <b>mortgage</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outstanding balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>mortgage</b> as used in previous models. The option to refinance is a sequential option; after the borrower refinances, a new option is obtained to refinance again in <b>the</b> future. A <b>mortgage</b> refinancing model is developed taking information asymmetry and sequential refinancing into account. The model is used to solve for (1) the value to <b>the</b> borrower <b>of</b> a callable <b>mortgage</b> and (2) <b>the</b> minimum interest rate differential between <b>the</b> contract rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>mortgage</b> and <b>the</b> market interest rate needed to justify refinancing.

25|$|Adjustable rate {{mortgages}} {{are sometimes}} sold to consumers who {{are unlikely to}} repay the loan should interest rates rise. In the United States, extreme cases are characterized by the Consumer Federation of America as predatory loans. Protections against interest rate rises include (a) a possible initial period with a fixed rate (which gives the borrower a chance to increase his/her annual earnings before payments rise); (b) a maximum (cap) that interest rates can rise in any year (if there is a cap, it must be specified in the loan document); and (c) a maximum (cap) that interest rates can rise over the life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> (this also must be specified in the loan document).|$|E
25|$|One {{critical}} component of the securitization system in the US market is the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS) created in the 1990s, which created a private system wherein underlying mortgages were assigned and reassigned outside of the traditional county-level recording process. The legitimacy and overall accuracy of this alternative recording system have faced serious challenges with the onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> crisis: as the US courts flood with foreclosure cases, the inadequacies of the MERS model are being exposed, and both local and federal governments have begun to take action through suits {{of their own and}} the refusal (in some jurisdictions) of the courts to recognize the legal authority of MERS assignments. The assignment of mortgage (deed of trust) and note (obligation to pay the debt) paperwork outside of the traditional US county courts (and without recordation fee payment) is subject to legal challenge. Legal inconsistencies in MERS originally appeared trivial, but they may reflect dysfunctionality in the entire US mortgage securitization industry.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2009 policy {{report from}} the Cato Institute {{authored}} {{by one of the}} institute's directors, Mark A. Calabria, critics of the legislation feared that, with the allowance for mergers between investment and commercial banks, GLBA allowed the newly-merged banks to take on riskier investments {{while at the same time}} removing any requirements to maintain enough equity, exposing the assets of its banking customers. Calabria claimed that, prior to the passage of GLBA in 1999, investment banks were already capable of holding and trading the very financial assets claimed to be the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mortgage</b> crisis, and were also already able to keep their books as they had. He concluded that greater access to investment capital as many investment banks went public on the market explains the shift in their holdings to trading portfolios. Calabria noted that after GLBA passed, most investment banks did not merge with depository commercial banks, and that in fact, the few banks that did merge weathered the crisis better than those that did not.|$|E
