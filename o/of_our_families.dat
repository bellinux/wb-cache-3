2500|$|The Hail Mary is the {{essential}} element of the Rosary, a prayer method in use especially among Roman Rite (Western) Catholics. [...] The Eastern Catholic Churches say a similar version. The Rosary consists traditionally of three sets of five Mysteries, each mystery consisting of one [...] "decade" [...] or ten Ave Marias. The 150 Ave Marias of the Rosary thus echo the 150 psalms. These meditate upon events of Jesus' life during his childhood (Joyful Mysteries), Passion (Sorrowful Mysteries), and from his Resurrection onwards (Glorious Mysteries). Another set, the Luminous Mysteries, is of comparatively recent origin, having been proposed by Pope John Paul II in 2002. Each of these Mysteries is prayed as a decade (a unit of ten), consisting of one Our Father (Pater Noster or The Lord's Prayer), ten Hail Marys, and one 'Glory Be' (Gloria Patri) (Doxology).The repetition of the [...] "Our Father," [...] "Hail Mary," [...] and [...] "Glory Be" [...] is conducive to meditation, as several Popes have pointed out, especially Pope Leo XIII. The restatement of the prayers locks one into fixed language, having the effect of freeing the conscious mind so that the recitation may come more from the heart and not the head. During the apparitions at Fatima, Mary placed singular emphasis {{on the importance of}} praying the Rosary every day to bring the world to conversion. Pope Paul V said that [...] "the Rosary is a treasure of graces" [...] and Sister Lúcia of Fátima explained [...] "the Rosary helps to preserve that flickering flame of faith that has not yet been completely extinguished from many consciences. Even for those souls who pray without meditating, the simple act of taking the beads in hand to pray is already a remembrance of God - of the supernatural". Lúcia also said [...] "there is no problem, no matter how difficult it is, whether temporal or above all spiritual, in the personal life of each one of us, <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>families,</b> of the families in the world, or of the religious communities, or even of the life of peoples and nations that cannot be solved by the Rosary".|$|E

Are we engaged in quarrels and misunderstandings with our neighbours? These were all begun and inflamed by the false, malicious tongues of our servants. Are the secrets <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>families</b> betrayed, and evil repute spread of us? Our servants were the authors. Do false accusers rise up against us (an evil too frequent in this country)? They have been tampering with our servants. Do our children discover folly, malice, pride, cruelty, revenge, undutifulness in their words and actions? Are they seduced to lewdness or scandalous marriages? It is all by our servants.
