50|$|Oxygen {{exists as}} a ground state triplet state, which is {{relatively}} unreactive and needs free radicals or very electron-rich substrates such as deprotonated lignin phenolic groups. The production of these phenoxide groups requires that delignification with oxygen {{be carried out}} under very basic conditions (pH >12). The reactions involved are primarily single electron (radical) reactions. Oxygen opens rings and cleaves sidechains giving a complex mixture of small oxygenated molecules. Transition metal compounds, particularly those ofiron, manganese and copper, which have multiple oxidation states, facilitate many radical reactions and impact <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification.</b> While the radical reactions are largely responsible for delignification, they are detrimental to cellulose.Oxygen-based radicals, especially hydroxyl radicals, HO•, can oxidize hydroxyl groups in the cellulose chains to ketones, and under the strongly basic conditions used in <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification,</b> these compounds undergo reverse aldol reactions leading to cleavage of cellulose chains.

The carboxyl group contents determined in different chemical components of oxygen delignified pulps was used to establish the distribution of carboxyl groups in lignin and pulp polysaccharide and decouple the responses from residual lignin and polysaccharide. Following this study, two high kappa (~ 49. 0) SW kraft pulps prepared were delignified through two-stage <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification.</b> Fiber carboxyl group profiles of these pulps were elucidated to investigate the effect of lignin content of incoming unbleached kraft pulps on fiber carboxyl group formation. Due to a limitation to enhance fiber carboxyl groups only by parameter optimization during one- and two- stage <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification,</b> a catalytic oxidation program was developed to enhance fiber carboxyl groups by 52. 2 116. 0 % employing 0. 10 - 0. 18 % of a bismuth ruthenium pyrochlore oxide catalyst during <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification.</b> The mechanism of fiber carboxyl group formation through the catalytic oxidation was proposed. The main factor on carboxyl group formation in pulp carbohydrate was identified to follow the order: NaOH > oxygen pressure> reaction temperature through a 3 -factor at 3 -level (L 933) orthogonal experimental design and the optimal conditions were found at 2. 5 % NaOH, 85 - 100 oC, and 800 - 960 kPa O 2 during the catalytic oxidation.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this program was to develop improved extended <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification</b> (EOD) technologies for current U. S. pulp mill operations. This was accomplished by: (1) Identifying pulping conditions that optimize O and OO performance; (2) Identifying structural features of lignin that enhance reactivity towards EOD of high kappa pulps; (3) Identifying factors minimizing carbohydrate degradation and improve pulp strength of EOD high kappa pulps; (4) Developing a simple, reproducible method of quantifying yield gains from EOD; and (5) Developing process conditions that significantly reduce the capital requirements of EOD while optimizing the yield benefits. Key research outcomes included, demonstrating {{the use of a}} mini-O sequence such as (E+O) Dkf: 0. 05 (E+O) or Dkf: 0. 05 (E+O) (E+O) without interstage washing could capture approximately 60 % of the delignification efficiency of a conventional O-stage without the major capital requirements associated with an O-stage for conventional SW kraft pulps. The rate of formation and loss of fiber charge during an O-stage stage can be employed to maximize net fiber charge. Optimal fiber charge development and delignification are two independent parameters and do not parallel each other. It is possible to utilize an O-stage to enhance overall cellulosic fiber charge of low and high kappa SW kraft pulps which is beneficial for physical strength properties. The application of NIR and multi-variant analysis was developed into a rapid and simple method of determining the yield of pulp from an <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification</b> stage that has real-world mill applications. A focus point of this program was the demonstration that Kraft pulping conditions and <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification</b> of high and low-kappa SW and HW pulps are intimately related. Improved physical pulp properties and yield can be delivered by controlling the H-factor and active alkali charge. Low AA softwood kraft pulp with a kappa number 30 has an average improvement of 2 % in yield and 4 cP in viscosity in comparison to high AA pulp for the <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification.</b> This difference is also seen for high-kappa SW kraft pulps with an average improvement of {approx} 3 % in yield and 3 cP in viscosity for low AA high kappa number 50 pulp.

MartínezChemical {{modification}} of eucalypt lignin was investigated during kraft pulping and chlorine-free bleaching by comparing milled-wood lignin, kraft lignin, and enzymatic residual lignins. The syringyl-to-guaiacyl ratio (S/G) from analytical pyrolysis slightly changed during pulping and bleaching (S/G 3 - 4) but was much {{higher in the}} kraft lignin. Semiquantitative HSQC NMR showed that the relative amount of β-O- 4 ' (around 80 % side-chains) and resinol-type substructures (around 15 %) was only slightly modified during pulping and <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification.</b> Other minor inter-unit linkages and terminal units were also detected. However, a decrease of resinol substructures (to only 6 %) was found after alkaline-peroxide bleaching. The relative amount of surviving linkages in the highly-phenolic kraft lignin was dramatically modified, resinols being predominant. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>delignification</b> did not change inter-unit linkages, but an increase of oxidized units {{was found in the}} HSQC aromatic region, in agreement with the higher amount of pyrolysis markers with oxidized side-chains. HMBC NMR correlations showed that the oxidized units after <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification</b> bore conjugated ketone groups, and conjugated carboxyls after peroxide bleaching. Presence of xylan and lignin-carbohydrate linkage signals was shown by the HSQC spectra of pulp ligninsThe study was funded by the Spanish projects BIO 2005 - 03569, AGL 2005 - 01748 and CTQ 2005 - 08925 -C 02 - 02, the EU contracts QLK 3 - 99 - 590 and FP 6 - 2004 -NMP-NI- 4 - 02456, the CSIC project 2006 - 4 - 0 I- 039, and two ENCE-CSIC contracts.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification</b> {{is very low}} for pulps of low number kappa and with high concentrations of hexenuronic acids, therefore the oxygen does not react with these acids, so being minimum the elimination of these during the <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification</b> (pre-O 2) in simple or double stage. In this study, the physicalmechanical properties of pulp of kappa number 17 and 14, produced with modified cooks and with the application of AD(EO) D techniques for pulp of kappa 17 and DHT(EPO) DP for pulp of kappa 14 for the bleaching up to 90 % ISO, had been investigated. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the physicalmechanical properties in pulps submitted to the bleaching sequences without oxygen in the beginning of the sequence. As references, cooks had been carried until numbers kappa 17 and 14, <b>oxygen</b> <b>delignification</b> and conventional bleaching for sequences A/D(EO) D for pulp of kappa 17 and DHT(EPO) DP for pulp of kappa 14. The alternative bleaching, without pre-O 2, resulted in bleached pulps with bigger integrity that of the reference, what it was confirmed by the values significantly higher of bulk, tear index, opacity and air resistance of the pulp weakly refined (for tissue papers). However, the high integrity of the fibers from pulps bleached with alternative processes lowered their conformabilities and collapsibility, with consequent reduction of tensile index of the pulp weakly refined. Therefore, with more intensive beating (for printing and writing papers), the tensile index was recovered. The high integrity of the bleaching pulps without pre-O 2 makes beating difficulty. To reach the draining degree of 35 °SR with the pulps proceeding from alternative processes of bleaching, it was necessary to apply 30 % more energy than the reference...|$|E
