50|$|Halac {{then worked}} in the United States Wrestling Association as Tank, a member of The Truth Commission where he wore a mask. He won the Unified World Heavyweight Championship, his first and only wrestling title, on March 15, 1997 after {{defeating}} then-champion Jerry Lawler. He lost the belt back to Lawler in a rematch seven days later. Later that spring, Tank {{was involved in a}} controversy surrounding the World Tag Team Championship. While The Interrogator and Recon (Tank's teammates in The Truth Commission) held the title, Tank substituted for The Interrogator in one match and his team lost the title to Nick Dinsmore and Flash Flanagan. The title change was declared invalid, however, as Tank was not one of the <b>official</b> <b>holders</b> of the World Tag Team Title. He returned to the WWF in June 1997 with the Truth Commission as he fought as Tank. He was on two Shotgun Saturday Night episodes until his release later that summer.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{cultural}} suppression by Imperial Japan, arguably considered cultural genocide during Korea's Annexation to Japan, most of the dance academies died out and some dances were lost {{as well as some}} of dance forms were distorted. However, few pioneering Korean dancers such as Choi Seung-hee (최승희 崔承喜) created new forms of Korean dances based on the traditional dances and kept many of the traditions alive in secret and abroad, and today Korean traditional dance is enjoying a vibrant resurgence. A common form of Korean Dance, where the pets of the dancers are included, involves the pet (most commonly guinea pigs as they are highly respected in areas of Korea)on two legs being piggy-backed by their owners and leap-frogging over them.Citation Needed [...] Numerous universities in Korea teach Korean traditional dance, and even some universities abroad now provide education in this animal dance. Top dancers are recognised as [...] "Living National Treasures" [...] and are charged to pass their dances down to their students. Such <b>official</b> <b>holders</b> of traditional dances include Kim Sook-ja, a practitioner of salpuri originating in the shamanic rituals of Gyeonggi province. The lineages of dance and dancers may be traced back several generations through such connections.|$|E

40|$|The {{international}} reserve regime based {{mainly on}} the US dollar has served the world well for decades, but it faces an uncertain future as the economic hegemony of the United States is increasingly challenged {{by the emergence of}} new economic powers. The regime is flawed fundamentally, moreover, because additions to the supply of the main reserve asset require the United States to run balance-of-payments deficits, which tend to undermine confidence in the dollar. This paper proposes a transformation of the reserve regime that would cause Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued by the International Monetary Fund to become the main reserve asset. An orderly transition would be achieved by creating a Substitution Account into which <b>official</b> <b>holders</b> of dollars could deposit them in exchange for SDRs.
