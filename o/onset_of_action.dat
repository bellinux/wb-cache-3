5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (<b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action)</b> and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E

50|$|RTI(-4229)-336, (LS-193,309, (−)-2β-(3-(4-methylphenyl)isoxazol-5-yl)-3β-(4-chlorophenyl)tropane) is a phenyltropane {{derivative}} {{which acts}} as a potent and selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor and stimulant drug.

25|$|Whilst all benzodiazepines have abuse potential, certain {{characteristics}} {{increase the}} potential of particular benzodiazepines for abuse. These characteristics are chiefly practical ones—most especially, availability (often based on popular perception of 'dangerous' versus 'non-dangerous' drugs) through prescribing physicians or illicit distributors. Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic factors are also crucial in determining abuse potentials. A short elimination half-life, high potency and a rapid <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> are characteristics which increase the abuse potential of benzodiazepines. The following table provides the elimination half-life, relevant potency to other benzodiazepines, speed of <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and duration of behavioural effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} {{profile of}} lidocaine {{as a local}} anaesthetic {{is characterized by a}} rapid <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.|$|E
25|$|When {{administered}} orally, it {{is rapidly}} absorbed {{and has a}} fast <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is one to five minutes for IV administration and 15–30 minutes for IM administration.

Peak plasma levels occur between 30 and 90 minutes after oral administration and between 30 and 60 minutes after intramuscular administration; after rectal administration, peak plasma levels occur after 10 to 45 minutes.

40|$|For years, it {{has been}} known that the “onset” of the {{antipsychotic}} response is “delayed,” and this notion is expressed in many major textbooks, informs clinical decisions and has even led {{to the search for}} biological markers responsible for this delayed onset. But is the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> antipsychotic <b>action</b> really delayed? In this review, we bring together data from several recent studies of antipsychotic drugs that show that the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> the antipsychotic effect is within the first day; the effect is distinguishable from behavioural sedation; is specific to antipsychotic drugs; is seen with oral and parenteral preparations; and is seen with typical and atypical antipsychotics. More anti- “psychotic” improvement is seen within the first 2 weeks than in any other 2 -week period thereafter, and more improvement is seen in the first month than {{in the rest of the}} year of follow-up. This body of data convincingly refutes the notion of “delay” in the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> antipsychotic <b>action</b> and suggests an “early” onset instead.

40|$|The dorsal {{anterior}} cingulate cortex (dACC) {{has previously}} been implicated in processes that influence action initiation.

In a simple reaction task, three patients were instructed to respond to a specific visual cue with the movement of a joystick.

In a decision making task with three separate patients, the ablation effect on action initiation persisted even when action selection was intact.

25|$|Spironolactone {{inhibits}} {{the effects}} of mineralocorticoids, namely, aldosterone, by displacing them from MR in the cortical collecting duct of renal nephrons. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water while limiting the excretion of potassium (A K+ sparing diuretic). The drug has a slightly delayed <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> and so it takes several days for diuresis to occur. This is because the MR is a nuclear receptor which works through regulating gene transcription and gene expression, in this case, to decrease the production and expression of ENaC and ROMK electrolyte channels in the distal nephrons. In addition to direct antagonism of the MRs, the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone may also in part be mediated by direct inactivation of steroid 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase), enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of mineralocorticoids. If levels of mineralocorticoids are decreased then there are lower circulating levels to compete with spironolactone to influence gene expression as mentioned above. The <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> of the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone is relatively slow, with the peak effect sometimes occurring 48 hours or more after the first dose.|$|E
