5|$|Horse {{racing and}} {{greyhound}} racing are both popular in Ireland. There are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well-attended. The island is noted for the breeding {{and training of}} race horses and is also a large exporter <b>of</b> <b>racing</b> dogs. The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare.|$|E
5|$|Leech married Mitch Tuohy {{and had two}} sons, Adam and Troy, {{whom she}} {{discouraged}} from entering competitive swimming, fearing the pressure and strain <b>of</b> <b>racing.</b> In retirement, she shunned competitive sport, but maintained her fitness and athleticism.

5|$|In his retirement, Browne {{continued}} {{his involvement in}} the sport, using his vast experience to serve the sport as an administrator. Browne served as the Vice President of the Victorian Amateur Cycling Association and he strongly advocated the use of a handicap system in racing, believing that it would improve the standard <b>of</b> <b>racing</b> and improve Australia's success rate. At the age of 39, he married Rhonda, a primary school teacher. They had three children, a girl and two boys.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} racial' and ethnic' {{diversity of}} cities in a neoliberal terrain calls for planning scholars {{to revisit the}} notions <b>of</b> <b>race</b> and ethnicity in relation to capital. Theorists of Canadian multiculturalism have often used culturalist notions <b>of</b> <b>race</b> that are divorced from the inseparable links between racialization and capitalist processes. In light of this quandary, this paper is an attempt at a renewed conceptual and historical interpretation <b>of</b> <b>race</b> and capitalism by using a selection of Marxist scholars. The research takes two specific avenues in exploring race and capitalism: {{an analysis of the}} production <b>of</b> <b>race</b> in the labour history of the United States, and Caribbean slavery in the development of global capitalism. Furthermore, the paper concludes with a reflection on the implications of its content for planning. The construcxion <b>of</b> <b>race</b> is inextricably tied to the development of capitalism. The historical relationship <b>of</b> <b>race</b> to issues <b>of</b> labour, slavery, and colonial-imperial processes demonstrates the shared conceptual roots <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> class and capital...|$|R
40|$|The small GTPase racE is {{essential}} for cytokinesis in Dictyostelium but its precise role in cell division is not known. To determine the molecular mechanism <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> function, we undertook a mutational analysis <b>of</b> <b>racE.</b> The exogenous expression <b>of</b> either wild-type <b>racE</b> or a constitutively active V 20 racE mutant effectively rescues the cytokinesis deficiency <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> null cells. In contrast, a constitutively inactive N 25 racE mutant fails to rescue the cytokinesis deficiency. Thus, cytokinesis requires only the activation <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> by GTP and not the inactivation <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> by hydrolysis <b>of</b> GTP. To determine the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>racE,</b> we created a fusion protein with GFP at the amino terminus <b>of</b> <b>racE.</b> Remarkably, GFP-racE fusion protein was fully competent to rescue the phenotype <b>of</b> <b>racE</b> null cells and, therefore, must reside in the same location as native racE. We found that GFP-racE localized to the plasma membrane of the cell throughout the entire cell cycle. Furthermore, constitutively active and inactive GFP-racE fusion proteins also localized to the plasma membrane. We mapped the domain required for plasma membrane localization to the carboxyl-terminal 40 amino acids <b>of</b> <b>racE.</b> This domain, however, {{is not sufficient to}} confer racE function onto a closely related GTPase. Taken together, these results suggest that racE functions at the cell cortex but it is not involved in determining the timing or placement of the contractile ring...|$|R

5|$|Secretariat was {{inducted}} into the National Museum <b>of</b> <b>Racing</b> and Hall of Fame in 1974, the year following his Triple Crown victory. Also in 1974, Paul Mellon commissioned a bronze statue, sometimes known as Secretariat in Full Stride, from John Skeaping. The life-size statue remained {{in the center of the}} walking ring at Belmont Park until 1988 when it was replaced by a replica. The original is now located at the National Museum <b>of</b> <b>Racing</b> and Hall of Fame. The Kentucky Horse Park has two other life-sized statues of Secretariat. The first, created by Jim Reno in 1992, shows Secretariat as an older sire, while the second, completed by Edwin Bogucki in 2004, shows him being led into the winner's circle after the Kentucky Derby. In 2015, a new statue of Secretariat and Ron Turcotte crossing the finish line at the Belmont Stakes was unveiled in Grand Falls, New Brunswick, Turcotte's hometown.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 World Championship was {{the final}} IndyCar race for Davey Hamilton, Alex Lloyd, Vitor Meira, Danica Patrick, Buddy Rice, Tomas Scheckter, and Paul Tracy.

The event was instrumental in helping the Rockingham Motor Speedway become established on the world motor sport scene, and brought a new type <b>of</b> <b>racing</b> to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The stage {{began with}} an 18-rider {{breakaway}} within the first five minutes <b>of</b> <b>racing.</b> This included Contador's teammate Robert Ki≈°erlovski and this group was joined shortly afterwards by several more riders, including Yuri Trofimov, another Tinkoff rider, while others were dropped {{and returned to the}} peloton. Thomas De Gendt and Antoine Duchesne were again in the breakaway; Duchesne won the first four climbs of the day, with De Gendt second on each occasion. Duchesne won enough points to secure victory in the mountains classification.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1995, Rosecroft {{was forced}} to cut costs. Its owners lowered the amount of purse money, {{eliminated}} stake races, and reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>racing</b> days.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects <b>of</b> <b>racing,</b> Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons. Each craft has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero‚Äîeither from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other craft or {{the edges of the}} circuit‚Äîthe craft blows up. The craft also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust a destructive wave down the track that dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E

40|$|Race as a {{biological}} category {{has a long}} and troubling history as a central ordering concept in the life and human sciences. The mid-twentieth century has been marked as the point where biological concepts <b>of</b> <b>race</b> began to disappear from science. However, biological definitions <b>of</b> <b>race</b> continue to penetrate scientific understandings and uses of racial concepts. Using the theoretical frameworks <b>of</b> critical <b>race</b> theory and science and technology studies and an in-depth case study of the discipline of immunology, this dissertation explores {{the appearance of a}} mid-century decline of concepts <b>of</b> biological <b>race</b> in science. I argue that biological concepts <b>of</b> <b>race</b> did not disappear {{in the middle of the}} twentieth century but were reconfigured into genetic language. In this dissertation I offer a periodization of biological concepts <b>of</b> <b>race.</b> Focusing on continuities and the effects of contingent events, I compare how biological concepts <b>of</b> <b>race</b> articulate with racisms in each period. The discipline of immunology serves as a case study that demonstrates how biological concepts <b>of</b> <b>race</b> did not decline in the postwar era, but were translated into the language of genetics and populations. I argue that the appearance of a decline was due to events both internal and external to the science of immunology. By framing the mid-twentieth century disappearance <b>of</b> <b>race</b> in science as the triumph of an antiracist racial project of science, it allows us to more clearly see the more recent resurgence <b>of</b> <b>race</b> in science as a recycling of older themes and tactics from the racist science projects of the past...|$|R
