40|$|Abridged) We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the stellar populations of the gas-stripped outer disks of ten Virgo Cluster spiral galaxies, utilizing SparsePak integral field spectroscopy on the WIYN 3. 5 m telescope and GALEX UV photometry. The <b>galaxies</b> in <b>our</b> sample show evidence for being gas-stripped spiral galaxies, with star formation within a truncation radius, and a passive population beyond the truncation radius. We find that all of the galaxies with spatially truncated star formation have outer disk stellar populations consistent with star formation ending within the last 500 Myr. The synthesis of optical spectroscopy and GALEX observations demonstrate that star formation was relatively constant until the quenching time, after which the galaxies passively evolved. Large starbursts at the time of quenching are excluded for all galaxies. For approximately half of <b>our</b> <b>galaxies,</b> timescales derived from our observations are consistent with galaxies being stripped in or near the cluster core, where simple ram-pressure estimates can explain the stripping. However, the other half of <b>our</b> sample <b>galaxies</b> were clearly stripped outside the cluster core. Such galaxies provide evidence that the intra-cluster medium is not static and smooth. For three of <b>our</b> sample <b>galaxies,</b> <b>our</b> stripping timescales agree with those from the gas stripping simulations, suggesting that star formation is quenched near the time of peak pressure. While the stripping of star-forming gas in the outer disk creates a passive population in <b>our</b> <b>galaxies,</b> there is still normal star formation in the center of <b>our</b> sample <b>galaxies.</b> It may be that Virgo is not massive enough to completely strip these spiral galaxies and, in a more dynamically active cluster or a cluster with a higher density ICM, such a process would lead to passive spirals and/or S 0 s.

5|$|Following the war, Gascoigne and {{astronomer}} Gerald Kron used newly modernised telescopes at Mount Stromlo {{to determine}} that the distance between <b>our</b> <b>galaxy</b> and the Magellanic Cloud dwarf galaxies had been underestimated {{by a factor of}} two. Because this measurement was used to calibrate other distances in astronomy, the result effectively doubled the estimated size of the universe. They also found that star formation in the Magellanic Clouds had occurred more recently than in the Milky Way; this overturned the prevailing view that both had evolved in parallel. A major figure at Mount Stromlo Observatory, Gascoigne helped it develop from a solar observatory to a centre of stellar and galactic research, and was instrumental in the creation of its field observatory in northern New South Wales, Siding Spring Observatory. When the British and Australian governments agreed to jointly build the Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring, Gascoigne was involved from its initial conception and throughout its lengthy commissioning, taking its first photograph. Gascoigne was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for his contributions to astronomy and to the Anglo-Australian Telescope.|$|E
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star of <b>our</b> <b>galaxy</b> despite {{a distance of}} billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} sample of 48 metal-poor galaxies at z < 0. 14 {{selected}} from 92, 510 galaxies in the LAMOST survey. These galaxies are identified for their detection of the auroral emission line λ 4363 above 3 σ level, which allows a direct measurement of the electron temperature and the oxygen abundance. The emission line fluxes are corrected for internal dust extinction using Balmer decrement method. With electron temperature derived from λλ 4959, 5007 /λ 4363 and electron density from λ 6731 /λ 6717, we obtain the oxygen abundances in our sample which range from = 7. 63 (0. 09) to 8. 46 (0. 6). We find an extremely metal-poor galaxy with = 7. 63 ± 0. 01. With multiband photometric data from FUV to NIR and measurements, we also determine the stellar masses and star formation rates, based on the spectral energy distribution fitting and luminosity, respectively. We find that <b>our</b> <b>galaxies</b> have low and intermediate stellar masses with 6. 39 < log(M/M_) < 9. 27, and high star formation rates (SFRs) with - 2. 18 < log(SFR/M_ yr^- 1) < 1. 95. We also find that the metallicities of <b>our</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{are consistent with the}} local T_e-based mass-metallicity relation, while the scatter is about 0. 28 dex. Additionally, assuming the coefficient of α = 0. 66, we find most of <b>our</b> <b>galaxies</b> follow the local mass-metallicity-SFR relation, while a scatter about 0. 24 dex exists, suggesting the mass-metallicity relation is weakly dependent on SFR for those metal-poor galaxies.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} study of stellar feedback processes in simulations of disk galaxy formation. Using a dark matter halo with properties {{similar to the}} ones for the Milky Way's stellar halo, we perform a comparison of different methods of distributing energy related to feedback processes to the surrounding gas. A most promising standard model is applied to halos spanning a range of masses in order to compare the results to disk galaxy scaling relations. With few exceptions we find little or no angular momentum deficiency for <b>our</b> <b>galaxies</b> and a good agreement with the angular momentum-size relation. <b>Our</b> <b>galaxies</b> are in good agreement with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and the slope of the photometric Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced. We find a zero-point offset of 0. 7 to 1 magnitudes, depending on the employed IMF. We also study our standard feedback model in combination with additional physical processes like a UV background, kinetic feedback, a delayed energy deposition as expected for type Ia supernovae, mass return and metal-dependent cooling. Only a combination of effects yields a real improvement of the resulting galaxy by reducing the bulge, while including metal-dependent cooling increases the bulge again. We find that in general the stellar mass fraction of <b>our</b> <b>galaxies</b> is too high. In an ad-hoc experiment we show that an removal of the bulge could reconcile this. However, the fit of the Tully-Fisher relation can only be improved by delaying the star formation, but not suppressing it completely. Our models {{do not seem to be}} efficient enough to achieve either effect. We conclude that disk formation is a complex, highly interconnected problem and we expect a solution to come from a combination of small effects.
