5|$|Although the {{settlers}} received {{the benefit of}} a section of public opinion, politically and legally every decision was going the way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b> In March 1880, Stanford himself attempted a reconciliation by appearing in Hanford and meeting with the Settler's League in an attempt to find some sort of compromise.|$|E

5|$|A new Methodist {{church was}} built in the {{community}} in 1910, which was used until 1988 and is still standing. Two years later, a new two-room school replaced the old one-room school, which in turn was replaced by a modern school in the mid 1900s, all on the same property. In 1939, the wooden trestle part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> bridge across the Willamette caught fire and burned.

5|$|After a brief {{slowdown}} of {{the economy}} {{at the end of}} the Depression, the country entered World War II, which renewed the importance of railroads. The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region's rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s, when the affordability of automobiles and the subsidized Interstate Highway System drew off passengers from the trains. The decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> industry, which went through considerable restructuring among freight lines as well, caused significant job losses. The city's population declined as workers left for other areas.|$|E

There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.|$|E

5|$|During April 1887, J.I. Berry {{established}} {{a site for}} a town after he chose a well-watered section along {{the way of the}} Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and Colorado City, Texas, merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County. Availability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> and freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} poorly {{developed}} peninsula suddenly {{found itself in}} a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b> Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E

Blount owned several corporations and one, the Green Mountain Railroad (GMRC), controlled the tracks that lay between Walpole, Bellows Falls and Chester, Vermont, which Steamtown was to use for its excursions.

5|$|Framingham Railroad Station is a {{historic}} Boston and Albany Railroad station located in downtown Framingham, Massachusetts. Designed by noted American architect H. H. Richardson, {{it was one of}} the last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> stations he designed in the northeastern United States to be built. The station, built in 1884–85, served as a major stop on the B Main Line as well as a hub for branch lines to Milford, Mansfield, Fitchburg, and Lowell. After years of deterioration, the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and restored a decade later.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed {{adjacent to the}} Long Bridge {{as part of a}} plan to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia. An extension of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the bridge would be used until {{the turn of the century}} before being replaced. Owing to the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would detach its locomotive and be pulled across the bridge by a team of horses.|$|E

5|$|In early July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) {{announced}} it would reduce the wages of all workers by ten percent.
