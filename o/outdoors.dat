5|$|On September 17, the NHL {{announced}} that on January 1, 2008, the Penguins would travel to Orchard Park, New York {{to play the}} Buffalo Sabres <b>outdoors</b> at Ralph Wilson Stadium in the AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic. The event {{marked the first time}} a regular-season contest was played <b>outdoors</b> in the United States.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the <b>outdoors</b> environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The <b>outdoors</b> stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done <b>outdoors,</b> and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the <b>outdoors</b> avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Heritage Classic was {{the second}} <b>outdoors</b> game held during the 2010–11 season, {{following}} the 2011 NHL Winter Classic.|$|E
5|$|ArtWalk {{takes place}} {{approximately}} every six weeks on Saturday evenings throughout the year. ArtWalk is organized by Galveston Arts Center, which releases an ArtWalk brochure featuring {{a map of}} participating venues as well as descriptions of shows and exhibits. Venues include GAC, Galveston Artist Residency and artist’s studios and galleries. Additionally, art is shown in “other walls”—for example MOD Coffeehouse or Mosquito Cafe—or <b>outdoors</b> at Art Market on Market Street. Musicians perform <b>outdoors</b> and at venues such as the Proletariat Gallery & Public House or Old Quarter Acoustic Cafe. While most ArtWalk events are concentrated downtown, {{there are a number}} or participants elsewhere on the island.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium montanum may be {{cultivated}} <b>outdoors</b> or in a terrarium. In either case, {{the soil}} used should be amended with chips of acidic rock.|$|E
5|$|Dogon villagers did {{not have}} {{electric}} lighting and spent most nights <b>outdoors,</b> talking and sleeping; so they were apparently an ideal population for detecting a lunar influence; none was found.|$|E
5|$|Few earwigs survive winter <b>outdoors</b> in cold climates. They can {{be found}} in tight crevices in woodland, fields and gardens. Out of about 1,800 species, about 25 occur in North America, 45 in Europe (including 7 in Great Britain), and 60 in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Minnesotans {{participate}} in {{high levels of}} physical activity, {{and many of these}} activities are <b>outdoors.</b> The strong interest of Minnesotans in environmentalism has been attributed to the popularity of these pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Margaret Roffey {{was born}} in London, England, the {{daughter}} of Anne (née Murphy) and Peter Roffey. She moved to the United States at age three in 1959, when her father, an anesthesiologist, took up a fellowship at the University of Washington. Her mother was a nurse practitioner whose specialty was women's health. The Roffey family, including Sally and her three siblings, enjoyed the <b>outdoors,</b> and Sally went sailing and hiking from a young age. A two-week camping trip to teach children ecology inspired her love of the <b>outdoors</b> when she was nine years old. She graduated in 1973 from Renton High School.|$|E
5|$|Scouting or the Scout Movement is a {{movement}} that aims to support young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development, that they may play constructive roles in society, with a strong focus on the <b>outdoors</b> and survival skills.|$|E
5|$|Supplemental skill-specific {{training}} {{is also available}} to BSA volunteers to gain knowledge in <b>outdoors</b> skills including camping, hiking, first aid, Leave No Trace, swim safety, climbing safety, hazardous weather, and other skills.|$|E
5|$|A live {{theatrical}} {{production of}} Quatermass and the Pit was staged, {{with the permission}} of Kneale, <b>outdoors</b> in a quarry at the village of Cropwell Bishop in Nottinghamshire in August 1997. The adaptation was written by Peter Thornhill and mounted by Creation Productions, with David Longford starring as Quatermass.|$|E
5|$|A {{report was}} {{approved}} by Brampton City Council during a council meeting on August 16, 1993. The report suggested that in British Columbia, such sculptures are frequently displayed <b>outdoors.</b> As Chinguacousy Park bears an Aboriginal name, it was deemed appropriate for the sculpture to be used {{at the entrance of}} the nearby area. It was to be bolted to a 1.5-metre high (five-foot high) tree stump.|$|E
5|$|Albert Downing {{was born}} on 12 July 1886 in Port Ahuriri, Napier, New Zealand, the eldest son of Mr and Mrs John Downing. He {{attended}} Napier Boys' High School until 1904. He was a farmer before joining Barry Brothers, carriers and coal merchants, choosing {{to work as a}} carter <b>outdoors,</b> rather than join the clerical staff. Later, he worked as a storeman for the Ellison and Duncan Company.|$|E
5|$|Although {{competitions}} are {{no longer}} held <b>outdoors,</b> the most important competitions (Olympics, World Championships, World Cups) are still scheduled for the Northern Hemisphere summer season because they are combined with outdoor events. Many lesser international events, however, are held during the European indoor season between October and March, culminating in the European Championships each year. Most of these competitions are multi-day events held together with air rifle matches.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{attended}} Linfield College in Oregon. He {{began working}} at The Columbian newspaper in 1975 as a photojournalist. It {{was there that}} he met his wife, Fay Mall, {{who worked in the}} newspaper's display advertising department. The two dated for several months before marrying in the summer of 1979. Blackburn enjoyed hiking and loved the <b>outdoors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{may also}} be planted <b>outdoors</b> in regions with {{suitable}} climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions {{has led to the}} promotion of gardens requiring less watering (xeriscaping). For example, in California, the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates. Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E
5|$|Cattle breeds such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus {{date back}} to the 1700s, and a handful of farmers {{continue}} to raise cattle sired by registered pedigree bulls. Bullocks, which live <b>outdoors</b> year-round, grow slowly as they would in their natural habitat, ultimately producing a distinctly tender meat. Around 2,200,000 cattle are slaughtered for beef each year in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Disaster Transport {{originally}} {{opened on}} May 11, 1985 as Avalanche Run and was entirely <b>outdoors.</b> It was built {{next to the}} beach, on the former spot of Jumbo Jet and later, WildCat. Many other rides also had to be relocated. The original ride cost $3.4 million: $1.9 million to manufacture and $1.5 million to install.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{was seven}} years old when his {{grandfather}} was elected U.S. president, but he did not attend the inauguration. Although Harrison's family was distinguished, his parents were not wealthy. John Scott Harrison, a two-term U.S. congressman from Ohio, spent much of his farm income on his children's education. Despite the family's modest resources, Harrison's boyhood was enjoyable, much of it spent <b>outdoors</b> fishing or hunting.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} full {{professor}} in 1963 and retired in 1980. He remained interested in oceanography, scuba diving, seashell collecting and the <b>outdoors</b> throughout his later years, {{and continued to}} work both on oceanographic research, {{as well as on}} the DUMAND deep ocean neutrino astronomy project, which combined his two careers in physics and oceanography.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the Kertész {{couple were}} {{designated}} as enemy aliens because of World War II (Hungary was {{fighting on the}} side of the Axis powers). Kertész was not permitted to photograph <b>outdoors</b> or to have any project related to national security. Trying to avoid trouble because Elizabeth had started a cosmetics company (Cosmia Laboratories), Kertész ceased to do commissioned work and essentially disappeared from the photographic world for three years.|$|E
5|$|January 4/5, 1879: At Jacksonville at 7 pm, sleet began, {{which turned}} to rain 90minutes later. The {{freezing}} rain covered trees, shrubbery, {{and everything else}} <b>outdoors</b> by morning. The weight of the ice broke the limbs of many orange trees. At Fernandina, snow occurred.|$|E
5|$|MSI {{displayed}} the Pioneer Zephyr <b>outdoors,</b> with no {{protection from the}} weather, until 1994. At that time, the steam locomotive that shared the display space with the Zephyr, Santa Fe #2903, was donated to the Illinois Railway Museum (IRM) at Union, west of Chicago, while MSI prepared a new display location for the Zephyr.|$|E
5|$|Missoula, often {{considered}} the cultural center of Montana, is {{the location of}} the state's first university, and an eclectic mix of loggers, hippies, college students, sports fans, and retirees. Community events generally take place downtown either <b>outdoors</b> or in one of the several downtown buildings listed on the National Historic Registry.|$|E
5|$|Rollins {{has written}} a variety of books, {{including}} Black Coffee Blues, Do I Come Here Often?, The First Five (a compilation of High Adventure in the Great <b>Outdoors,</b> Pissing in the Gene Pool, Bang!, Art to Choke Hearts, and One From None), See a Grown Man Cry, Now Watch Him Die, Smile, You're Traveling, Get in the Van, Eye Scream, Broken Summers, Roomanitarian, and Solipsist.|$|E
5|$|Scouting {{is taught}} using the Scout method, which {{incorporates}} an informal educational system that emphasizes practical {{activities in the}} <b>outdoors.</b> Programs exist for Scouts {{ranging in age from}} 6 to 25 (though age limits vary slightly by country), and program specifics target Scouts in a manner appropriate to their age.|$|E
5|$|Scouting {{virtually}} started itself, but {{the trigger}} that set it going was the 1908 publication of Scouting for Boys written by Robert Baden-Powell. At Charterhouse, one of England's most famous public schools, Baden-Powell {{had an interest}} in the <b>outdoors.</b> Later, as a military officer, Baden-Powell was stationed in British India in the 1880s where he took an interest in military scouting and in 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting.|$|E
5|$|Since 1997, Kevin Lewis (formerly of the Cine Centre and the New Forum) has {{arranged}} the Jersey Film Festival, a charity event showing {{the latest and}} also classic films <b>outdoors</b> in 35mm on a big screen. The 2011 festival was held in Howard Davis Park, St Saviour, on the 13–19 August 2011.|$|E
5|$|Swimming or bathing <b>outdoors</b> was {{discouraged}} in the Christian West, {{so there}} was little demand or need for swimming or bathing costumes until the 18th century. The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or flannel that retained coverage and modesty.|$|E
5|$|The Jean and Johnnie {{dance was}} an {{important}} part of Barbadian culture until it was banned in the 19th century. This was a popular fertility dance performed <b>outdoors</b> at plantation fairs and other festivals, and was functional in that it allowed women to show off to men, and more rarely, vice versa. The dance was eventually banned because the dance was associated with non-Christian African traditions.|$|E
5|$|The first Wood Badge {{training}} in the Netherlands was held in July 1923 by Scoutmaster Jan Schaap,on Gilwell Ada's Hoeve, Ommen. At Gilwell Sint Walrick, Overasselt, the Catholic Scouts had their training. Since approximately 2000, the Dutch Wood Badge training takes place on the Scout campsite Buitenzorg, Baarn, or <b>outdoors</b> in Belgium or Germany under the name 'Gilwell Training'.|$|E
5|$|The greater Phoenix {{region is}} home to the only {{thriving}} feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living <b>outdoors</b> in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.|$|E
5|$|The mimids are {{a family}} of {{passerine}} birds that includes thrashers, mockingbirds, tremblers and the New World catbirds. These birds are notable for their vocalization, especially their remarkable ability to mimic {{a wide variety of}} birds and other sounds heard <b>outdoors.</b> The species tend towards dull grays and browns in their appearance.|$|E
