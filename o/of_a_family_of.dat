5|$|Edmontosaurus was a hadrosaurid (a duck-billed dinosaur), {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> dinosaurs which to date are known {{only from the}} Late Cretaceous. It is {{classified}} within the Saurolophinae (alternately Hadrosaurinae), a clade of hadrosaurids which lacked hollow crests.

It was either closely related to or includes the species Anatosaurus annectens (alternately Edmontosaurus annectens), a large hadrosaurid from various latest Cretaceous formations of western North America. The giant Chinese hadrosaurine Shantungosaurus giganteus is also anatomically similar to Edmontosaurus; M. K. Brett-Surman found the two to differ only in details related to the greater size of Shantungosaurus, based on what had been described of the latter genus.|$|E
