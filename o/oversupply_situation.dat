50|$|The world steel {{industry}} entered a crisis period during {{the end of}} the 1970s and early 1980s with the widespread recession, which occurred at that time. South Africa did not escape this recession and the local demand for steel fell as a result. A world <b>oversupply</b> <b>situation</b> occurred in the steel market with export prices falling to uneconomic levels. During 1982 Iscor was thus forced into the early closure of the two oldest blast furnaces at Pretoria Works, as well as the closure of the so-called South Works at Newcastle which had been taken over from Amcor only a decade earlier.|$|E
30|$|Oil price decline due {{to global}} oil being {{excessively}} supplied {{has resulted in the}} cessation of drilling in a large number of oilfields. Oil stocks continued to decline, which reduced the global oil surplus. But the <b>oversupply</b> <b>situation</b> still exists and the status of many traditional oil-rich countries is being challenged. Along with the conventional and unconventional oil production tending to be stable, what pattern will global oil supply evolve into? This has profound influence on the main oil suppliers and consumers who have just experienced sharp fluctuations of oil price. This paper forecasts the global oil supply using the multi-cycle generalized Weng model.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{share of}} electricity generated by fluctuating renewable energies may cause <b>oversupply</b> <b>situations</b> in electricity generation, which {{are likely to}} occur in the future. A way to avoid surplus electricity is to limit the output of wind turbines or solar parks. Another option that allows the surplus electricity to be used is reconversion into hydrogen, which could be stored underground in large amounts for several weeks. At the same time a future demand for hydrogen from fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) can be expected. These vehicles need hydrogen produced from renewables for a positive emission balance. The potential coverage of hydrogen supply from surplus electricity for hydrogen fuel demand from FCEVs is analyzed in this paper. We find that supply is sufficient to meet demand on an annual reso lution. Our monthly analysis shows that storage is necessary to store hydrogen for one or two months...|$|R
40|$|These events {{point out}} that there is an {{international}} problem in which supplies of apples have grown at a faster rate than the demand. The world per capita con-sumption of apples has been static for some time. Apple growers from New Zealand, the European Union, and Wash-ington State are also feeling the effects of low returns. When the inevitable shakeout of farms and other apple marketing and pro-cessing firms occurs, many in the indus-try are wondering if the situation will re-sult in more favorable prices and markets for New York apples. A positive response to this question is little consolation be-cause <b>oversupply</b> <b>situations</b> can take sev-eral years to work themselves out with a perennial crop such as apples, given the lag of {{at least two or three}} years between investment in new plantings and the im-pact of the fruit from these plantings on markets.

40|$|The {{operation}} of the power markets is strongly aected {{by the presence of}} high shares of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) in the market. Especially in times of high RES-E infeed, rm market situations can lead to extreme results, even to negative power prices. The behavior of RES-E in potential <b>oversupply</b> <b>situations</b> depends on the RES-E support scheme and in particular on the dened curtailment rules. By now, dierent curtailment rules have not been taken into account in long-run capacity expansion analyses. The present research investigates the impact of curtailment rules on the operation and the investment decisions through the utilization of "The High Temporal Resolution Electricity Market Analysis Model" (THEA) for the German power market under consideration of the neighboring countries. In general the results show that RES-E can provide exibility to the system if low burdens for curtailment are applied. This comes with the cost of lacking market signals which could trigger investments in exible generation capacities. However, if RES-E are forced into the market at any cost, the burden for consumers increases and the market signals high demand for alternative exibilities. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} 15 years since China {{dominated}} the rare earth permanent magnet market in 2001. The annual output of sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets in China reached {{a new record}} of 126, 300 tonnages in 2015 while the output in 2001 is only 6, 500 tonnages. The average growth rate from 2001 to 2015 is about 23. 5 % though the output in 2012 suffers a deep drop due to the well known rare earth crisis in 2011. Currently, the RE magnet production capability in China seems to be over developed compared to actual requirements. Needless to say the <b>oversupply</b> <b>situation</b> implies a hard time for RE magnet manufacturers due to the fierce competition but maybe {{a good time for}} the whole industry. The motivation for a company to develop new technology and more competitive products with better performance and/or lower costs is greatly enhanced.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the high}} growth of {{biodiesel}} production, glycerol, a major by-product from transesterification, is also produced at the same growing rate, resulting in its <b>oversupply.</b> This <b>situation</b> brings the price of glycerol to drop dramatically. Solketal, a derivative from glycerol, can be utilized by blending with gasoline or biodiesel as an additive. This work studies the synthesis of solketal from glycerol and acetone using homogeneous acid catalyst. The reaction progresses successfully when using the acetone in excess. Subsequently, the prepared solketal is used for synthesizing benzyl solketal ether by performing reaction with benzyl alcohol. However, several other products such as benzyl glycerol ether, dibenzyl ether and glycerol are formed. It {{was found that the}} high ratio of solketal to benzyl alcohol is required to increase selectivity toward benzyl solketal ether...|$|R

This research investigates the potential of data mining techniques as well as alternative approaches to improve the short-term forecasting method for short-lifecycle products with high uncertainty in demand. We found that data mining techniques cannot unveil their full potential to improve short-term forecasting in this case due to the high demand uncertainty and the high variance of demand patterns. In fact we found that the higher the variance in demand patterns the less complex a demand forecasting method can be. Forecasting can often be improved by data preparation. The right preparation method can unveil important information hidden in the available data and decrease the perceived variance and uncertainty. In this case data preparation did not lead to a decrease in the perceived uncertainty {{to such an extent that}} a complex forecasting method could be used. Rather than using a data mining approach we found that using an alternative combined forecasting approach, incorporating judgmental adjustments of statistical forecasts, led to significantly improved short-term forecasting accuracy. The findings are validated on real world data in an extensive case study at a large retail company in Western Europe...|$|R

40|$|The {{electricity}} {{is a vital}} asset and a priority for {{the social and economic}} development of todayâ€™s world. Building energy infrastructures with high efficiency and renewable energy sources is an important yet challenging task for a sustainable future. Smart grid is a term referring to a modernized electrical grid that uses information and communications technology to gather and act on information, such as information about the behaviors of suppliers and consumers, in an automated fashion to improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity. The main issue of this thesis is to propose new solutions which help end-users to optimize their consumption and better manage their own electricity costs. More specifically, the challenge is to make elastic the demand for, and the supply of, electricity of prosumers in order to optimize their energy cost based on power market conditions and on suitable constraints on their power consumption. By definition, a prosumer is a user that not only consumes, but also produces and stores electricity. In our work, we focus on power market models in which prosumers interact in a distributed environment during the purchase or sale of electric power. We have chosen to follow the distributed power market model DEZENT. Our contribution is the planning phase of the consumption of prosumers based on the negotiation mechanism of DEZENT. We propose a controller for the planning of the consumption which aims at minimizing the electricity cost achieved {{at the end of a}} day. Our controller model exploits the standard dynamic programming algorithm and in the thesis we discuss the assumptions on which the controller design is based. In order to evaluate the performance of our introduced controller, we performed extended experimental studies based on the available DEZENT simulator and on the Java implementation of the optimal controller. Our main result is that the highest energy cost reduction was obtained when we have a high variance on the profile cost of the electricity, the prosumer environment is in the undersupply situation and the reserve capacity of the controller is infinite. Vice versa, the lowest energy cost reduction corresponds to low variance, <b>oversupply</b> <b>situation</b> and finite reserve capacity. Furthermore the study of the problem of (sub) optimal repeated re-planning for the rest of the day has shown that a prosumer having to consume more than expected will pay a remarkable additional cost at the end of the day which depends also on the increased unit costs; in the case in which a part of the available energy reserve is lost, the additional cost paid is proportional to the amount of energy lost. In summary the general idea behind the planning (optimization) phase of a consumer is to plan consumption as smartly (delay or anticipate the consumption) as possible during a day, a week, a month or even a year. The results of this behavior is the minimization of the electricity cost in the long run, under certain assumptions on energy costs, as resulted by local negotiations, and on the acceptable variations of consumer requests. One of the open issues is the global effect of our introduced controller in a prosumer population since each prosumer can make use of it. We believe that the issue can lead to a congestion problem similar to that of the minority game problem proposed in economics literature...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{research}} question; â€˜how does environmentalism influence the export performance of export ventures exporting hardwood woodchips from Australia to Japan?â€™ The Australia-Japan hardwood woodchip export industry {{is used as}} the focus of the study because it is an interesting exemplar of the influence of environmentalism on export activity. It also facilitates the use of a number of research design features that enhance the contribution of the research to the development of new knowledge and, it is an economically and socially important industry to both Australia and Japan. Environmentalism is presented as a useful construct to consider the influence {{of a wide range of}} â€˜environmentalâ€™ related issues across a broad spectrum of business activities. In this thesis, environmentalism is defined as â€˜the social movement concerned with the pursuit (through political and social influence) of perceived improved preservation and/or conservation conditions of the natural state of selected environs and the inferred benefits to human welfareâ€™. A two-stage approach is used to address the research question. The first stage involves the synthesis (from reviews of industry issues and related theory) of a conceptual framework of the export performance of Australian hardwood woodchip export ventures exporting to Japan. The second stage then uses this export performance framework to identify and discuss how environmentalism influences the export performance of export ventures. The research technique used is grounded theory. Data is collected from case studies of five export ventures that export hardwood woodchips from Australia to Japan (out of a total of nine such ventures in existence) and interviews with 18 industry participants who are senior managers of export ventures that export hardwood woodchips to Japan. Analysis of results reveals that assessments of venture level export performance vary between Australian-owned export ventures and Japanese-owned export ventures. Analysis also reveals that export ventures, regardless of ownership type, assess their export performance as a mix of financial and non-financial measures. The notion of â€˜License to Operateâ€™ is found to be the most prominent non-financial consideration. Analysis of results also reveals that the influence of environmentalism on the export performance of export ventures is particularly expressed via three features. Firstly, the preferences of Japanese buyers for hardwood woodchips sourced from plantations and/or forests certified as being sustainably managed. Secondly, the impact that changes to the forest resources available as wood supply to export ventures have made on the cost-competitiveness and export reliability of those export ventures. Thirdly, aspects of the license to operate of export ventures including the requirements of regulatory compliance and how environmentalism shapes stakeholder sentiment regarding the sustainability of export ventures and related forest management activities. The discussion highlights that the strategic outlook for Australian-owned export ventures is one characterised by their diminishing bargaining power. This diminishing bargaining power is a consequence of the likely <b>oversupply</b> <b>situation</b> in the Pacific Rim market and the transfer pricing strategies of the Japanese pulp and paper industry expressed. In this context, the transfer pricing strategies of the Japanese pulp and paper industry are expressed via their longer term supply policies and their investment in overseas hardwood plantations and woodchip export ventures. It follows that the search for feasible alternative markets is a critical strategic consideration for Australian-owned export ventures. Analysis reveals that environmentalism can act as an impediment to the realisation of some of these alternative markets (e. g. as opposition to a pulp mill development proposal) or as a catalyst in others (e. g. as support for the emergence of environmental markets such as carbon trading). It is also surmised that, in general terms, environmentalism has contributed to the enhancement of the sustainable governance of export ventures that export hardwood woodchips from Australia to Japan...|$|E
