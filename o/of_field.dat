5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank <b>of</b> <b>field</b> marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. It was felt that, as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank <b>of</b> <b>field</b> marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was the first Indian army officer to be promoted to the rank.|$|E
5|$|Although Manekshaw was conferred {{the rank}} <b>of</b> <b>field</b> marshal in 1973, it was {{reported}} that he was not given the complete allowances that he was entitled to as a field marshal.

5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years <b>of</b> <b>field</b> trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E
5|$|Before the Crimean War, {{there was}} no {{official}} standardised system for recognition of gallantry within the British armed forces. Officers were eligible for an award {{of one of the}} junior grades of the Order of the Bath and brevet promotions while a Mention in Despatches existed as an alternative award for acts of lesser gallantry. This structure was very limited; in practice awards of the Order of the Bath were confined to officers <b>of</b> <b>field</b> rank. Brevet promotions or Mentions in Despatches were largely confined to those who were under the immediate notice of the commanders in the field, generally members of the commander's own staff.|$|E
5|$|British anti-invasion {{preparations}} of the Second World War entailed {{a large-scale}} division {{of military and}} civilian mobilisation {{in response to the}} threat of invasion by German armed forces in 1940 and 1941. The British army needed to recover from the defeat of the British Expeditionary Force in France, and 1.5 million men were enrolled as part-time soldiers in the Home Guard. The rapid construction <b>of</b> <b>field</b> fortifications transformed much of the United Kingdom, especially southern England, into a prepared battlefield. The German invasion plan, Operation Sea Lion, was never taken beyond the preliminary assembly of forces. Today, little remains of Britain's anti-invasion preparations; only reinforced concrete structures such as pillboxes are commonly found.|$|E

50|$|In baseball, defense—that is, {{preventing}} the opponent from scoring runs—is the joint {{responsibility of the}} pitcher and the fielders. ERA attempts to adjust {{for some of the}} influence of the fielders on a pitcher's runs allowed by removing runs that are scored because <b>of</b> <b>fielding</b> errors—that is, unearned runs. However, removing unearned runs doesn't adequately adjust for the effects of defensive support, because it makes no adjustment for other important aspects <b>of</b> <b>fielding,</b> such as proficiency at turning double plays, throwing out base stealers, and fielding range. Errors are the only aspect <b>of</b> <b>fielding</b> that ERA adjusts for, and are generally regarded as a small part <b>of</b> <b>fielding</b> in modern baseball.|$|R
