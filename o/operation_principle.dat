2500|$|Separating the {{expensive}} machinery section from the cargo space offers several advantages {{in comparison to}} conventional vessels, {{one of the most}} important being the ability to operate on the [...] "drop and swap" [...] principle which minimizes the turnaround time in port for the pusher and its crew. When a pusher-barge combination arrives at a port, the fully laden barge is left for unloading while the pusher picks up an empty one and leaves again. In theory the system works on optimum efficiency when there are as many barges as there are pushers and ports of call – the barges are always either being loaded or unloaded, or underway with a pusher. In addition to reducing unprofitable waiting time such <b>operation</b> <b>principle</b> allows more time for the unloading of the barge, removing the need for expensive cargo handling equipment in the unloading port.|$|E

Progress spacecraft have flown re-supply missions since 1978. Nikolai Bryukhanov, RKK Energia's deputy general designer, said in May 2005 that the Federal Space Agency had received a design for a new space system. According to him, the system's <b>operation</b> <b>principle</b> is completely different from that used by Progress. A launch vehicle first places a Parom reusable inter-orbit [...] "tug" [...] into a 200 km orbit. As this spacecraft will not carry any consignments, other rockets will orbit payload containers that will be docked by Parom. The tug will then deliver them to the ISS or another orbiter.|$|E
5000|$|The Coandă {{effect is}} used in dual-pattern fluid {{dispensers}} in automobile windshield washers. The <b>operation</b> <b>principle</b> of oscillatory flowmeters also relies on the Coandă phenomenon. The incoming liquid enters a chamber that contains two [...] "islands." [...] Due to the Coandă effect, the main stream splits up and goes {{under one of the}} islands. This flow then feeds itself back into the main stream making it split up again, but {{in the direction of the}} second isle. This process repeats itself as long as the liquid circulates the chamber, resulting in a self-induced oscillation that is directly proportional to the velocity of the liquid and consequently the volume of substance flowing through the meter. A sensor picks up the frequency of this oscillation and transforms it into an analog signal yielding volume passing through.|$|E
50|$|The MAMI {{accelerator}} {{consists of}} four cascaded microtrons, an injector linac, a thermal source for unpolarized electrons and a laser-driven source for electrons with 80% spin polarization. The <b>operation</b> <b>principle</b> {{is based on the}} continuous wave (cw) microtron technique. There thebeam is recirculated many times through a normal-conduction linear accelerating structurewith a moderate energy gain per turn. Due to constant, homogenous magnetic bending fields the length of the beam path is increasing with energy after each turn. The magnetic fields, the radio-frequency (rf)used to accelerate the electrons and the energy gain per turnhave to be adjusted to meet the microtron coherence condition, i.e. the condition that the length of each path is an integer factor of the rf wavelength. This microtron scheme makes efficient use of the rf power and the inherent strong longitudinal phase focussing guarantees excellent beam quality and stability.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, {{they started}} {{work on the}} new pistol, at the Łucznik Arms Factory in Radom, Poland. It was {{intended}} primarily for the Polish Army, to replace both the obsolete P-64 and the P-83 Wanad pistols. The obvious caliber choice was the more powerful, NATO standard 9×19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger), to replace the old 9×18mm Makarov. Since the Army had not worked out technical conditions for a pistol by then, the factory worked them out on its own, and decided to design a pistol of a classic construction, utilizing {{the experience of the}} world's best designs. The lead designer was Marian Gryszkiewicz. The gun was designed by late 1993. In 1994 prototypes were tested, and an information series appeared in 1995.

5000|$|In {{optical sensor}} systems, {{problems}} occur {{due to the}} <b>operation</b> <b>principle</b> through the scattered light of the open arc. Therefore, measuring in the working point directly is in most cases not possible when optical sensors are used, a certain advance/distance must be maintained. Further process trouble stems from weld spatters which may exert a negative influence on the detection results. Screening systems between sensor and torch provide a remedy to a certain extent. The direct observation of the arc with special cameras for process monitoring remain an exception.The running of the sensor {{in front of the}} arc causes the limited accessibility of corners in the parts. In order to reduce this problem, a design/structure which is as compact as possible and a short advance distance are most important. The pre-defined orientation of the sensor is, moreover, restricting the working space of the robot. For untroubled operation of the optical components also stronger soiling/impurification (dust and deposition of weld fume particles) should be avoided, if possible. Exchangeable protective glasses and safety screens in the form of compressed air curtains provide a remedy. The quality of the surface which is to be measured has substantial influence on the measuring result. If the surface is strongly reflecting, unwanted reflection and faulty measurements may occur, lustreless surfaces are less difficult. Ever-changing surface qualities also lead to problems.Since optical systems are equipped with semiconductor detectors and comprehensive electronics, it is most important to pay attention to safe electro-magnetic screening. This applies to the sensor, the image processing unit and the connecting cables thereof. Sensor systems with active laser illumination are reacting particularly sensitive to strong temperature fluctuations since the emitted light wavelength of the used laser diodes depends on the temperature of the laser. If the ambient temperature and thus the wavelength of the active illumination are changing, the light is no longer capable to penetrate through the narrow-band optical filter to the photodetector. Therefore, appropriate screening against the welding process or the cooling of the sensor head is required. Depending on the applied laser power, particular caution must be taken when sensors with active illumination are applied. The wavelength of the applied systems are often in the field of vision, which means the classification into the hazard classes 3A and 3B. The respective accident prevention regulations must be strictly adhered to.The application of optical sensors demands the consideration of following points: ...|$|E
