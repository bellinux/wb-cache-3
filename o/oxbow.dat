5|$|Northern Bloomsburg and Scott Township {{include a}} small <b>oxbow</b> lake of Fishing Creek; {{the area around}} this lake {{is known as the}} Turkey Hill <b>Oxbow.</b> The lake is located between Interstate 80 and the forests on the side of Turkey Hill. The <b>oxbow</b> is on a flood plain and {{includes}} grasses, forested wetlands, and areas of open water. In wet periods of the year, the Turkey Hill <b>Oxbow</b> lake receives overflow from the waters of Fishing Creek while during dry periods it contains water in only a few places.|$|E
5|$|Three weeks later, Lukas entered <b>Oxbow</b> in Oaklawn Park's key preparatory {{race for}} the Arkansas Derby, the Grade II Rebel Stakes. For {{the fourth time in}} five races, <b>Oxbow</b> started on the far outside at post ten. He went off as the {{favorite}} {{for the second time in}} his career, at 4–1. Lukas switched Jon Court to ride stablemate Will Take Charge, and <b>Oxbow</b> was given yet another jockey, Mike Smith. <b>Oxbow</b> was third out of the gate. He took the lead down the backstretch and stayed in front until the end of the race where he was narrowly defeated by Will Take Charge. <b>Oxbow</b> lost by half a head, but earned his first triple-digit speed figure at 101, along with 20 Derby qualification points. After the Rebel Stakes, <b>Oxbow</b> was ranked as one of the top ten horses in some Triple Crown pre-race polls, and secured eligibility to run in the Derby with 36 points.|$|E
5|$|Five weeks later, <b>Oxbow</b> {{was entered}} in the Grade II mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) Risen Star Stakes. Ridden {{for the third time}} by Jon Court, <b>Oxbow</b> was {{assigned}} the far outside post at number ten, and was the second favorite at 4–1. He broke fifth from the gate, moved to third passing the stands, but lost ground by being five horses wide around the first turn. In the stretch, <b>Oxbow</b> took the lead but could not hold it and finished fourth, although he and the three top-placed horses all ended the race within a length and a half of each other in a blanket finish. The winner was I've Struck a Nerve, at odds of 135–1. <b>Oxbow</b> again progressed in performance, earning a speed figure of 98 and five more points toward Derby qualification.|$|E
40|$|The Upper Tisza {{floodplain}} region {{provides a}} mosaic of aquatic habitats including a series of <b>oxbows.</b> Inorganic contaminants can accumulate in the sediment; thus, the sediment is good indicator of the contamination of these <b>oxbows.</b> Our aim was to explore the effects of anthropogenic activities on the concentration of ele- ments and also to study the influence of vegetation types on the element in surface sediment of <b>oxbows.</b> We studied eight oxbows: {{two of them were}} protected, four of them were used for fishing and two of them were contaminated with domestic sewage. The following el- ements were measured with MP-AES in surface sedi- ment: Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn. The elemental concentration was compared to the toxicity classes of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the as- sessment of the level of toxicity was based on this comparison. We found that studied <b>oxbows</b> were differ- ent from each other based on the elemental concentra- tions of sediment using canonical discriminant analysis and analysis of variance. Based on the elemental con- centration in surface sediment of <b>oxbows,</b> separation was also found among vegetation types. But significant difference was not found in the concentrations of ele- ments based on vegetation types. Our results demon- strated that the anthropogenic activities had remarkable effects on the elemental concentration of surface sedi- ment in <b>oxbows.</b> Our findings suggest that the sediment is useful to assess the effects of anthropogenic activities on elemental concentrations of <b>oxbows...</b>|$|R
40|$|Our aim was {{to study}} the effects of {{short-term}} weather fluctuations on the quality of <b>oxbows,</b> based on the physico-chemical parameters of the water. The present study explored the effect of precipitation, temperature, and the water level of the main river on the quality of <b>oxbows.</b> We assessed the quality of four <b>oxbows</b> in the Upper Tisza region (north Hungary) over a two-year period. Water samples were collected in the summer in 2011 and 2012, and 12 physico-chemical parameters were investigated. We found positive correlations between the dissolved oxygen, water temperature, concentration of hydro carbonate, nitrate, pH, conductivity and the average temperature. Canonical discriminant analysis showed that the studied <b>oxbows</b> were similar in 2011 and 2012, based on physico-chemical parameters. Significant {{differences were found between the}} years, in terms of the water temperature, the content of suspended solids, and the concentrations of carbonate and chloride. Our results show that only short-term weather changes such as less precipitation and higher temperature cause the quality of <b>oxbows</b> to deteriorate. Our results demonstrated that the water quality of <b>oxbows</b> is influenced by the River Tisza, because the decrease in the water level of the Tisza was also responsible for the differences between the years, based on the physical-chemical parameters of the water...|$|R

5|$|Fourteen horses {{started at}} the 2013 Belmont Stakes. <b>Oxbow</b> drew the number seven post position, with rival Orb at post five. There were {{concerns}} about Stevens' fitness as he had missed races after being thrown from a horse the previous week, but medical tests {{showed no sign of}} injury. <b>Oxbow</b> was the third favorite at 5–1 on the morning line, but by race time his odds were at 10–1.|$|E
5|$|After Oxbow's maiden win, he {{was flown}} to Hollywood Park in California {{to run in}} the Grade I CashCall Futurity at a mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) on a {{synthetic}} surface. He was the longest shot in the field at 61–1, and drew the far outside post at number eleven. Ridden by Corey Nakatani, his fifth jockey in five races, <b>Oxbow</b> broke well coming out the gate. He ran close to the front throughout the race, despite losing ground by being four horses wide around the first turn and three wide around the final turn. <b>Oxbow</b> finished fourth, nine lengths back, but earned his first Road to the Kentucky Derby point, and a speed figure of 87.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oxbow</b> (foaled March 26, 2010), an American Thoroughbred racehorse, is {{best known}} for winning the second jewel in the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, the 2013 Preakness Stakes.

5|$|The second-place {{finish in}} the Belmont earned <b>Oxbow</b> $200,000 and pushed him over the $1million mark in career earnings, making him the third horse in 2013 to reach $1million in purse wins, behind Orb and a fellow Awesome Again son, the six-year-old gelding Game On Dude. Although the $1million bonus for the horse winning the highest {{combined}} Triple Crown points has long been discontinued, <b>Oxbow</b> would have won it over Orb owing to his win in the Preakness and second in the Belmont. Further, his placing in the Belmont put him at {{number one in the}} post-Belmont June 10 NTRA poll of top three-year-olds, and in the top ten for race horses of all ages.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} wildflower {{species in the}} uplands and rock outcroppings of the Turkey Hill <b>Oxbow.</b> These include white baneberry, northern maidenhair fern, spikenard, blue cohosh, foamflower, false Solomon's seal, purple trillium, and wild columbine. Animals inhabiting the areas surrounding the pools include pickerel frogs, green frogs, wood ducks, and snapping turtles. Plants in this location include broadleaf arrowhead, northern blueflag, manna grasses, water starwort, and several varieties of sedges. Japanese knotweed has been seen near Interstate 80 on the northern edges of the Turkey Hill <b>Oxbow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the other}} crested newt species, the Danube crested newt is more adapted to life along a river system and {{frequently}} occurs in flowing water and together with fish. Typical breeding sites are slow-flowing river margins, <b>oxbow</b> lakes, flooded marshland, larger ponds, or ditches, provided abundant underwater vegetation is available. During land phase, the newts live in deciduous forests or groves, bushlands, or meadows.|$|E

5|$|<b>Oxbow</b> {{was moved}} {{with the rest}} of Lukas' horses to winter {{headquarters}} at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth choice at 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was the front-runner throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, but then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who <b>Oxbow</b> faced again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who had just returned to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride <b>Oxbow</b> in future races.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oxbow</b> was {{represented}} by his first winner on July 16, 2017 when filly Delaphene took a mile-long maiden race at Arlington Park by 3 1/2 lengths. The filly, out of the Empire Maker mare Boustierre, was making her second start. The filly is bred and owned by Calumet Farm.|$|E
40|$|The Tisza River {{is a large}} {{tributary}} of the Danube River. The largest reservoir of the river is the Kisköre reservoir, and there are furthermore {{a great number of}} <b>oxbows</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} river. In February and early spring 2000 serious amounts of cyanide and heavy metal pollution were spilled into the Tisza River. The Kisköre Reservoir of the Tisza was less polluted than the river itself. However, the four <b>oxbows</b> investigated were flooded by the Tisza River in April 2000. Epiphytic diatom samples were taken in February and October 2000 along the Tisza River, in November and December 2000 at the Kisköre Reservoir and in May and July 1996, October 2000 and June 2001 at the four Tisza <b>oxbows.</b> The aims of this study were to obtain preliminary data about the species composition of the attached diatoms of these waters, to evaluate the impact of the pollution on epiphytic diatoms and to evaluate the natural protection value of these waters. Epiphyton of the Tisza River was dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum, Amphora pediculus, Cocconeis placentula, Diatoma moniliformis in February and by Achnanthidium minutissimum and several Nitzschia spp. in October. A number of teratological frustules were observed. In the Kisköre reservoir, Amphora pediculus, Cocconeis pediculus, C. placentula, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Gomphonema angustum, Nitzschia dissipata were dominant. In 1996 Staurosira, Staurosirella and Navicula species dominated in the <b>oxbows,</b> whereas in 2000 Aulacoseira distans, Achanthidium minutissimum and Nitzschia spp. became dominant. Based on results from the literature, we are of the opinion that the characteristic Achnanthidium minutissimum - Nitzschia spp. dominance of the Tisza River and the <b>oxbows</b> is partly due to the heavy metal pollution. A number of endangered species, two new elements for the Hungarian diatom flora - Navicula austrocollegarum and Navicula streckerae - and two probably invasive species, Diadesmis confervacea and Didymosphenia geminata were found...|$|R
