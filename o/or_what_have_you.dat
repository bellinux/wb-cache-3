25|$|The {{rotating}} observer {{sees the}} walker travel {{a straight line}} {{from the center of the}} carousel to the periphery, as shown in Figure 5. Moreover, the rotating observer sees that the walker moves at a constant speed in the same direction, so applying Newton's law of inertia, there is zero force upon the walker. These conclusions do not agree with the inertial observer. To obtain agreement, the rotating observer has to introduce fictitious forces that appear to exist in the rotating world, even though there is no apparent reason for them, no apparent gravitational mass, electric charge <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> that could account for these fictitious forces.|$|E
25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you?</b> This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E

If not for your own sake, then for mine, let us depart from this doomed house, where I profess I have not the heart to leave you; and then, if you will take my advice, and if your {{determination}} be sincere, you will instantly quit this city, where no further occupation can detain you.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Bridgenorth {{interrupted}} {{him with a}} grim smile; for such it seemed, as it passed over a face of deep melancholy. [...] "My daughter well said, but short while past, {{that you were a}} dreamer of dreams--an architect of plans and hopes fantastic as the visions of the night. It is a great thing you ask of me;--the hand of my only child--the sum of my worldly substance, though that is but dross in comparison. You ask the key of the only fountain from which I may yet hope to drink one pleasant draught; you ask to be the sole and absolute keeper of my earthly happiness--and what have you offered, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> to offer in return, for the surrender you require of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then that's {{just what}} you ought not to do, Mr Cradell," [...] said Mrs Roper. And now {{the lady of the}} house spoke out her mind with much {{maternal}} dignity and with some feminine severity. [...] "That's just what a young man like you has no business to know. What's a married woman like that to you, or you to her; <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> to do with understanding her position? When you've a wife of your own, if ever you do have one, you'll find you'll have trouble enough then without anybody else interfering with you. Not but what I believe you're innocent as a lamb about Mrs Lupex; that is, as far as any harm goes. But you've got yourself into all this trouble by meddling, and was like enough to get yourself choked upstairs by that man. And who's to wonder when you go on pretending to be in love with a woman in that way, and she old enough to be your mother? What would your mamma say if she saw you at it?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Similar {{artists to}} Angels and Agony are VNV Nation, Assemblage 23, and Covenant. A 2007 {{interview}} {{commented on the}} musical style of the band, noting that, in contrast with many electro-industrial projects whose lyrics center on violence and provocation, Angels and Agony songs are philosophical and humanist in character. To this Renier replied: [...] "The lyrics {{are meant to be}} 'universal', multi-interpretable and objective, in a way.... I'm just not the guy to write songs, singing 'Fuck' 116 times in 4 minutes, or singing I'd like to cut up my bitch <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> not." [...] Metropolis Records describes the band's music thus: [...] "Although the music can be dark and melancholic, but still danceable with pumping beats and sequences, the songs have a very positive message." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{precepts of}} social decorum as we {{understand}} them, of the preservation of external decency, were consciously set by Lord Chesterfield, who {{was looking for a}} translation of les moeurs: [...] "Manners are too little, morals are too much." [...] The word decorum survives in Chesterfield's severely reduced form as an element of etiquette: the prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within a set situation. The use of this word in this sense is of the sixteenth-century, prescribing the boundaries established in drama and literature, used by Roger Ascham, The Scholemaster (1570) and echoed in Malvolio's tirade in Twelfth Night, [...] "My masters, are you mad, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> are <b>you?</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> no wit, manners nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?...Is there no respect of persons, place nor time in you?" ...|$|R

5000|$|At an {{interview}} alongside Bill Gates at the 5th All Things Digital conference in 2007, Steve Jobs further described a concept similar to Gates' [...] "PC Plus" [...] {{known as a}} [...] "post-PC device"; [...] "a category of devices that aren't as general purpose, that are really more focused on specific functions, whether they're phones or iPods or Zunes <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you.</b> And I think that category of devices {{is going to continue}} to be very innovative and we're going to see lots of them". Jobs felt that despite these developments, PCs would [...] "continue to be with us and morph with us, whether it's a tablet or a notebook or, you know, a big curved desktop that you have at your house or whatever it might be." [...] Gates suggested the prevalence of multiple form factors for such devices, including full-sized tablets, small phones, and 10-foot experiences for the living room.|$|E
5000|$|Dave: [...] "You {{know when}} you have a {{cockroach}} and they run round the house and get into a corner? We used to have these shoes called PRFCs - Puerto Rican Fence Climbers, okay? And this was aptly titled because if you were running from the police <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> and you were wearing your PRFCs, you could hit the fence at a dead run and your foot would stay in and you could commence climbing immediately, which was the essence of the whole sport anyway. And these were also great shoes for when the cockroach moves into the corner and you can't get at it with your foot or the broom anymore. You just jam your toe into the corner and hit as hard as you can. And if you did it right you got the full bug. So this slang means &#8212; bammm! &#8212; you have to give it everything you've got. Make the maximum effort, do everything possible, get the full bug." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{packaging}} of Take it {{from the}} Man! prominently features the Union Jack, reflecting the British influence on the album, and the American flag reflecting the band's home nation. Thrasher wrote an essay on his preference for analogue recording over digital recording in the liner notes. After a Vendetta Mag journalist told Newcombe he [...] "especially loved" [...] the essay, Newcombe stated [...] "I really like getting together with my friends and writing that kind of stuff. We just talk about ideas. So many people don't even have a clue why they're doing stuff or they can't tell you. They won't admit it. I really love music and I want to put out stuff that isn't out there. I don't care what people think...if they think it's derivative or invoking a certain time period <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you.</b> I'm just doing it because it's the music I like. It doesn't exist unless I animate it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Superboy-Prime {{claims that}} he is better than Kal-El, and that his Krypton was {{superior}} to Kal-El's.
