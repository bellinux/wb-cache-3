Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0.3 to 0.4) between brain volume and IQ. The most consistent associations are observed within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the hippocampi, and the cerebellum, but these only account for a relatively small amount <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> IQ, which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real-world performance.|$|E
5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

25|$|Genetics {{and family}} history (e.g., parental anxiety) may {{predispose}} an individual for {{an increased risk}} of an anxiety disorder, but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation. Genetic differences account for about 43% <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> panic disorder and 28% in generalized anxiety disorder. Although single genes are neither necessary nor sufficient for anxiety by themselves, several gene polymorphisms have been found to correlate with anxiety: PLXNA2, SERT, CRH, COMT and BDNF. Several of these genes influence neurotransmitters (such as serotonin and norepinephrine) and hormones (such as cortisol) which are implicated in anxiety. The epigenetic signature of {{at least one of these}} genes BDNF has also been associated with anxiety and specific patterns of neural activity.|$|E

Method: Undergraduate students (N[*]=[*] 180, 54 males, 126 females, 60 per year of study) completed baseline measures of demographic variables, binge-drinking episodes (BDE), TPB constructs and anticipated regret. BDE were assessed one-week later. Results: The TPB accounted for 60 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> female undergraduates' intentions and 54 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> male undergraduates' intentions. The TPB accounted for 57 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> intentions in first-year undergraduates, 63 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> intentions in second-year undergraduates and 68 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> intentions in final-year undergraduates. Follow-up BDE was predicted by intentions and baseline BDE for female undergraduates as well as second- and final-year undergraduates. Baseline BDE predicted male undergraduates’ follow-up BDE and first-year undergraduates’ follow-up BDE. Conclusion: Results show that while the TPB constructs predict undergraduates’ binge-drinking intentions, intentions only predict BDE in female undergraduates, second- and final-year undergraduates. Implications of these findings for interventions to reduce binge drinking are outlined...|$|R

In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} phylogenetic, life history and environmental factors on seed germination of 134 common species from an alpine/subalpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. In one-way ANOVAs, phylogenetic groups (at or above order) explained 13. 0 % and 25. 9 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> germination percentage and mean germination time, respectively; life history attributes, such as seed size, dispersal mode, explained 3. 7 %, 2. 1 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> germination percentage and 6. 3 %, 8. 7 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> mean germination time, respectively; the environmental factors temperature and habitat explained 4. 7 %, 1. 0 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> germination percentage and 13. 5 %, 1. 7 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> mean germination time, respectively.

2500|$|Heritability {{is defined}} as the {{proportion}} <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> a trait which is attributable to genotype within a defined population in a specific environment. A number of points must be considered when interpreting heritability. [...] Heritability, as a term, applies to populations, and in populations there are variations in traits between individuals. [...] Heritability measures how much of that variation is caused by genetics. [...] The value of heritability can change if the impact of environment (or of genes) in the population is substantially altered. A high heritability of a trait does not mean environmental effects, such as learning, are not involved. Since heritability increases during childhood and adolescence, one should be cautious drawing conclusions regarding the role of genetics and environment from studies where the participants are not followed until they are adults.|$|E

2500|$|An example {{this method}} is in the {{prediction}} of college grade point average (GPA) where high school GPA and admissions test scores (e.g., SAT, ACT) usually account for a large proportion <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> college GPA. The use of admissions tests is supported by incremental validity evidence. For example, the pre-2000 SAT correlated [...]34 with freshman GPA while high school GPA correlated [...]36 with freshman GPA. It might seem that both measures are strong predictors of freshman GPA, but in fact high school GPA and SAT scores are also strongly correlated, {{so we need to}} test for how much predictive power we get from the SAT when we account for high school GPA. The incremental validity is indicated by the change in R-square when high school GPA included in the model. In this case, high school GPA accounts for 13% of the variance in freshman GPA and the combination of high school GPA plus SAT accounts for 20% of the variance in freshman GPA. Therefore, the SAT adds 7 percentage points to our predictive power. If this is significant and deemed an important improvement, then we can say that the SAT has incremental validity over using high school GPA alone to predict freshman GPA. Any new admissions criterion or test must add additional predictive power (incremental validity) in order to be useful in predicting college GPA when high school GPA and test scores are already known.|$|E
