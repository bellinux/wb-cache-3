They were led by McNall in Toronto, Larry Ryckman in Calgary, and Glieberman in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|The theatre reputedly {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} under the Brars. In 1998, the Princess was called “an absolutely lousy advertisement for late 20th century privatization” by Magic Lantern Theatre’s Rick Ostapchuk, {{who said that}} the current <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> allowed the theatre to sink “with the velocity, if not the sanitized H20, of a waterslide”. By his count, 170 of the marquee’s 330 lights were burnt out, and he did not believe the interior had been regularly washed or maintained.|$|E

5000|$|Usually the {{claimant}} is actually making, using, selling, offering {{to sell or}} importing or is prepared to actually make, use or sell, offer to sell or import an allegedly infringing device or method, and usually the patent <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> claimed that such activities by claimant will result in patent infringement. [...] An express threat of litigation is not needed, {{nor is it a}} guarantee that jurisdiction will be granted.

5|$|By 2November, all owners, {{except the}} two {{environmental}} organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, had sold their shares to NSB.

Prior to the meeting, the other minority <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do. Several municipalities were concerned that they would lose even more money {{if they did not}} sell. The other minority owners agreed to cover the costs of the two environmental organizations, and let them make the principal stand to oppose the liquidation.|$|E

In 1988, NSB decided to organize {{the operation of the}} dining services through tendered contracts; the first contract (from 1990 through 1995) was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary. The <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> an agreement that neither could sell without the approval of the other. In 1995 NSB sold its shares with Fritt Ord's approval, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|Other legal {{troubles}} {{were left}} over in {{wake of the}} expansion collapse. Louisiana courts eventually ordered the Gliebermans to repay Shreveport US$1 million with interest; the dispute centered over whether the city had agreed to share losses or simply lent money to the ownership group. Art Williams, enraged after discovering some American <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> received discounts and extended payment periods on their franchise fees, threatened litigation and at first refused to honour the balance of Matt Dunigan's sizable contract before the matter was dragged through court.|$|E
5|$|The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a suit {{to enforce}} the treaty rights of the tribe.

Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.|$|E

5|$|To {{counter the}} {{influence}} of union radicals in the Industrial Workers of the World, Disque sponsored an alternative union based on patriotism and labor–management cooperation. The new union, the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, was established in 1917 and put {{under the leadership of}} Portland attorney Captain Maurice E. Crumpacker, who would later serve as a U.S. Congressman. The union was initially opposed by both labor and mill owners, but due to Disque's strong advocacy, within six months nearly all of the mill <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> agreed to support the union; by October 1918, it had 125,000members. In fact, the union lasted 20 years longer than the Spruce Production Division.|$|E
5|$|When One Meridian Plaza {{was built}} Philadelphia was {{enforcing}} a building code from 1949 that made {{no distinction between}} high-rises and other buildings. In 1984 Philadelphia adopted new codes that required automatic sprinkler systems in all new buildings. At the time of construction, sprinklers were only built on the service levels below ground. In 1988 plans {{were put in place}} to have automatic sprinklers placed throughout the building by November 1993. By 1991 four floors were completely protected by sprinklers and in part on three other floors. The sprinklers had been installed during floor renovations at the request of tenants and the building's <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> plans to install more as other floors were renovated.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Bouchard's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the {{championship}} for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low, often less than 3,000 a game, and {{there was talk of}} folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or {{near the bottom of the}} league for several years, apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey life. In his first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{anticipated}} that Labour would legislate for two years, then seek {{a general election}} and be returned with {{a majority of the}} seats. Were this to occur, he would be 67 when that term expired, and according to him perhaps too old to hold office. With no ministerial responsibilities, he departed on a three-month tour of East Africa, hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as Colonial Secretary. As the minority Labour Government attempted to grapple with the onset of the Depression, the Conservative Party indulged in a period of internecine warfare, with Baldwin under attack in the Parliamentary Party and in the press for losing the election, and for being too moderate. Chamberlain attempted to mediate between the press lords and Baldwin, only to learn that the newspaper <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> been trying to influence local constituency organisations behind his back. During the leadership crisis, Chamberlain persuaded Conservative Party chairman John Davidson to resign to relieve the pressure on Baldwin. Chamberlain took the vacant chair himself.|$|E
5|$|One Foot used Bournemouth to film some {{exterior}} sequences {{because of}} its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the housenear Pokesdown, Bournemouthwhich had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed hands and the new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees that the previous <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided {{to find a new}} house, and the first episode of the second series was rewritten to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire (Filmed on waste ground in Northcote Road, Springbourne). This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.|$|E
5|$|The October 17 {{press release}} set November 21, 2006 as the North American {{distribution}} {{date for the}} Xbox 360 and PC versions of Knights of the Nine. The European release for the Xbox 360 and PC was set two days later, on November 23. The European release was co-published by Bethesda and Ubisoft. On November 9, 2006, Bethesda clarified earlier statements regarding PC releases, declaring that, although the boxed retail PC edition of Knights of the Nine was set for release on November 21, the PC release downloadable from the company website wouldn't be available until December 4. This caused some consumer complaints, for although the Xbox 360 release was available on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft Points (the equivalent of US$10.00, or GB£6.80), for the time being, PC <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> only the US$19.99 boxed retail edition of the game. The increased price of the PC's boxed retail release (The Elder Scrolls IV: Knights of Nine Oblivion Downloadable Content Collection) resulted from its inclusion of Oblivions other previously released downloadable content. Such content {{was not included in}} either the downloadable PC release, the Xbox Marketplace download, or the PlayStation 3 edition of Oblivion. The downloadable release was ultimately issued on December 6 at the price of US$9.99. According to IGN Entertainment's GamerMetrics, a service based on compiled visitor activity information on IGN's website, the pack was the fourth most anticipated release of its release week, following , Superman Returns and College Hoops 2K7.|$|E

5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the <b>owners</b> <b>had</b> bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E
