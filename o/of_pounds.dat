5|$|After the Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707 where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large prize of £20,000, equivalent to millions <b>of</b> <b>pounds</b> today, {{for anyone who}} could determine longitude accurately.

40|$|The texture <b>of</b> <b>pounded</b> yam is {{the main}} {{attribute}} of this traditional dish, one of the preferred ways of consuming yam in West Africa. We integrated functional properties and cell microstructure to describe or predict the textural quality <b>of</b> <b>pounded</b> yam. The firmness and adhesiveness <b>of</b> <b>pounded</b> yam prepared from six cultivars were measured. In parallel, the thermo-mechanical properties (DMA, DSC) and starch behaviour were also determined while the structure of raw, cooked and pounded yam was observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Light Microscopy and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy. No significant correlation was found linking DMA, DSC measurements with the textural quality <b>of</b> <b>pounded</b> yam (adhesiveness, firmness). Conversely, multiple regressions showed that 75 % {{of the variation in}} firmness could be explained by the dry matter, soluble starch and amylose content <b>of</b> the <b>pounded</b> yam. In addition, CLSM revealed a thicker cell wall in Florido, a cultivar known for its bad pounding ability. We hypothesize that pectin, the major component of cell wall middle lamella, plays a role in the textural quality <b>of</b> <b>pounded</b> yam. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds <b>of</b> <b>pounds.</b> This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands <b>of</b> <b>pounds</b> were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E

Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people, requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water, and electricity supply.

5|$|In {{the late}} autumn of 1808, the French Navy {{despatched}} four large frigates to the East Indies. These ships, stationed on Île de France and Île Bonaparte, {{were ordered to}} attack and disrupt British trade routes from the Far East, in particular British India. This disruption was intended to have a negative financial effect on the British economy and force the Royal Navy to send ships into the Indian Ocean, expending valuable resources in doing so. The commander of this French force was Commodore Jacques Hamelin, a highly skilled officer who ordered his frigates to disperse in the Bay of Bengal to hunt British East Indiamen, large and well armed merchant ships that carried millions <b>of</b> <b>pounds</b> worth of goods between Britain and her Empire ever year.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, French privateers and naval frigates operating from the fortified island bases of Île de France and Île Bonaparte had attacked British shipping in the Indian Ocean. The huge distances involved, restrictions on supplies and the presence of Royal Navy warships and heavily armed East Indiamen had prevented these relatively weak French ships from attacking the convoys that transported millions <b>of</b> <b>pounds</b> worth of goods from British India and the Far East to the United Kingdom. When one French squadron under Admiral Linois had tried to seize a convoy in 1805, it had been driven off by the aggressive tactics of the merchant captains.|$|E
