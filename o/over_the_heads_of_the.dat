5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 {{gathered}} and threatened to {{set fire to the}} area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.|$|E

A throw-in to Revie led to interplay {{on the right}} wing involving Barnes, Dyson, and Johnstone, resulting in a through-ball which put Dyson clear of the defence to score. Two minutes later, Trautmann collected the ball {{at the end of}} a Birmingham attack and kicked the ball long to Dyson, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retreating Birmingham players. Dyson flicked the ball on to Bobby Johnstone, who scored Manchester City's third, becoming the first player ever to score in consecutive Wembley finals in the process.|$|E

25|$|On April25, a {{majority}} of voters expressed confidence in the president and called for new legislative elections. Yeltsin termed the results a mandate for him to continue in power. Before the referendum, Yeltsin had promised to resign, if the electorate failed to express confidence in his policies. Although this permitted the president to declare that the population supported him, not the parliament, Yeltsin lacked a constitutional mechanism to implement his victory. As before, {{the president had to}} appeal to the people <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislature.|$|E
25|$|At 13.59 in {{an attempt}} to {{distract}} the anti-aircraft gunners, Sergente Maggiore Luigi Valotti, flying a Fiat CR.42 of 354 Squadriglia, started performing aerobatics <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> astounded ships gunners, who after a while started to shoot at him. He lasted six minutes before he was shot down and killed. Further attacks were unable to get through the anti-aircraft barrage and the Italian aircraft flew back to base, landing at 15.50 pursued by the Ark Royals Fulmars, which strafed the airfield at Cagliari (Sardinia), damaging ten seaplanes and causing three casualties.|$|E

25|$|Holliday was {{reported}} to have been involved in a shooting on the Withlacoochee River, Georgia, in 1873. At age 22, Holliday went with some friends to their favorite swimming hole, but discovered it was occupied by a group of black youths. Holliday and his companions told them to leave, but they refused. Accounts of this event vary. Holliday left and returned carrying either a shotgun or a pistol and started shooting, either at or <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> youths. Some of them may have shot back. There are no contemporaneous accounts of the incident. Some family members and friends allege that Holliday killed one to three of the youths, but other members of Holliday's family dispute those accounts.|$|E
25|$|Penderel Moon simply {{attributes}} the League's {{rise to power}} to the alluring and irresistible appeal of the Pakistan cry to the Muslim masses. Peter Hardy's explained that the Muslim League gained its electoral success in the Punjab by making a religious appeal <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professional politicians. Pakistani historians have explained the League's success in the Punjab, as elsewhere in the subcontinent, solely {{in terms of the}} Two Nation Theory. Whatever the historians may suggest, one thing is clear that League's success was due to the political vision, farsightedness of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a man of high personal integrity and intelligence who became a Grandmaster of the game by his clever, and clever calculations.|$|E

Viola Meskin tried to run to a door but was intercepted by a terrorist with a gun who turned her back. Austrian passenger Anna Hoeranter ran to an exit but was pushed down an adjacent flight of stairs by one of the terrorists. Other passengers ran in a panic from the dining room into the kitchen and were chased by one of the terrorists. Inside the kitchen the pursuing terrorist beat two of the kitchen staff to the floor.|$|E

25|$|The long through ball: This is a long, {{and usually}} high, pass from a teams' own half, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other team's defence. It is {{intended}} for the attacking players to chase {{and it is important}} that they remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic works best with strong and fast forwards who will {{have a good chance of}} winning back the ball, taking control over it, and eventually getting a shot on goal. In the diagram, the ball (red line) is played in front of the furthermost forward, the dotted blue line showing their run. In this example, a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one of the defenders (black team) because the gap between the two central defenders is too small.|$|E
25|$|Believing {{the state}} {{needed to take}} on a greater moral role, Cruce {{supported}} enforcement of blue laws. Through specific legislation, Cruce and the state legislature closed businesses on Sundays, and declared prize fighting, gambling, bootlegging and horseracing illegal. This, combined with Haskell's prohibition plan, proved too much for the state to handle. The state legislature did not possess the funds needed to finance the operations and only ended up shifting funds around from one law enforcement agency to another. Cruce, on numerous occasions, in his role as Commander-in-Chief, called out the state militia to enforce his laws. The most famous of these events occurred when Cruce declared martial law in Tulsa to prevent a horserace from taking place. The race was brought to a halt as shots were fired <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jockeys.|$|E
25|$|The final assault {{began at}} 10:55 am on 31 August when James Leith's 5th Division rushed the main breach {{from the south}} while Thomas Bradford's Portuguese brigade stormed the smaller one from the east. After running the {{gauntlet}} of mines and small-arms fire, both columns reached the tops of their respective breaches and came under murderous fire. After enduring the one-sided slaughter for nearly 30 minutes, both columns retreated {{to the base of}} the wall where the troops hugged the ground to escape the intense fire. In this emergency, Graham ordered his siege guns to fire <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surviving attackers. This expedient saved the day for the Allies, as the fire ripped apart the inner defenses, inflicting heavy losses on the French. As some of the 5th Division managed to make progress, an accident set off a store of bombs, killing 60 Frenchmen and injuring many more.|$|E

25|$|The Armstrong gun—mainly the 12 pounder—was used {{extensively}} in the 1863 conflict in New Zealand between British troops and Maori in the Waikato. A well preserved 12-pounder which {{was used in the}} battle of Rangiriri is at the Te Awamutu museum. The barrel can traverse 6 degrees left or right without moving the gun carriage. The wheels are wooden with a 75mm wide steel band. The wheel diameter is 1.7 m. The track width is 1.8 m. Barrel width at the muzzle is 140mm. Such was the confidence of the army in the accuracy of the gun that at the battle of Hairini Ridge the artillery was fired <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advancing infantry as they stormed the ridge. The infantry took cover in a slight depression in {{the ground in front of}} the Maori trenches and then stormed the trenches when the shelling stopped.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the volunteers}} work in the visitor center helping to answer {{questions}} brought up by visitors. Restoration projects {{in the form of}} the removal of invasive plants or creating wood duck boxes for wood ducks is also an option. Bird and raptor surveys are also done at least once a year to get a population estimate on birds of prey and waterfowl that migrate or live within the Cosumnes River Preserve. Other volunteer options are available such as working with the paddle team, leading guided nature walks, or helping with the mountain lion research team. The paddle team takes visitors on tours of the Cosumnes River throughout the year. Some of the paddle tours include the bat paddle which allows visitors to witness tens of thousands of Mexican Free Tail bats feed during sunset right <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visitors. The mountain lion research team gets to access closed parts of the preserve and places or checks game cameras to observe mountain lions that reside around the preserve. There are many other volunteer opportunities available at the Cosumnes River Preserve.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March 1813, Devon took {{eight men}} and his 12-year-old brother, Midshipman Frederick Devon, in Brev Dragerens gig. William Dunbar, Master of Blazer, took 11 men in Blazers cutter. Together the two boats went up river {{in search of}} a {{privateer}} reported to be in the area. Off the Danish port of Brunsbuttel they sighted two boats, one of which hailed them, ran up Danish colours and opened fire, fortunately <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British. Devon boarded the gunboat in the smoke of her second broadside, and possibly the explosion of some cartridges on her deck, and captured her. Blazers cutter came up and together the British sailors succeeded in imprisoning the Danish crew below deck. The gunboat {{turned out to be the}} Jonge-Troutman. She was under the command of Lieutenant Lutkin, had a crew of 25 men and carried two 18-pounders and three 12-pounders. Dunbar and the cutter then turned their attention to the second gunboat, the Liebe, and captured her too. She was under the command of Lieutenant Writt and had the same establishment as the Jonge-Troutman. The British suffered no casualties and the Danes suffered two wounded.|$|E

25|$|The {{two sides}} met {{throughout}} the day, and to everyone's surprise a tentative {{agreement was reached}} that evening. Although {{a majority of the}} steel workers appeared ready to accept the tentative agreement, a mob of 6,000 men formed on August 1 in downtown Scranton and resolved to reject it. When McKune appeared outside the mayor's office to try to calm the mob, shots were fired. McKune was clubbed and stoned. His lower jaw broken and his upper jaw fractured, McKune tried to flee but was knocked unconscious when a member of the mob hit him {{in the head with a}} hammer. A few minutes later, the county sheriff and a hastily assembled posse arrived and fired shots <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd to try to disperse the mob. Several people in the crowd returned fire, wounding the sheriff and a member of the posse. The posse fired several volleys into the crowd, killing four and wounding around 20. Many of those killed and injured were shot in the back as they tried to flee. Mayor McKune, although badly injured, helped restore order around 2 p.m. The following day, 3,000 federal troops arrived from Pittsburgh and entered the city. Martial law was imposed, and the strike ended several uneventfully weeks later with no agreement. The sheriff and several posse members were arrested and tried on the charge of manslaughter, but were acquitted.|$|E
25|$|The England innings {{began with}} 10 extras from Jeff Thomson with Rod Marsh leaping behind the stumps in vain as one ball lifted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batsman and wicketkeeper for four. Thereafter wickets fell {{regularly}} with the Hillites cheering {{on the fast}} bowlers, but it was Max Walker (2/77) who made the breakthrough when he swung {{the ball to the}} edge of Dennis Amiss's bat to see it superbly caught by Mallett in the gully. Thomson took a surprisingly good catch to dismiss Lloyd off a Lillee bouncer and then beat Cowdrey three balls in a row before the master was caught by McCosker at short leg. This left England 69/3, but Edrich and Fletcher saw the day out safely enough. One ball from the captain was driven full into McCosker's face, knocking him unconscious for five minutes and he was helped off the field. Mallet was brought on {{at the end of the}} day, but asked to be taken off after one over because of his bruised had from that morning. Returning on the third day Thomson was bowling at his fastest and took 1/12 off five overs, having Edrich missed by Redpath in the slips, Greig caught by Greg Chappell and almost having Alan Knott out on the second, third and fourth balls he faced, dropped by Marsh, a caught behind not given and almost bowled by an inswinger. Fletcher was hit on the head by a bouncer and was caught by Redpath off Walker to leave England were 123/5, their top order failing again. After his escape Knott rode his luck and sliced 11 fours in an innings of 82, adding 57 with Edrich (50), 60 with Fred Titmus (22) and 33 with Derek Underwood (27). Knott and Underwood took 14 runs off one Lillee over and Ian Chappell had to set a defensive field for the first time in the series. The wicketkeeper was finally dismissed leaning back ready to cut the short ball and had his stumps flattened by a Thomson half-volley, but Lillee repeatedly bounced the tailenders and gave Bob Willis a beamer which fortunately missed his head. Willis was bowled by Thomson (4/74) and Lillee took the last wicket, having Underwood caught by Walker when he drove high into the covers. England were out for 295, having saved the follow on, which looked unlikely at one point, but still 110 runs behind.|$|E
