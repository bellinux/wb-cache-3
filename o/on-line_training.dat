His work led to several European research projects (ESPRIT) including projects in machine learning (autonomous vehicles) and methodologies for AI system development. As {{one of the}} first researchers in the area he began his research in Genetic Programming (GP) in 1992. GP is a type of evolutionary algorithm and a general automatic programming method that generates Turing complete algorithms - i.e. computers that write their own programs. In 1993, he started Dacapo AB, a research and development company. He invented a method for automatic induction of binary machine code using genetic programming and has devoted a large part of his research on how to produce machine code with genetic programming. In 1997 he co-founded the American company RML Technologies, Inc. with the first commercial GP software. Nordin spent a large portion of 1995 and 1996 at the University of Dortmund, where he completed his doctoral studies. At Dortmund University he initiated research in evolutionary robotics. and demonstrated {{for the first time that}} GP can be used for real-time, <b>on-line</b> <b>training</b> and control of robotic systems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} experimental autopilot-controlled landings {{in commercial}} service {{were not in}} fact full auto landings but were termed [...] "auto-flare". In this mode the pilot controlled the roll and yaw axes manually while the autopilot controlled the [...] "flare" [...] or pitch. These were often done in passenger service {{as part of the}} development program. The Trident's autopilot had separate engagement switches for the pitch and roll components, and although the normal autopilot disengagement was by means of a conventional control yoke thumb-button, it was also possible to disengage the roll channel while leaving the pitch channel engaged. In these operations the pilot had acquired full visual reference, normally well above decision height, but instead of fully disengaging the autopilot with the thumb-button, called for the second officer to latch off the roll channel only. He then controlled the lateral flight path manually while monitoring the autopilot's continued control of the vertical flight path - ready to completely disengage it {{at the first sign of}} any deviation. While this sounds as if it may add a risk element in practice it is of course no different in principle to a training pilot monitoring a trainee's handling during <b>on-line</b> <b>training</b> or qualification.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A robust {{speed control}} {{technique}} for permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives is proposed {{in this paper}} for electric vehicle applications. The robust controller consists of a neural-network controller (NNC) in the speed feed-back loop {{in addition to an}} <b>on-line</b> <b>trained</b> neural-network model-following controller (NNMFC) in the feedforward loop. The adaptive neural-network model-following controller (ANNMFC) combines the merits of the feed-back NNC and the feed-forward NNMFC for PMSM drive. The weights of the NNMFC are <b>trained</b> <b>on-line</b> according to the model-following error between the outputs of the reference model and the PMSM drive system to realize high dynamic performance in disturbance rejection and tracking characteristics. The NNMFC generates an adaptive control signal which is added to the feed-back neural-network speed controller output to attain robust model-following characteristics under different operating conditions regardless of parameter uncertainties and load disturbances. A computer simulation is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust ANNMFC. The results confirm that the proposed robust speed controller grants robust performance and precise tracking response to the reference model regardless of load disturbances and PMSM parameter uncertainties using the adaptive neural-network model-following control...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{approach is developed}} for designing adaptive and reconfigurable nonlinear control systems that are applicable to plants modeled by ordinary differential equations. The nonlinear controller comprising a network of neural networks is taught using a two-phase learning procedure realized through novel techniques for initialization, <b>on-line</b> <b>training,</b> and adaptive critic design. A critical observation is that the gradients of the functions defined by the neural networks must equal corresponding linear gain matrices at chosen operating points. <b>On-line</b> <b>training</b> {{is based on a}} dual heuristic adaptive critic architecture that improves control for large, coupled motions by accounting for actual plant dynamics and nonlinear effects. An action network computes the optimal control law; a critic network predicts the derivative of the cost-to-go with respect to the state.

40|$|Abstract. Gradient descent {{training}} of neural networks {{can be done}} in either a batch or on-line manner. A widely held myth in the neural network community is that batch training is as fast or faster and/or more “correct ” than <b>on-line</b> <b>training</b> because it supposedly uses a better approximation of the true gradient for its weight updates. This paper explains why batch training is almost always slower than on-line training— often orders of magnitude slower—especially on large training sets. The main reason is due to the ability of <b>on-line</b> <b>training</b> to follow curves in the error surface throughout each epoch, which allows it to safely use a larger learning rate and thus converge with less iterations through the training data. Empirical results on a large (20, 000 -instance) speech recognition task and on 26 other learning tasks demonstrate that convergence can be reached significantly faster using <b>on-line</b> <b>training</b> than batch training, with no apparent difference in accuracy...|$|E
