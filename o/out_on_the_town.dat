5|$|In 1992, NOU was on {{tour with}} Bikini Kill, {{and when they}} arrived in Memphis, the found that the {{promoter}} for the show hadn't actually promoted the show. So, while <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> flyering the streets and ducking into record stores, NOU ran into Primal Scream, a band which had been in town recording their own album. Primal Scream then decided to attend NOU's show at the Antenna Club, and then proceeded to invite NOU to record {{with them in the}} studio the next day. Nation of Ulysses then recorded five songs with Primal Scream in nine hours, though of course only after a quick errand for some tin foil to smoke a bit of crack, according to Tim Green. These recordings are known as Memphis Demos, and include the demos of N-Sub Ulysses, 50,000 Watts, Mockingbird, Yeah, and Shakedown.|$|E

Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is invited to}} go <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> with them, but finds that he is incapable of keeping up with their lifestyle. Tracy fears that if the public were to learn {{that he no longer}} lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he would be forced to change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street.|$|E

Trafford recalled: [...] "I played a guitar, and [...] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged {{on the backs of}} chairs." [...] The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as [...] "Rock Island Line" [...] and [...] "Walking Cane", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools.

500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "S" [...] is an up-tempo eurodance song {{produced}} by Norwegian producers StarGate and Sandy Vee. The song {{is reminiscent of}} Depeche Mode's 1984 song [...] "Master and Servant" [...] and contains lyrical thoughts of sadomasochism. Andy Kellman of Allmusic regarded [...] "S" [...] as a dance-pop song which efficiently balanced [...] "Rihanna's playful and sinister sides". [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was also produced by StarGate and features guest vocals from Canadian rapper Drake. It is a mid-tempo, electro-R song with a back track consisting of heavy reggae. The song also sees Rihanna's return to the [...] "Island-pop" [...] style of her early career". [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] is a pop rock song produced by The Runners, and interpolates Avril Lavigne's 2002 single [...] "I'm with You". Mark Savage from BBC News described the song as a funky, loping guitar groove for a night <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>town.</b> [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was the third song from the album produced by StarGate. It is an up-tempo dance-pop song that incorporates elements of eurodance in its production. Brad Wete, a reviewer of Entertainment Weekly, described Rihanna's vocals as [...] "seductive" [...] and reminiscent of a [...] "stronger, sexier version" [...] of her 2007 single, [...] "Don't Stop the Music".|$|E

It is indeed no surprise to learn that this Italian-Chilean was himself snatched by the military in Buenos Aires and tortured. Yet, despite his admirable insistence on moving us with the truth (helped by his grainy camera work), Bechis can also tell a tale and he gradually incorporates a race-against-time element.

50|$|Several {{more attacks}} {{took place in}} the {{following}} centuries.

2500|$|Courtney did {{return to}} rowing, however, {{and the next}} year a rematch was {{scheduled}} at Lake Chautauqua, New York, for a $6,000 prize. To accommodate the expected crowds, a temporary grandstand was built along with a special rail line to carry spectators to the site. The morning before the race, Courtney's racing shell was sawed in half, and he declined offers of other boats. What actually happened to the boat is unknown. Some thought that Hanlan's supporters had destroyed the boat, but others suspected Courtney had done it himself to avoid another loss. Courtney claimed Hanlan was <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> the night before the race and his supporters were concerned they would lose their money they wagered on him. He would also claim that Hanlan’s supporters offered Courtney the entire $6,000 prize to fix the race. Courtney was latter reported as saying in response to the offer, [...] "Gentlemen, the race will be raced tomorrow, and whoever wins it will have to row for it." [...] Courtney's backers believed that Hanlan's backers sneaked into Courtney's boathouse and destroyed his boat. Another version of events was that Courtney did not want to row unless the race would be fixed in his favor. Hanlan's friends agreed that Hanlan would lose. Hanlan and his friends did not have any intention of living up to this promise to Courtney and bet heavily on Hanlan to win. Courtney's supporters learned of the double-cross and destroyed Courtney's boat.|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
50|$|RASL {{is taken}} away by Sal and tossed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of <b>town,</b> telling him that he is still seeking out Annie.

After driving out of town, he recalls seeing a flash in the mirror, and witnesses (along with other drivers who had gotten out of their cars) a devastating explosion from The Compound. The story flashes back to the present one last time with RASL standing in the desert where Sal left him, with the eerie girl he'd met earlier right behind him.|$|R
50|$|In 1871-72, the {{disorderly conduct}} of Khalkom, a Mizo chief, {{compelled}} the British {{to establish an}} outpost that later became the Aizawl village. In 1890, officer Dally of the Assam Police and his 400 men arrived at Aizawl to support Colonel Skinner's troops during a British military operation against <b>the</b> Mizo tribals. <b>On</b> Dally's recommendation, Aizawl {{was selected as the}} site of a fortified post that Colonel Skinner had been ordered to construct. The troops constructed stockades and buildings at the site. In 1892-95 Aizawl became accessible from Silchar by fair weather road under the supervision of Major Loch. The Indian Air Force carried <b>out</b> air strikes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> during <b>the</b> March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising, following which the MNF withdrew to Lunglei. Until 1966, Aizawl was a large village but the regrouping of Mizo villages after the uprising made it become a larger town and then a city. Aizawl has become the centre of Road network in Mizoram connecting the north and south, east and west. More than 25% of the Mizoram population reside in Aizawl.|$|R

5000|$|According to Dix from September 2008 {{there were}} a number of air raids (by the Sri Lankan Air Force) each day on Kilinochchi, often at night. The Sri Lankan {{government}} told the UN that they could no longer guarantee their safety - they must leave Kilinochchi and other Tamil Tiger held areas. According to Gordon Weiss the Sri Lankan government regarded the UN as an [...] "impediment" [...] to their defeat of the Tamil Tigers. By removing the aid agencies from the Tamil Tiger areas there were no longer any international witnesses to the Sri Lankan military's actions, charged Weiss. When the UN announced it was evacuating all its staff from Kilinochchi, hundreds of local civilians, fearing an all <b>out</b> onslaught <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> by <b>the</b> Sri Lankan military, went to <b>the</b> UN office <b>on</b> 15 September 2008 and pleaded with the UN staff not to leave. Dix filmed <b>the</b> scene <b>on</b> his camcorder: [...] "They were pleading with us...'please don't leave'...There was one girl..she wasn't shouting and she wasn't chanting, she was just still but she had real sadness in her face...Her face just really captured this 'have compassion...stay and watch'". A Hindu priest pleaded with Dix stay, not to provide food and shelter but to be witnesses: [...] "We are begging you to stay and witness our suffering. If we allow you to leave the truth is that everyone here will die. The knife is at our throat." [...] The UN, accepting the Sri Lankan governments warning and ignoring the pleas of the local civilians, left Kilinochchi. [...] "It was their greatest hour of need. They had an army sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doorstep...and we drove out. That was ...a real sense of abandonment of these people" [...] stated Dix. Weiss believes the UN's decision to leave Kilinochchi to be a mistake. The removal of the UN staff from Kilinochchi left virtually no international witnesses in the area. After the UN had withdrawn, the Sri Lankan military launched a massive offensive into the Tamil Tiger held areas and captured Kilinochchi in January 2009. Hundreds of thousands of civilians fled the onslaught. Over the following four months they were trapped in an ever-decreasing area and constantly bombed by the Sri Lankan military. Tens of thousands died as result of deliberate Sri Lankan military fire. The harrowing ordeal suffered by the civilians was filmed.|$|R
