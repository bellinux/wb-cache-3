It was opposed to liberal nationalism, represented by authors such as Ernest Renan (1823–1892), who conceived <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> a community, which, instead of being based on the Volk ethnic group and on a specific, common language, was founded on the subjective will to live together ("the nation is a daily plebiscite", 1882) or also John Stuart Mill (1806–1873).|$|E

25|$|The Jewish Diaspora in Egypt {{was already}} several centuries old. It was {{as old as}} that of the East (Babylon), but not until the early Hellenistic period did it achieve {{comparable}} importance. Alexander the Great's breathtakingly rapid campaign of conquest led to the swift commercialisation of the Eastern Mediterranean after 333 BCE. In Palestine, under the favourable auspices of the long period of peace - almost a whole century - which followed the advent of the Ptolemies, the new ways were to flourish. By means of all kinds of contacts, and particularly thanks to the development of commerce, Hellenism infiltrated on all sides in varying degrees. The ports of the Mediterranean coast were indispensable to commerce and, {{from the very beginning of}} the Hellenistic period, underwent great development. In the Western Diaspora Greek quickly became dominant in Jewish life and little sign remains of profound contact with Hebrew or Aramaic, the latter probably being the more prevalent. The proportion of Jews in the Diaspora in relation to the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> a whole increased steadily throughout the Hellenistic era and reached astonishing dimensions in the early Roman period, particularly in Alexandria. It was not least for this reason that the Jewish people became a major political factor, especially since the Jews in the diaspora, notwithstanding strong cultural, social and religious tensions, remained firmly united with their homeland.|$|E

500|$|Polyethnicity divides nations, {{complicating the}} {{politics}} as {{local and national}} governments attempt to satisfy all ethnic groups. Many politicians in countries attempt to find the balance between ethnic identities within their country and the identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> a whole. Nationalism also plays a large part in these political debates, as cultural pluralism and consociationalism are the democratic alternatives to nationalism for the polyethnic state. The idea of nationalism being social instead of ethnic entails a variety of culture, a shared sense of identity and a community not based on descent. Culturally plural states vary constitutionally between a decentralized and unitary state (such as Great Britain) and a federal state (such as Belgium, Switzerland, or Canada). Ethnic parties in these polyethnic regions are not anti-state but instead seek maximum power within this state. Many polyethnic countries face this dilemma with their policy decisions. The following nations and regions {{are just a few}} specific examples of this dilemma and its effects: ...|$|E
500|$|Hand's {{democratic}} {{respect for}} legislation {{meant that he}} hardly ever struck down a law. Whenever his decisions went against the government, he based them only on the boundaries of law in particular cases. He adhered to the doctrine of presumptive validity, which assumes that legislators {{know what they are}} doing when they pass a law. Even when a law was uncongenial to him, or when it seemed contradictory, Hand set himself to interpret the legislative intent. Sometimes, however, he was obliged to draw the line between federal and state laws, as in United States v. Schechter Poultry. In this important case, he ruled that a New Deal law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state. Hand wrote in his opinion: [...] "It is always a serious thing to declare any act of Congress unconstitutional, and especially in a case where {{it is part of a}} comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> a whole. With the wisdom of that plan we have nothing whatever to do..." ...|$|E

[...] His main concern was that their methods disrupted the democratic process, as did the refusal of the Southern states to put the interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> a whole above their own. In 1856, in his unpublished The Eighteenth Presidency, addressing {{the men of the}} South, he wrote [...] "you are either to abolish slavery or it will abolish you". Whitman also subscribed to the widespread opinion that even free African-Americans should not vote and was concerned at the increasing number of African-Americans in the legislature. Whitman shared the racial prejudices of his time and place and thought of black people as [...] "servile, shiftless, ignorant, and given to stealing, although he would remember individual blacks of his youth in positive terms".|$|E

500|$|Historian Roberto Garcia Ferreira {{wrote in}} 2008 that Árbenz's legacy {{was still a}} matter of great dispute in Guatemala itself, while arguing {{that the image of}} Árbenz was {{significantly}} shaped by the CIA media campaign that followed the 1954 coup. Garcia Ferreira said that the revolutionary government represented one of the few periods in which [...] "state authority was used to promote the interests of the nation's masses." [...] Forster described Árbenz's legacy in the following terms: [...] "In 1952 the Agrarian Reform Law swept the land, destroying forever the hegemony of the planters. Árbenz in effect legislated a new social order... The revolutionary decade... plays a central role in twentieth-century Guatemalan history because it was more comprehensive than any period of reform before or since." [...] She added that even within the Guatemalan government, Árbenz [...] "gave full compass to Indigenous, campesino, and labor demands" [...] in contrast to Arévalo, who had remained suspicious of these movements. Similarly, Greg Grandin stated that the land reform decree [...] "represented a fundamental shift in the power relations governing Guatemala". Árbenz himself once remarked that the agrarian reform law was [...] "most precious fruit of the revolution and the fundamental base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> a new country." [...] However, to a large extent the legislative reforms of the Árbenz and Arévalo administrations were reversed by the US-backed military governments that followed.|$|E

[...] He noted that the painting is the only [...] "canonized" [...] one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze. [...] The painting is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae, the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person. [...] Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting [...] "the most significant historical image of China's founding". [...] Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel {{the changes that have}} come to China's leadership during the years of Communist governance. [...] Andrews wrote that [...] "its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting". [...] Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it [...] "a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles". [...] The painting has never been as highly regarded in the West as in China; according to Andrews, [...] "art history students have been known to roar with laughter when slides of it appear on the screen". [...] Art historian Michael Sullivan dismissed it as mere propaganda. [...] Today, following a merger of museums, both paintings are in the National Museum of China, on Tiananmen Square.|$|E
