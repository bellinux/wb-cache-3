5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is a much}} more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, close to the ground, before it alights, whereas its {{relative}} is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> forming small flocks.|$|E
5|$|Trains {{regularly}} {{operate on}} five routes. Unlike most other rapid transit and rail systems around the world, BART lines {{are generally not}} referred to by shorthand designations – they are <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> referred to officially by color names. However, future train cars will display line colors more prominently.|$|E

5|$|Chestnut sparrows are gregarious, and are <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> found {{away from}} flocks. They {{frequently}} associate with queleas and other weavers. Adults feed on grass seeds, and those near human habitations will also eat crumbs and other household scraps. Nestlings are fed mostly softer grass seeds, and small beetles are also recorded in their diet.|$|E
5|$|Choughs {{breed in}} mountains, from Morocco and Spain eastwards through {{southern}} Europe and the Alps, across Central Asia and the Himalayas to western China. The Alpine chough {{is also found}} in Corsica and Crete, and the red-billed chough has populations in Ireland, the UK, the Isle of Man, and two areas of the Ethiopian Highlands. Both species are non-migratory residents throughout their range, <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> wandering to neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to capture Constantinople in 717–718, the Umayyads for a time {{diverted}} their attention elsewhere, allowing the Byzantines {{to take to the}} offensive, making some gains in Armenia. From 720/721 however the Arab armies resumed their expeditions against Byzantine Anatolia, although now they were no longer aimed at conquest, but rather large-scale raids, plundering and devastating the countryside and <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> attacking forts or major settlements.|$|E

5|$|Natives {{were also}} removed from high {{governmental}} and ecclesiastical office. After 1075 all earldoms were held by Normans, and Englishmen were <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> appointed as sheriffs. Likewise in the Church, senior English office-holders were either expelled from their positions or kept {{in place for}} their lifetimes and replaced by foreigners when they died. By 1096 no bishopric was held by any Englishman, and English abbots became uncommon, especially in the larger monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Schwarzkopf retired {{shortly after}} the end of the war and {{undertook}} a number of philanthropic ventures, <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> stepping into the political spotlight before his death from complications of pneumonia in late 2012. A hard-driving military commander with a strong temper, Schwarzkopf was considered an exceptional leader by biographers and was noted for his abilities as a military diplomat and in dealing with the press.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's feeding {{habitat is}} rocky coasts, {{rather than the}} damp {{grassland}} favoured by the water pipit. The Eurasian rock pipit feeds mainly on invertebrates, seeking out most of its prey on foot, <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> flying to catch insects. It will venture into shallow water as it follows retreating waves, and may take advantage of human activity that exposes sea slaters or other species that hide under stones.|$|E

5|$|The Kriegsmarines 4thDestroyer Flotilla {{comprised}} the Narvik-class destroyers Z31, Z34, and Z38. By January 1945, these ships had been stationed in northern Norwegian waters {{for three and}} a half years, but had <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> put to sea during 1944. Due to Germany's deteriorating position, the flotilla was directed in January to leave Norwegian waters and return to the Baltic. The three destroyers departed Tromsø on the 25th of the month.|$|E
5|$|Wills held no {{positions}} of power at the South Melbourne Cricket Club and <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> appeared in local team lists. He nonetheless convinced the club to open its ground to football in winter by arguing {{that it would make}} the turf firm and durable. Other clubs soon followed South Melbourne's example and football adapted to an oval-shaped field. By now, the sport had spread throughout Australasia with Melbourne matches attracting the world's largest football crowds yet seen.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of Japanese air {{opposition}} to the American bomber raids, VIIFighter Command was solely tasked with ground attack missions from July. These raids were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft being held in reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> encountered Japanese fighters in the air, the airfields were protected by anti-aircraft batteries and barrage balloons. By the end of the war, VIIFighter Command had conducted 51 ground attack raids, of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships along with large numbers of buildings and railway rolling stock. American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Géricault, who {{had just}} been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic {{existence}} in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.|$|E
5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. The books were set almost entirely {{in the world of}} the wealthy upper class and <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase red foxes {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws {{give them an}} {{advantage}} over foxes, especially when {{the depth of the}} snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red foxes are absent or are seen <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do. North American felid predators of red foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.|$|E

5|$|In Half-Life, players usually fight {{alone and}} <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> {{encounter}} friendly non-player characters who assist them, such as security guards and scientists. While Decay still features levels {{where this is}} the case, significant sections in Decay are dedicated to working with friendly non-player characters, usually escorting them to various objectives and protecting them in firefights. An array of enemy characters from Half-Life populate the game, including alien lifeforms such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts, as well as human soldiers sent in to contain the alien threat. The players {{have access to a}} limited selection of Half-Lifes weaponry to assist them in the game. Although developed after Opposing Force, no non-player characters or weapons from the earlier expansion appear in Decay.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi {{can serve}} as source of food for insect larvae, whereas most insects eat fungi <b>only</b> <b>occasionally.</b> Still, {{a whole range of}} insect species {{specialize}} on fungi. These animals are mainly beetle larvae, especially hairy fungus beetles (Mycetophagidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), and true flies (Diptera). Milk caps are especially attractive for true flies, while beetle larvae are comparatively rarer. The most common insects found on the fungus are Mycetophilidae and Phoridae larvae, which populate even the youngest fruit bodies. Also relatively common on mature or overaged fruit bodies are Drosophilidae and Psychodidae. Species from the section Deliciosi are often infested by Diptera larvae.|$|E
5|$|Official scorers are <b>only</b> <b>occasionally</b> terminated, {{but there}} have been cases when a scorer was {{replaced}} after making decisions which displeased the home team. In 1992 the Seattle Mariner players signed a petition to have their official scorer replaced, and in 2001 the management of the Boston Red Sox ordered that a rookie scorer not be allowed to score another game after pitcher Hideo Nomo lost a no-hitter on a close play in right field that was ruled a hit rather than an error.|$|E
