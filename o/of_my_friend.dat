25|$|Finally, {{after the}} last of the Just Molly and Me shorts ceased production, an attempt at getting the McGees onto {{television}} came in September 1959. The Fibber McGee and Molly TV series was produced by William Asher for NBC (and co-sponsored by Singer Corporation and Standard Brands). As Marian Jordan was too ill to reprise her role, {{the decision was made to}} recast both roles, with younger actors Bob Sweeney and Cathy Lewis as Fibber and Molly respectively; Lewis had previously played Jane Stacy, a very similar straight-woman character, on the radio version <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Friend</b> Irma. The only radio alumnus to appear as a regular cast member was Harold Peary, who took the role of Mayor La Trivia.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... “It {{frequently}} {{happens that}} men {{bleed to death}} before assistance can be procured, or lose so much blood {{as not to be}} able to go through an operation. In order to prevent this, it has been proposed, and on some occasions practised, to make each man carry about him a garter, or piece of rope yarn, in order to bind up a limb in case of profuse bleeding. If it be objected, that this, from its solemnity may be apt to intimidate common men, officers at least should make use of some precaution, especially as many of them, and those of the highest rank, are stationed on the quarter deck, which is one of the most exposed situations, and far removed from the cockpit, where the surgeon and his assistants are placed. This was the cause of the death <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend</b> Captain Bayne, of the Alfred, who having had his knee so shattered with round shot that it was necessary to amputate the limb, expired under the operation, in consequence of the weakness induced by loss of blood in carrying him so far. As the Admiral on these occasions allowed me the honour of being at his side, I carried in my pocket several tourniquets of a simple construction, in case that accidents to any person on the quarter deck should have required their use.” ...|$|E
