50|$|The Korean War brought {{extensive}} {{use by the}} Military Air Transport Service (MATS) for the logistical support of Korea and Japan. Its strategic location drastically shortened the air route to the orient. With the development of Trans-Pacific airlifters (C-124), Shemya was declared surplus and the base was inactivated on 1 July 1954. The facilities were {{turned over to the}} Civil Aeronautics Authority in 1955. They were then leased to Northwest Orient Airlines who remained on the island until 1961 and used the airport as a <b>technical</b> <b>stop</b> for their service between the U.S. and Asia. The airfield was also used as a <b>technical</b> <b>stop</b> by Canadian Pacific Airlines during the early 1950s for its weekly Vancouver, B.C.-Tokyo service.|$|R

40|$|The {{operational}} {{efficiency of the}} LHC is analyzed {{by looking at the}} downtime statistics over the 2010 run. Hardware reliability is reviewed along with the mitigation actions put in place for the 2011 run. Recovery, duration and frequency of scheduled <b>technical</b> <b>stops</b> are also discussed. Finally, possible ways to reduce the setup time without beam are considered...|$|R
40|$|The LHC is a 26. 7 km {{circumference}} ring {{lined with}} superconducting magnets that operate at 1. 9 K. These magnets {{are used to}} control the trajectory of beams of protons traveling in opposite directions and collide them at various experimental sites across the LHC where their debris is analyzed. The focus {{of this paper is}} the cryogenic system that allows the magnets to operate in their superconducting states. It aims to highlight the operating principles of helium refrigeration and liquefaction, with and without nitrogen pre-cooling; discuss the various refrigerators and liquefiers used at CERN for both LHC and Non-LHC applications, with their liquefaction capacities and purposes; and finally to deliberate the management of the LHC inventory and how it contributes to the strategic decision CERN makes regarding the inventory management during the Year-End <b>Technical</b> <b>Stop</b> (YETS), Extended Year-End <b>Technical</b> <b>Stop</b> (EYETS) and long shutdowns...|$|R
50|$|During the {{off-peak}} tourist {{season the}} airport has limited flight connections and operating hours. On the other hand, during the 2014 peak summer season {{it was found}} necessary to severely limit general aviation activity, allowing only a <b>technical</b> <b>stop</b> of 2 hours. For the summer of 2016, NOTAM B0335/16 introduces a similar limitation, but now even down to a one hour's stop.|$|R
50|$|Hunnu Air {{introduced}} its first long-haul direct flight from Ulaanbaatar to Paris {{for the summer}} period of 2014, with one <b>technical</b> <b>stop,</b> using an Airbus A319.

The two Airbus A319s were repossessed by their owner late in 2014, putting plans for expansion in doubt.|$|R

50|$|Invercargill {{does not}} have the {{appropriate}} border control measures to service international flights. Customs Officers from the nearby Port of Bluff provide official security services when aircraft are uplifting fuel. Virgin Australia and Qantas are also looking to use Invercargill as a standby <b>technical</b> <b>stopping</b> point for their Queenstown service to Australia, once again due to the benefit of the airport's longer runway.|$|R
