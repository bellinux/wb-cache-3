5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank.

By writing the texts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the pyramid internal chambers, the architects of Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.|$|E

5|$|The {{walls of}} Caernarfon were {{built at the}} same time as the castle, under the overall {{supervision}} of Master James of Saint George, Edward's chief architect in North Wales. Between 1283 and 1284, Richard the Engineer acted as James' deputy on the site; later, between 1295 and 1308, Walter of Hereford performed a similar role, and may have also been responsible for earlier work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> as well. Huge amounts of labourers were mobilised from across England for the task, massed at Chester and then brought into Wales for each summer building season. Work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> progressed quickly, albeit in uneven bursts: local houses were demolished to make way for the fortifications and the stone walls and gates were probably finished by 1292. The cost of building the town walls was around Â£3,500, a large sum for the period.|$|E
