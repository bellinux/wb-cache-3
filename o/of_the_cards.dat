5|$|The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> (7-6-5-4-2) {{are called}} cartas blancas (white cards) because their value is zero round points.|$|E
5|$|The {{total of}} the round points the player (or pair) has gained is {{calculated}} as the sum of values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> collected in the baza and {{the values of the}} declared combinations. The winner of the last trick also receives ten bonus round points. The total value of the deck (and thus the maximum amount of round points) is 230 points.|$|E
5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two cards are picked up, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, the players start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and their scores are calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E

5000|$|All three {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{contain a}} maple leaf in <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> hence earning <b>the</b> nickname [...] "Maple Leaf Card".|$|R
5|$|Syaoran Li, a boy Sakura's age and {{descendant}} of Clow Reed, arrives from Hong Kong {{to recapture the}} cards himself. While initially antagonistic, he comes to respect Sakura and begins aiding her to capture the cards. Once Sakura captures all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards,</b> she is tested by Yue, the cards' second guardian, to determine if she is worthy of becoming the cards' true master; Yue is also the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, Toya's best friend. Aided by her teacher Kaho Mizuki, Sakura passes the test and becomes the new master of the Clow Cards.|$|E
5|$|Tute in Pairs {{is played}} by four players—two teams of two players each—and every player {{receives}} ten cards (since there are 40 cards, this means that all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> in the deck are dealt). The last card to be dealt is shown {{to the rest of}} the players and becomes the trump. This card belongs to the player it was dealt to. The four people sit in a circle, with opponent players to the right and left of each player, and players sitting opposite their team members.|$|E
5|$|Cardcaptor Sakura {{takes place}} in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which is somewhere near Tokyo. Ten-year-old Sakura Kinomoto accidentally {{releases}} a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards,</b> Cerberus, emerges from the book and chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with battle costumes. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.|$|E
5000|$|Data is encoded on <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> using [...] "dot code", a {{specialized}} barcode technology licensed from Olympus Corporation. e-Reader Cards may {{have one or}} two sets of dot code on them, either a wide strip on <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> a wide strip on both the left and right sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> a narrow strip on <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> or a short strip on <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> with a long strip on <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> Smaller games may require scanning only one card (two sets of dot code), while the greater NES games can require as many as five cards (nine to ten sets of dot code) in order to start the application.|$|R
5000|$|The first Association {{football}} (soccer) {{cards were}} produced in 1898 by Marcus's Tobacco in England. <b>The</b> set consisted <b>of</b> over 100 cards and was issued under <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> [...] "Club Colours". They featured illustrated images <b>of</b> players on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> and a tobacco advertisement on <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> <b>The</b> next series <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> were produced in 1934 by Ardath, {{which was a}} 50-card set called Famous Footballers featuring images <b>of</b> players on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> and a tobacco advertisement and short biography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player on <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{second issue}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{standard}} Oyster <b>card</b> had 'Transport for London' branding on <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> with <b>the</b> Mayor <b>of</b> London (having replaced the 'LONDON' branding in <b>the</b> blue segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card's</b> back). <b>The</b> roundel on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> was {{changed from the}} colour red to white, as white was seen to represent Transport for London (whereas a red roundel is more known to represent London Buses).|$|R
5|$|The {{plot of the}} anime {{series is}} extended, {{featuring}} 52 Clow Cards from the manga's original 19, and certain scenes are stretched and delayed, such as Cerberus' true form not being revealed until just before Yue's appearance. Sakura creates a 53rd card, Hope, a talent she is not shown {{to have in the}} manga. Some of the circumstances around the capturing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> is changed, such as Syaoran capturing several cards himself and being tested by Yue in the Final Judgment. Syaoran's cousin and fiancée Meiling Li is introduced in the anime, who positions herself as a romantic rival for Sakura later in the series and also a friend until she returns to Hong Kong. The TV series leaves the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran unresolved, but Sakura confesses her love to Syaoran {{at the end of the}} second anime film.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was {{produced}} and distributed; one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> featured Dee's name and picture.|$|E
25|$|Techniques {{other than}} card {{counting}} can swing {{the advantage of}} casino blackjack toward the player. All such techniques {{are based on the}} value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> to the player and the casino as originally conceived by Edward O. Thorp. One technique, mainly applicable in multi-deck games, involves tracking groups of cards (also known as slugs, clumps, or packs) during the play of the shoe, following them through the shuffle, and then playing and betting accordingly when those cards come into play from the new shoe. Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> in the shoe.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> credit <b>card</b> {{itself has}} become a major selling point in recent years. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> to <b>the</b> issuer is often related to <b>the</b> customer's usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> or to <b>the</b> customer's {{financial}} worth. This has led to <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> Co-Brand and Affinity <b>cards,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>card</b> design is related to the [...] "affinity" [...] (a university or professional society, for example) leading to higher card usage. In most cases a percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> is returned to the affinity group.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>card</b> is {{hard plastic}} and {{rectangular}} in shape, 105 × 74 mm in size. On <b>the</b> front side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> on <b>the</b> left side a color photograph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bearer is placed {{along with a}} round hologram and a signature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bearer. Top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> bears a title REPUBLICA MOLDOVA - BULETIN DE IDENTITATE (Republic of Moldova - Identity Card) and country code MDA.

50|$|Usually {{found on}} {{undivided}} back cards, {{consisting of a}} design that does not occupy <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture side. Vignettes may be anything from a small sketch in one corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> to a design cover three quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> <b>The</b> purpose is to leave some space for the message to be written, as <b>the</b> entire reverse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> could only {{be used for the}} address.|$|R
25|$|The missing {{information}} needed to help explain how new features could pass from a parent to its offspring {{was provided by the}} pioneering genetics work of Gregor Mendel. Mendel’s experiments with several generations of pea plants demonstrated that inheritance works by separating and reshuffling hereditary information during the formation of sex cells and recombining that information during fertilisation. This is like mixing different hands of playing cards, with an organism getting a random mix of half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> from one parent, and half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> from the other. Mendel called the information factors; however, they later became known as genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity in living organisms. They contain the information that directs the physical development and behavior of organisms.|$|E
25|$|Trial {{versions}}, Transport for London staff versions and {{the first}} version of the standard Oyster card for the public were released with the roundels on the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> in red. Standard issues of the Oyster card have been updated since the first public release in order to meet TfL's Design Standards.|$|E
25|$|In the deck, all {{kings and}} 10s are worth 10 points each, while 5s are worth 5 points each, {{although}} {{the presence of}} the points do not affect the order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> In two decks, there are a total of 200 points. All other cards do not contain points.|$|E
50|$|Starting with <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> Pearl Edition in 1999, <b>the</b> <b>card</b> fronts {{were changed}} to a simpler, cleaner look that allowed for more card text, as well as {{returning}} <b>the</b> visual focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> on <b>the</b> art, rather than <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each card {{features}} an attack, defence and an overall rating. They feature the player in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> and <b>the</b> player's {{team at the}} top left hand corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> They also show the player's position (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder or Forward) at <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> Star players and Goal Stoppers sport a glitter foil effect while Fan's Favourites sport a Rainbow Foil effect. Champions sports a black/gold foil effect.|$|R
50|$|Switch/Maestro cards {{issued by}} certain banks carried an issue number on <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{corresponding}} to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> times a card had been issued {{on a particular}} account. This was usually because the current account number <b>the</b> <b>card</b> was linked to actually formed a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> number, and therefore <b>the</b> <b>card</b> number could not be readily changed in case <b>of</b> loss or <b>the</b> <b>card</b> expiring.|$|R
25|$|In 1993, Shergold's mother, Marion, wrote a {{book about}} her son's story entitled, Craig Shergold : A Mother's Story. On 10 November 2001, PAX TV aired a made-for-TV movie, The Miracle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cards.</b> The movie starred Thomas Sangster as Shergold and also {{featured}} Kirk Cameron as a cynical reporter.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, 150,000 Spanish card holders {{had their}} funds frozen in an {{apparent}} fraud case involving a PayPal service provider, Younique Money, which was the de facto administrator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> Previously, PayPal had charged €15 to all its card users without authorization (150,000 users). As of March 2015 most funds have not been returned.|$|E
25|$|Bauer Trumps: Adapted from 500 and Euchre, highest trump is the J, {{known as}} the right bauer. Second highest trump is J, being the same color and {{known as the}} Left Bauer. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> follow normal order. Alternatively, and similar to the above, both Jacks can be {{replaced}} with two Jokers, making them more distinctive.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{inventor}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> was Ni Guangnan (倪光南) at <b>the</b> Chinese Academy <b>of</b> Engineering.
