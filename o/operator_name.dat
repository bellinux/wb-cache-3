The bottom portion of the screen is split with individual account information contained on the left side, while the area to take a message is located on the right side. The operator must read the information on left side to decide how to dispatch a message, which will include instructions to e-mail, fax, print and snail mail, alpha page/text message, call/patch employees on call, or to even ignore messages from individuals.|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} {{managing}} and monitoring agricultural labors at farm level {{was developed and}} tested in an agrochemical application. The system is constituted by an electronics box mounted on the tractor and software that acquire and analyze data from the application task. The electronics box consists of a microcontroller, a GPS, sensors, a keyboard, a SD memory reader and a LCD screen. This device is able to store in a SD’s memory the data of the position and the instantaneous speed of the tractor, the applied dose, the speed and absolute wind direction, the temperature and relative humidity in-situ. In addition it can generate alert of unfavorable climatic conditions for the agro-chemical applications. The interface to the user is software that allows generating a job order identifying the <b>operator</b> <b>name,</b> the tractor, the spraying equipment, the pesticide, the dose and the sector of application. In addition it allows analyzing the output data in graphical form, generating maps of speed, applied volume and dose. The map of the route is also drawing up on Google-Earth for a better spatial visualization. All the tasks carried out are stored in a data base administered by this software. With this tool {{it is possible to}} verify if the norms that establish environmental conditions apt for the application of pesticide are fulfilled, besides checking the variability of the dose and jumps of rows, along with reports with indices of performance of the operator. The system has been tested in two important vineyards of Chile with promissory results...|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} figures provide {{statistical data}} concerning the test drives. The test protocol consisted of ten questions: name of the <b>operator,</b> <b>name</b> of the attendant, number of passengers, test route (short or long), test purpose, test audience, weather conditions, road conditions, problems during the drive and applied solutions to the problem. During the test period from April 24 th to November 22 th a total of 240 test drives were conducted, of which 102 were on the long route and 138 on the short route. The test drives covered a distance of almost 341  km. During these test drives 874 persons were transported. The majority of test drives (70 %) were conducted in sunny and dry or slight cloudy conditions. For almost 28 % of the test drives it was cloudy respectively very cloudy and rainy. 0.7 % of the test drives took place during snowfall. However, test drives and a few rides in heavy rain had to be stopped because of weather conditions. The majority of the test drives (45 %) was conducted for demonstration purposes for an external audience. These demonstration drives were held either for company delegations, representatives from road or transport authorities, for the press or for private persons. 38 % of the drives were used for operator training, test drives for data collection or test drives without external passengers immediately after the commissioning of the self-driving shuttle. Almost 18 % of the trips were conducted for technical tests. Here, for example, optimizations were made on the route guidance, the software was updated, brake tests were made, or the functionality and/or range of the sensors were tested.|$|E
