40|$|The {{counseling}} field operates under {{a continuing}} assumption that <b>open</b> <b>questions</b> {{lead to more}} counseling talk while closed questions lead to less conversation, but this statement has not be subjected to an empirical test. Two studies are reported here examining this issue. In Study I, 100 male and 100 female students rated items of 40 open and 40 closed questions as for likely length of response. It was found that <b>open</b> <b>questions</b> were expected to derive longer responses than closed questions, and that among <b>open</b> <b>questions,</b> why and could questions were expected to derive longer responses than what and how questions. In Study II, {{on the basis of}} the results of Study I, 6 items of <b>open</b> and closed <b>questions</b> were selected for an experimental interview, in which 10 male and 10 female students were individually asked by the experimenter to respond to the questions. The results revealed that <b>open</b> <b>questions</b> produced greater numberof syllables and longertime of response than closed <b>questions,</b> and that <b>open</b> <b>questions</b> led to longer latency than closed questions. These results confirm Ivey's definition about the effect of <b>open</b> and closed <b>questions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Throughout West Africa, ASL-based sign {{languages}} are spoken by educated Deaf adults. These languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations {{to be the}} official sign languages of their countries, and are named accordingly, e.g. Nigerian Sign Language, Ghanaian Sign Language. Such signing systems are found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo. Due to lack of data, it is still an <b>open</b> <b>question</b> how similar these sign {{languages are}} to the variety of ASL used in America.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} sources contemporary {{with the}} rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD4) in Germany and Pannonia as praefect of cavalry and legatus. Paterculus' Compendium of Roman History spans a period from the fall of Troy {{to the death of}} Livia in AD29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor and Sejanus. How much of this is due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an <b>open</b> <b>question,</b> but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD31 as a friend of Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Phaedrus was {{suspected}} of having alluded to Sejanus in his Fables and received some unknown punishment short of death (Cf. Fables I.1, I.2.24, and I.17). Velleius Paterculus was a historian and contemporary of Sejanus, whose two-volume The Roman History details a history of Rome from the fall of Troy until the death of Livia Augusta in AD 29. In his work he praised Tiberius and Sejanus, even defending the latter's high position in the government, despite not ranking higher than equestrian. How much of Paterculus' writing is due to genuine admiration, prudence or fear remains an <b>open</b> <b>question,</b> {{but it has been}} conjectured that he was put to death as a friend of Sejanus.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} scleractinians {{were not}} reef builders, but were small, phaceloid or solitary individuals. Scleractinian corals were probably at their greatest {{diversity in the}} Jurassic and all but disappeared in the mass extinction event {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous, about 18 out of 67 genera surviving. Recently discovered Paleozoic corals with aragonitic skeletons and cyclic septal insertion – two features that characterize Scleractinia – have strengthened the hypothesis for an independent origin of the Scleractinia. Whether the early scleractinian corals were zooxanthellate is an <b>open</b> <b>question.</b> The phenomenon seems to have evolved independently on numerous occasions during the Tertiary, and the genera Astrangia, Madracis, Cladocora and Oculina, all in different families, each have both zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate members.|$|E
5|$|ASL is used internationally as a lingua franca, and {{a number}} of closely related sign {{languages}} derived from ASL are used in many different countries. Even so, there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard ASL in these imported ASL varieties. Bolivian Sign Language is reported to be a dialect of ASL, no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects. On the other hand, it is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages. For example, Malaysian Sign Language, which has ASL origins, is no longer mutually comprehensible with ASL and must be considered its own language. For some imported ASL varieties, such as those used in West Africa, it is still an <b>open</b> <b>question</b> how similar they are to American ASL.|$|E
5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy remains an <b>open</b> <b>question</b> in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by}} the gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E
