500|$|... "Providence" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a B+ rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode took the promising {{beginning of the}} last episode and delivered a strong and surprising larger meaning to {{the pieces of the}} mythology we’ve seen over the past few seasons. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… those who bash these episodes simply because they relate to the “new direction” <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of themselves. With this kind of creativity, this series could easily end {{in a way that makes}} the entire series one seamless tapestry." [...] Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Providence", along with the previous episode [...] "Provenance", [...] "does a fairly good job without including Duchovny" [...] due to its adherence to [...] "the series' main storyline [...] the government conspiracies." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five." ...|$|E

500|$|Kvinneakt {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the most notorious of the sculptures installed in the Transit Mall during the 1970s. In addition to being somewhat controversial because it is a nude, the sculpture has also received mixed reviews as a work of art. In 1981, Taylor recalled that following the sculpture's first installation one man told him that [...] "he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of himself." [...] In 1985, Jeff Kuechle of The Oregonian listed the work as one of the city's [...] "worst sculptures". In the article, Claire Kelly, director of Portland State University's art and architecture program said, [...] "She's more than simplistic, she's absurd. It's not a piece that belongs on public display." [...] In contrast, Monk Magazine described the sculpture as [...] "the best-looking girl in Portland" [...] with [...] "her stunning eyes and voluptuous figure". [...] According to the magazine, Portland is the only city in the United States with a [...] "flasher statue". [...] The sculpture was included in Kate Chynoweth's 2003 book, The Best Places to Kiss in the Northwest: A Romantic Travel Guide, as one of Portland's [...] "romantic highlights".|$|E

[...] Fowler responded by calling Beeton [...] "a damned fool for saying anything of the sort." [...] Although present during the exchange, Priestley held his peace. Following this ominous start, the wagon soon embarked on its journey, propelled into motion by some of Fowler's other employees.|$|E
2500|$|Ruiz de Burton is very {{critical}} of the United States in her fiction, both objectively and in relation to her native Mexico. [...] She accuses the US of childishly holding on to a provincial mentality, maintaining that Europe still sets the standard for cultural judgment.. [...] In The Squatter and the Don, the characters Clarence and Hubert discuss wines from California, {{which appears to be}} patronizing criticism of California from Northeasterners, but, according to Anne Elizabeth Goldman, is in fact more of a criticism of the provincial sensibilities maintained by Bostonians. [...] Like the Norval sisters in Who Would Have Thought It? who travel to Europe to learn good taste, Clarence notes this mentality saying [...] "Don't you know I like some of our California wines quite as well as the imported, if not better? [...] I suppose I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> to admit it, thus showing my taste is not cultivated...I think sooner or later our wines will be better liked, better appreciated." [...] Hubert responds: [...] "I think so too, but for the present it is the fashion to cry down our native wines and extol the imported. [...] When foreigners come to California to tell us that we can make good wines, that we have soils in which to grow the best grapes, then we will believe it, not before." ...|$|E
