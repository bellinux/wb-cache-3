The long list <b>of</b> <b>project</b> success factors indicates that there are no common denominators for project success. It also indicates that there was no agreement on the definition of success. The aim of this review paper is to classify relevant literature on project success in order to obtain a greater breadth on this topic. This paper distinguishes the success <b>of</b> <b>project</b> into project success definition, measurement or dimension <b>of</b> <b>project</b> success, traditional success factors, non-traditional success factors, frameworks and models <b>of</b> <b>project</b> success, type <b>of</b> industry, location (country) of research, specific level (individual, group, organisation, and <b>project),</b> and phases <b>of</b> <b>project</b> (project life cycle). This paper further highlights the classification of the success factors <b>of</b> <b>project</b> in construction industry and other industries.
