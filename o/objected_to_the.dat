Parliament rejected the proposed connection and the changes to the NWLR's route and the company's permissions eventually expired without any construction work being carried out. The Bakerloo Tube bill was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|By 1966 the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Synod forbade {{membership}} in the Loyal Order of Moose. The Catholic Church, however, has never explicitly <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moose, despite having condemned similar organizations, such as the Freemasons for their oaths and other rituals.|$|E

5|$|Critics have <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{killing of}} the sea lions, {{pointing}} out that the level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to {{the project}} was based on three {{separate}} objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides breeding ground for millions of waterfowl and habitat for game and fur-bearing animals. Alaska Native groups <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project's human cost—the need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages—and Native groups outside the reservoir area <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost {{and the belief that}} cheap electricity would not be enough to attract industry to Alaska.|$|E

5|$|Austin {{admitted}} {{the theft of}} the cow, saying he had had no food for his children. According to his undated charge sheet, witnesses for the state were Littrell, Martin, Lane, and Lawrence Payne. Austin's account of what happened tallied {{with that of the}} posse, except that he said he was the one, not Laura, who had <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shotgun being removed from the wall. He said Laura had been trying to take the rifle away from her son when it was fired.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} good {{reaction}} of the studio audience, a second series was commissioned before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members of the teaching profession and its unions <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> negative representation of teachers and the comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
50|$|A {{taxpayer}} <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> {{a decision}} and this is first reviewed by {{an officer of the}} Australian Taxation Office.

If <b>the</b> taxpayer <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> a disallowance, <b>the</b> same process takes place but with a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal instead of a taxation officer. Following a disallowance at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the taxpayer can then <b>object</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Federal Court of Australia.|$|R

5|$|Chamberlain and Daladier {{returned}} to their hotel and informed the Czechoslovaks of the agreement. The two Prime Ministers urged quick acceptance by the Czechoslovaks of the agreement, since the evacuation by the Czechs was to begin the following day.

5|$|Cleveland was {{the first}} Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which {{originated}} in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Fincher's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film's sexual content. The filmmakers {{considered}} Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher objected that she was too young for the role. He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.|$|E

5|$|However that {{decision}} proved controversial. The Bishops' Council formally <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commissioners' decision, and {{the matter was}} referred by the Archbishops' Council to a committee which, in May 2014, decided that the house in Croscombe was not suitable to be a see house, and that the bishop should remain living in the Palace.|$|E

Long's protest gained some support, including that of two bishops, and eventually reached the Home Office. The Home Office considered the protest to be in humour, though the chief constable responded to say the office could not act against a protected scheduled monument.|$|E
