50|$|Then {{comes the}} second longest {{straight}} of the circuit, also named Railway, where vehicles often slipstream {{one another in}} preparation for the heaviest braking zone belonging to the ninth and final corner. Taylor's is a hairpin corner {{that is one of the}} tightest found anywhere in the UK. It has an uphill apex, is arguably the best <b>overtaking</b> <b>point</b> of the circuit and was previously known as the Real Radio Hairpin for sponsorship reasons. Upon exit from Taylor's vehicles accelerate hard on the part uphill pit straight towards the finish line.|$|E
50|$|The banked multi-apex turn 10-11-12 {{sequence}} {{is one of}} the most notable sections of the circuit. It has been likened to the long, fast Turn 8 at Turkey's Istanbul Park circuit as it is a challenging sequence that generates high tyre loadings. Unlike Turkey's Turn 8, it tightens on exit and is a clockwise right-hander. Although it is not one of the main overtaking points, it is the corner that shows F1 cars to their full cornering potential. The circuit's main straight, at 1060m, is among the longest in F1, with a key <b>overtaking</b> <b>point</b> at its end. The pitlane is also one of the longest in F1, at more than 600 metres: as in most races with pit stops, time spent in the pitlane is an important factor in determining race strategies.|$|E
50|$|Turn 1 is {{the main}} <b>overtaking</b> <b>point</b> at Catalunya, {{as it is a}} braking zone {{at the end of a}} long DRS straight. The inside and outside are equally {{difficult}} for overtaking; drivers who can hold the line around the outside of turn one, can get the inside line for turn two. The corners themselves make up a medium-speed chicane - drivers brake rather late for turn one (Elf) and shift down to gear two, and turn two is almost full throttle as they try to gain as much exit speed as possible. Turn 3 (Renault) is a long, flat-out (in most cars) right-hander that has a g-force of about four, and it leads to a short straight before turn 4, the Repsol curve. Another right-hander, turn four is similar to Monza's Curva Parabolica - drivers brake and take an early apex (in third gear), carrying lots of speed out of the exit. Turn 5 (Seat) comes immediately after and is a slow left-hander taken in second gear which drops rapidly downhill towards the left kink of turn 6 which is ignored by F1 cars. Turns 7 and 8 make up a medium-speed, uphill, left-right chicane. Drivers brake and shift down to gear three, and must not run too wide as turn eight has a large kerb on its apex which could potentially damage cars' suspensions. Turn 9, Campsa Corner, is a very fast, sixth-gear right-hander which is made incredibly difficult by being completely blind (drivers cannot see the apex on approach). It is initially quite steep uphill but the exit is then downhill, so it is quite easy to run wide onto the astroturf. The long back straight leads into turn 10 (La Caixa), a second-gear, left-hand hairpin, then turns 11 and 12, a left kink before a long, slow, third-gear right. The next section has been redesigned by German engineer Hermann Tilke to lower speeds onto the 1,047-metre pit straight - which in turn increases overtaking opportunities and safety. Turn 13 is a tight, third-gear right-hander and drivers have to cross the track quickly to take the racing line through the slow left-right chicane of turns 14 and 15, taken in second gear. Good traction is needed here as it determines speed down the pit straight. Turn 16 (New Holland) is a flat-out right-hander which takes cars across the start/finish line.|$|E

50|$|Even {{the modest}} {{design of a}} 3 m gravel road, with <b>overtaking</b> <b>points,</b> {{appeared}} too expensive. The impulse for building a road, which was meant {{to open up the}} barren alpine valleys to motorized tourism, was given by the New York stock market slump in 1929. This catastrophe shook an impoverished Austria with terrible force.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, an <b>overtake</b> <b>point</b> {{was needed}} on the main railway track line halfway between Tikkurila and Kerava. The Korso stop was built in 1889 in nearly {{uninhabited}} wilderness at the border of Tuusula and the Helsinki parish - Korso. The train started to stop at Korso twice a day, which provided a starting point {{for the development of the}} area. The current disused station building was built in 1938 according to Thure Hellström's class V station plans for the Seinäjoki-Kristiinankaupunki-Kaskinen railway track line.|$|R
50|$|As in October, the Lightning earned 12 {{points in}} November with a 6-7-0 {{record for the}} month, making their overall record 11-11-2.

Stamkos continued to lead the team in goals with 16, and also <b>overtook</b> the <b>points</b> lead with 26.|$|R
50|$|After {{the death}} of de Haro, squatters began to <b>overtake</b> Potrero <b>Point.</b> The de Haro family tried to {{maintain}} control of the land but the family's ownership was challenged legally. The case {{went all the way}} to the Supreme Court when in 1866 it ruled against the De Haro family. Residents of Potrero Point celebrated with bonfires after learning of the outcome, some of whom gained title to the lot where they squatted through the Squatter's Rights.|$|R
50|$|Ashby {{began his}} career with the Swindon Robins in 1961 but was moved on to the Exeter Falcons in 1968 by the {{speedway}} rider control committee. Three years later he returned to Swindon remained there {{for the rest of his}} career, apart from a short spell at Reading Racers in 1980 where he helped secure the title. Ashby was a regular England international. Ashby held the club record for most appearances (641) and points total (5,4765½) until 2008 when Leigh Adams <b>overtook</b> the <b>points</b> record.|$|R
50|$|After this, Senna {{vowed that}} if Prost (starting second) got the {{advantage}} {{into the first}} corner, which most were sure he would, Senna would attempt {{to take the lead}} into the first corner, regardless of the consequences. The two drivers made contact in the first corner, sending both drivers off the track. The crash meant that Senna had clinched the drivers' championship for a second time, as with one race left in the season, Prost could not <b>overtake</b> his <b>points</b> tally. Benetton-Ford's dominance of the podium prevented Ferrari from scoring enough points to stop McLaren clinching its sixth constructors' title.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the late}} 1980s {{most of this}} section, {{and some of the}} {{following}} Wiltshire section, was configured as three lanes, with the central lane available for overtaking traffic in either direction. This is no longer considered safe so the road now has one wider-than normal lane in each direction, with ghost islands at junctions to discourage <b>overtaking</b> at these <b>points.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Week 5 of 2015 {{against the}} Kansas City Chiefs, Gould became the Bears' all-time scoring leader with 1,118 <b>points,</b> <b>overtaking</b> Kevin Butler's record by two, with a 30-yard field {{goal in the}} third quarter. At {{the end of the}} season, Gould made 33 field goals for this season, the most ever for a Bears kicker in a single season. In 2016, Gould was awarded the Ed Block Courage Award.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the flight is to produce drag and thus prevent the rear of the dart <b>overtaking</b> the <b>point.</b> It also has an effect on {{stability}} by reducing wobble. Modern flights are generally made from plastic, nylon, or foil and are available in a range of shapes and sizes. The three most common shapes in order of size are the standard, the kite, and the smaller pear shape. The less surface area, the less stability but larger flights hamper close grouping. Some manufactures have sought to solve this by making a flight long and thin but this in turn creates other problems such as changing the dart's centre of gravity. Generally speaking a heavier dart will require a larger flight.|$|R

40|$|The study investigates detonations with {{multiple}} quasi-steady velocities {{that have been}} observed {{in the past in}} systems with multi-peaked thermicity, using Fickett's detonation analogue. A steady state analysis of the travelling wave predicts multiple states, however, all but the one with the highest velocity develop a singularity after the sonic point. Simulations show singularities are associated with a shock wave which <b>overtakes</b> all sonic <b>points,</b> establishing a detonation travelling the highest of the predicted velocities. Under a certain parameter range, the steady-state detonation can have multiple sonic points and solutions. Embedded shocks can exist behind sonic points, where they link the weak and strong solutions. Sonic points whose characteristics do not diverge are found to be unstable, and to be the source of the embedded shocks. Numerical simulations show that these shocks are only quasi stable. This is believed to be due to the reaction rates having been chosen to be independent of hydrodynamics which permits shocks anywhere behind a sonic point...|$|R

50|$|Criticisms also {{extend to}} {{the way that the}} {{business}} model can often appear unregulated, to the point of encouraging prolific spending.

The game had the player buy characters and buildings using in-game currency, but more currency could be purchased with real money using account details tied to the device, using Apple's store authentication prior to purchase. Prior to changes Apple made in 2011, it was possible to use the authentication for up to fifteen minutes before having to reconfirm the password, and parents had soon found that their children had used this to unwittingly incur hundreds of US dollars in charges by playing the game.

40|$|Micropollutants are {{emerging}} as a new challenge to the scientific community. The discharge of treated effluent from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is a major pathway for the introduction of emerging contaminants into surface water. Solar advanced oxidation processes can achieve high and consistent micropollutants’ removal. This study deals with the destruction of trace organic contaminants in secondary treated effluents by (i) sulphate radical based (SO 4 -) homogeneous photo-Fenton using peroxymonosulphate as an oxidant, ferrous ion Fe(II) as catalyst, (ii) hydroxyl radical (○OH) heterogeneous photocatalysis using suspended titanium dioxide (TiO 2) as catalyst, (iii) photolysis and solar irradiation as a light source. Solar advanced oxidation processes of wastewater was conducted in a panel solar pilot and the efficiency of this treatment was evaluated {{on the basis of}} micropollutants’ disappearance, reduction of total organic matter content (TOC), and measurement of the final estrogenicity. The chemical analyses of the wastewater collected showed that several contaminants persisted {{at the end of its}} treatment in the WWTP. Contaminants elimination was followed by Liquid Chromatography/Quadrupole ion trap Mass Spectrometry analysis after a pre-concentration 100 : 1 by solid phase extraction. 74 target micropollutants were identified. Some of them were found at trace level also after the applied AOPs. The ecotoxicity of the effluent wastewater was evaluated using different commonly adopted bio-tests as Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri, Brachionus calyciflorus, Spirodela polyrhiza, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. These standard methods can give an idea about of quality of wastewater, but they are not able to respond also to the presence of estrogenic activity, that can be a crucial problem. For <b>overtake</b> this <b>point,</b> the treatment efficiency was provided by estrogenic activity measurements based on the use of bioluminescent HELN ERa cell line.

2500|$|Vettel {{explained}} his loss of {{ground at the}} start of the race triggered memories of his first lap collision with Bruno Senna in the 2012 race, saying he felt Red Bull would be stronger against McLaren at the start but that it was highly competitive and was hoping to possibly finish in a higher position. Nevertheless, he was happy with his sixth-place result. The Head of Vehicle Performance for the Williams team Rob Smedley stated he was angry with himself for not preventing Massa from driving through the McLaren pit stall after the Williams had switched garage positions for the race and exchanged words afterwards. He felt it should have been given more consideration and given advance warning. However he reserved praise for his team for salvaging one additional point from Bottas and described the Williams team's race as a [...] "character building" [...] event, something he was taught at Ferrari by their technical director Ross Brawn. Bottas revealed he had severe left-rear tyre graining on his final stint which caused him to slide massively and drop positions: [...] "I was managing a lot at the beginning and then could just avoid [...] Kvyat from <b>overtaking.</b> At one <b>point</b> there was some debris in the rear wing , a tear off or something.

25|$|But {{the most}} {{significant}} system introduced in F1 was the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), a system that stores energy created by braking that is stored through a flywheel and this saved energy is then channeled to the car's drivetrain to increase acceleration. A few well funded teams had tested this technology the previous year {{but it was too}} experimental and all of the teams' KERS systems needed more development to the point where none of them would be ready for 2009. Due to the recession, many more rule changes were brought in to reduce the cost of Formula One. Initially a standardised engine was proposed, but this idea was rejected by the teams, who came up with their own cost-cutting measures. These included a huge reduction in testing times and an increase in the required engine and gearbox mileage. Many teams voiced concerns over the cost of KERS and have suggested a standardised unit, but so far no such opportunity exists. The new rules and regulations saw a new order in 2009, with new teams Brawn GP and Red Bull Racing and their drivers leading the way, with Ferrari and McLaren having a poor season. However Ferrari started by the British Grand Prix {{to make the most of}} their car with a string of podium finishes and a race victory in Belgium, while a redesign of the McLaren challenger helped Lewis Hamilton to win two races and gain more points than any other driver after it was upgraded at the German Grand Prix. After dominating the beginning of the season with six out of seven race wins, Jenson Button eventually clinched the Drivers' title in Brazil, with Brawn GP winning the Constructors' Championship in its only season, before being taken over by Mercedes. Rubens Barrichello, Jenson Button's teammate, was second in the Drivers' Championship for the whole season until he had a problem at the Brazilian Grand Prix and was <b>overtaken</b> (in <b>points)</b> by Sebastian Vettel, a Red Bull driver, who won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to finish eleven points behind Button. Also, the major manufacturer teams were starting to disappear rapidly due to the worldwide economy crisis. In addition to Ford/Jaguar which had left in 2004, Honda had departed in 2008 also due to uncompetitiveness, Toyota and BMW both departed entirely in 2009 (BMW sold Sauber, a team it had bought in 2005 after its split with Williams even though in 2010 the team was still called BMW Sauber), Renault changed their involvement as a full works effort to engine supplier in 2011 and Cosworth departed entirely as an engine supplier in 2013.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at the {{individuation}} {{of novel}} paradigms for Smart Surveillance applications based on collecting intensive sensor dataflows and providing an abstraction layer for event and activity detection.

The objective is to individuate any difficulties that may arise from usage of Konnex networking in surveillance applications and, eventually providing indications and models to <b>overtake</b> the weak <b>points.</b> The surveillance system being investigated here leverages the potentials offered by Radio Frequency Identification (known as RFID) even in home environments, where correct, real-time identification of persons and objects may constitute the basis for an intelligent security system, not limited to intrusion detection, but also monitoring other abnormal activities and events (such as abnormal behaviours of elderly or disabled people, i. e.

While currently alarm systems merely offer the possibility to switch the full protection on and off, this work proposes a more context aware protection, that tailors itself to the different situations that may {{take place in a}} home environment, and a set of smart behaviours to define the best reaction to each event, in order to introduce a novel working model for security systems: an always on operating mode where it 2 ̆ 7 s up to the system and not to the user the responsibility to determine whether protection is needed or not. To accomplish this, raw sensor data will undergo a pattern recognition process, where the system gains knowledge even of complex situation, inferring from dataflows coming from the environment (through statistical analysis, artificial intelligence and possibly machine learning). Apart from the always on mode, the introduction of pattern recognition techniques will enable to define a fine grain security model, not only providing intrusion detection, but also an access control policy where the system gains knowledge of which subjects are committing actions on which objects, since each of this two elements can be given an actual value if an identification infrastructure is introduced. The network layer will have to show some specific characteristic in its physical and logical parameters, in order to prove efficient enough to support this security system. Konnex bus will be investigated in this direction, and possibly extended or integrated with the cooperation of other existing network types, both wired and wireless, such as Ethernet/IP, wireless 802. 11 and/or 802. 15 protocols...|$|R
