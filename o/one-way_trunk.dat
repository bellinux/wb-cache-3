5000|$|In telecommunication, a <b>one-way</b> <b>trunk</b> is a trunk {{between two}} {{switching}} centers, over which traffic may be originated from one preassigned location only.|$|E
5000|$|Note 2: At the {{originating}} end, the <b>one-way</b> <b>trunk</b> {{is known}} as an [...] "outgoing trunk" [...] at the other end, it {{is known as}} an [...] "incoming trunk".|$|E
5000|$|On a trunk, on-hook and {{off-hook}} signals {{must pass}} in both directions. In a <b>one-way</b> <b>trunk,</b> the originating or A board sends a short for off-hook, {{and an open}} for on-hook, while the terminating or B board sends normal polarity or reverse polarity. This [...] "reverse battery" [...] signaling was carried over to later automatic exchanges.|$|E
50|$|Supervision and trunk {{signalling}} {{were the}} responsibility of trunk circuits. The most common kinds (reverse battery <b>one-way</b> <b>trunks)</b> were in plug-in trunk packs, two trunks per pack, 128 packs per Trunk Frame (originally) on 16 shelves. Each trunk pack was originally about 3x5x8 inches (8x12x20 cm) with edge connector in the back. The later 1AESS were made with shorter wire spring relays, making them less than half as wide, with more complex leaf spring connector. Trunk Frames were in pairs, the even numbered one having the Signal Distributor to control the relays in both. Most trunks had three wire spring relays and two scan points. They could supply regular battery or reverse battery to a line, and on-hook or off-hook supervision to the distant end, or be put into a bypass state allowing all functions (usually sending and receiving address signals) to be performed by common control circuits such as digit transmitters and receivers. Slightly more complex trunks, for example those going to TSPS offices for operator control, were packaged as only one per plugin unit.|$|R
