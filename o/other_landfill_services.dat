40|$|Landfilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} common ways of {{municipal}} solid waste disposal. Degradation of organic waste produces CH 4 and <b>other</b> <b>landfill</b> gases that significantly contribute to global warming.

In the present study the oxidation rate of CH 4 was studied with various types of compost as possible landfill cover. The influence of incubation time, moisture content and temperature on the CH 4 oxidation capacity of different types of compost was examined.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and evaluate policies that could increase the amount of municipal solid waste recycled in Clark County, Nevada. Clark County has not met the Nevada State goal of a 25 % recycling rate since it was established by the Nevada Legislature in 1991. Using the system dynamics problem solving approach, a model for Clark County was adapted from a model developed by Stave (2008) to test policy options. There was no feedback in the model due to the long lifespan of the <b>landfill</b> <b>servicing</b> Clark County and the relatively shorter time horizon of the model. Since there is limited manufacturing of products in Clark County, there is a low demand for recyclable material, which is a driving factor behind the low recycling rate. The scenarios that increased the recycling rate beyond 25 % were: (1) increasing residential and multi-family recycling to 34 %, which represents the recyclable portion of material in those waste streams and (2) increasing residential and multi-family recycling to 25 % and increasing commercial diversion to 30 % from small businesses and material collected by roll-off services...|$|R

Since 74 % of an average restaurant’s waste stream is compostable material, composting and reuse of organic material would redirect {{a significant portion of}} the waste stream from landfills. Economic, ecological, and social costs and benefits of three methods of organic waste disposal are compared: landfilling, off-site composting, and onsite composting. A waste characterization of one large Emeryville restaurant is performed to determine the mass of the organic waste generated. An economic analysis of the three methods of organic waste disposal is made for the specifications of this particular restaurant and ecological and social considerations are proposed for each method. Two commercially available composting technologies are compared.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in {{accordance}} with the RE-Powering America's Land initiative, selected the Johnson County Landfill in Shawnee, Kansas, for a feasibility study of renewable energy production. Citizens of Shawnee, city planners, and site managers are interested in redevelopment uses for landfills in Kansas that are particularly well suited for grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV) installation. This report assesses the Johnson County Landfill for possible grid-tied PV installations and estimates the cost, performance, and site impacts of three different PV options: crystalline silicon (fixed tilt), crystalline silicon (single-axis tracking), and thin film (fixed tilt). Each option represents a standalone system that can be sized to use an entire available site area. In addition, the report outlines financing options that could assist in the implementation of a system. The feasibility of PV systems installed on landfills is highly impacted by the available area for an array, solar resource, operating status, landfill cap status, distance to transmission lines, and distance to major roads.

40|$|Contamination {{of surface}} water or {{groundwater}} by metals and/or metalloids, originating from landfill leachates is environmental {{concern in the}} vicinity of landfills designed for disposal for municipal solid waste (MSW). It is known that many organic compounds and metals/metalloids can be associated with colloids of the size 1 nm- 1 μm. This relationship is mainly caused by the total surface area of colloids and consequently their binding capacity for contaminants occuring in the aqueous environment. In order to identify these associations in landfill leachates a cascade frontal filtration/ultra filtration is often adopted. Colloids obtained by this size-fractionation can be further studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) or transmission electron microscope (TEM) coupled to energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Typical example is a Vejen landfill in Denmark, which has been extensively studied, where leachate samples exhibited significant proportion of total metal content to be associated to colloids - Cd: 38 - 45 %, Ni: 27 - 56 %, Zn: 24 - 45 %, Cu: 86 - 95 % a Pb: 96 - 99 %. Whereas Cd, Zn and Ni were mostly associated with smaller colloids (1 - 10 nm), other metals like Pb and Cu were bound to colloids of the size > 10 nm.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to survey and risk {{evaluate}} 9 out of 23 disused landfills in Vilhelmina municipality, Västerbotten, Sweden. The study is based on MIFO methodology which is developed by the Swedish Environmental protection agency, EPA. The MIFO methodology is divided into two phases and this study deals with phase one. The intended use for MIFO is to evaluate the risk of these nine disused landfills and assess polluted soil and water areas. The results of the study are described for each landfill with respect to degree of pollution, the toxicity of the pollutants, conditions for distribution from soil to groundwater, soil to surface water, and surface water to sediments. The conclusions of the risk classification indicate that one landfill ended up in a class 2 and the <b>other</b> <b>landfills</b> ended up in class 3. Two of nine landfills are in need of action while the others need a control program to continuously monitor the status of the landfill. Metals were analyzed from soils of three landfills, and although these landfills were leaching, no levels exceeded the guideline value for land. Pollutants have been analyzed in surface water and groundwater of two of the landfills, but high detection limit and small sample sizes prevented accurate comparisons with available guidelines. More samples have to be analyzed to assure that guidelines are not exceeded. No acute environmental damages have been noted in this study, but in the future some of the landfills may need to be inventoried. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. T. R. P.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. A {{number of}} environmental, social and {{economic}} problems are associated with waste disposal in landfill operations. The potential hazards associated with landfill operations are numerous and include fatal accidents, infrastructure damage, pollution of the local environment, harmful air emissions, to simple nuisance problems – such as dust, odour, vermin, and noise pollution. Further challenges include the availability of land and lack of municipal or other financing {{in the face of}} rising operation costs. Landfilling is, however, seen by many as an environmentally responsible and cost-effective solution to waste disposal. It is acknowledged however to lead to waste of resources by burying valuable materials that could have been reutilized. Careful engineering can resolve this shortcoming, yet the associated challenges and costs can become prohibitive. The regulatory environment also affects the prospects for adopting this approach to landfill site management in different contexts. The Mariannhill landfill site in eThekwini Municipality, South Africa, provides an opportunity to investigate both the range of challenges which these type of sites encounter, and the solutions which have been developed as a response. The central questions which this research seeks to answer are whether the practices adopted by the Mariannhill landfill site are replicable in <b>other</b> solid waste <b>landfills</b> around eThekwini and whether it can be viewed as an example of best practice in landfill site management more generally. The research finds that the main barrier to easy replication of systems followed at Mariannhill in <b>other</b> <b>landfill</b> sites is the difficulty in replicating the specific structures and character of management. Another key determining factor found is the prevailing attitudes to recycling and the environment in general in the society. Consumers choices are seen to be critical to the prospects for recycling of solid waste, including the size, degradability and recyclable potential of products purchased. In considering the potential for replication of the Mariannhill model as an example of best practice, it becomes clear that the technical aspects of operations at Mariannhill are the most easily replicable, yet other and equally important determinants of success are not easily replicable. These include the existing regulatory environment and prevailing societal attitudes towards recycling...|$|R
