50|$|The {{non-uniform}} {{property of}} NURBS brings up an important point. Because they are generated mathematically, NURBS objects have a parameter space {{in addition to}} the 3D geometric space in which they are displayed. Specifically, an array of values called knots specifies the extent of influence of each control vertex (CV) on the curve or surface. Knots are invisible in 3D space and you can't manipulate them directly, but occasionally their behavior affects the visible appearance of the NURBS <b>object.</b> <b>Parameter</b> space is one-dimensional for curves, which have only a single U dimension topologically, even though they exist geometrically in 3D space. Surfaces have two dimensions in parameter space, called U and V.|$|E
5000|$|Downcasting {{is useful}} when {{the type of}} the value {{referenced}} by the Parent variable is known and often is used when passing a value as a parameter. In the below example, the method objectToString takes an <b>Object</b> <b>parameter</b> which {{is assumed to be}} of type String.public static String objectToString(Object myObject) { // This will only work when the myObject currently holding value is string. return (String)myObject;}public static void main(String args) { // This will work since we passed in String, so myObject has value of String. String result = objectToString("My String"); Object iFail = new Object (...) // This will fail since we passed in Object which does not have value of String. result = objectToString(iFail);}In this approach, downcasting prevents the compiler from detecting a possible error and instead causes a run-time error.Downcasting myObject to String ('(String)myObject') was not possible at compile time because there are times that myObject is String type, so only at run time can we figure out whether the parameter passed in is logical. While we could also convert myObject to a compile-time String using the universal java.lang.Object.toString (...) , this would risk calling the default implementation of toString (...) where it was unhelpful or insecure, and exception handling could not prevent this.|$|E

40|$|Fickle is a {{class-based}} {{object oriented}} imperative language, which extends Java with object re- classification. In this paper, we introduce a natural observational equivalence on Fickle programs. This is a contextual equivalence on main methods {{with respect to}} a given sequence of class defini- tions, i. e. a program. To study it, we use the formal computational model for OO-programming based on coalgebras, which has recently emerged, whereby objects are taken to be equal when the actions of methods on them yield the same observations and equivalent next states. However, {{in order to deal with}} imperative features, we need to extend the original approach of H. Reichel and B. Jacobs in various ways. In particular, we introduce a coalgebraic description of objects (states of a class), which induces a coinductive behavioural equivalence on programs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} the complete conceptual model for an MC product offering; the Product Envelope. A literature review synthesises and presents new terminology relating to the design of MC products. It identifies that mass customisation takes place through the interaction between customer, product and producer (CPP Interactions). When designing these CPP interactions, it identifies two classes of design that mediate them; Macro and Micro level. It describes a range of approaches to product customisation and presents new meta customisation classes; <b>Object,</b> <b>Parameter</b> and Hybrid customisation. The paper links the process of mass customisation with emotional connection with a product and discusses the role of brand in this connection and in product selection. A four pleasures analysis is presented and the resultant hypotheses are used to reveal the complete model.
