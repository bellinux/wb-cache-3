On calculating the coefficients that characterize {{the components of the}} indicator <b>for</b> assessment <b>of</b> the <b>staffing</b> <b>for</b> innovative development, it has been concluded that the level <b>of</b> <b>staffing</b> <b>for</b> the innovative-integrated structures of the regions of Ukraine is low and thus brings evidence about that science-technological and innovation activities are in a threatening and, in some regions, in crisis state. The article builds the regional ranking, based on a number of indicators that reflect asymmetry in the <b>staffing</b> <b>of</b> innovative-integrated structures at the region level. It has been substantiated that the results of such ranking can serve as a basis for the development of regional strategic documents.
