5|$|The Austrian and French armies {{met again}} at Schliengen on 24 October. Moreau had arrayed his force in a semi-circle on the heights, {{offering}} him a tactically superior position. Charles threw his army against both flanks; the French left flank fought stubbornly, but gave way {{under the pressure}} of Condé's emigre corps; the right flank withstood a day-long battering by Latour and Nauendorf, but eventually had to withdraw. The loss <b>of</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crossing at Kehl forced Moreau to withdraw south to Hüningen.|$|E

5|$|The first {{road was}} built in Harrison County in 1809 {{connecting}} Corydon with Mauckport on the Ohio River. A tow-and-ferry line was operated there by the Mauck family bringing settlers into the county from Kentucky.

5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right <b>of</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> car park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E
5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack <b>of</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E

5|$|During late August {{and into}} early September 1961, an unusual series of {{low-level}} disturbances developed over Central and West Africa {{and into the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean. One of these systems, that probably formed over Central Africa {{at the end of}} August, became increasingly organized as it moved over Nigeria on September1. As the disturbance travelled steadily westward, its mid-level circulation became well defined, and the accompanying low-level centre gradually followed suit. An upper-level anticyclone accompanied the storm during this entire period, providing a favorable upper-air regime for strengthening. According to a post-storm study in 1962, all the necessary environmental ingredients were available to the disturbance while it was over land; the only factor inhibiting earlier development was a lack <b>of</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> warm waters. Around 1200UTC on September5, the low emerged off the coast of Senegal as a strong tropical depression or tropical storm. By this time, the system had a central pressure below 1006mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg), and sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) were reported in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. As the system neared Cape Verde, it continued to intensify and by the evening of September6, reports from the nearby Danish tanker Charlotte Maersk indicated that the system was already at or near hurricane intensity.|$|E
5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level <b>of</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes {{that seem to be}} involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability <b>of</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} in modern microprocessor design {{is a first}} order concern.

Dynamic Instruction Fusion provides a means to accomplish {{all three of these}} goals. By leveraging register re-use within typical instruction streams, whether generated {{through the use of a}} trace cache, or through wide issue instruction logic, it is possible to simultaneously reduce both <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> register file, as well the number of instructions stored within the instruction window. On average, Dynamic Instruction Fusion can reduce the number of instructions scheduled by ~ 48 %, while simultaneously reducing <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> register file by ~ 30 %. This reduction in both the number <b>of</b> register file <b>accesses</b> and instruction window entries directly corresponds to a saving in energy in the register file...|$|R
5|$|Uprising {{was created}} by Masahiro Sakurai after {{receiving}} a request from Satoru Iwata to create a launch title for then-in development 3DS. Development began in 2009, but was faced with multiple difficulties: these included lack <b>of</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hardware during early stages, balancing between its many elements, and issues with the controls. Sakurai was responsible for creating the story, which retained the light-hearted tone of the first Kid Icarus. The music {{was created by}} a team of composers that included Motoi Sakuraba, Yuzo Koshiro, and Yasunori Mitsuda. Since release, Uprising has sold over a million copies worldwide, and met with mainly positive reviews; praise was given to the story, graphics, music and gameplay, although the control scheme was frequently faulted.|$|E
