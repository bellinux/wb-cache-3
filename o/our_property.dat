25|$|The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in an {{internal}} report by delegate George Burnier, stated the following in April 1920:There are two distinct military organizations in Hungary: the national army {{and a kind}} of civil guard which was formed when the communist régime fell. It is the latter which has been responsible for all the reprehensible acts committed. The Government managed to regain control of these organizations only a few weeks ago. They are now well-disciplined and collaborate with the municipal police forces.This deep hostility toward Communism would be the more lasting legacy of Kun's abortive revolution. It was a conviction shared by Horthy and his country's ruling class that would help drive Hungary into what might have been a fatal alliance with Adolf Hitler.The nation of the Hungarians loved and admired Budapest, which became its polluter in the last years. Here, {{on the banks of the}} Danube, I arraign her. This city has disowned her thousand years of tradition, she has dragged the Holy Crown and the national colours in the dust, she has clothed herself in red rags. The finest of the nation she threw into dungeons or drove into exile. She laid in ruin <b>our</b> <b>property</b> and wasted our wealth. Yet the nearer we approached to this city, the more rapidly did the ice in our hearts melt. We are now ready to forgive her.|$|E

Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals. The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues.

40|$|Many {{object-oriented}} programming languages use fields to represent object state. But subclasses cannot alter {{the representation of}} an object sufficiently. Because of that, a number of subclassing problems are difficult or impossible to deal with if the superclasses were not designed to anticipate them, especially under multiple inheritance. Moreover, in languages such as Java and C#, encapsulation necessitates a lot of boilerplate code. In this paper, we improve the C# concept of properties, making them more flexible for use with inheritance and reducing their boilerplate code. Using <b>our</b> <b>properties</b> {{makes it easier for}} programmers to model programs in a more consistent manner. Furthermore, <b>our</b> <b>Properties</b> allow redefining an object’s attributes in ways that equal the possibilities for redefinition of virtual methods in many programming languages, which makes them better suited to deal with unanticipated reuse.

2500|$|Upon {{entering}} {{the house the}} man approaches the fireplace, called ognjište (...) —the hearth of an ognjište {{is similar to a}} campfire, in that it has no vertical surround. He lays the badnjak down on the fire and moves it a little forward, to summon prosperity for the household. Any other logs are brought in by other males and laid on the fire parallel or perpendicular to the first. The head of the household takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that <b>our</b> <b>property</b> increase in the field, pen, and barn!"

Footprint Power planned to demolish the 63-acre waterfront site that has towering smokestacks, a coal pile, and oil tanks. A city study estimated cleanup costs at more than $50 million. The final plan {{was to develop a}} new state-of-the-art natural gas plant on one-third of the original site, reportedly along the Fort Avenue side near the city's ferry landing. The remainder of the waterfront property eventually will be used for commercial and industrial redevelopment, the company said. [...] "The transition will not only stabilize <b>our</b> <b>property</b> tax base, but also provide cleaner, more efficient and reliable energy." [...] Footprint said its plans are consistent with the recommendations of a city study completed earlier that year on the future use of the power plant site. The City of Salem required Footprint to demolish the existing plant and stacks. [...] "We will restore some 30 to 40 acres of our waterfront to its vibrant and prosperous past." [...] Mayor Kim Driscoll said she had not [...] "detailed" [...] talks yet with Footprint, but is encouraged by discussions so far.

A randomized complete block experiment was planted in 12 environments, which included the 2004 and 2005 growing seasons and irrigated and dryland water regimes in eastern, central, and west central Nebraska, and a dryland, low-N environment in eastern Nebraska. The environment accounted for 71 – 85 % of the total variation in RVA parameters, while the hybrid accounted for 11 – 23 % and the environmentby- hybrid interaction, 1 – 3 %. Unfortunately, the results of this experiment suggest that it is diffi cult to predict the effect that environment will have on resulting sorghum-fl our parameters. Although of secondary importance in terms of total variation in sorghum-fl <b>our</b> RVA <b>properties,</b> the choice of hybrid predictably and signifi - cantly contributes to sorghum-starch viscosity properties.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{assigning}} indivisible and heterogenous objects (e. g., houses, jobs, offices, school or university admissions etc.) to agents. Each agent receives at most one object and monetary compensations are not possible. We consider mechanisms satisfying a set of basic properties (unavailable-type-invariance, individual-rationality, weak non-wastefulness, or truncation-invariance). In the house allocation problem, where at most one copy of each object is available, deferred-acceptance (DA) -mechanisms allocate objects based on exogenously fixed objects' priorities over agents and the agent-proposing deferred-acceptance-algorithm. For house allocation we show that DA-mechanisms are characterized by <b>our</b> basic <b>properties</b> and (i) strategy-proofness and population-monotonicity or (ii) strategy-proofness and resource-monotonicity. Once we allow for multiple identical copies of objects, {{on the one hand}} the first characterization breaks down and there are unstable mechanisms satisfying <b>our</b> basic <b>properties</b> and (i) strategy-proofness and population-monotonicity. On the other hand, <b>our</b> basic <b>properties</b> and (ii) strategy-proofness and resource-monotonicity characterize (the most general) class of DA-mechanisms based on objects' fixed choice functions that are acceptant, monotonic, substitutable, and consistent. These choice functions are used by objects to reject agents in the agent-proposing deferred-acceptance-algorithm. Therefore, in the general model resource-monotonicity is the «stronger» comparative statics requirement because it characterizes (together with our basic requirements and strategy-proofness) choice-based DA-mechanisms whereas population-monotonicity (together with <b>our</b> basic <b>properties</b> and strategy-proofness) does not...|$|R
