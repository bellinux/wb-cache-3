40|$|Water {{management}} relies {{not only}} on data on water availability, but also on data on water abstractions and demands. Hydrological modelling studies often neglect the impact of water abstractions and not all models are designed to handle abstractions. Given the various activities for European scale assessments made at the JRC and other institutions, it is desirable to have quantitative and spatially distributed background information on water abstractions, losses and returns to better judge the potential relevance of human abstractions on water quantity and to have reasonable estimates for modelling purposes. The work presented in this report aims at evaluating the potential of readily available data from the OECD/EUROSTAT <b>Joint</b> <b>Questionnaire</b> on Inland Waters and relevant EUROSTAT data to support regionalized water balance assessments including human water abstraction and consumption. This report further document the methodological approaches to generate maps on water abstractions, losses and returns across the EU at 10 x 10 km resolution. Specific tasks documented in this report include: •	Modification and extension of available water abstraction data to generate consistent and complete datasets at national level. •	Spatial disaggregation of national data to regional and local (10 x 10 km cell) level using proxy data and simulation results. •	Estimation of consumptive water losses and returns •	Comparison of water abstractions and losses to water availability and mapping of water resources pressure indicators. The report is organized in three parts. Section 2 describes the data used in this assessment and the approaches to compile the specific data for the Atlas of water use and returns. Section 3 is an Atlas documenting and presenting the datasets. Section 4 is a general discussion of the approaches and results. JRC. H. 5 -Rural, water and ecosystem resource...|$|R

We merged the deliverables for the following reasons: For readability ease we have merged the two deliverables D 1. 1 and D 1. 2 into one. Saving time and effort, since both issues T 1. 1 / T 1. 2 are not independent, we have decided to merge the body of study / analysis (<b>joint</b> <b>questionnaire!)</b> into one, clearly separating out goals (introduction) and recommendations (conclusion) {{for each of the}} two tasks. Despite being merged, this deliverable clearly delivers the expected outcomes of each of the constituents as part of the conclusion: Gather information about current practices in the training industry about the current and potential use of AR/WT in educational processes in order to assess training industry needs (D 1. 1) and to extract input for the WEKIT Framework and Training Methodology (T 1. 1). Gather information about current practices in the technology industry about conditions, success factors and acceptance conditions for the current and potential future use of AR/WT in educational processes and other industry relevant use cases in order to assess technology industry needs (D 1. 2) and to extract requirements for WEKIT scenarios and technical prototype (T 1. 2). Our results confirm a high interest in augmented reality (AR) and wearable technologies (WT) for educational purposes, while they also reveal, that the experience with these technologies in practical use is still sparse. To support the development of educational AR/WT applications with a focus on usefulness, usability, and feasibility, we collected a number of insights taking three perspectives: industry needs, user needs, and technology needs. These insights feed into the parallel deliverables D 1. 3 (WEKIT Framework and Training Methodology) and D 1. 4 (Requirements for scenarios and prototypes) and also are used as starting point for the technical and pedagogical workpackages WP 2 (Wearables-Enhanced Learning Technology Platform), WP 3 (Wearable Experience Capturing and Analytics), WP 4 (Augmented Reality Learning and Experience Re-enactment), WP 5 (Workplace Integration and Human Aspects).

Diagnosing chondromalacia is very difficult. Knee arthroscopy is the best method for evaluating the cartilage condition, however this technique is invasive. Kinesiotaping is a therapeutic method extensively used to affect knee pain. Patellar taping is an effective method in improving symptoms resulting from patellofemoral joint problems, nevertheless the evaluation of its effect {{has not yet been}} objectively investigated. Aim of the thesis: The aim of this study is firstly to discover the possibility to noninvasively detect chondromalacia patellae using the method of biorheometry and secondly to discover the impact of kinesiotaping on rheological properties of the knee joint with chondromalacia patellae. Method: The designed experiment was performed as a pilot case study using the method of biorheometry.

METHODS [...] A <b>Joint</b> Symptom <b>Questionnaire,</b> developed to resemble the McGill Pain Questionnaire, was given to health professionals (n = 50) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 100), fibromyalgia (FM) (n = 50), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (n = 50), and osteoarthritis (OA) (n = 50). Respondents were invited to define each word by selecting an appropriate heading. Comparison of patient groups was based on the selection of words they chose to describe their joint symptoms. RESULTS [...] Between health professionals and patients there were no semantic differences in the words given. Patients with FM chose more words to describe their symptoms than the other patient groups (RA median nine words; AS nine words; OA 10 words; FM 12 words). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, a clear distinction between patients with RA, FM, and AS was found, but patients with RA were not readily separated from patients with OA.

40|$|Objectives: Knowledge {{about the}} impact of joint {{impairment}} on functional ability is needed in planning care and setting treatment goals in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). We investigated the relationship between joint impairments and upper and lower limb function. Methods: Twenty-one children with systemic JIA with an average age of 9. 2 years and a mean disease duration of 4. 8 years participated in this study. Joint impairments were assessed by the following variables: joint counts on swollen (JCS) and tender (JCT) joints and the loss of joint motion as determined by the Joint Alignment and Motion scale (JAM). Functional performance and functional ability were determined by the Juvenile Arthritis Functional assessment Scale (JAFAS) and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ), respectively. The relationship between impairments and functional disabilities was studied at the level of (1) the complete instruments, (2) upper and lower limb function separately, and (3) the individual joints and items. Results: Regarding complete instruments, the Spearman rank correlation between functional disabilities and loss of joint motion as moderate to good (JAN/CHAQ rs = 0. 66, JAM/JAFAS rs = 0. 77). A fair correlation was found between functional disabilities and the joint count on swollen joints (JCS/CHAQ rs = 0, 45, JCS/JAFAS rs - 0, 52), but no significant relationship was found with the number of tender joints (JCT/CHAQ rs - 0, 02, p> 0, 05, and JCT/JAFAS rs = 0, 14, p> 0, 05). As the extremity level (upper and lower limb function), the relationship between functional diabilities and the loss of joint motion appeared to be stronger in the leg than in the arm. At the level of the individual <b>joints</b> and <b>questionnaires</b> items, loss of joint motion in hip or shoulder joint appeared {{to be the most important}} factor in predicting limitation in leg or arm function.

40|$|There {{were two}} main {{aims of the}} project. A surface {{replacement}} prosthesis was previously designed at the University of Durham for the metacarpo-phalangeal joint (MCPJ). Tools were required to assess the joint prosthesis pre-operatively and postoperatively. The areas of assessment which the author was involved in were joint stiffness and a self-assessment questionnaire. The Durham arthrograph had previously been used for many clinical trials to assess joint stiffness objectively. However, the computer system was not portable. Hence a new computer system was developed, in Lab VIEW, for a lap-top computer. Ten normal individuals were assessed to validate the system. A questionnaire was also developed for patients to self-assess {{the performance of their}} <b>joints.</b> The <b>questionnaire</b> assessed parameters such as range of movement, hand strength, stiffness and pain on visual analogue scales. The difficulty in performing activities of daily living were assessed on simple descriptive scales. The second part of the project was to develop a surface replacement prosthesis for the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ). Since there was inadequate information in the literature on the architecture of the PEPJ bearing surfaces and phalangeal bone shafts, a detailed study was performed on the bones from 83 PIPJs. Proximal and middle phalangeal bones were dissected, modelled in bone cement, sectioned and shadowgraphed. The shadowgraphs were measured and models of the proximal phalangeal heads were produced. These models were then used to design four PIPJ surface replacement prostheses over a range of sizes which covered 97. 6 % of the sample population of PIPJs. It was proposed that the MCPJ and PIPJ prostheses would be made entirely from cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE). Hence wear tests on pin-on-plate apparatuses were carried out to investigate the wear characteristics of XLPE-on-XLPE compared with other biomaterial combinations. The wear of XLPE-on-XLPE was comparable with UHMWPE-on-stainless steel. XLPE-on-stainless steel wore 10 times faster than XLPE-on-XLPE, and UHMWPE-on-UHMWPE wore 100 times faster than XLPE-on- XLPE. Hence it was concluded that all XLPE joint prostheses were feasible as far as the wear considerations were concerned...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the outcomes of both treatments for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the thumb trapeziometacarpal joint in a randomized trial. Methods: Women who were forty years of age or older were randomized either to trapeziectomy with ligament recon-struction and tendon interposition or to arthrodesis with plate and screws. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and at three and twelvemonths postoperatively with respect to pain, function (Patient-RatedWrist/Hand Evaluation [PRWHE] and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] <b>questionnaires),</b> <b>joint</b> motion, strength, complication rate, and patient satisfaction. Results: Forty-three patients were enrolled. Since we found significantly more moderate and severe complications following arthrodesis compared with trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (71 % versus 29 %; p = 0. 016), the study was prematurely terminated before the sample size necessary to validly compare the two groups was reached. The higher complication rate for arthrodesis led to an increase in revision surgery (two of seventeen patients).

This study is a retrospective, cross-sectional, nonrandom, cohort design, with subjects stratified according to disease severity based on functional limitation and {{the presence or absence of}} joint prosthesis. Subjects were recruited from primary care, geriatric medicine, rheumatology, and orthopedic clinics. There were 219 patients in the mild disease category, 290 patients in the severe category, and 65 patients with <b>joint</b> replacement. A <b>questionnaire</b> gathered information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, function limitation, use of health and social services, and effect on occupation and living arrangements over the previous 12 months. Costs were calculated as direct and indirect. Results. Low education and socioeconomic class were associated with more severe disease. OA affected family or close relationships in 44 %. The average cost incurred as a result of side effects of medication is similar to the average cost of medication itself. Excluding joint replacement, the direct costs ranged from Hong Kong (HK) dollar $ 11, 690 to $ 40, 180 per person per year and indirect costs, HK $ 3, 300 -$ 6, 640. The direct costs are comparable to those reported in Western countries; however, the ratio of direct to indirect costs is much higher than 1, in contrast to the greater indirect versus direct costs reported in whites. The total cost expressed as a percentage of gross national product is also much lower in Hong Kong. Conclusions. The socioeconomic impact of OA in the Hong Kong population is comparable to Western countries, but the economic burden is largely placed on the government, with patients having relatively low out-of-pocket expenditures. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Because {{of several}} similar {{features}} in the pathobiology of periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis, in a previous study we proposed a possible {{relationship between the two}} diseases. Therefore, the aims of this study were to study a population of rheumatoid arthritis patients and determine the extent of their periodontal disease and correlate this with various indicators of rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Sixty-five consecutive patients attending a rheumatology clinic were examined for their levels of periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis. A control group consisted of age- and gender-matched individuals without rheumatoid arthritis. Specific measures for periodontitis included probing depths, attachment loss, bleeding scores, plague scores, and radiographic bone loss scores. Measures of rheumatoid arthritis included tender joint analysis, swollen joint analysis, pain index, physician 2 ̆ 7 s global assessment on a visual analogue scale, health assessment questionnaire, levels of C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The relationship between periodontal bone loss and rheumatological findings as well as the relationship between bone loss in the rheumatoid arthritis and control groups were analyzed. Results: No differences were noted for the plaque and bleeding indices between the control and rheumatoid arthritis groups. The rheumatoid arthritis group did, however, have more missing teeth than the control group and a higher percentage of these subjects had deeper pocketing. When the percentage of bone loss was compared with various indicators of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity, it was found that swollen <b>joints,</b> health assessment <b>questionnaire</b> scores, levels of C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were the principal parameters which could be associated with periodontal bone loss. Conclusions: The results of this study provide further evidence of a significant association between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} the factors, including size of organisation, associated with job loss in patients awaiting surgery to the hip or knee <b>joint.</b> Methods: A <b>questionnaire</b> {{was mailed to}} 498 consecutive patients of working age listed at a district general hospital for major joint replacement, knee arthroscopy, or periacetabular osteotomy. Questions were asked about level of physical disability, duration of symptoms, employment circumstances {{at the time the}} joint problem began, and job changes since the onset of symptoms with their reasons. Analysis focused on those in work when their health problem began. Cox regression was used to examine risk factors for job loss related and unrelated to the joint problem, and results were summarised as adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Results: Responses came from 370 (74 %) of those mailed, including 278 who were in work when their joint problem began. Of these, 82 (30 %) had left their original job mainly or partly because of their joint disorder. Such job loss was more common in those employed in small businesses (HR for 2 hours per day (HR 2. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 6. 1) No similar associations were found when jobs were left for other reasons. After adjustment for non-sedentary work the association with small business employment remained but was weaker (HR 1. 5, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 2. 5). Modifications to work and access to occupational health advice were not associated with better job retention. Conclusions: In subjects with disabling hip or knee disease, job retention is poorer in those from small companies—a matter of concern given the rising prevalence of serious joint disease in the British workforce and the tendency of businesses to downsize and subcontract services to smaller enterprises. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Galleting is the {{practice}} of inserting chips of stone into the mortar joints of masonry. Its long and enduring history is not explained by the belief that it is primarily decorative and a convincing purpose is sought. Information is not only in short supply but also inconsistent in the unsubstantiated views expressed. A detailed understanding of galleted masonry is necessary for its correct conservation. To better understand the subject {{a wide range of}} galleted mortar <b>joints</b> were photographed, <b>questionnaires</b> were sent to professionals and their views correlated and a separate convenience survey conducted. The geographical spread of galleting was plotted and the origins of galleting sought through secondary data sources. Finally, a series of new and innovative tests was devised to establish the influence of gallets on the strength and durability of lime mortar joints. A definition and taxonomy was devised to aid positive identification of galleting. Lime mortar joints are susceptible to early failure due to the slow progression of carbonation, exposure to weathering and the build-up of stresses. It was found that the incorporation of gallets into joints resolved this by significantly increasing compressive strength and reducing shrinkage. The gallets, being stronger than the mortar, accommodate the shear stresses and minimise the risk of failure. At the same time, they increase the durability of a wall and reduce damage due to weathering. Results show that galleting has been in use for many centuries, is more widespread than is generally recognised and almost certainly started out as a significant structural element in masonry construction. The true purpose of galleting and its relationship to the mortar in which it is bedded throws new light onto the use of non-hydraulic lime mortar in construction and conservation work. This will help conservationists and operatives to understand the complex nature of this traditional form of building...|$|R
40|$|Research Purpose : The area {{of joint}} audits became {{increasingly}} popular after {{the global financial}} crisis in 2010. This was after the European Commission proposed to mandate joint audits. South Africa {{is one of a}} few countries in the world were joint audits were once mandated for financial services firms. Although empirical research has increased, little has been done on theoretical research. This research investigates the factors influencing on the success of joint audits using an interorganisational theory, the resource dependence theory and concepts from joint audit literature research. Research Methodology : The study adopted a quantitative descriptive approach. A self-administered online questionnaire was sent to a group of individuals with experience on <b>joint</b> audits. The <b>questionnaire</b> was based on interorganisational literature and research already conducted on joint audits. The group of individuals included individuals from companies that have been audited, individuals who have formed part of joint audits and regulators. Research Findings : The results of the research established important factors influencing joint audits. A suggested model which can be used by joint auditors, audited companies and regulators was developed from these findings. Opinion shopping ranked highest as the most important factor influencing joint audits, followed by similarity and goals where it was found that joint audits work best when firms are of a similar size, each firm has a unique value proposition and goals are clear. Market uncertainty was the next most influencing factor followed by the level of difficulty of the audit and lastly freeriding. Results suggested that gender does not to have any influence on the success of joint audits.

40|$|The bachelors thesis {{deals with}} the {{position}} and possibilities of wide-ranging use of yoga in modern physiotherapy. Yoga is an integral discipline looking upon humans as a whole. It does not divide them into separate parts, such as body, mind, psyche. In {{the past few decades}} yoga established itself in medical sciences and as an effective means of preventing civilization diseases, in rehabilitation and also as an auxiliary method of treating before all psychosomatic disorders. This way yoga has {{become an integral part of}} modern medicine. Yoga moves are very relaxed, slow, intentional, actively controlled and coordinated with breathing. As such these moves can be called reeducational, thus rectifying wrong movement patterns. By means of yoga one-sided overstrain of the locomotor apparatus can be set right very well, consequently establishing its well-proportioned load. Moreover, other existing treatment procedures can be supported effectively by establishing psychosomatic balance. The theoretical part of the thesis presents physiological principles of how yoga techniques work and describes the present-day position of yoga in physiotherapy. The thesis aims at showing the possibilities of wide-ranging application of yoga in physiotherapy, mainly for the benefit of influencing posture, breathing pattern, spine and joint mobility and improving the psychic condition of the patients. Qualitative research approach was applied using the following techniques: an interview, an examination by sight, body and posture assessment, the spine mobility examination, the examination of the passive movement range of the hip <b>joint,</b> the STAI <b>questionnaire,</b> and secondary analysis of the data. The study sample comprised three probands who took part in a six-month public yoga course during the research. Conducted examinations result in the fact that yoga exercises lead to regulation of the breathing pattern, to posture improvement and to balancing the psyche of the gymnasts. The thesis points out the fact that applying yoga techniques in physioteraphy to a larger extent can bring new possibilities of treating wrong body posture, solving vertebrogenic troubles and regulating breathing movements. The bachelors thesis can further on be used in clinical work of physiotherapists, but also for the needs of common yoga gymnasts...|$|R
40|$|THE PROBLEM. The {{research}} {{required an}} investigation into and an assessment of selected risk exposures of multinational companies headquartered in the United States and Hong Kong which have engaged in or planned to participate in joint ventures within the special economic areas or mainstream economy of China. THE METHOD. A data sample of forty-five companies (twenty-two in Hong Kong and twenty-three in the United States) was obtained from a population of 187 published listings of parent companies with verifiable <b>joint</b> ventures. A <b>questionnaire</b> was mailed to top-level corporate managers responsible for or vitally involved in the joint venture investment decision. Each respondent was asked to provide opinion data by individually rating twenty-three risks on a continuum which indicated the degree of concern for each risk. The risks were classified as political, foreign exchange, or commercial. The data for joint ventures in China 2 ̆ 7 s special economic areas and mainstream economy were analyzed using percentage comparisons, rank orders, and t-tests. Tabulations also were provided to illustrate demographic data. THE RESULTS. It {{was found that the}} political risk of primary concern for the special economic areas was the possibility of an excessive and unanticipated rise in taxes. For the mainstream economy, the highest concern expressed was the possibility of antagonistic attitudes developing toward foreign investment. The foreign exchange risk which received the highest priority was identical for both local groups. This concern involved the potential for financial loss from the restriction of currency exchange. This factor also was rated the greatest concern of all the risks evaluated in the survey. The primary commercial risk for the special economic areas was that of an inconsistent interpretation of the Chinese legal and regulatory structure. For the mainstream economy, the greatest commercial risk was found to be the failure or inability of the Chinese suppliers of raw materials to meet delivery schedules. It was concluded that joint ventures in China are faced with a moderate level of investment risk exposures. As a result of the two-tiered legal structure, the mainstream economy was reported to present a slightly higher political and commercial risk profile than was noted for the special economic areas...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the effects of Pilates exercises on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in individuals with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (HA). Design: Randomized, prospective, single-blind trial. Setting: Outpatient clinic of pediatric rheumatology and the rehabilitation department. Participants: Children (N= 50) with MA according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups. in group I (n= 25), the participants were given a conventional exercise program for 6 months. Patients in group 11 (n= 25) participated in a Pilates exercise program for 6 months. Main Outcome Measures: the primary outcome measure was HRQOL, as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4. 0 (PedsQL 4. 0). the secondary outcome measures provided an estimate of the clinical relevance of the primary outcome results and included joint pain intensity (according to a 10 -cm visual analog scale), disability (according to the Childhood Health Assessment <b>Questionnaire),</b> <b>joint</b> status (using the Pediatric Escola Paulista de Medicina Range of Motion Scale), and the total PedsQL 4. 0 score. Results: All participants completed the study. the scores of the PedsQL 4. 0 differed significantly between groups indicating that Pilates exercises increased these scores when compared with the conventional exercise program. Group II participants showed significant improvements in the 10 -cm visual analog scale-joint pain, Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, and Pediatric Escola Paulista de Medicina Range of Motion Scale. Conclusions: the use of Pilates exercises had a positive physical and psychosocial impact on HRQOL in individuals with HA. Future multicenter studies with a follow-up beyond the period of treatment using more objective parameters will be useful to support {{the results of the present}} study.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Adipokines as adiponectin, leptin and visfatin/nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) have {{recently}} emerged as pro-inflammatory mediators {{involved in the}} pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to determine whether serum adipokine levels independently predicted early radiographic disease progression in early RA. METHODS: A total of 791 patients were included from the prospective Etude et Suivi des POlyarthrites Indifferenciees Recentes (ESPOIR) cohort who met the American College of Rheumatology-European League Against Rheumatism criteria for RA (n = 632) or had undifferentiated arthritis (UA) (n = 159). ELISA {{was used to assess}} baseline serum levels of adiponectin, leptin and visfatin/NAMPT. In the RA group, we tested the association of serum adipokine levels and 1) baseline radiographic damage and 2) radiographic disease progression defined as a change > 0 or >= 5 in total Sharp-van der Heijde Score ([increment]SHS) between inclusion and 1 year ([increment]SHS >= 1 or rapid radiographic progression: [increment]SHS >= 5) adjusting for confounders (age, sex, body-mass-index, insulin resistance, C-reactive protein level, Disease Activity Score in 28 <b>joints,</b> Health Assessment <b>Questionnaire</b> score, auto-antibody status, steroid use and radiographic evidence of RA damage at inclusion). RESULTS: Adiponectin level was independently associated with baseline total SHS (adjusted beta = 0. 12; p = 0. 006). It was also associated with [increment]SHS >= 1 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1. 84 [1. 25 - 2. 72]) involving erosive as well as narrowing disease progression (aOR = 1. 73 [1. 17 - 2. 55] and 1. 93 [1. 04 - 3. 57], respectively). Serum adiponectin level predicted [increment]SHS >= 5 (aOR = 2. 0 [1. 14 - 3. 52]). Serum leptin level was independently associated only with [increment]SHS > 0 (aOR = 1. 59 [1. 05 - 2. 42]). Conversely, serum visfatin/NAMPT level and radiographic disease progression were unrelated. Considering the receiver-operated characteristic curves, the best adiponectin cut-off were 4. 14 mug/mL for [increment]SHS >= 1 and 6. 04 mug/mL for [increment]SHS >= 5 with a good specificity (58 % and 75 % for [increment]SHS >= 1 and [increment]SHS >= 5, respectively) and high negative predictive values (75 % and 92 % for [increment]SHS >= 1 or [increment]SHS >= 5, respectively). CONCLUSION: Serum adiponectin level is a simple useful biomarker associated with early radiographic disease progression in early RA independent of RA-confounding factors and metabolic status...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{investigate}} the initial response to treatment {{and risk of}} radiographic disease progression in current smokers (S), ex-smokers (EX), and nonsmokers (NS) in a prospective early arthritis cohort and to analyze the influence of smoking cessation on arthritis outcome. The ESPOIR cohort is a prospective cohort study monitoring clinical, biologic, and radiographic data for patients with inflammatory arthritis lasting 6 weeks to 6 months. We examined the influence of smoking status on disease presentation (baseline characteristics) and therapeutic response at 1 year. Risk of structural progression at 12 months, defined as change in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde score ≥ 1, was analyzed by multivariate regression adjusted for potential confounders (age, sex, joint erosion at inclusion, educational level, positivity for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 2 antibodies, and shared HLA-DRB 1 epitope). A total of 813 patients were included; 641 (79 %) fulfilled the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). At inclusion, 138 (21. 5 %) were S patients, 168 (26. 2 %) were EX patients, and 335 (52. 3 %) were NS patients. Baseline acute-phase indicator values were significantly lower for S patients than EX and NS patients (mean ± SD erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 24. 2 ± 18. 2 mm/hour versus 33. 4 ± 28. 0 and 31. 4 ± 25. 0 [P = 0. 02], respectively, and mean ± SD C-reactive protein level was 17. 7 ± 28. 0 mg/dl versus 28. 5 ± 42. 5 and 21. 4 ± 29. 0 [P = 0. 01], respectively). Smoking status had no influence on Disease Activity Score in 28 <b>joints,</b> Health Assessment <b>Questionnaire</b> score, EULAR response, or use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic therapy in the first 12 months of followup (P > 0. 05). The adjusted risk for structural disease progression was associated with active smokers (odds ratio 0. 50 [95 % confidence interval 0. 27 - 0. 93], P = 0. 028). Sixteen patients had stopped smoking at 12 months, with {{no significant difference in}} observed outcomes from other patients. In this large prospective cohort of patients with early arthritis, smoking status had no significant effect on disease activity and disability but did reduce 1 -year radiographic disease progression. The antiinflammatory role of nicotine may explain the lower systemic inflammation and structural disease progression in current smokers with early RA...|$|R
40|$|Articular {{stiffness}} is {{an important}} symptom in most arthritic diseases {{and appears to be}} a useful marker of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis. Attempts to obtain a reliable objective measure of articular stiffness span the last 30 years but a meaningful measure of this symptom remains elusive. A number of reasons have been suggested to explain the discrepancy between objective and subjective stiffness in arthritis and these can be summarised as: a semeiological confusion, aberrant mechano-receptor thresholds and concurrent muscle wasting. This thesis examines each of these hypotheses. Some patients may confuse pain and stiffness or may wish to use other words to describe their <b>joint</b> symptoms. A <b>questionnaire</b> was developed which enabled patients to express their joint symptomatology using a wide range of descriptors. No differences were found between health professionals and patients in their definition of each of the descriptors. The questionnaire discriminated clearly between groups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-articular rheumatism. Movement perception threshold was measured in the finger but it was found that subjects relied on cutaneous information. Vibration perception threshold was used as an alternative measure of mechano-receptor thresholds: no abnormalities were found in 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Muscle cross-sectional area was calculated from anthropometric data and the results compared with measurements obtained from computed tomographic scans. A significant decrease in forearm muscle cross-sectional area was found in rheumatoid arthritis but the decrease was not sufficient to explain the reduction in grip strength observed, some of the variation being explained by deformity and pain in the joints. From this study it was possible to make a correction for muscle wasting in previously published stiffness data, revealing significant increases in metacarpo-phalangeal joint stiffness in rheumatoid arthritis. This result was confirmed in new data based on the resonant frequency of the wrist. Further data on the qualitative aspects of muscle were obtained by relating dynamic angular wrist stiffness to level of contraction of forearm muscles. Although arthritic subjects differed significantly from normals at maximum activation, when the results were expressed in terms of absolute grip strength no differences were found, suggesting inhibition of muscle activation in rheumatoid arthritis. It is concluded that symptomatic stiffness is objectively quantifiable in arthritis providing measurements are made in relationship to the equilibrium position of the joint and providing a correction is made for muscle wasting...|$|R
