5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, {{each of which}} is a strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have accomplished this feat for a total of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E

5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E
5|$|Following {{unification}} {{of the greater}} part of the island under Merina rule in the 19th century, the palaces of the Rova served as the seat of power for successive sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar, including King RadamaI (1810–1828), Queen RanavalonaI (1828–1861), King Radama II (1861–1863), Queen Rasoherina (1863–1868), Queen Ranavalona II (1868–1883) and lastly Queen Ranavalona III (1883–1895), who ruled from the Rova until Madagascar's annexation by France. During his successful 1817 military campaign to pacify the east coast, RadamaI—son and successor of Andrianampoinimerina—was favourably impressed by the houses he saw in Toamasina that had been built by newly arrived Creole merchants from Mauritius and Reunion. Radama invited one <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>a</b> craftsman named Louis Gros, to return with him to Antananarivo to redesign Bevato as a home for his principal wife, Rasalimo. The new Bevato reportedly featured two stories, much like the houses Radama had seen in Toamasina.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, Peel {{played for}} Accrington. His signing was widely {{reported}} in the press. Before this, most professionals in league cricket were neither famous names nor particularly good cricketers. According to Pearson, in his survey of club cricket {{in the north of}} England, Peel was the first international cricketer to play in a league. He took 80 wickets that season, but only received a third of his salary; the committee withheld the rest because of unspecified problems during the season. His contract was not renewed and he instead became the professional at Morley. Pearson suggests that Peel's signing showed the clubs that big-name signings could bring benefits. Peel also accepted a position as a coach at Essex in 1899, and remained there until at least 1904. The press suggested that he would qualify for Essex, but he never played for that team. He later became the landlord of a public house in Churwell. In 1923 he resumed his connection with Yorkshire when he undertook a coaching and scouting programme for the county, in association with George Hirst, organised by the Yorkshire Evening News. Peel remained close to the Yorkshire players. When the four Yorkshire members of the English team that toured Australia in 1932–33 departed from Leeds, Peel was present and gave each <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> white rose—the symbol of Yorkshire. He attended the funeral of Roy Kilner in 1928, and was one of many Yorkshire cricketers to attend the memorial service for Lord Hawke in 1938. Peel continued to play cricket and coach locally into his seventies. In his later years, he worked in a woollen mill in Morley.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, the IOC {{announced}} that six athletes had tested positive during the 2008 Summer Olympics, without mentioning names or sports. Later, rumours emerged that the athletes included two cyclists, one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> medal winner. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) then confirmed that a male Italian cyclist had {{tested positive for}} Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) during the men's road race, without identifying him. The next day, on 29 April 2009, the Committee confirmed that Davide Rebellin was an involved athlete. Rebellin's agent sent a request {{for the analysis of}} the B sample. On 8 July 2009, Rebellin, along with Stefan Schumacher, were confirmed as having tested positive. Schumacher was already serving a ban after testing positive in the 2008 Tour de France, but faces further punishment, and Rebellin subsequently had his medal removed by the UCI and the IOC. On 27 November, Rebellin returned his silver medal to CONI, per their and the UCI's request. Per UCI regulations, Cancellara and Kolobnev were moved up to second and third in the official results, but did not initially receive new medals. On December 18, 2010, Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin, in a ceremony held in his hometown of Ittigen, Switzerland. The medal originally given to Cancellara will in turn be given to Kolobnev.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939 Cunningham rejoined his {{squadron}} {{which had}} been equipped with {{a version of the}} Bristol Blenheim. John was not enthusiastic about flying the Blenheim. The turret had been eliminated to reduce weight and increase speed, but the flying suits and cockpit were not heated, which caused discomfort to the crews over the winter period. The radios were too short-range which caused communication problems. The Blenheim's cockpit windshield was multi-faceted and difficult to clean. It was also liable to reflect light; which made cooperation with searchlights hazardous. The unit also had unspecified problems with blind-flying instruments. The squadron incurred some losses owing to the inexperience of crews flying patrols over the North Sea from RAF North Weald in Essex, a number <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> result of the difficulties with the aircraft. In January 1940 604 moved to RAF Northolt and flew Blenheim's adorned in the Finnish Air Force Swastika to Finland via Sweden to assist the country after the Soviet invasion.|$|E

5|$|Myers made {{passenger}} balloons for the St. Louis Fair in 1904. He was {{the superintendent}} of the Aeronautic Concourse of the St. Louis World's Fair.

Myers used as an example, to win the $20,000 prize of the Aero Club the French balloonist Alberto Santos-Dumont spent more than that amount in six airships he entered into the tournament to win. Myers himself had an over abundance of ideas for balloons, but was short on cash to make many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> reality even though he had the necessary balloon knowledge.
