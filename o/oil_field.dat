5|$|On August 20, 2008, Williams and a {{consortium}} of oil companies led by Chevron Canada signed a deal to develop the Hebron <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> – the second largest <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> {{off the coast of}} the province with an estimated 700million barrels of oil reserves, worth some $20billion in royalties and up to 3,500 jobs from the project. Construction is scheduled to start in 2012, with oil extraction by 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay <b>Oil</b> <b>Field</b> was {{discovered}} in Alaska's North Slope. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in oil prices during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.|$|E

They later attacked the <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> as well, forcing ISIL to withdraw. The group set the <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> on fire while retreating. On the next day, the Syrian army secured the entirety of the Jazal <b>Oil</b> <b>Fields</b> and captured the adjacent Jazal mountain.|$|R
5|$|CHC Helikopter Service {{operates}} {{flights to}} the {{offshore oil platform}} at Norne on contract with Statoil. The oil company flies an average 55 people to the airport with various scheduled services and onwards to the <b>oil</b> <b>field.</b> In addition, the helicopter operator flies to various temporary oil rigs. It has two Sikorsky S-92 helicopters stationed at Brønnøysund. In 2011, there were 17,229 offshore helicopter passengers which traveled through Brønnøysund Airport.|$|E
5|$|Hiding {{inside an}} <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> shack while police comb {{the area and}} set up roadblocks, Gil is {{discovered}} by young Suzy who offers to fetch him cookies. Hurrying back to her house, Suzy is caught hoarding cookies by her mother and is forced to reveal who they are for. While her mother calls the police, Suzy slips {{out of the door}} to return to Gil. Her mother chases after her into the <b>oil</b> <b>field,</b> and police cars soon arrive. Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him, Gil carries the girl out of the shack into the sunlight where he lets her go. He soon transforms into the creature. In the ensuing police chase, Gil slaughters one of the officers and then climbs the stairs {{to the top of a}} tall natural gas tank, where the remaining officer chases after him. As Gil begins to strangle him, the officer shoots Gil in the neck. Mortally wounded, the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell, Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay.|$|E
5|$|The harbour is very shallow {{in places}} and {{contains}} {{a number of}} islands, notably Brownsea Island, {{the birthplace of the}} Scouting movement {{and one of the few}} remaining sanctuaries for indigenous red squirrels in England. The harbour, and the chalk and limestone hills of the Isle of Purbeck to the south, lie atop Western Europe's largest onshore <b>oil</b> <b>field.</b> The field, operated by Perenco from Wytch Farm, has the world's oldest continuously pumping well at Kimmeridge which has been producing oil since the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{was built}} between 1974 and 1977 after the 1973 oil crisis caused a {{sharp rise in}} oil prices in the United States. This rise made exploration of the Prudhoe Bay <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> economically feasible. Environmental, legal, and political debates followed the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968, and the pipeline was built only after the oil crisis provoked the passage of legislation designed to remove legal challenges to the project.|$|E
5|$|The road {{begins at}} a remote {{interchange}} with US 101 south of King City in the Salinas River Valley. Leaving US 101, SR 198 {{passes through the}} Priest Valley, climbs the Diablo Range as a two-lane road and crosses over an unnamed pass. It then descends along Warthan Canyon {{to the town of}} Coalinga in the agricultural Central Valley, where it briefly runs concurrently with SR 33. On both sides of Coalinga the road passes through the enormous Coalinga <b>Oil</b> <b>Field.</b>|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{production}} in the East Texas <b>Oil</b> <b>Field</b> and oil prices stabilized. Though the major urban areas continued to grow, the extreme growth patterns {{of the first three}} decades began to slow. As western Texas and the panhandle region began to be more fully explored, the Permian Basin gradually became the top producing area of the state. Though independent oil companies were still {{an important part of the}} industry for some time, the major new strikes were increasingly made by established companies. World War II helped complete the state's transition to an industrialized and urbanized state with oil facilitating the transition.|$|E
50|$|With these developments, the {{original}} plan and design for the crude oil pipeline has to be reviewed to accommodate these new discoveries. The Pipeline will now evacuate crude oil from Lokichar <b>Oil</b> <b>fields</b> in Kenya, Lake Albert <b>Oil</b> <b>fields</b> in Uganda and <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> in South Sudan. As such considerations are being made to commence construction of crude oil pipeline from Lokichar to Lamu Port to evacuate Kenyan oil as more preparations are made to complete negotiations {{on the construction of}} joining crude oil pipelines from Uganda and South Sudan <b>oil</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|R

50|$|More than 40,000 <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> are {{scattered}} around the globe, on land and offshore. The largest are the Ghawar Field in Saudi Arabia and the Burgan Field in Kuwait, with more than 60 billion barrels (9.5×109 m3) estimated in each. Most <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> are much smaller. According to the US Department of Energy (Energy Information Administration), as of 2003 the US alone had over 30,000 <b>oil</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dallas and Fort Worth {{experienced}} one {{of their}} greatest oil-related construction booms in 1930 and 1931, when {{the opening of the}} East Texas <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> helped establish Dallas as the financial center for the oil industry in Texas and Oklahoma. New business offices and municipal buildings appeared in the city, including the Highland Park Village shopping center, one of the nation's earliest shopping malls. The Depression slowed population growth in the Dallas area somewhat during the later 1930s, but rapid growth patterns returned again during the 1940s. By this time, though, Dallas had already begun to rediversify, becoming a center for aircraft manufacturing and electronics technology in addition to a variety of other industries.|$|E
5|$|Following {{military}} service, Romesha {{moved to}} North Dakota, where his sister lived, {{to look for}} a job in the oil industry. He moved to Minot, North Dakota and purchased a 100-year-old, flood-damaged home that he is restoring himself. He took a job at KS Industries, an <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> construction firm. Initially crewing a hydro excavation truck, he went through a driver's training program and later began managing the crews of six other trucks. He currently works as a field safety specialist for KS Industries. His exploits during the firefight were later written about by journalist Jake Tapper in his book, The Outpost.|$|E
5|$|Hunt's first successes {{were in the}} oilfields of Arkansas, but he {{lost most}} of his fortune by {{the outset of the}} Depression as {{overproduction}} depleted his fields and his speculation on land and oil drained his resources. He joined in Columbus Joiner's venture which opened the East Texas <b>Oil</b> <b>Field.</b> Hunt bought most of Joiner's interests in eastern Texas and his company, Placid Oil, owned hundreds of wells. He became established in Dallas and was labeled the richest man in the nation in 1948 by Fortune Magazine. A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that he had had a hidden bigamous relationship, with his second wife living in New York.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, after Galveston {{was struck}} by a devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated. The {{following}} year, the discovery of oil at the Spindletop <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1-million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before. African Americans formed {{a large part of the}} city's population, numbering 23,929 people, which was nearly one-third of the residents.|$|E
5|$|In the 1910s, several power {{companies}} built lines through the area. The General Pipe Line Company completed an oil pipeline connecting the San Joaquin Valley's Midway-Sunset <b>Oil</b> <b>Field</b> with the port at San Pedro in 1913. Its alignment followed the Ridge Route north of Gorman {{and south of}} Reservoir Summit, a longer distance {{than any of the}} earlier transportation routes, but from Gorman south to the present location of Pyramid Lake, where it turned east to Reservoir Summit, it roughly followed the later Ridge Route Alternate. That same year, the Midway Gas Company opened a natural gas line, and the Pacific Light and Power Company opened a power line, both staying fairly close to the entire Ridge Route.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Goose Creek <b>Oil</b> <b>Field</b> was {{discovered}} launching an oil boom at Galveston Bay. In 1915 Goose Creek acquired the first {{offshore oil drilling}} site {{in the state and}} soon after refineries opened in Texas City, Baytown and Pasadena. The Humble Oil refinery in Baytown became the largest in the Houston area. The wealth brought on by the boom transformed the region and population surged. Texas State History Association. Manufacturing and refining expanded rapidly.

5|$|Jacob {{attends a}} lecture given by Gekko and {{introduces}} himself. Gekko {{tells him that}} KZI's collapse started when Bretton spread rumors of KZI having toxic debt. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton for his actions against KZI and for providing evidence against Gekko years ago. In revenge, Jake illegally manipulates the market by spreading rumors about the nationalization of a foreign <b>oil</b> <b>field</b> which Church has invested in. The company loses $120 million, but Bretton gives Jake a job, impressed by his initiative. Jake further impresses Bretton when he convinces Chinese investors {{to invest in the}} fusion project through Church.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{helicopter}} operations commenced out of Brønnøysund Airport in 1981, when Helikopter Service was contracted for fly to exploration {{field on}} Trænabanken. A combined fixed-wing and helicopter hangar {{was completed in}} 1983. The contract changed to Lufttransport from 1984. Operations remained limited and in 1989 the airport only saw 34 helicopter flights. The exploration resulted in a positive find on the Norne field, which started production in 1997.
