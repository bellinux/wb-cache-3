5|$|After the Ashton Canal {{closed in}} the 1960s, {{it was decided to}} turn the Portland Basin {{warehouse}} into a museum. In 1985, the first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heritage</b> Centre and Museum opened {{on the first floor of}} the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.|$|E

40|$|When {{referring}} to <b>the</b> tangible cultural <b>heritage,</b> {{people tend to}} concern more about the conservation and research <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tangible <b>heritage</b> than <b>the</b> cross-cultural communication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> which is also one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>heritage.</b> As an exotic new born <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>heritage,</b> <b>the</b> entity born from the cross-cultural communication inherits <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> on <b>the</b> one hand, {{and on the other}} hand generates diversities as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> differences based on social, cultural and environment. And the business model is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important reasons for <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> diversities. There’s no doubt that a good form of business model makes great significance to the cross-cultural communication. Therefore, <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business model <b>of</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> cross-cultural communication will not only contributes to the deeper understanding towards <b>the</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>heritage’s</b> cross-cultural communication, but also leads to the introspection to <b>the</b> tangible cultural <b>heritage</b> itself. In this way, a new kind of conservative notion could take form, and <b>the</b> goal <b>of</b> protecting cultural heritage could be achieved. Thus the Chinese Garden is a typical representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> which makes great sense in the cross-cultural communication. As a kind <b>of</b> tangible cultural <b>heritage,</b> <b>the</b> Chinese gardens are well preserved in different regions in China. While <b>the</b> spirits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese garden carry forward through <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese gardens abroad during the cross-cultural communication. As a new kind <b>of</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross-cultural communication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>heritage,</b> on <b>the</b> one hand, the Chinese gardens overseas built ever since China's Reform and Opening express creatively <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materialist and <b>the</b> spirituality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional Chinese Garden...|$|R

5|$|Fifteen {{additional}} trams {{were built}} by Strømmen as series two. The first vehicle was delivered on 4 August 1989 {{and was taken}} into service on 11 October, while the last was put into service on 27 August 1990. These were numbered 126 through 140. From 7 September 1990 to 1 February 1991, tram 140 was used on the tramway in Chemnitz, Germany. Following this delivery, all lines of the tramway used SL79, although there were still many other trams needed to supplement the new trams. During the summer of 1995, tram no. 137 was used on the Djurgården Line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heritage</b> tramway in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to a labor dispute about privatizing {{the operation of the}} tramway and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all trams and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heritage</b> plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E

5|$|In October 2012, {{with the}} project still unfinished, the museum {{published}} a report examining {{the reasons for the}} delay and additional cost. It found that the museum had greatly underestimated the work required due to the poor condition of the locomotive, much of which had been missed by a rushed inspection, which produced an overly optimistic assessment which was not based on engineering realities. It also found that once the project was underway, management lacked the experience, continuity or resources to undertake such a complex task, which was also hampered by illness and recruitment issues. Although the museum had a formal contract system to manage suppliers, managers failed to implement it properly, and it was ill-suited to the cottage industry nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heritage</b> railway sector which the suppliers were largely drawn from, many of whom had failed to meet their contractual targets. Problems were also caused by the conflicting objectives of producing a certified main line locomotive while retaining as many original components and assemblies as possible, and between the need to overhaul the locomotive {{and use it as a}} marketing tool for the museum. The report recommended that the NRM consider the scope, size and responsibilities of their project management and engineering functions, and their contracting policy.|$|E
