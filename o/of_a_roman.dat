5|$|A Roman {{colonnade}} {{was built}} in the third century, probably by emperor Septimius Severus, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under Roman rule. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Roman</b> fountain.|$|E
5|$|Also {{starting}} with Endubis these coins were 2.11-2.5grams in weight which {{is half the}} weight <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Roman</b> antoninianus of 3.5-4.5 grams. A Denarius in the early 3rd century was 2.5-3.00grams of 52 percent or less of silver, but the Aksum coins were almost pure silver at first later debased. The name is unknown so it {{is referred to as}} an AR Unit.|$|E

5|$|During Roman Britain, {{iron ore}} was mined in the Weald and transported to Ashford where two {{ironworks}} processed the ore into a workable metal. Archaeological studies have revealed the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Roman</b> {{town to the}} north of the current centre, roughly at the junction of Albert Road and Wall Road.|$|E
5|$|Fleet Street was {{established}} as a thoroughfare in Roman London and {{there is evidence that}} a route led west from Ludgate by 200 AD. Local excavations revealed remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Roman</b> amphitheatre near Ludgate on what was Fleet Prison, but other accounts suggest the area was too marshy for regular inhabitation by the Romans. The Saxons did not occupy the Roman city but established Lundenwic further west around what is now Aldwych and the Strand.|$|E
5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Tyldesley and its {{surroundings}} have provided {{evidence for the}} remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Roman</b> road passing through the township on its ancient course between Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). Following the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, Tyldesley {{was part of the}} manor of Warrington, until the Norman conquest of England, when the settlement constituted a township called Tyldesley-with-Shakerley in the ancient parish of Leigh.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the present}} house {{was built in the}} early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon. There is {{speculation}} that it may lie on the site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Roman</b> building, based on excavations to the south of the house in 1961/62. The house incorporates remnants of a 13th-century building which lie at an angle {{to the rest of the}} house. It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of St Andrew, which stands on the coast.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1902 {{the palace}} became {{the seat of}} the Belgian Historical Institute, and after a short time was {{acquired}} by the Congregation of Propaganda Fide.

5|$|Part of a slate frieze {{depicting}} a retiarius, or net-fighter, {{was discovered in}} 1738, most likely dating to the 2nd century; it was probably used to decorate the tomb of a gladiator. Other finds included a small bronze statuette of a gladiator, parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Roman</b> bowl depicting scenes from a gladiatorial contest, {{and part of a}} gladius sword handle. Much of the masonry from the amphitheatre was reused {{in the construction of the}} St John's Church and the monastery of St Mary.|$|E
5|$|Smaller objects {{include a}} wheel-turned blackware ceramic, a few {{terracotta}} figurines, shell beads, gems, gold, terracotta, iron nails, copper percussion beater, red fragment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Roman</b> lamp shade, an engraved emblem of emperor Augustus, an ivory handle, and a wooden toy boat. Based on these antiquities Wheeler {{concluded that the}} Arikamedu was a Greek (Yavana) trading station. However, recent excavations by Begley have altered this assessment.|$|E

Evidence for the presence of Anglo-Saxons in the sparsely populated, heavily wooded and isolated region is provided by place names incorporating the Old English suffix leah, such as in Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.|$|E
