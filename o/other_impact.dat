Underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions do not normally generate such large tsunamis, but landslides next to bodies of water resulting from earthquakes can, since they cause {{a large amount of}} displacement. If the landslide or impact occurs in a limited body of water, as happened at the Vajont Dam (1963) and Lituya Bay (1958) then the water may be unable to disperse and one or more exceedingly large waves may result.|$|E

500|$|This tiny {{woodland}} bird has {{had little}} <b>other</b> <b>impact</b> on literature, although it {{is the subject of}} Charles Tennyson Turner's short poem, [...] "The Gold-crested Wren", first published in 1868. An old English name for the goldcrest is the [...] "woodcock pilot", since migrating birds preceded the arrival of Eurasian woodcocks by a couple of days. There are unfounded legends that the goldcrest would hitch a ride in the feathers of the larger bird, and similar stories claimed that owls provided the transport. Suffolk fishermen called this bird [...] "herring spink" [...] or [...] "tot o'er seas" [...] because migrating goldcrests often landed on the rigging of herring boats out in the North Sea.|$|E
500|$|During its {{formative}} stage, a high-pressure area {{combined with}} the low pressure of Marco resulted in a tight pressure gradient which led to beach erosion and gale force winds on the Florida coast. In Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties, heavy surf generated by the combination of those systems caused [...] of beach erosion. Additionally, [...] of top sand were lost in that region. Further north, severe beach erosion caused the loss {{of as much as}} [...] of the dune line in Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie, and Martin counties. <b>Other</b> <b>impact</b> was minimal. Marco was one of few hurricanes to enter the Caribbean Sea and not make landfall. Also, Hurricane Hunter flights recorded volatile center structure with severe turbulence, extreme rainfall, and hail during a flight into the storm. Overall, Marco caused 14fatalities and approximately $8.2million in damage.|$|E

After degenerating {{into an open}} wave, Joyce's remnants passed over the ABC Islands, where locally heavy thunderstorms and light winds were reported on October 2. A tropical wave related to Joyce's decay was blamed for flooding in the Dominican Republic, where rain caused the Mao, Amina, and Yaque del Norte Rivers to burst their banks, flooding thousands of hectares of banana and rice crops.

500|$|As the {{hurricane}} passed about [...] {{north of the}} Lesser Antilles, the outer rainbands of Connie produced wind gusts as high as 104mph (166km/h) on Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. Wind gusts reached 46mph (74km/h) in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, although there were estimates of 80mph (130km/h) wind gusts on Saint Thomas. The outer rainbands of Connie also produced heavy rainfall in the northeastern Caribbean. The highest precipitation total in Puerto Rico was [...] along the lower Río Blanco, of which [...] fell in one day. Rainfall reached [...] in Charlotte Amalie on Saint Thomas. Two people drowned on the island, and one person was electrocuted due to Connie's passage. The hurricane also destroyed a few shacks and boats on Saint Thomas. Along the northern coast of Puerto Rico, the threat of Connie forced 40,000people to evacuate their homes. High waves and <b>other</b> <b>impact</b> from the storm destroyed 60poorly-built houses.

500|$|Studies {{conducted}} upon {{samples from}} Apollo 14 {{have shown that}} the samples do not support the possibility that the landing site is floored by volcanic rocks, or basalts. Basalts are sparse in samples of Cone crater ejecta, but somewhat abundant in samples recovered farther west, {{on the opposite side of}} the immediate landing site. Two explanations have been presented for this: (1) the majority of basalt in the landing site lies below the depth of excavation of Cone crater or (2) the presence of a basalt flow beneath the landing area excavated by a nearby crater with a diameter of [...] It is believed that the former seems more likely, as the basalts are similar to the basalts recovered at Cone crater. It is inconclusive whether or not the recovered basalts have a direct affiliation with the landing site, as it is located in a valley between ridges, and there exists the possibility that the basalts were merely deposited there as a result of <b>other</b> <b>impact</b> events.|$|E
2500|$|The {{latter part}} of the 20th century saw a new role for the riot shotgun, with the advent {{of a wide variety of}} less lethal {{ammunition}} for police use. These vary from the early [...] "bean bag" [...] shooting flexible baton rounds, rubber bullets and <b>other</b> <b>impact</b> munitions, to tear gas and, released in October 2009, a 12 gauge electroshock weapon from TASER International. Using the shotgun as the delivery system allows the officers to quickly choose a lethal or a less lethal weapon, so responding officers can adapt to changing situations; An officer in a standoff can quickly eject a chambered buckshot cartridge and replace it with a less-lethal cartridge such as a bean bag, and is not required to unload the magazine as with most rifles or handguns. Alternatively, one officer can be equipped with less lethal munitions, while others, equipped with buckshot, can provide a backup in case the less lethal rounds fail to stop the target.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2007, {{scientists}} from the University of Bologna identified a lake in the Tunguska region as a possible impact crater from the event. They do not dispute that the Tunguska body exploded in mid-air but believe that a ten-metre fragment survived the explosion and struck the ground. Lake Cheko is a small, bowl-shaped lake approximately [...] north-northwest of the hypocentre. The hypothesis has been disputed by <b>other</b> <b>impact</b> crater specialists. A 1961 investigation had dismissed a modern origin of Lake Cheko, saying {{that the presence of}} metres-thick silt deposits at the lake's bed suggests an age of at least 5,000 years, but more recent research suggests that only a metre or so of the sediment layer on the lake bed is [...] "normal lacustrine sedimentation", a depth indicating a much younger lake of about 100 years. Acoustic-echo soundings of the lake floor provide support for the hypothesis that the lake was formed by the Tunguska event. The soundings revealed a conical shape for the lake bed, which is consistent with an impact crater. Magnetic readings indicate a possible metre-sized chunk of rock below the lake's deepest point that may be a fragment of the colliding body. Finally, the lake's long axis points to the hypocentre of the Tunguska explosion, about [...] away. Work is still being done at Lake Cheko to determine its origins.|$|E
2500|$|There are six notable {{meteorite}} or comet impact craters in Saskatchewan. [...] Carswell, Deep Bay, and Gow Lake {{have affected}} the Canadian Shield area of the north. In the southern Phanerozoic crater are the Viewfield, Elbow, and Maple Creek structures. [...] The Carswell structure is the largest astrobleme at [...] in diameter. It is estimated that the impact to the Athabasca basin occurred about 478 million years ago during the Ordovician period. The thrust of the impact affected the Athabasca Rock groups. [...] The William River Subgroup and the Douglas and Carswell formations show inversions, thrusting and disruptions. [...] The impact that occurred about 210 million years ago has created the Gow Lake Structure. [...] This lake is [...] in diameter with Calder island centrally located. [...] La Ronge is [...] south-southwest of the crater location.

[...] The crater is about [...] in diameter and about [...] at the deepest point. [...] The circular impact ridge [...] above water level partially encompasses the crater area. [...] There is some central uplift. [...] The crater was formed about 50 to 150 million years ago. [...] Weyburn is west and Stoughton is north of the Viewfield Impact Structure, a small impact crater [...] in diameter. The impact occurred in the early Jurassic period about 190 million years ago. [...] Oil and gas reserves {{have been found in}} the area of the rim breccia [...] Another impact crater in the Phanerezoic crater is the Maple Creek Structure.
