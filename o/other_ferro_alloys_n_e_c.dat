40|$|Malleable iron {{lost the}} {{interest}} and the development stopped in the turbulent seventies of tremendous developments of new technologies. The personal computer, emission spectrometer, thermal analysis, cold-box core system and automatic vertical moulding were introduced into the foundry industry. Experience shows that these new technologies do not always match up with malleable iron. Solidification and mould filling simulation programs are not always capable to handle a low carbon equivalent iron like malleable iron. Recent developments show however by using these new technologies and combined with practical experience, {{it is possible to}} increase the casting yield of malleable iron to the same level as ductile iron. The mechanical properties, especially the yield strength of malleable iron according to the standard are equivalent to those of ductile iron, however the yield strength of oil quenched malleable iron is significantly higher than that of ductile iron. An extensive investigation is made between ductile iron, air quenched and oil quenched malleable irons based on the properties of more than 350 test bars produced under the same conditions. The results are compared with the existing international standards and discussed. Other properties like fatigue strength and response to surface treatments as induction hardening are also discussed. The costs of malleable iron are reviewed and compared with <b>other</b> <b>ferro</b> <b>alloys.</b> These recent developments in increasing the casting yield, the understanding of the strength, makes malleable iron competitive with ductile iron and cheaper than the first grade of ausferritic ductile iron, or steel qualities. It is possible to design lighter and save weight which is essential in the automotive industry. An example of “green cast” development for typical applications, used in automotive transmissions and engines are shown...|$|R

40|$|Steel is {{the most}} {{versatile}} material which has made the progress in every aspect on this earth possible. There are hundreds of varieties of steel because for each application {{it has to be}} made with specific properties to get the most optimum usage. It is well known that the basic constituent of steel is iron. But it is the proportion of other elements in it, which give each type of steel certain specific properties. These elements are added in liquid iron in form of <b>Ferro</b> <b>alloys</b> to get the desired composition and properties. Thus, <b>Ferro</b> <b>alloys</b> are im-portant additives in the production of steel. It can be said that no steel can be made without use of {{one or more of the}} several <b>Ferro</b> <b>alloys.</b> They form the backbone of steel. Thus, the <b>Ferro</b> <b>alloys</b> industry is vitally linked for its growth and development to that of the steel industry. <b>Ferro</b> <b>alloys</b> industry in India has never been globally competitive, despite its rich ore deposits and low-cost manpower, essentially due to a) Insufficient availability and high cost of electric power b) Increasing ores and reductants cost c) Non-availability of low ash, low phos. coking coal in the country for the production of desired coke with low ash, and low phos. contents, making import of such coke at a high cost imperative d) High-cost and insufficient infrastructural facilities (both road and rail) for rapid transportation of ore from mines to plants e) Stiff competition from producers and exporters of <b>Ferro</b> <b>alloys</b> in <b>other</b> countries like South Africa, Ka...|$|R

40|$|South Africa is {{a leading}} player in the {{international}} <b>ferro</b> <b>alloys</b> industry. Historical factors that have con-tributed to this dominant position include an abundance {{of natural resources and}} relatively low cost electric-ity. A number of relatively recent developments are potentially threatening this position. These include new legislation affecting the mining and minerals industry, a shortage of some types of suitable reductants, deple-tion of surplus electricity generation capacity with resultant threat of real escalation of electricity prices and pressure resulting from the recent strengthening of the South African Rand. The industry is addressing these challenges {{in a number of ways}} to ensure long-term viability. Some of these measures include investments in more efficient technologies that have economy of scale benefits and are less dependent on expensive reduct-ants and electricity. Local macro-economic impacts include new legislation regarding ownership of enter-prises, mineral rights and royalties on mineral sales, development plans for port and rail infrastructure, as well as initiatives to expand electricity generation and coke production capacity. The fundamentals for being a successful <b>ferro</b> <b>alloy</b> producer are still largely in place for South African pro-ducers.

40|$|CIS {{countries}} {{are home to}} some of the world's largest producers of chrome, manganese and silicon ferro al-loys and leading suppliers to world export markets. The region's <b>ferro</b> <b>alloys</b> production is rising faster than demand from its domestic steel industry- unit alloy consumption in domestic steelmaking is in fact falling as process efficiencies improve- and there is significant spare capacity available to increase production. CIS producers enjoy certain strategic advantages in the production of ferro alloys- for example, captive ore sup-plies, low power and labour costs- but must also meet certain challenges- such as lower labour productivity and greater distance to market than some of their competitors. CIS producers are ambitious but new invest-ment is needed to upgrade some aging plants and overhaul outdated process technologies {{if they are to be}} more competitive with the world's leading producers and address the environmental issues that are now mov-ing up the agenda. This paper describes the structure of the region's <b>ferro</b> <b>alloys</b> industry and discusses its advantages and dis-advantages by alloy and by country. It considers how the ongoing process of restructuring and new invest-ment in the industry might move forwards, based on its strengths and weaknesses, technical and environmental factors and the strategies of the main players. It asks how the industry might maximise its sub-stantial potential- in particular, for the production of chrome and manganese ferro alloys- and examines the implications this holds for all global <b>ferro</b> <b>alloys</b> players...|$|R
