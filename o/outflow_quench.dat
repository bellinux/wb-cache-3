40|$|We present Adaptive Optics {{assisted}} near-IR integral field spectroscopic {{observations of}} a luminous quasar at z = 2. 4, previously observed {{as the first}} known example at high redshift of large scale quasar-driven <b>outflow</b> <b>quenching</b> star formation in its host galaxy. The nuclear spectrum shows broad and blueshifted Hβ in absorption, which is tracing outflowing gas with high densities (> 10 ^ 8 - 10 ^ 9 cm^- 3) and velocities in excess of 10, 000 km s^- 1. The properties of the outflowing clouds (covering factor, density, column density and inferred location) indicate that they likely originate from the Broad Line Region. The energetics of such nuclear regions are consistent with that observed in the large scale outflow, supporting models in which quasar driven outflows originate from the nuclear region and are energy conserving. We note that the asymmetric profile of both the Hβ and Hα emission lines is likely due to absorption by the dense outflowing gas {{along the line of}} sight. This outflow-induced asymmetry has implications on the estimation of the black hole mass using virial estimators, and warns about such effects for several other quasars characterized by similar line asymmetries. More generally, our findings may suggest a broader revision of the decomposition and interpretation of quasar spectral features, in order {{to take into account the}} presence of potential broad blueshifted Balmer absorption lines. Our high spatial resolution data also reveals redshifted, dynamically colder nebular emission lines, likely tracing an inflowing stream. Comment: 14 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|The baryon {{cycle of}} galaxies {{is a dynamic}} process {{involving}} the intake, consumption and ejection of vast quantities of gas. In contrast, the conventional picture of satellite galaxies has them methodically turning a large gas reservoir into stars until this reservoir is forcibly removed due to external ram pressure. This picture needs revision. Our modern understanding of the baryon cycle suggests that in some regimes the simple interruption of the fresh gas supply may quench satellite galaxies long before stripping events occur, a process we call overconsumption. We compile measurements from the literature of observed satellite quenching times at a range of redshifts to determine if satellites are principally quenched through orbit-based gas stripping events – either direct stripping of the disc (ram pressure stripping) or the extended gas halo (strangulation) – or from internally driven star formation outflows via overconsumption. These time-scales show significant deviations from the evolution expected for gas stripping mechanisms and suggest that either ram pressure stripping is much more efficient at high redshift, or that secular <b>outflows</b> <b>quench</b> satellites before orbit-based stripping occurs. Given the strong redshift evolution of star formation rates, at high redshift even moderate outflow rates will lead to extremely short delay times {{with the expectation that}} high-redshift (z > 1. 5) satellites will be quenched almost immediately following the cessation of cosmological inflow. Observations of high-redshift satellites give an indirect but sensitive measure of the outflow rate, with current measurements suggesting that outflows are no larger than 2. 5 times the star formation rate for galaxies with a stellar mass of 1010. 5 [*]M⊙...|$|R

Previous [Oiii]Î» 5007 observations of these quasars showed evidence for ionised <b>outflows</b> <b>quenching</b> star formation in their host galaxies. Systemic CO(3 - 2) emission has been detected only in one quasar, LBQS 0109 + 0213, where the CO(3 - 2) emission is spatially anti-correlated with the ionised outflow, suggesting {{that most of}} the molecular gas may have been dispersed or heated in the region swept by the outflow. In all three sources, including the one detected in CO, our constraints on the molecular gas mass indicate a significantly reduced reservoir compared to main-sequence galaxies at the same redshift, supporting a negative feedback scenario. In the quasar 2 QZ J 002830. 4 - 281706, we tentatively detect an emission line blob blue-shifted by v â 8 ̆ 8 ¼ - 2000 km s- 1 with respect to the galaxy systemic velocity and spatially offset by 0. 2 â 8 ̆ 0 ²â 8 ̆ 0 ² (1. 7 kpc) with respect to the ALMA continuum peak. Interestingly, such emission feature is coincident in both velocity and space with the ionised outflow as seen in [Oiii]Î» 5007. This tentative detection must be confirmed with deeper observations but, if real, it could represent the molecular counterpart of the ionised gas outflow driven by the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Finally, in all ALMA maps we detect the presence of serendipitous line emitters within a projected distance â 8 ̆ 8 ¼ 160 kpc from the quasars. By identifying these features with the CO(3 - 2) transition, we find that the serendipitous line emitters would be located within | Î 9 ̆ 4 v | < 500 km s- 1 from the quasars, hence suggesting an overdensity of galaxies in two out of three quasars...|$|R
40|$|It {{is usually}} assumed that {{outflows}} from luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) are {{either in the}} energy-conserving (non-radiative) or in the momentum-conserving (radiative) regime. We show that in a non-spherical geometry the effects of both regimes may manifest at the same time, {{and that it is}} the momentum of the outflow that sets the MBH–σ relation. Considering an initially elliptical distribution of gas in the host galaxy, we show that a non-radiative outflow opens up a wide ‘escape route’ over the paths of least resistance. Most of the outflow energy escapes in that direction. At the same time, in the directions of higher resistance, the ambient gas is affected mainly by the incident momentum from the <b>outflow.</b> <b>Quenching</b> SMBH growth requires quenching gas delivery along the paths of highest resistance, and therefore, it is the momentum of the outflow that limits the black hole growth. We present an analytical argument showing that such energy-conserving feedback bubbles driving leaky ambient shells will terminate SMBH growth once its mass reaches roughly the Mσ mass derived earlier by King for momentum-conserving AGN outflows. Our simulations also have potentially important implications for observations of AGN jet feedback and starburst galaxy feedback. The collimation of the wide angle AGN outflow away from the symmetry plane, as found in our simulations, indicates that credit for work done by such outflows may sometimes be mistakenly given to AGN jets or star formation feedback since wide angle v ∼ 0. 1 c outflows are harder to observe and the phase when they are present may be short.

40|$|Supermassive {{black hole}} {{accretion}} and feedback play {{central role in}} the evolution of galaxies, groups, and clusters. I review how AGN feedback is tightly coupled with the formation of multiphase gas and the newly probed chaotic cold accretion (CCA). In a turbulent and heated atmosphere, cold clouds and kpc-scale filaments condense out of the plasma via thermal instability and rain toward the black hole. In the nucleus, the recurrent chaotic collisions between the cold clouds, filaments, and central torus promote angular momentum cancellation or mixing, boosting the accretion rate up to 100 times the Bondi rate. The rapid variability triggers powerful AGN <b>outflows,</b> which <b>quench</b> the cooling flow and star formation without destroying the cool core. The AGN heating stifles the formation of multiphase gas and accretion, the feedback subsides and the hot halo is allowed to cool again, restarting a new cycle. Ultimately, CCA creates a symbiotic link between the black hole and the whole host via a tight self-regulated feedback which preserves the gaseous halo in global thermal equilibrium throughout cosmic time.

40|$|Most {{theoretical}} models invoke quasar driven <b>outflows</b> to <b>quench</b> star formation in massive galaxies, this feedback mechanism {{is required to}} account for the population of old and passive galaxies observed in the local universe. The discovery of massive, old and passive galaxies at z= 2, implies that such quasar feedback onto the host galaxy must have been at work very early on, close to the reionization epoch. We have observed the [CII] 158 um transition in SDSSJ 114816. 64 + 525150. 3 that, at z= 6. 4189, {{is one of the most}} distant quasars known. We detect broad wings of the line tracing a quasar-driven massive outflow. This is the most distant massive outflow ever detected and is likely tracing the long sought quasar feedback, already at work in the early Universe. The outflow is marginally resolved on scales of about 16 kpc, implying that the outflow can really affect the whole galaxy, as required by quasar feedback models. The inferred outflow rate, dM/dt > 3500 Msun/yr, is the highest ever found. At this rate the outflow can clean the gas in the host galaxy, and therefore quench star formation, in a few million years.

40|$|The {{hot plasma}} filling galaxy {{clusters}} emits copious X-ray radiation. The classic unheated and unperturbed cooling flow model predicts dramatic cooling rates and an isobaric X-ray spectrum with constant differential luminosity distribution. The observed cores of clusters (and groups) show instead a strong deficit of soft X-ray emission: dL_ x/dT ∝ (T/T_ hot) ^α= 2 ± 1. Using 3 D hydrodynamic simulations, {{we show that}} such deficit arises from the tight self-regulation between thermal instability condensation and AGN outflow injection: condensing clouds boost the AGN <b>outflows,</b> which <b>quench</b> cooling as they thermalize through the core. The resultant average distribution slope is α≃ 2, oscillating within the observed 1 8), while unopposed cooling drives a too shallow slope, α< 1. AGN outflows deposit their energy inside-out, releasing more heat in the inner cooler phase; radially distributed heating alone induces a declining spectrum, 1 <α< 2. Turbulence further steepens the spectrum and increases the scatter: the turbulent Mach number in the hot phase is subsonic, while it becomes transonic in the cooler phase, making perturbations to depart from the isobaric mode. Such increase in d P/d T leads to α≈ 3. Self-regulated AGN outflow feedback can address the soft X-ray problem through the interplay of heating and turbulence.

While major mergers appear {{to play a role}} in instigating outflows in other systems, deep imaging of NGC 1266 as well as stellar kinematic observations from SAURON, have failed to provide evidence that NGC 1266 has recently been involved in a major interaction. The molecular gas and the instantaneous SF tracers indicate that the current sites of star formation are located in a hypercompact disk within 200 pc of the nucleus (Fig. 1; SF rate ≈ 2 M ⊙ yr- 1). On the other hand, tracers of recent star formation, such as the Hβ absorption map from SAURON and stellar population analysis show that the young stars are distributed throughout a larger area of the galaxy than current star formation. As the AGN at the center of NGC 1266 continues to drive cold gas out of the galaxy, we expect star formation rates to decline as the star formation is ultimately quenched. Thus, NGC 1266 is in the midst of a key portion of its evolution and continued studies of this unique galaxy may help improve our understanding of how galaxies transition from the blue to the red sequence (Alatalo et al. 2011) ...|$|R

The selected sightlines towards the starburst nuclei probe {{the properties of the}} recently formed massive stars and the physical conditions in the starburst-driven galactic superwinds. Despite being metal-rich and dusty, all four galaxies are strong Lyman-alpha emitters with equivalent widths ranging between 2 and 13 Angstroms. The UV spectra show strong P Cygni-type high-ionization features indicative of stellar winds and blueshifted low-ionization lines formed in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium. We detect outflowing gas with bulk velocities of about 400 km/s and maximum velocities of almost 900 km/s. These are among the highest values found in the local universe and comparable to outflow velocities found in luminous Lyman-break galaxies at intermediate and high redshift. The outflow velocities are unlikely to be high enough to cause escape of material from the galactic gravitational potential. However, the winds are significant for the evolution of the galaxies by transporting heavy elements from the starburst nuclei and enriching the galaxy halos. The derived mass outflow rates of ~ 100 Msol/yr are comparable to, or even higher than the star-formation rates. The <b>outflows</b> can <b>quench</b> star formation and ultimately regulate the starburst as has been suggested for high-redshift galaxies.

40|$|Relativistic {{outflows}} (mainly {{observed in}} the radio) are a characteristic feature of both Galactic stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of Galactic sources {{have shown that the}} outflow is strong at low accretion rates, but it weakens dramatically or disappears completely at high accretion rates, manifesting structural changes in the accretion flow. It is reasonable to assume that SMBHs follow the same trend. For low luminosity SMBHs in nearby elliptical galaxies and clusters, recent observations strongly suggest that the outflows play the central role in keeping the gas hot (mechanical feedback). If the <b>outflow</b> is <b>quenched</b> in SMBHs at high accretion rates similarly to the behavior of galactic sources, then the straightforward consequence is a relatively weak feedback of rapidly accreting SMBHs. We argue that elliptical galaxies and their central engines should then evolve through two stages. Early on, the central SMBH rapidly grows by accreting cooling gas at a near-Eddington rate with high radiative efficiency but with weak feedback on the infalling gas. This stage terminates when the black hole has grown to a sufficiently large mass that its feedback (radiative and/or mechanical), despite the low gas heating efficiency, is able to suppress gas cooling. After that the system switches to a stable state corresponding to passively evolving ellipticals, when the accretion rate and radiative efficiency are very low, but the gas heating efficiency is high and energy input from the relativistic outflow keeps the gas hot.

Traldi et al. [104] analyzed by schlieren imaging an ICP jet either impinging on a cylindrical substrate or in the free flow regime. Schlieren imaging allowed to evaluate the strong influence of the feed gas flow rates on the shape of the plasma plume and how the presence of the substrate affects the fluid-dynamics of the effluents.

40|$|The tight {{correlations}} {{observed between}} galaxies and their SMBH provides compelling {{evidence that the}} evolution of the galaxy and its central black hole are strongly linked.

40|$|Galaxy {{evolution}} {{is likely to}} be shaped by negative feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). In the whole range of redshifts and luminosities studied so far, galaxies hosting an AGN frequently show fast and extended outflows consisting in both ionized and molecular gas. Such <b>outflows</b> could potentially <b>quench</b> the start formation within the host galaxy, but a clear evidence of negative feedback in action is still missing. Hereby I will analyse integral-field spectroscopic data for six quasars at z ~ 2. 4 obtained with SINFONI in the H- and K-band. All the quasars show [Oiii]λ 5007 line detection of fast, extended outflows. Also, the high signal-to-noise SINFONI observations allow the identification of faint narrow Hα emission (FWHM < 500 km/s), which is spatially extended and associated with star formation in the host galaxy. On paper fast outflows are spatially anti-correlated with star-formation powered emission, i. e., star formation is suppressed in the area affected by the outflow. Nonetheless as narrow, spatially-extended Hα emission, indicating star formation rates of at least 50 – 100 M⊙ yr− 1, has been detected, either AGN feedback is not affecting the whole host galaxy, or star formation is completely quenched only by several feedback episodes. On the other hand, a positive feedback scenario, supported by narrow emission in Hα extending along the edges of the outflow cone, suggests that galaxy-wide outflows could also have a twofold role {{in the evolution of the}} host galaxy. Finally, I will present CO(3 - 2) ALMA data for three out of the six QSOs observed with SINFONI. Flux maps obtained for the CO(3 - 2) transition suggest that molecular gas within the host galaxy is swept away by fast winds.

40|$|Direct and {{statistical}} observational evidences suggest that photoevaporation {{is important in}} eroding the atmosphere of sub-Neptune planets. We construct full hydrodynamic simulations, coupled with consistent thermochemistry and ray-tracing radiative transfer, to understand the physics of atmospheric photoevaporation caused by high energy photons from the host star. We identify a region on the parameter space where a hydrostatic atmosphere cannot be balanced by any plausible interplanetary pressure, so that the atmosphere is particularly susceptible to loss by Parker wind. This region may lead an absence of rich atmosphere (substantially H/He) for planets with low mass (M ~ 3 M_earth). Improving on previous works, our simulations include detailed microphysics and a self-consistent thermochemical network. Full numerical simulations of photoevaporative outflows shows a typical outflow speed ~ 30 km/s and Mdot ~ 4 e- 10 M_earth/yr for a 5 M_earth fiducial model rocky-core planet with 1 e- 2 of its mass in the atmosphere. Supersonic <b>outflows</b> are not <b>quenched</b> by stellar wind ram pressure (up to 5 times the total pressure at transonic points of the fiducial model). The outflows modulated by stellar wind are collimated towards the night side of the planet, while the mass loss rate is only ~ 25 % lower than the fiducial model. By exploring the parameter space, we find that EUV photoionization is most important in launching photoevaporative wind. Other energetic radiation, including X-ray, are of secondary importance. The leading cooling mechanism is ro-vibrational molecular cooling and adiabatic expansion rather than recombination or Ly alpha cooling. The wind speed is considerably higher than the escape velocity at the wind base in most cases, hence the mass loss rate {{is proportional to the}} second power of the EUV photosphere size R_euv, instead of the third, as suggested by previous works [...] .

Results. We find bright, complex (CO) -C- 12 2 - 1 line emission in the inner 400 pc of NGC 1377. The (CO) -C- 12 2 - 1 line has wings that are tracing a kinematical component that appears to be perpendicular to the component traced by the line core. Together with an intriguing X-shape of the integrated intensity and dispersion maps, this suggests that the molecular emission of NGC 1377 consists of a disk-outflow system. Lower limits to the molecular mass and outflow rate are M-out(H- 2) > 1 x 10 (7) M-circle dot and (M) over dot > 8 M-circle dot yr(- 1). The age of the proposed outflow is estimated to be 1. 4 Myr, the extent to be 200 pc and the outflow speed to be V-out = 140 km s(- 1). The total molecular mass in the SMA map is estimated to M-tot(H- 2) = 1. 5 x 10 (8) M-circle dot (on a scale of 400 pc) while in the inner r = 29 pc the molecular mass is M-core(H- 2) = 1. 7 x 10 (7) M-circle dot with a corresponding H- 2 column density of N(H- 2) = 3. 4 x 10 (23) cm(- 2) and an average (CO) -C- 12 2 - 1 brightness temperature of 19 K.
