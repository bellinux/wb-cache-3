He went to live at Mamaroneck, in the county of Westchester, and while here he wrote and published {{the first of his}} novels, entitled Precaution. Concerning the <b>occasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> this work, it is related, that once, as he was reading an English novel to Mrs. Cooper, who has, within a short time past, been laid in the grave beside her illustrious husband, and of whom we may now say, that her goodness was no less eminent than his genius, he suddenly laid down the book, and said, [...] "I believe I could write a better myself." [...] Almost immediately he composed a chapter of a projected work of fiction, and read it to the same friendly judge, who encouraged him to finish it, and when it was completed, suggested its publication. Of this he had at the time no intention, but he was at length induced to submit the manuscript to the examination of the late Charles Wilkes, of this city, in whose literary opinions he had great confidence. Mr. Wilkes advised that it should be published, and to these circumstances we owe it that Cooper became an author.|$|E

60|$|The course {{which we}} have taken having brought us to {{the name of this}} {{distinguished}} Writer--Pope--I will in this place give a few observations upon his Epitaphs,--the largest collection we have in our language, from the pen of any Writer of eminence. As the epitaphs of Pope and also those of Chiabrera, which occasioned this dissertation, are in metre, it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph, as given in a former Paper, may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle, in preference to prose. If our opinions be just, it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case; and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure; and it is equally plain, that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy, or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery. For the <b>occasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> an epitaph is matter-of-fact in its intensity, and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction, except those which the very strength of passion has created; which have been acknowledged by the human heart, and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities. When I come to the epitaphs of Chiabrera, I shall perhaps give instances in which I think he has not written under the impression of this truth; where the poetic imagery does not elevate, deepen, or refine the human passion, which it ought always to do or not to act at all, but excludes it. In a far greater degree are Pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not I think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical Wit. I will transcribe from Pope's Epitaphs the one upon Mrs. Corbet (who died of a cancer), Dr. Johnson having extolled it highly and pronounced it the best of the collection.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the reason why students of different ages are demotivated towards writing and investigates ways to solve the problem. The study {{was based on the}} assumption that students’ motivation to write changes across school levels in relation to particular tasks and practices. After the investigation of the literature, the instruments to investigate motivation toward different genres of texts and processes were created. This part of the study comprised three phases and involved 707 students. In the preliminary phase, 5 th, 8 th, 10 th, and 12 th graders (N= 165) were asked to indicate, in written form, the type(s) or aspects <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> in and out of school they liked most, and the one(s) they disliked most. The students’ responses were integrated to information coming from Educational Ministery Documents, in order to create two questionnaires, one for the genres and one for the processes. The two questionnaires were administered to students of the same school grades as those interviewed in the first phase (N = 200), who rated each item on a 5 -point scale (“Not at all” – “Very much”) on four dimensions: liking, self-perception of competence, valuing and attainment value (second exploratory phase). In the third phase the two questionnaires have been modified and were administered to 361 students of the same school grades. Factor analyses showed different factor structures for each dimension. From ANOVAs and post-hoc analyses carried out on the factor scores, interesting developmental differences emerged for each dimension; in particular it emerged that new writings have an own trend. On the basis of the results, we reflected on pedagogical implications and elaborated didactics proposals. In particular we experienced two methodologies: one was based on a multimodal concept of composition, the other on the use of the blog at school. The two experiences showed positive aspects in the use of new technologies but they also showed difficulties connected to the integration between traditional writing and new writings. In conclusion, the research confirms writing is a complex process to teach, but it also shows the potential of didactic approaches that take into account motivational aspects and the changes occured in the communication field, giving students multiple <b>occasions</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the literary career of Judah Waten (1911 - 1985) {{in order to}} focus on a series of issues in Australian cultural history and theory. The concept of the career is theorised as a means of bringing together the textual and institutional dimensions <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and being a writer in a specific cultural economy. The guiding question of the argument which re-emerges in different ways in each chapter is: in what ways was it possible to write and to be a writer in a given time and place? Waten 2 ̆ 7 s career as a Russian-born, Jewish, Australian nationalist, communist and realist writer across the middle years of this century is, {{for the purposes of the}} argument, at once usefully exemplary and usefully marginal in relation to the literary establishment. His texts provide the central focus for individual chapters; at the same time each chapter considers a specific historical moment and a specific set of issues for Australian cultural history, and is to this extent self-contained. Recent work in narrative theory, literary sociology and Australian literary and cultural studies is brought together to revise accepted readings of Waten 2 ̆ 7 s texts and career, and to address significant absences or problems in Australian cultural history. The sequence of issues shaping Waten 2 ̆ 7 s career in writing is argued in terms of the following conjunctions of theoretical and historical categories: proletarianism, modernity and theories of the avant-garde; the "e;migrant"e; writer and minority literatures; realism, political purpose and narrative self-situation; communism, nationalism and literary practice in the cold war; utopianism and the "e;literary witness"e; narrative of the Soviet Union; assimilationism, multicultural theory and the "e;non-Anglo-Celtic"e; writer; theories <b>of</b> autobiographical <b>writing,</b> and autobiography in Waten 2 ̆ 7 s career. The purpose of the thesis is not to discover a single key to Waten 2 ̆ 7 s writing across the oeuvre but rather to plot the specific <b>occasions</b> <b>of</b> this <b>writing</b> in the context of the structure of a career and the cultural institutions within which it was formed...|$|R
