2500|$|Comedian Jon Stewart {{appeared}} on Crossfire on October 15, 2004 and criticized its format and {{the style of}} arguments presented on the show. He called hosts Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala [...] "partisan hacks", {{and asked them to}} [...] "stop hurting America". [...] Begala argued {{that the purpose of the}} show was that it was intended as for debate, to which Stewart responded [...] "To do a debate would be great. But that's like saying Pro Wrestling is a show about athletic competition" [...] and called Carlson's signature bow-tie an example of [...] "theater". At one point Carlson told Stewart [...] "I think you're more fun on your show", Stewart replied by saying: [...] "You know what's interesting though?

[...] Carlson later told Stewart that [...] "You need to get a job at a journalism school, I think" [...] to which Stewart quipped [...] "You need to go to one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Preminger {{began to}} {{assemble}} his cast. Harry Belafonte, a folk singer who recently had introduced Calypso music to a mainstream audience, {{had only one}} film to his credit, but he had just won the Tony Award and Theatre World Award for his performance in John Murray Anderson's Almanac, and Preminger cast him as Joe. Pearl Bailey's sole screen credit was the 1948 film Isn't It Romantic?, but she had achieved success as a band singer and was familiar to television audiences from her appearances <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Show</b> of Shows, so she was assigned the role of Frankie. Joe Adams was a Los Angeles disc jockey with no acting experience, but Preminger felt {{he had the right}} look for Husky. Diahann Carroll auditioned for the title role, but she was so terrified of the director she could barely focus on the scene, and Preminger cast her in the small supporting role of Myrt instead. Finally, every black actress from Eartha Kitt to Joyce Bryant was tested for the role of Carmen.|$|E

6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, your sermon last Sunday puzzled me. I could not {{comprehend}} (<b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>showing)</b> how Paul got that wonderful influence over those pagans which he evidently had; and as how to get influence is a very favourite study of mine, I borrowed the book when I went home, and read for myself; and the matter at last seemed clear enough, on Paul's own showing." ...|$|R

5000|$|Carlson countered Stewart's criticisms {{by reading}} {{examples}} of questions Stewart had asked of then-presidential candidate John Kerry during his recent interview on The Daily Show, such as, [...] "How are you holding up?" [...] and [...] "Have you ever flip-flopped?" [...] Stewart argued that unlike Carlson and Begala {{he was a}} comedian, not a journalist, and therefore {{it was not his}} role to conduct hard-hitting interviews. Begala defended the show on the basis that it was intended as a forum for debate, to which Stewart responded that calling Crossfire a debate show was [...] "like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition." [...] Arguably the most heated moment of the exchange occurred after Carlson told Stewart, [...] "I do think you're more fun <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>show.</b> Just my opinion," [...] to which Stewart replied, [...] "You know what's interesting, though?

5000|$|Others {{have called}} {{attention}} to a paucity of opposing viewpoints. Kenneth Feder, Professor of Archaeology at Central Connecticut State University and author of Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology, {{has said that he}} was approached by Ancient Aliens producers regarding his potential participation. [...] "My response was, I’d be happy to be <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>show,</b> but you should know that I think that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is execrable bullshit," [...] he said, in an interview.

From December 1950 to June 1951, he appeared with his wife on the ABC TV show Andy and Della Russell. [...] "It was a brief but pleasant musical interlude, which originated live from New York 7:00 to 7:05 every weeknight." [...] They also had an act that they would perform together in nightclubs. A review described their act as: [...] "delightfully light, cleverly done and wholly entertaining." [...] In addition to singing and dancing, Russell would perform impressions of celebrities. Lastly, they appeared together in the 1953 musical short, House Party.|$|E
50|$|During {{his time}} at NBC, Kinoy wrote scripts {{for many of the}} major NBC radio and {{television}} dramas of the 1950s, including the television anthology series Studio One and Playhouse 90. His television play Walk Down the Hill, based on his experiences as a prisoner of war, aired in 1957 as an episode of Studio One.

The series, although well-received, was cancelled when the stars Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy chose to pursue their stage careers.

5000|$|His {{television}} {{career began}} as Master of Ceremonies on the 1951 late Sunday afternoon comedy hour, Star Time, co-starring Frances Langford and Lew Parker as John and Blanche Bickerson ("The Bickersons"), {{as well as}} sound-effects master stand-up comedian Reginald Gardner. His own weekly solo skit on Star Time was as an hilarious, heavily accented Italian-American chef ( [...] in an all-white uniform, complete with huge muffin-shaped chef's hat) preparing bumbled recipes as he recited them along with frequent tangential references to [...] "the homemade-a wine" [...] fermenting in his bathtub visible from the kitchen. This led to a featured guest appearance with Sid Caesar <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Show</b> of Shows about a year later.

[...] Woody Allen is often misattributed to the Ira Stone character, as the character in the play is a hypochondriac and Allen went on to use that affectation to great effect in his own comedy career.
