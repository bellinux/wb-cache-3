5|$|Once elected, {{the council}} plays a largely passive {{role in the}} city government; it meets <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> month. The current council is divided between a {{coalition}} of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre right, plus a few members from smaller parties.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee elects the Politburo in the {{aftermath}} of the Party Congress. Since the full Central Committee meets <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> year, the Politburo functions as the Party's leading collective decision-making body. The Secretariat is also elected by the Central Committee, and is headed by the General Secretary. It is responsible for solving organisational problems and implementing the demands of the Central Committee. The Secretariat oversees the work of the Commissions of the Central Committee.|$|E

Using a shared queue approach, this overprovisioning is required <b>only</b> <b>once.</b> <b>As</b> a result, network services are simpler and have a small memory footprint.|$|R
50|$|The {{line between}} Essen and Gelsenkirchen, however, {{is served by}} a variety of {{passenger}} services, with intermediate stops at Essen-Kray Nord and Gelsenkirchen-Rotthausen, which are served <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour by S-Bahn line S2.|$|R
5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} town. When the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line and received mail <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E
5|$|The CPC is, officially, {{organized}} on {{the basis}} of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress, convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the Central Committee is the highest body, but since the body meets normally <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> year, most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party's leader holds the offices of General Secretary (responsible for civilian party duties), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and State President (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts the party leader is the country's paramount leader. The current paramount leader is Xi Jinping who was elected at the 19th National Congress held in October 2017.|$|E
5|$|When the National Assembly reconvened in Hanoi on October 28, only 30 of the 50 VNQDD {{seats were}} filled. Of the 37 VNQDD and Dong Minh Hoi members who turned up, only 20 {{remained}} {{by the end}} of the session. By the end of the year, Tam had resigned as foreign minister and fled to China, and only one of the three original VNQDD cabinet members was still in office. In any case, the VNQDD never had any power, despite their numerical presence. Upon the opening of the National Assembly, the communist majority voted to vest power in an executive committee almost entirely consisting of communists; the legislature met <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> year. In any case, the façade of a legislature was dispensed with as the First Indochina War went into full flight. A small group of VNQDD fighters escaped Giáp's assault and retreated to a mountainous enclave along the Sino-Vietnamese border, where they declared themselves to be the government of Vietnam, with little effect.|$|E
50|$|The Metropolitan Evansville Transit System {{was created}} in 1971 to address Evansville's growing need for public transportation. Service {{was limited to the}} actual city limits; buses ran <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour and {{generally}} did not run past 6:00 pm.|$|R
50|$|Despite an {{extensive}} network of lines in London, the company {{never made a}} net profit and <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> operating profit. It was acquired by the Postmaster General in the general nationalisation of private telegraph companies under the Telegraph Act 1868.|$|R

25|$|Because this {{reference}} frame rotates {{several times a}} minute rather than <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> day like the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced is many times larger and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by {{the rotation of the}} Earth.|$|E

Hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> year, likely due to the pain caused by the RSD/CRPS, which {{was caused by the}} plane crashes.

25|$|For example, many smokers {{believe that}} they are taking all {{necessary}} precautionary measures so that they won't get lung cancer, such as smoking <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> day, or using filtered cigarettes, and believe that others are not taking the same precautionary measures. However, it is likely that many other smokers are doing the same things and taking those same precautions.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of chrism may {{be accomplished by}} any bishop at any time, but usually is done <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> year, often when a synod of bishops convenes for its annual meeting.

Anointing with it substitutes for the laying-on of hands described in the New Testament, even when an instrument such as a brush is used.|$|E

25|$|The F121 engine had a rare set {{of design}} {{parameters}} {{as it is}} designed to be used <b>only</b> <b>once.</b> <b>As</b> a cruise missile engine, it was designed to have a long shelf life (be able to sit around unused for long periods of time) and then operate when needed for several hours. It was designed to power the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, which was to be a stand-off anti radiation missile. Its first flight was on July 30, 1984. The AGM-136 program was canceled several years later.|$|R
