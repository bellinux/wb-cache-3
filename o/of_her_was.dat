5|$|Grigory Orlov, one of Catherine's lovers, led {{a palace}} coup in June 1762 that ousted the Emperor Peter III and enthroned Catherine II. Sergeant Potemkin {{represented}} his regiment in the revolt. Allegedly, as Catherine reviewed her troops {{in front of}} the Winter Palace before their march to the Peterhof, she lacked a sword-knot (or possibly hat plumage), which Potemkin quickly supplied. Potemkin's horse then (appeared to) refuse to leave her side for several minutes before Potemkin and horse returned to the ranks. After the coup Catherine singled out Potemkin for reward and ensured his promotion to second lieutenant. Though Potemkin was among those guarding the ex-Tsar, it appears that he had no direct involvement in Peter's murder in July. Catherine promoted him again to Kammerjunker (gentleman of the bedchamber), though he retained his post in the Guards. Potemkin was soon formally presented to the Empress as a talented mimic; his imitation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> well received.|$|E

25|$|The Trojan {{survivors}} escape with {{a number}} of ships, seeking to establish a new homeland elsewhere. They land in several nearby countries that prove inhospitable, and are finally told by an oracle that they must return to the land of their forebears. They first try to establish themselves in Crete, where Dardanus had once settled, but find it ravaged by the same plague that had driven Idomeneus away. They find the colony led by Helenus and Andromache, but decline to remain. After seven years they arrive in Carthage, where Aeneas has an affair with Queen Dido. (Since according to tradition Carthage was founded in 814 BC, the arrival of Trojan refugees a few hundred years earlier exposes chronological difficulties within the mythic tradition.) Eventually the gods order Aeneas to continue onward, and he and his people arrive {{at the mouth of the}} Tiber River in Italy. Dido commits suicide, and Aeneas's betrayal <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> regarded as an element in the long enmity between Rome and Carthage that expressed itself in the Punic Wars and led to Roman hegemony.|$|E
