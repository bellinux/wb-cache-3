50|$|Monitoring, {{abundance}} estimates, {{and basic}} biological data {{are needed for}} the black-spotted torpedo {{in order to assess}} its conservation status. It is taken <b>as</b> <b>by-catch</b> by inshore trawl fisheries and anglers, and its shallow estuarine and intertidal habitats are vulnerable to coastal development. Resolving its taxonomy may reveal that this species has a much more restricted range than previously thought.|$|R
50|$|S. parvus is {{generally}} considered abundant and common in coastal, bay, and estuarine waters, over sandy and mud bottoms. This preference makes the least puffer commonly taken <b>as</b> <b>by-catch</b> during inshore shrimp trawls.This species is not utilized or targeted for any reason and its range overlaps with several marine protected areas. For this reason, Sphoeroides parva is listed as Least Concern.|$|R
40|$|Wet pitfall traps used {{to sample}} invertebrates, in particular, {{short-range}} endemic invertebrates {{for the purpose}} of supporting environmental impact assessments, killed, <b>as</b> <b>by-catch,</b> numerous small vertebrates. For the five surveys reported here, vertebrate by-catch rates varied between 0. 4 and 15. 6 individuals per 1000 trap nights using two litre plastic containers half-filled with ethylene glycol. No satisfactory alternative trapping strategy is available that provides quantitative data for sampling short-range endemic invertebrates (e. g., terrestrial molluscs, spiders and millipedes), which are a focus of the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority. We discuss the trade-off between catching short-range endemic invertebrates as part of an environmental impact assessment against killing small vertebrates <b>as</b> <b>by-catch.</b> We urge government environmental regulators to provide greater clarity on the specific locations of where short-range endemic invertebrate surveys should be undertaken as an interim measure for reducing vertebrate trapping deaths until improved trapping protocols are available and to be more cautious when requiring surveys for short-range endemic invertebrates...|$|R
50|$|Any {{fish that}} crosses {{the path of}} a drift net in the ocean may be tangled or caught in the net. Non-target {{individuals}} caught in the net are called by-catch. In 1994 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) estimated global by-catch rates to be as high as 27 million tons of fish discarded by fisheries each year. Many individuals of non-target species perish <b>as</b> <b>by-catch</b> in the cast of each drift net. As a result, many such species are now endangered. Species caught <b>as</b> <b>by-catch</b> include sharks, dolphins, whales, turtles, sea birds, and other marine mammals. Since nets are placed and may not be retrieved for days, air-breathing mammals that become tangled in the nets drown if they are unable to free themselves. In certain areas, exemption from punitive measure due to the unintentional by-catch of marine mammals, as outlined by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, is extended to commercial drift fishermen.|$|R
50|$|The Pavoraja arenaria (common name: sandy skate, yellow skate) is {{a species}} of fish in Rajidae family. It lives in depths ranging from 192 to 712 meters but is usually found from 300 to 400 meters out the coast of western Australia. Its maximum size is 34.3 cm total length. It is a little-known species that could be {{threatened}} by being taken <b>as</b> <b>by-catch</b> in trawl fisheries.|$|R
50|$|The sixgill sawshark {{is listed}} as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List. This is because of their {{restricted}} geographical range, small litters, high age of maturity, and extreme vulnerability to bottom trawling fishing. Though they are not sought after in any market, they are frequently caught <b>as</b> <b>by-catch</b> and disposed. Because of their deep habitat, sixgill sawsharks are not considered a threat to people.|$|R
50|$|Broad skates feed on cephalopods, crustaceans, {{and small}} bony fishes such as rattails. It is presumably oviparous like other skate species. Males mature from 86 to 93 cm and grow {{to at least}} 95 cm, while females grow to at least 99 cm. The {{smallest}} known free-swimming specimens measured 23 cm. This species is of no commercial interest, but is occasionally taken <b>as</b> <b>by-catch</b> in deepwater trawls and traps.|$|R
40|$|Cephalopods {{are caught}} mainly <b>as</b> <b>by-catch</b> {{in the bottom}} trawl and due to the growing demand for {{cephalopods}} in the international market, they are exploited all along the Indian coast.

50|$|The shortlip {{electric}} ray, Narcine brevilabiata is {{a species}} of electric ray in the numbfish family, Narcinidae. It may be synonymous with the blackspotted numbfish, Narcine maculata. The shortlip electric ray is found in shallow continental shelf waters offshore of China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, {{at a depth of}} 41 to 70 meters.
