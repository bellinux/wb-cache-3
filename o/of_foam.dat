5|$|Cystidia {{that are}} located {{along the edge}} of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74µm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls <b>of</b> <b>foam</b> bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Titanic {{began in}} July 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with {{the filming of}} the modern day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full scale RMS Titanic had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge which could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking. For {{the safety of the}} stuntmen, many props were made <b>of</b> <b>foam</b> rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron chose to build his RMS Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.|$|E
40|$|Crumb rubber {{modified}} asphalt (CRMA) is a "green" paving material {{which provides}} {{an effective way}} to recycle waste tires. However, it also faces the criticism of increased energy consumption and air emissions during construction. Foaming technology allows CRMA to be constructed at lower temperatures, but very limited research has been conducted on the influence <b>of</b> <b>foaming</b> water content on the properties <b>of</b> <b>foamed</b> CRMA binder. In this study, foamed CRMA binders were produced at various foaming water contents (0 %, 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, and 4 %) in laboratory, and their high-temperature performance, low-temperature performance, temperature sensitivity, and fatigue resistance were characterized and compared through laboratory testing. The test results indicated that foamed CRMA binders provide slightly worse high-temperature performance but better low-temperature performance, temperature stability, and fatigue resistance, compared to regular CRMA binder. With the increase <b>of</b> <b>foaming</b> water content, the high-temperature performance <b>of</b> <b>foamed</b> CRMA binder drops off, the low-temperature performance <b>of</b> <b>foamed</b> CRMA binder first decreases and then increases, and the temperature stability and fatigue resistance <b>of</b> <b>foamed</b> CRMA binder keep increasing.

5|$|The {{shape and}} size of the egg mass is {{characteristic}} of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. The smoky jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest <b>of</b> <b>foam</b> in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT：Different amounts <b>of</b> <b>foaming</b> {{agents were}} {{employed}} in natural rubber(NR) /butadiene rubber(BR) blends to understand the foaming behavior in presence of nano-reinforcing agent, zinc methacrylate (ZMA). The ZMA greatly improved most of the mechanical properties <b>of</b> the rubber <b>foams,</b> however it did not show considerable effect on the cell morphology, such as cell size, density and porosity. It was also observed that the foaming agent concentration affected all the mechanical parameters. When the content <b>of</b> <b>foaming</b> agent was increased, the number <b>of</b> <b>foams</b> was increased leading to a decrease in density of the compounds. But the size and distribution <b>of</b> <b>foams</b> remained unchanged with increased foaming agent. The effect of high styrene-butadiene rubber (HSBR) was also studied.

40|$|Foamed {{concrete}} is {{a controlled}} low density ranging from 400 kg/m 3 to 1800 kg/m 3, and hence {{suitable for the}} construction of buildings and infrastructures. The uniqueness <b>of</b> <b>foamed</b> concrete is does not use aggregates in order to retain low density. Foamed concrete contains only cement, sand, water and foam agent. Therefore, the consumption of cement is higher in producing a good quality and strength <b>of</b> <b>foamed</b> concrete. Without the present of aggregates, the compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>foamed</b> concrete can only achieve as high as 15 MPa. Therefore, this study aims to introduce the pelletized coconut fibre aggregate to reduce the consumption of cement but able to enhance the compressive strength.
