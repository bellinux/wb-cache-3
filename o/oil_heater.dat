50|$|Typical oil heaters {{range in}} power consumption/output from 300 to 2400 watts, and their length {{and number of}} columns is roughly {{proportional}} to their power rating. A 2400 Watt <b>oil</b> <b>heater</b> is usually approximately 1 meter (3.3 feet) in length.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> {{are more}} {{expensive}} to run and provide far less spatial heating than gas heaters, they are still commonly used in bedrooms and other small-to-medium-sized enclosed areas. This is because gas heaters, especially when unflued, are not suitable for bedroom use - gas heaters cannot be used in confined spaces due to the reduced oxygen, and the emissions produced. This leaves electrically powered <b>heaters,</b> such as <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> and fan heaters, as the only alternative.|$|R

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>heaters</b> {{have been}} known to explode when their thermal fuses fail to shut them off. This can cause fire, thick black smoke, {{unpleasant}} odors, oil on walls and other surfaces, and disfiguring scalding.|$|R
50|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{it is best}} to avoid having any object within three feet of an <b>oil</b> <b>heater.</b> Using an <b>oil</b> <b>heater</b> to dry clothes is not {{recommended}} by any modern manufacturer. There is a substantial fire risk if flammable materials such as clothing or bedding are left near a heater, especially synthetic fabrics such as polyester, which can melt or burn. Even though the surface temperature of the heater in normal operation is quite low, the extra thermal resistance of the clothing on the heater can cause its surface temperature to rise to the material's autoignition temperature. It {{should also be noted that}} some oil heaters contain strong warnings to avoid operation in damp areas (such as bathrooms or laundry rooms) because the moisture and humidity can damage components of the heater itself.|$|E
50|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>heater,</b> {{also known}} as an {{oil-filled}} heater, oil-filled radiator, or column heater, is a common form of convection heater used in domestic heating. Although filled with oil, it is electrically heated and does not involve burning any oil fuel; the oil {{is used as a}} heat reservoir (buffer), not as a fuel.|$|E

50|$|Several {{efficiencies}} can {{be measured}} in regards to heaters, such as the efficiency of heating a room with a given amount of power, and the efficiency of the electrical generator which powers the heater and power loss from transporting the electricity over power lines. Measures may also consider how well a heater keeps the temperature of a space above a certain point. Such a measure would find inefficiencies in heating an already warm room. Many heaters (the majority of available models) are equipped with a thermostat to prevent this inefficient heating, which in turn reduces running costs. This feature was much more common in <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> than in the cheaper fan heaters until recently; thus many older <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> will be cheaper and more efficient to run than their contemporary fan heaters that lack the thermostat.|$|R

In 1959, he opened an <b>oil</b> <b>heater</b> factory, Lamborghini Bruciatori, which later entered the business of producing air conditioning equipment. In 1963, he most famously created Automobili Lamborghini, a maker of high-end sports cars in Sant'Agata Bolognese. Lamborghini founded a fourth company, Lamborghini Oleodinamica in 1969. Lamborghini sold off many of his interests by the late 1970s and retired to an estate in Umbria, where he pursued winemaking.|$|E
5000|$|Kopp kept {{corresponding}} with Orwell {{for quite}} a while. He even sent him letters from France during the war. The friendship cooled in the late 1940s. When MI5 asked Orwell {{what kind of man}} Kopp was, he told them he was an [...] "unpolitical" [...] man. A loyal person, driven by honest anti-Nazi-feelings, but also an adventurer. After his adventurous military career, he became an inventor of a buggy, a washing machine and a sand-sieving machine. His biggest success was the Tinto heater, an <b>oil</b> <b>heater.</b> His designs were far ahead of his time but he lacked commercial instinct and his financial troubles almost ruined him.

50|$|Some {{companies}} offer <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> with a fan, {{to increase the}} air flow over the heater. Since it is constantly bringing the colder air from the room {{into contact with the}} heater, that can improve the rate of heat flow from the heater into the room. The rate of heat flow from the heater into the air in contact with it is higher when there is a greater temperature difference between the heater and the air.|$|R
50|$|A {{convection}} heater is a heater which operates by air convection currents circulating {{through the body}} of the appliance, and across its heating element. This heats up the air, causing it to increase in volume and so become buoyant and rise. <b>Oil</b> <b>heaters</b> are an example of this kind of heating appliance. A {{convection heater}} may have an electrical heater element, a hot water coil, or a steam coil. Because of the natural ventilation, they are quieter in operation than fan heaters.|$|R

40|$|Infiltration is {{a common}} source of heat loss, {{especially}} in older homes. This case study focused on a 1924 house in the downtown Eugene area. Infiltration in this home is excessive due to a basement door left open at all times, a fireplace lacking a damper, and vents left over from a defunct <b>oil</b> <b>heater.</b> We hypothesized that sealing these large leaks would reduce the infiltration by 50 %.

40|$|Abstract. A new-type heat-insulating water {{transporting}} {{vehicle is}} designed {{to solve the problem}} that water transported in cold area is apt to be frozen. The vehicle shall be actively heated and passively heat-insulated with fuel <b>oil</b> <b>heater</b> and polyurethane insulation layer.

In order to study on the heat-insulation property of the vehicle, the temperature distribution of the water in the tank and heat losses from the tank with ANSYS; finally, the low temperature environmental test is carried out. The test result shows that the water temperature in the tank is reduced from 20 ℃ to 19 ℃ for 24 h under ambient temperature of- 25 ℃, the average overall heat transferring coefficient is 0. 52 W/(m 2 •K) and thus completely meets requirements for water transporting in cold areas...|$|E
50|$|Two {{other forms}} of <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> should be noted. Prior to the {{development}} of battery-powered safety blinkers on saw-horses, many highway departments used small oil-burning safety pot markers to denote work zones, and many railroad systems still rely on oil-fired switch heaters, long tubs of fuel with a wick, that fits between the ties and keeps snow and ice from fouling the points of a switch. This is generally only used in yard applications. Mainline switches are usually heated by natural gas heaters.|$|R
50|$|In {{convection}} heaters, {{heating elements}} either warm the air directly or heat oil or another filler, {{which in turn}} transfers heat to the air. The air then warms the objects {{and people in the}} space. Convective heaters are suitable for providing constant, diffuse heat in well-insulated rooms. <b>Oil</b> <b>heaters</b> warm up slowly but do not reach dangerous surface temperatures; wire-element heaters, which may be fan assisted, produce warm air more quickly but may pose a fire hazard. One particular type of convective heater is the fan heater.|$|R
50|$|Using the oil as a heat reservoir, {{the heating}} element heats the oil, which remains warm {{for a long}} period of time while the heat is {{transferred}} to the metal wall through convection, through the walls via conduction, then to the surroundings via convection and radiation. The columns of <b>oil</b> <b>heaters</b> are typically constructed as thin fins, such that the surface area of the metal columns is large relative to the volume of the oil heat reservoir. A large surface area allows more air to be in contact with the heater at any point in time, allowing for the heat to be transferred more rapidly from the heater into the room.|$|R
