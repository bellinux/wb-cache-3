5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> oil {{are also}} {{frequently}} used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E
5|$|A popular snack in Kalimpong is the momo, steamed dumplings {{made up of}} pork, beef <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> {{cooked in}} a {{wrapping}} of flour and served with watery soup. Wai-Wai is a packaged Nepalese snack made of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form. Churpee, a kind of hard cheese made from yak's or chauri's (a hybrid of yak and cattle) milk, is sometimes chewed. A form of noodle called Thukpa, served in soup form is popular in Kalimpong. There are {{a large number of}} restaurants which offer a wide variety of cuisines, ranging from Indian to continental, to cater to the tourists. Tea is the most popular beverage in Kalimpong, procured from the famed Darjeeling tea gardens. Kalimpong has a golf course besides Kalimpong Circuit House.|$|E
5|$|The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans {{recommends}} consuming five to nine {{servings of}} fruit and vegetables daily. The total amount consumed will vary according to age and gender, and is determined based upon the standard portion sizes typically consumed, as well as general nutritional content. Potatoes {{are not included in}} the count as they are mainly providers of starch. For most vegetables and vegetable juices, one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked. For leafy greens, such as lettuce and spinach, a single serving is typically a full cup. A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> provides all the nutrients needed for health.|$|E

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
25|$|Technically, {{according}} to Jewish law, whenever one partakes of fruits or vegetables dipped in liquid while remaining wet, one must wash one's hands, if the fruit <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> remains wet.

25|$|Many {{species in}} the family Apiaceae or Umbelliferae are superficially similar to fennel, and some, such as poison hemlock, are toxic, so it is unwise, and {{potentially}} extremely dangerous, to use any part {{of any of these}} plants as an herb <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> unless it can be positively identified as being edible.|$|E
25|$|The term 'preserves' {{is usually}} {{interchangeable}} with 'jams'. Some cookbooks define preserves as cooked and gelled whole fruit (<b>or</b> <b>vegetable),</b> {{which includes a}} significant portion of the fruit.

25|$|Colloidal {{suspensions}} of nanoparticles of {{boric acid}} dissolved in petroleum <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> oil can form a remarkable lubricant on ceramic or metal surfaces with a coefficient of sliding friction that decreases with increasing pressure to a value ranging from 0.10 to 0.02.

In bulk-scale, an inverse relationship exists between friction coefficient and Hertzian contact pressure induced by applied load.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the centuries}} Macedonia {{had become a}} {{multicultural}} region. The historical references mention Greeks, Bulgarians, Turks, Albanians, Gypsies, Jews and Vlachs. It is often claimed that macédoine, the fruit <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> salad, was named after the area's very mixed population, {{as it could be}} witnessed {{at the end of the}} 19th century. From the Middle Ages to the 20th century the Slav-speaking population in Macedonia was identified mostly as Bulgarian or Greek and occasionally as Serbian.|$|E
25|$|Solyanka is a thick, piquant soup that {{combines}} components from shchi (cabbage, smetana) and rassolnik (pickle water and cucumbers), spices such as olives, capers, tomatoes, lemons, lemon juice, kvass, salted and pickled mushrooms {{make up a}} considerably strong sour-salty base of the soup. Solyanka is much thicker than other soups, about 1/3 less liquid ratio. Three types are distinguished: meat, fish, and simple solyanka. The first two are cooked on strong meat or fish broths, and the last on mushroom <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> broth. All the broths are mixed with cucumber pickle water.|$|E

25|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} that {{are high in}} lycopene include autumn olive, gac, tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, pink guava, papaya, seabuckthorn, wolfberry (goji, a berry relative of tomato), and rosehip. Ketchup is a common dietary source of lycopene. Although gac (Momordica cochinchinensis Spreng) has the highest content of lycopene of any known fruit <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> (multiple times more than tomatoes), tomatoes and tomato-based sauces, juices, and ketchup {{account for more than}} 85% of the dietary intake of lycopene for most people. The lycopene content of tomatoes depends on species and increases as the fruit ripens.|$|E
25|$|Benghazi {{is home to}} many {{distinctive}} {{dishes that}} can be prepared in the home. Bazin {{is one of the}} most well known of these dishes. Bazin is a dish consisting of a small loaf of heated dough and a meat <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> sauce. The dough can be ripped into bite-sized pieces and dipped into the sauce. This dish uses essential ingredients such as garlic and oil. Other dishes like Couscous are more well known around the world and adopted by other cultures. One common dessert that can be found in Benghazi is deep fried dates. These are often served with milk.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{the houses}} were 10–50 m2 in ground area, and were often {{provided}} with small gardens <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> plots, as well as adjoining workshops and storehouses. Inside, {{the houses were}} sometimes partitioned with curtains or wooden partitions, but usually they consisted of a single room; furniture was spartan, consisting of little more than benches and store chests; floors were strewn with rushes or straw; {{the only source of}} heat or light (other than the doorway) was the hearth in the centre of the living room. Rush lights fuelled by mutton fat were available, but they were expensive. A shuttered hole in the roof served as a chimney.|$|E

50|$|According to Delhi-based {{historian}} Sohail Nakhvi, pulao {{tends to}} be (comparatively) plainer than the biryani and consists of either <b>vegetables</b> <b>or</b> meat cooked with rice. Biryani {{on the other hand}} contains more gravy (due to the use of yakhni in it), is often cooked for longer (hence yielding more tender meat <b>or</b> <b>vegetables)</b> and with additional condiments. Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani comprises two layers of rice with a layer of meat (<b>or</b> <b>vegetables)</b> in the middle; the pulao is not layered.|$|R
