5|$|Like the Council, {{from time}} to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior {{military}} officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members. Such {{was the case in the}} lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The <b>operational</b> <b>work</b> of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.|$|E
500|$|With No. 1 Airstrip <b>operational,</b> <b>work</b> {{began on}} two more airfields. Some 5,000 coconut trees were removed for No. 2 Airstrip, {{and the site}} was {{levelled}} and graded, but its use first required the construction {{of at least two}} [...] bridges, so work moved to No. 3 Airstrip near Kilarbo. Its construction was undertaken by the 2nd Battalion of the US 43rd Engineers (less Company E), which arrived on 4 August. That day Japanese aircraft began to bomb and strafe Milne Bay, focusing upon attacking the airfields and the engineers as they worked. Four Zeros and a dive bomber attacked No. 1 Airstrip. One Kittyhawk was destroyed on the ground, while a Kittyhawk from No. 76 Squadron shot down the dive bomber. Following this, the Australians established a workable radar system to provide early warning. On 11 August, 22 Kittyhawks intercepted 12 Zeroes. Despite their numerical advantage, the Australians lost three Kittyhawks, while claiming four Japanese Zeros shot down.|$|E

40|$|Ipswich {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing regions in Queensland, and as such, Ipswich City Council has had to deal with a rapid {{increase}} in <b>Operational</b> <b>Works</b> Applications. The aim of this dissertation is to investigate ways of streamlining their <b>Operational</b> <b>Works</b> Assessment process. A new process was developed in the preliminary stages, based on Risk Management principles. The process was analysed and underwent extensive changes to ensure maximum effectiveness resulting in the use of checklists and incentives to streamline the development process. Once the process was finalised, analysis was carried out to ascertain the potential benefits. Risk Management excelled as a tool for the reduction of all types of risk, and in this case has resulted in major potential time savings for the Assessment of Developments. In addition the use of time based and financial incentives have been found to provide further indirect timesaving for the application assessment process which complement pre-lodgement checklist and site inspection checklist and meetings developed as part of the risk managemen...|$|R
