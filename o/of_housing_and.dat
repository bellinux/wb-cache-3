In H. Lavender and Son Ltd. v.

The largest occurred in May 1970 when over 1,500 students protested the Kent State shootings. In 1975, enrollment swelled to a record 8,500. The 1970s also saw the establishment of the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences at UND. During the 1980s and 1990s the University continued to grow. However, the devastating 1997 Red River Flood inundated numerous buildings on campus and forced the cancellation of the remainder of the school year.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 1950s, the radical reform of local {{government}} in Wales was considered more pressing than that in England, due to {{the small size of}} many of the existing authorities, especially the upper tier county councils. The Local Government Commission for Wales set up in 1958 was the first to recommend wholesale amalgamation of the administrative counties outside Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, with extensive boundary changes; however the then Minister <b>of</b> <b>Housing</b> <b>and</b> Local Government Sir Keith Joseph decided not to accept the report, noting that county amalgamations in England had been highly unpopular when proposed.|$|E
5|$|In 1360 {{the king}} {{conducted}} {{an inquiry into}} Southampton's defences and in 1363 he established a wider commission to examine how best to improve them.

The enquiry also concluded that the outer doors and ground floor windows of properties facing the sea should be filled in to form a more defensible line.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, K. Fred Skousen became dean of {{the school}}.

In 1993, the Organizational Leadership and Strategy Department was created, {{and a year later}} the school instituted a limited-enrollment policy. Also in 1994, the school began offering a minor in management. By 1998, the school's endowment had reached $40million and the Institute of Public Management was renamed in honor of George W.

5|$|In 2004, {{construction}} {{began on}} a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and {{a grant from}} the United States Department <b>of</b> <b>Housing</b> <b>and</b> Urban Development allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million New Urbanist revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood that borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park. Construction for the project began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the Dade County vote, Fort Lauderdale, Gainesville, and Palm Beach, Florida, and Austin, Texas, all {{rejected}} ordinances to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Department <b>of</b> <b>Housing</b> <b>and</b> Urban Development overturned its own rules they had set {{earlier in the year}} to allow unmarried and same-sex couples federally financed housing. Newsweek reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15years had been fired. An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator Paula Hawkins had also been dismissed. Despite the success of the Dade County campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of Aspen, Colorado, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Iowa City, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, and the very liberal Eugene, Oregon to pass gay rights ordinances.|$|E
