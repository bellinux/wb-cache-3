5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>five</b> months, and normal labor takes {{one to three}} hours. Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs. During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs, small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.|$|E

5|$|No nesting {{material}} {{is used in}} the breeding cavity. One white egg is laid each day until the typical clutch <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>five</b> eggs is complete. Incubation starts soon after the first egg is laid, with both parents sharing this duty in the day, but only the female at night. The eggs hatch in about 20 days, and the newly hatched young are blind, pink and naked. For most species, the eggs do not all hatch at the same time, so if food is in short supply only the older chicks survive. Adults and young defecate in the nest, and their pellets are trodden underfoot, making the nest cavity very malodorous. The chicks are in the nest for about 30 days.|$|E

5|$|The first XF-104 (Lockheed 083-1001, s/n 53-7786) was {{transported to}} Edwards AFB amidst high secrecy {{during the night}} of 24–25 February, where Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was to do the initial testing. On 28 February 1954, the XF-104 made a planned hop <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>five</b> ft off the ground during a {{high-speed}} taxi, but its first official flight took place on 4 March. During that flight, the landing gear did not retract, and LeVier landed after a low-speed flight of about 20 minutes. Adjustments and further flights discovered that the problem was low pressure in the hydraulic system. Bad weather kept the XF-104 on the ground until 26 March, when further flights were carried out with the landing gear retracting normally.|$|E

25|$|Appleton et al. (2009) {{extrapolated}} data by Yong et al. (1987), Ferrer López et al.

Reported variation in maturation period varies from 97–143 days (3.2-4.8 months) under the laboratory conditions to 6–12 months, also from laboratory data.

25|$|Sidewinders have an {{extraordinarily}} accelerated lifecycle, with natural life expectancies of females <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>five</b> years. Males may live {{quite a bit}} longer (maximum known natural lifespan of 13 years). Sidewinders can live more than 20 years when well fed in captivity (even females). Thus, energetics apparently factor heavily into natural female mortality, whereas predation might be the primary pressure on males. In the wild, females often die of exhaustion after giving birth, but the lives of sidewinders are also cut short by predation, diseases, and vehicle encounters.|$|E
25|$|The Jokhang owns a {{large and}} very {{important}} collection of about eight hundred metal sculptures, in addition to thousands of painted scrolls known as thangkas.

Among them are some extremely rare and important brass and copper statues originating from Kashmir, Northern India, Nepal, Tibet, and China. However, the most important statues of the Jokhang collection are those that date back to the Yar lung dynasty (7th–9th century).|$|E
