30|$|Habitat structures, {{vascular}} {{plants and}} grasshoppers {{proved to be}} excellent indicators in terms of practicability and cost efficiency. Vascular plants and grasshoppers showed high species numbers and abundances {{in most of the}} BINATS test areas, a circumstance which should enable the detection of potential species loss assumed from future GMP cultivation. Also, the methodology was practicable. One inspection for recording habitat structures and two inspections for monitoring vascular plants seemed to be adequate to get a comprehensive picture of diversity. Grasshoppers are mobile and their occurrence depends <b>on</b> weather <b>conditions.</b> One <b>inspection</b> proved to be marginal. When repeating the BINATS monitoring program, sampling frequency of grasshoppers should be increased to at least two annual surveys to provide comprehensive data.|$|R
40|$|Electricity plays a {{major role}} in today’s society and it is being taken for granted. For Electricity Network Company it is {{important}} that distribution of electricity is safe and disturbance free. Networks components faults will cause costs because compensation of disturbances is paid for the customers. For this reason it is important to minimize unplanned interruptions and optimize equipment performance. Network assets condition monitoring has an important role in the whole electricity network company’s operations so that investments timing and network assets lifetime can be optimize. The objective in maintenance is to maintain electricity network performance as high as possible. Its purpose is maintaining reliability, guarantee safety, prevent disturbances and repair noticed failures as fast as possible with optimal costs. 	 Maintenance can be divided into preventative maintenance and corrective maintenance. In preventative maintenance the aim is to prevent failures and it can be performed either time based or condition based. Efficient maintenance is based <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> <b>inspections</b> when <b>condition</b> monitoring of components can be used to optimize its lifetime and maintenance costs. Networks components can be also overhauled in certain time intervals but then unnecessary investments are possible. 	 The objective of this thesis is to clarify how condition based maintenance can be implemented more efficiently by using available network information. Appropriate would be that the resources could be used to necessary overhauls and not to inspections. For this purpose failure development is explained. Also insights are given on how to improve maintenance. The primary substations transformer, circuit breakers and protection relays has presented manners how their condition could be estimated without visiting the substation. The basis has been conveying data from primary substation and modern numeric relay possibilities to operate as data collectors. 	 Today ICT-technology enables gathering of diverse data from the electricity networks. Telecommunications make it possible to transmit information however for this purpose it is necessary to develop a system which can analyse and restore this data. This thesis presents potential structures for system infrastructure and database which could be practical. Intention is that system would not only serve maintenance but would also make possible to implement future smart grid technologies. /Kir 1...|$|R

Every year a significant increase in this group of vehicles enforces the need to shorten {{the time of the study}} of the technical <b>condition</b> <b>on</b> vehicle <b>inspection</b> stations. One of the major components checked during the inspection is vehicle suspension that has a decisive influence on the comfort and safety. Currently, vehicle inspection stations to assess the condition of the suspension mainly use EUSAMA method, which allows obtaining approximate results. The paper presents the verification of the effectiveness and operation of the developed method called Procedure of Matrix Decimation (PMD), which allows for useful application of research results using FFT spectral analysis of nonstationary, transient signals recorded on the vehicle during the EUSAMA test method. Verification of this method of signal processing was done with the use of vibration signals recorded on the vehicle during the EUSAMA test method on vehicle inspection stations. It consists of a comparison of the FFT spectra obtained for the secondary signal (after processing method based on PMD) with STFT analyzes made for the original signal...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} BIM-based route map and {{workflows}} for documentation of <b>condition</b> <b>inspection</b> for architectural heritage, exemplified by an on-going conservation project of three Duty Rooms in Yangxin Hall {{complex in the}} Forbidden City, Beijing. Since intensive, multi-disciplinary inspection work for architectural heritage will result in huge amount and categories of data and information, the 2 D-based traditional way of documentation is abandoned, while HBIM was introduced for information management and presentation. In respond to multi-disciplinary collaboration, a duel-route workflow is specially developed for the combination of BIM and non-BIM teams, in which the BIM team is responsible for BIM models’ creation and maintenance, and for information management and presentation, while the non-BIM team carry out the survey and inspection in their own established way without any requirements for BIM skills, making a little adjustment where necessary, with interactive models as links between them. The practice following the workflows mentioned in this paper proves that <b>condition</b> <b>inspection</b> based <b>on</b> HBIM is applicable, compatible and flexible, providing the possibility to improve the traceability and sustainability of heritage information, and to generate visualized, thematic and integrated presentation in high efficiency and consistency.

Under the effect of tensile- tensile stress fatigue stress, fatigue crack originated from weld fusion line near the pipe body and developed along the weld. Porosity defect in the weld reduced its bearing capacity, and promoted the formation and development of the fatigue crack. Fatigue strength and fatigue life of the weld has great relationship with the size and distribution of porosity. The greater the porosity, the more close to surface, the decrease of fatigue life is more obvious...|$|R

All beams failed to achieve the anticipated ultimate load capacity based on current design theory and actual material properties.

As no previous research has focused on cutting force in ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM), this paper presents a theoretical and experimental study on cutting force modeling in UPRM of V-groove. An analytic cutting force model is established to predict the cutting force components both in the feed direction and thrust direction, and a dynamic model is developed to simulate the free vibration signal induced by the cutting force pulse. The effects of cutting parameters in UPRM are studied, including the depth of cut and feed rate, and a group of experiments conducted to verify the simulation results. The simulation and experimental results show that cutting force in UPRM is figured as a force pulse followed by a free vibration signal induced by the force pulse and that the amplitudes of cutting force in both feed direction and thrust direction increase with the growing depth of cut and feed rate.

During humid <b>conditions,</b> <b>inspection</b> of {{the underside of the}} leaf reveals gray-brown to purplish-black fungal growth. This downy material is the sporulation of the pathogen. Magnification of the sporulation reveals the acutely and dichotomously branched sporangiophores bearing lemon-shaped sporangia. Eventually, leaves will turn necrotic and curl upwards. The disease is sometimes called wildfire because of how rapidly it progresses, as if the crop were burned by fire. [...] Symptoms on watermelon and cantaloupe are different from on other cucurbits; leaf spots are typically not angular and turn brown to black in color. Often, an exaggerated upward leaf-curling will occur. Regardless of which cucurbit is involved, only the leaves are infected, not fruit, flowers, stems or roots. Disease of the leaves results in three major effects: 1. reduced yields, 2. a greater proportion of misshapen fruit, especially in cucumber, and 3. sunscalded fruit, due to increased exposure to direct sunlight, especially in watermelon and winter squash.|$|R
