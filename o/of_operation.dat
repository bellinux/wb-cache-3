5|$|By 1943, Soviet armaments {{production}} was fully operational and increasingly outproducing the German war economy. The final major German offensive in the Eastern {{theater of the}} Second World War took place during July—August 1943 with the launch <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Zitadelle, {{an assault on the}} Kursk salient. Approximately one million German troops confronted a Soviet force over 2.5 million strong. Following the defeat <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Zitadelle, the Soviets then launched counter-offensives employing six million men along a 1500 mile front towards the Dnepr River as they drove the Germans westwards. Employing increasingly ambitious and tactically sophisticated offensives, along with making operational improvements in secrecy and deception, the Red Army was eventually able to liberate much of the area which the Germans had previously occupied by the summer of 1944. The destruction of Army Group Centre, the outcome <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Bagration, proved to be a decisive success; additional Soviet offensives against the German Army Groups North and South in the fall of 1944 put the German war machine into retreat. By January 1945, Soviet military might was aimed at the German capital of Berlin. The war ended with the total defeat and capitulation of Nazi Germany in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its first two years <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly {{over a period of}} 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss in the first year <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
