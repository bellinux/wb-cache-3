The study is based on secondary empirical material and on field work done in the Babati district in Tanzania. The result is important for several reasons, in today’s identity-focused world, since it illustrates the need to recognize people's multiple identities, to be able to integrate to create a foundation of tolerance and respect between religions...|$|R
