60|$|Simple ideas, as {{has been}} shown, are only to be got by those {{impressions}} objects themselves make on our minds, by the proper inlets appointed to each sort. If they are not received this way, all {{the words in the}} world, made use of to explain or define any of their names, {{will never be able to}} produce in us the idea it stands for. For, words being sounds, can produce in us no other simple ideas than of those very sounds; nor excite any in us, but by that voluntary connexion which is known to be between them and those simple ideas which common use has made them the signs of. He that thinks otherwise, let him try if any words can give him the taste of a pine apple, and make him have the true idea of the relish of that celebrated delicious fruit. So far as he is told it has a resemblance with any tastes whereof he has the ideas already in his memory, imprinted there by sensible objects, not strangers to his palate, so far may he approach that resemblance in his mind. But this is not giving us that idea by a definition, but exciting in us other simple ideas by their known names; which will be still very different from the true taste of that fruit itself. In light and colours, and all other simple ideas, it is the same thing: for the signification of sounds is not natural, but only imposed and arbitrary. And no DEFINITION of light or redness is more fitted or able to produce either of those ideas in us, than the SOUND light or red, by itself. For, to hope to produce an idea of light or colour by a sound, however formed, is to expect that sounds should be visible, or colours audible; and to make the ears do the office of all the other senses. Which is all one as to say, that we might taste, smell, and see by the ears: a sort of philosophy worthy only of Sancho Panza, who had the faculty to see Dulcinea by hearsay. And therefore he that has not before received into his mind, by the proper inlet, the simple idea which any word stands for, can never come to know the signification of that word by any other words or sounds whatsoever, put together according to any rules of definition. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> applying to his senses the proper object; and so producing that idea in him, for which he has learned the name already. A studious blind man, who had mightily beat his head about visible objects, and made use of the explication of his books and friends, to understand those names of light and colours which often came in his way, bragged one day, That he now understood what SCARLET signified. Upon which, his friend demanding what scarlet was? The blind man answered, It was like the sound of a trumpet. Just such an understanding of the name of any other simple idea will he have, who hopes to get it only from a definition, or other words made use of to explain it.|$|E

50|$|After {{bringing}} up the legend of a former PCA student named Charles L. Galloway who fled to the wilderness above PCA {{at a place called}} Redstone Gulch because of an extremely hard test that drove him insane by Mr Harges, PCA's meanest and longest serving teacher that first taught when Charles went missing 50 years ago, Zoey and the gang decide to go and check it out for themselves. A boy named Leif agrees to take Zoey and the gang to the spot where Charles is supposed to have disappeared (the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> helicopter). It is later revealed the only reason why Leif agrees to take the gang is because he has a crush on Lola. Later in the episode Lola and Leif are seen making out. While they (Zoey and the gang) are there, they find an old PCA necklace. Using Quinn's special binoculars, they manage to read an inscription on the back. It {{turns out to be a}} necklace that belongs to Charles L. Galloway. Logan thinks that if they show people at PCA the necklace, they'll become PCA legends, but when the gang refuse to let Logan keep the necklace, he steals it and puts it in Zoey's backpack. As they head back to PCA, a violent thunderstorm hits, forming a mysterious green cloud which follows them. While running, Zoey falls and breaks her ankle, meaning Chase had to pick her up and carry her back to PCA. Once there, the pair meet with the rest of the gang who discuss what the green cloud was, finally agreeing it was a ghost, and when Chase takes Zoey to the nurse, Zoey begins to see paranormal things. The ghost attacks Chase, Zoey and Stacey Dilsen who are all in the infirmary, and locks the door trapping them, despite Michael's numerous attempts to get them out. Finally, they get out and are followed again as the ghost tries to roll Zoey on a gurney down outdoor stairs with a bucket stuck on her head (luckily she jumps off but the gurney hits Stacey), until Quinn makes two glowing orbs that will make the ghost go away. Trapped in the classroom, they were due to have the important test in the next day. Zoey and Quinn throw the orbs at the cloud, and it disappears but then reappears again. Logan finally admits to the gang who is angry and annoyed with him for stealing the necklace and almost getting them all killed. After taking the necklace back to RedStone Gulch, the ghost returns it's resting spot, and Zoey, Chase, Michael and Logan rush back for the important exam. When Mr Harges demands to know why his classroom is in such a mess, the gang have to own up, saying it was Charles's ghost. Harges however shouts that it was just a story and there is no such thing as ghosts. Charles Galloway then attacks the teacher, spinning him in circles, to which he cancels the exam. Zoey thanks Charles as he returns to his resting place.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- E-businesses {{are searching}} for ways to provide both cost {{effective}} and secure communication services. Internet, which is the primary medium for conducting e-business, is by its nature, an open, heterogeneous, non secure medium. Reports show that the ellipsis of trust in transaction security is the major reason why consumers are dubious to shop online and in expansion, unwilling to adopt an electronic payment framework {{in order to pay}} for the goods or the services bought electronically. This paper emphasizes the necessity of the factor of trust to achieve having as safe electronic business procedures as having when transacting through paper based ones. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> means of cryptography and particular of public key infrastructure (PKI) that functions as a chain of trust...|$|E
40|$|Today {{cryptography}} {{allows people}} to carry over the confidence found {{in the physical world}} to the electronic world, thus allowing people to do business electronically without worries of deceit and deception. Every day {{hundreds of thousands of people}} interact electronically, whether it is through e-mail, e-commerce (business conducted over the Internet), ATM machines, or cellular phones. The perpetual increase of information transmitted electronically has lead to an increased reliance on cryptography. In this paper of survey about DES, 3 DES and AES, DES uses 56 -bit key length nowhere DES algorithm can be cracked but the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> brute force technique, where it takes around 400 days to decrypt at a rate of 2 -billion keys per sec. 3 DES uses 112 -bits by brute force it takes 800 days to decrypt the message at the same rate. But when it come to AES it uses 256 -bit key length even the brute force fails because it takes 5 × 1021 days to decrypt at the same rate. So AES is the best-known encryption standard...|$|E

5000|$|One crucial {{problem had}} yet to be faced - the {{question}} of who should be president of the League. O’Brien, now at the pinnacle of national popularity, had created the League primarily to promote land purchase through vigorous agitation. This had <b>been</b> crippled earlier <b>by</b> Parnell in the National League. To avoid this in the future he saw the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> retaining control of the UIL through individuals who were agrarian agitators. A National Convention of the League was called and held in Dublin on 19 and 20 June 1900. It registered the triumph of the League as the national organisation with elaborate rules and a constitution drawn up <b>by</b> O’Brien. Redmond <b>was</b> elected chairman. [...] He himself had no doubt as to the future action to be taken. Redmond intended to capture O’Brien’s organisation and subordinate it to party Parliamentarian interests. He assumed the role of president in December. Within two years he and Dillon were to tactically adjunct the UIL under the wing of the IPP, manoeuvring it out of O'Brien's control.|$|R
