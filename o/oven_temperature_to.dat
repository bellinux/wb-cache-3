40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} a beef {{roasting}} model {{is used to}} analyze the behaviour of two significant parameters during roasting: process times and weight losses, as a function of <b>oven</b> <b>temperature.</b> The cooking model considers conductive heat transfer inside the sample and take into account both evaporative and dripping losses. The evaporative losses are considered at the surface of the meat. The dripping losses are predicted through the internal moisture content variation, which is modelled as a function of water demand. Such water demand is the difference between actual water content and the water holding capacity of beef. For model simulation six 3 D irregular geometrics models of semitendinosus muscle were used. In all cases constant <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> was considered, with operative limits of 150 and 230 °C. A restriction to the optimization problem was imposed: the coldest point must reach a minimum temperature of 72 °C. The model prediction indicates that an increase in <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> leads <b>to</b> a decrease in cooking time and an increase in weight loss. In average, rates of variation with <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> are - 0. 3 min/°C for cooking time, and 0. 21 %/°C for weight loss, which are similar to published experimental results.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1982 / Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaA {{microprocessor-based}} {{differential scanning calorimeter}} {{is being}} designed for eventual use in planetary soil water analysis. The uniqueness of this effort is {{in the use of}} the microprocessor as an integral section of the system control loops, instead of as merely an auxilary processor of output data. The use of differential scanning calorimetry is advantageous in determining water content of soil samples. The basic idea is to use two matched ovens, one with a soil sample included. The average <b>temperature</b> of the <b>ovens</b> is forced to track a desired programmed temperature (normally a slow ramp) with one control loop, while a second control loop forces the <b>oven</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>to</b> be equal, even during a transition. The power necessary <b>to</b> keep the <b>temperatures</b> equal is monitored, containing information as to the transition energy, and thus the water content at programmed water transition temperatures. This approach uses the microprocessor to close both of the loops, taking <b>oven</b> sensor <b>temperatures</b> as an input, and providing power duty cycles as outputs. In actuality, two microprocessors are used - a slave to accumulate and process sensor information, and a master to generate the loop control, output data control, and temperature program control. The PSWA performance is compared to a state-of-the-art commercial instrument using analog loop control. The major advantage of the microprocessor loop control utilized in the PSWA is the capability of remote operation, including remote alignment and adjustment. Further advantages include accommodation of oven changes with software reprogramming, a flexible single oven capability, correction for system nonlinearities using software, and auto gain and auto zero control for the sensor circuitry. The analog loop control approach has somewhat better sensitivity, resolution, and noise performance. The current phase of the development of the PSWA is a feasibility study and circuit design, performed for the Planetary Geology Program Office, NASA Headquarters. The next developmental phases would include breadboarding, software design, testing, and evaluation. In conclusion, this instrument is a significant advance in the state-of-the-art for automatic water measurements, and will be of great value in further planetary exploration...|$|R

40|$|Faculty adviser: Dr. PoeSupercritical fluid {{chromatography}} (SFC) {{is becoming}} a rapid alternative to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) because the lower viscosity and higher diffusivity of the mobile phase due to critical conditions enables faster separations {{and the ability to}} use smaller stationary phase particle sizes. However, radial temperature gradients that form from expansion of the mobile phase across the column reduce its efficiency. The net cooling coefficient of the mobile phase at the column outlet is a major factor controlling that temperature drop. The experimental correlation between the net cooling coefficient and efficiency loss was examined by performing two series of experiments: one where the <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> was held constant at 50. 0 °C and the column outlet pressure was varied to yield nominal net cooling coefficients ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 25 K/bar and another where the column outlet pressure was held constant at 148 bar and the <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> was varied <b>to</b> yield the same range of nominal net cooling coefficients. Plate height curves of both sets of experiments were produced to examine column efficiency.

The upper phase containing the FAs was carefully collected and analyzed via GC–MS (7890 A/ 5975 C, Agilent, USA) using a DB- 5  ms chromatographic column (50  m ×  250  μm ×  0.25  μm). The <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> was set <b>to</b> 80  °C, then raised to 300  °C at a rate 10  °C/min, and held at 300  °C for 5  min; the injector <b>temperature</b> was set <b>to</b> 300  °C. The helium carrier gas was supplied at a flow rate of 1  mL min− 1. All the analyses were carried out in triplicate and the reported values correspond to their averages.|$|R
40|$|Calibration loss of ovens used in {{sintering}} {{metal ceramic}} prostheses leads to stress and 18 {{cracks in the}} material of the prostheses fabricated, and ultimately to failure of the dental treatment. 19 Periodic calibration may {{not be sufficient to}} prevent such consequences. Evaluation methods based 20 on firing supplemental control samples are subjective, time consuming, and rely entirely on the 21 technician’s skills. The aim {{of this study was to}} propose an alternative procedure for such 22 evaluations. Fifty prostheses were sintered in a ceramic <b>oven</b> at a <b>temperature</b> lower, equal or 23 larger than the temperature prescribed by the manufacturer. A non-destructive imaging method, 24 swept source (SS) optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to evaluate comparatively the 25 internal structure of prostheses so fabricated. A quantitative assessment procedure is proposed, 26 based on en-face OCT images acquired at similar depths inside the samples. Differences in 27 granulation and reflectivity depending on the <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> are used <b>to</b> establish 28 rules-of-thumb on judging the correct calibration of the oven. OCT evaluations, made on a regular 29 basis allow an easy and objective monitoring of correct settings in the sintering process. This 30 method can serve rapid identificatio...|$|R
40|$|Vapor jets of DNA and RNA bases (adenine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil) from an oven with a {{capillary}} exit {{have been studied}} in the intermediate regime between molecular and viscous flow corresponding to Knudsen numbers in the range 0. 1 < Kn < 10. The temperature control method ensured stationary flow. Assuming the Knudsen hypothesis, the pressure of sublimated molecules in the oven was determined {{as a function of}} temperature and the transmission probability of the capillary (Clausing factor). Thus it was possible <b>to</b> relate the <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure <b>to</b> the total flux through the capillary, determined by measuring the total mass of DNA / RNA base molecules condensed on a cold surface intersecting the jet. The angular distribution of molecules in the jet has been also studied experimentally using an optical interference method. The measured profiles are in good agreement with Troïtskii’s [Sov. Phys. JETP 7 (1962) 353] analytical law for (cosθ) 3 / 2 angular dependence in the intermediate regime with error functions associated with the mean free path between intermolecular collisions...|$|R

Increasing endpoint and decreasing <b>oven</b> <b>temperatures</b> influenced turkey meat {{as shown by}} increased fiber shrinkage, increased ultrastructure disintegration, and decreased clumping on the fiber surface.
