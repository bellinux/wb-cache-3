5|$|A mentally {{unbalanced}} Ricky Williams (David Baxt) {{is driven}} to re-enter the caves when {{a sample of}} crystals pulsates and the chemical intelligence exerts its influence through a mark <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> Thrown into a grille in a compromised environmental suit, Gail (Rosalind Lloyd) removes her helmet and freezes {{to death in the}} toxic atmosphere while trying to amputate her trapped foot with a chainsaw.

Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru {{if he were a}} girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he drew his forehead protector <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> in order to not obscure his hair.|$|E

That night, Bart, after experimentations involving the family pets, {{steps into the}} teleporter with a fly <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> thinking that he will become a mutant superhero.

5|$|In a December 23, 2008 {{game against}} the Phoenix Coyotes, Paul {{suffered}} a fractured forearm after being struck by a shot from Phoenix's Olli Jokinen in the last regulation minute of the game. He successfully underwent surgery <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> and missed 24 games, but also his chance {{to play in the}} 2009 All-Star Game in Montreal.

He was injured again later in the season when he broke his foot while blocking a shot during a March 17, 2009 {{game against the}} Minnesota Wild, putting him out of play {{for the rest of the}} season. He scored 36 points in just 45 games that year.|$|E
5|$|A tattoo <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and {{the rope}} still {{around his neck}} shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline lands <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.|$|E

5|$|Monster's Ball II {{was held}} at Bound for Glory. Rhino, Abyss, Sabu, and Jeff Hardy all participated in the match. James Mitchell {{accompanied}} Abyss to the ring. In a Monster's Ball match, pinfalls and submissions count anywhere. There are no disqualifications or count-outs and weapons are supplied and welcomed. It is called Monster's Ball because in the storyline each wrestler has supposedly been locked {{in a dark room}} for the preceding 24 hours without food or water. In the very beginning, Sabu started bleeding from his right eye, while Hardy had blood coming out of a cut <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> Midway through the bout, Rhino also started to bleed. Hardy laid Abyss on a table and then ascended {{to the top of the}} Bound for Glory set. He then jumped off in a somersault and landed on Abyss. Eventually both Abyss and Hardy recovered, leading to Rhino tackling Abyss through a table with his signature Gore maneuver. Afterwards, Rhino drove Hardy's head into the mat with his signature Rhino Driver maneuver from the second ring rope and followed with a pin to win the match at 12 minutes and 20 seconds. After this match, Larry Zbyszko announced that a Ten-Man Gauntlet match would be held later in the show to determine who would face Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

At first, Petrelis balked; earning his living as a temporary office worker, he had neither insurance nor money to pay a dermatologist. Urged by the referring physician, he relented.|$|E
25|$|Under the Invisibility Cloak, Harry, Ron, and Hermione follow Draco to Borgin and Burkes, a dark magic shop in Knockturn Alley. Draco threatens Mr. Borgin about {{repairing}} {{one item}} and keeping another safe for him. Draco shows Mr. Borgin something <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> that Harry believes {{to be the}} Dark Mark, Voldemort's sign, though whether or not Harry is correct is never confirmed. (In the film version Draco Malfoy shows Dumbledore the Dark Mark <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.)</b> On the Hogwarts Express, Harry invisibly spies on Draco and overhears him discussing Voldemort's task with several other Slytherins. Draco knows Harry is present and, once alone in the compartment, immobilises him and breaks his nose causing Harry to hate Draco even more. Harry is left stranded on the train until Nymphadora Tonks (Luna Lovegood in the film adaptation) rescues him. Harry spends {{much of the year}} trailing Draco's whereabouts on his Marauder's Map, but loses track of him once Draco enters the Room of Requirement.
