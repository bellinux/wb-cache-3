5|$|A {{whole week}} passed before Grace reappeared, again at Lord's, on Monday, 3 June. He played seven matches in June, all first-class, {{starting}} with MCC v Derbyshire. This was a three-day match completed on the Tuesday with MCC winning by 5 wickets. Derbyshire won the toss, elected to bat and Grace proceeded to bowl them <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mere 36. His figures were 8–23. Derbyshire then bowled MCC out for 74, Grace scoring 7. Grace took 2 more wickets in Derbyshire's second innings of 118 {{to give him}} his second 10-wicket match of the season. He scored 37 in the second innings as MCC made 81–5 to take the match.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} to Australia, Macartney {{continued}} to play club cricket and turned <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> final first-class summer. At {{the start of the}} 1926–27 season, he captained a combined Sydney City team against a New South Wales country team, which included the then 18-year-old Bradman. Macartney scored 126 and Bradman 98 in a match viewed as a generational transition in Australian batting. He scored 114 in his opening first-class match of the season, and took wickets in each of his four matches. Macartney totalled 243 runs at 40.50 and took 11 wickets at 17.82.|$|E
5|$|Alison {{remembers a}} time when Bruce took her and her {{brothers}} to New York City and stayed in a borrowed Greenwich Village apartment. After a long day, Small Alison, Christian and John settle into sleeping bags. Small Alison wakes up and catches Bruce sneaking out. Bruce sings a lullaby ("Pony Girl"). He reassures his daughter that he's just going <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> paper, but he leaves to go cruising. Medium Alison is angered by a noncommittal letter from Bruce, responding to her coming out. At a luncheonette with her father, Small Alison notices a butch delivery woman and feels an inexplicable kinship with her ("Ring of Keys").|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} entered its closing stages, the referee allotted {{a minimum of}} threeminutes of injury time. The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, {{allowing}} Iniesta to steal in and play the ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidić to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock the ball <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> corner. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro Rodríguez on for Iniesta in the secondminute of added time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash of heads with Messi when going for a header. That {{was to be the}} final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> goal kick.|$|E
5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels {{bid for the}} right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he {{wanted to be able to}} put the album <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate.|$|E
5|$|Davies and Caldwell {{began the}} 2012–13 season as first choice until an ankle injury {{sustained}} by Davies during a League Cup match at Coventry City gave Pablo an early opportunity to impress. He kept his place after Davies returned to fitness, but chipped a {{bone in his}} foot in the defeat to Barnsley and {{was expected to be}} <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month. Further injuries, the return to fitness of Caldwell, and the emergence of young left-back Mitch Hancox, which allowed Paul Robinson to partner Davies in the centre, meant that Pablo played only twice more, and he was released {{at the end of his}} contract.|$|E

Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they go <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people {{were meant to be}} together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E
5|$|Ford was a keen cricketer from {{an early}} age and would often turn <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> team {{representing}} Aston Villa against local sides. In 1955, he turned out for Glamorgan Cricket Club in a charity benefit match for Allan Watkins against Abergavenny Cricket Club, playing alongside players such as Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Pressdee and Harold Gimblett. His Wales international teammates Billy Lucas and Alf Sherwood were also due to play in the match.|$|E
5|$|Fossett {{took off}} with enough fuel for four to five hours of flight, {{according}} to spokesperson Major Cynthia S. Ryan, Public Information Officer with the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). Searchers with CAP were told that Fossett had gone <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short flight over favorite territory, possibly including the areas of Lucky Boy Pass and Walker Lake. At one point {{it was suggested that}} he might have been out scouting for potential sites to conduct a planned land speed run.|$|E

50|$|An inside {{straight}} draw, or gutshot draw or belly buster draw, is a {{hand with}} {{four of the}} five cards needed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> straight, but missing one in the middle. For example, 9-x-7-6-5. An inside straight draw has four outs (four cards to fill the missing internal rank). Because straight draws including an ace only have four outs, they are also considered inside straight draws. For example, A-K-Q-J-x or A-2-3-4-x. The probability of catching <b>an</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> inside straight draw is half that of catching <b>an</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> outside straight draw.|$|R
