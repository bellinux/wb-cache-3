5|$|The {{four types}} <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are {{homologous}} with and derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The {{development of these}} parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the ABC model <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> development. Each of the four types <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by {{a small number of}} genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the flowering plants themselves.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles a particular kind <b>of</b> <b>flower,</b> such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard {{is hard to see}} in long grass.|$|E
40|$|In the {{development}} of new crops such as Dimorphoteca pluvialis (L.) Moench, improvement <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> synchronisation is an important breeding objective. The <b>flowering</b> <b>of</b> single plants of Dimorphotheca pluvialis could be described by a logistic curve obtained by the regression of cumulative number <b>of</b> open <b>flowers</b> on time. The curve is characterised by three parameters, corresponding with the total number <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> produced by the plant, the rate <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> development and the day at which peak bloom is reached. From these parameters two other characteristics were derived, i. e., onset <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> and duration <b>of</b> <b>flowering.</b> The use <b>of</b> the <b>flowering</b> model for selection for improved flowering synchronisation is discussed. Heritabilities <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> traits were estimated using parent-offspring regression and variance components analyses. Onset <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> and date <b>of</b> peak bloom showed high (> 0. 69), and total number <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> moderate to high (0. 30 – 0. 90) heritability values, indicating that for these traits considerable progress may be expected from mass selection, particularly in the early selection generations. Duration <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> showed low to moderate values (0. 25 – 0. 45), and methods other than mass selection (e. g. family selection) should be considered. Determination of phenotypic and genetic correlations revealed only an additive genetic correlation between date of peak bloom and duration <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> (rA = 0. 80 and 0. 69 for 1993 and 1994, respectively), suggesting the possibility of indirect selection for curtailed duration <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> by means <b>of</b> selection against late date of peak bloom. Duration <b>of</b> <b>flowering,</b> total number <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> and onset <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> were not correlated. [KEYWORDS: Dimorphotheca pluvialis; flowering; heritability...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the show}} faced {{criticism}} from viewers for not intervening when a meerkat was injured and faced death, as a whole, Meerkat Manor enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet's top series in October 2007, {{both on the}} cable channel and through its video-on-demand service. The show's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and allowed viewers a long term, intimate look {{into the lives of}} its meerkat stars, breaking the traditional wall between viewer and subject found with most documentaries. In 2007, Meerkat Manor was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards. It has won three awards at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Galas.

5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> indicated, some preferring Crocus.

5|$|Outside Australia it {{has become}} naturalised in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia and New Zealand. It is present in California as a garden escapee, but is not {{considered}} to be naturalised there. In South Africa, where it had been introduced between 1858 and 1865 for dune stabilization and tannin production, it had spread along waterways into forest, mountain and lowland fynbos, and borderline areas between fynbos and karoo. The gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster signiventris has been introduced in South Africa for biological control and has reduced the capacity of trees to reproduce throughout their range. The eggs are laid by adult wasps into buds <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> heads in the summer, before hatching in May and June when the larvae induce the formation of the grape-like galls and prevent flower development. The galls can be so heavy that branches break under their weight. In addition, the introduction in 2001 of the acacia seed weevil Melanterius compactus has also proved effective.|$|E
5|$|The final {{project for}} his great patron Eusebi Güell was {{the church for}} the Colònia Güell, an {{industrial}} village in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (1890–1918).

Unfortunately only the crypt (known today as Crypt of the Colònia Güell) was built, as Güell's sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaudí designed an oval church with five aisles, one central aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. A porch of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults precedes the crypt, the first time that Gaudí used this structure and notably the first use of paraboloid vaults in the history of architecture.

However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of A.barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A.obovatus. The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb, which is rounded in A.obovatus and pointed in A.barbiger; the bracts, glabrous versus hirsute; and the style-ends, which are green and scarlet respectively. The species also differ slightly in range <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> colours: A.barbiger has scarlet to bright red flowers, whereas A.obovatus flowers are scarlet to orange.|$|E
