It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation <b>of</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls.

5|$|Nagore dargah is {{a common}} place of worship for devotees of various {{religious}} faiths. According to {{the administration of the}} dargah, about 50–75 per cent of pilgrims visiting the dargah everyday are Hindus. The practise of offering flowers, sweetmeats and food, the way of conducting worship, and playing musical instruments like nadaswaram (a type <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> instrument commonly used in Tamil Nadu) are atypical of Hindu tradition. Other worship practises include offering flags and lighting lamps of ghee at the saint's tomb. Devotees shave their heads near the tank and offer tin or silver-plated facsimiles of body parts, houses, sailboats matching their material needs.|$|E

Calculating axial deformation <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> {{is the key}} to successful operating of exploiting gas. In this paper, aiming for calculating axial deformation <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> in curved gas wells, we developed a series of basic tubing forces models, which are valuable in calculating axial deformation <b>of</b> <b>pipes.</b> Based on these models, a algorithm for calculating axial deformation is designed.

The racetracks required 85,000 vacuum tubes. Where possible, off-the-shelf components were used, but all too many components of the calutrons were unique.

5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had been turned over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E
5|$|The {{influences}} between Scotland and Donegal went {{both ways}} and were furthered {{by a wave}} of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as {{can be heard in}} the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.|$|E

To evaluate these metrics, energy supplied to each pipe is categorized into delivered and required energy, leakage, friction and surplus energy and then compared to each other. The results of the pipe-level energy assessment of the two systems imply that the energy performance <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> can vary considerably across a distribution system. Also, the proximity <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> to major components (e. g., pumps and tanks) and pipe flow rates can have a large impact on the energy efficiency <b>of</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In the {{application}} of guided waves NDT, the selection of exciting frequency is not only related with the setup of sensor, {{but also with the}} characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pipe’s</b> structure and material. In this paper, the characteristic of guided waves propagation in pipes that L(0, 1) and L(0, 2) have a cutoff frequency are respectively discussed, and the calculation formulas of their cutoff frequency are given. The varied relationship between the cutoff frequency of L(0, 1) and L(0, 2) mode guide waves, the outer diameter and wall thickness <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> are discussed, respectively. For a given steel pipe, experiments are carried out by selection of different exciting frequency. The results show that the “low-pass ” type cutoff frequency of L(0, 1) and “high-pass ” type cutoff frequency of L(0, 2) are reduced with increasing of outer diameter <b>of</b> <b>pipes,</b> and the “low-pass ” type cutoff frequency of L(0, 1) and “high-pass ” type cutoff frequency of L(0, 2) are initially increased with increasing of wall thickness <b>of</b> <b>pipes,</b> but the increased amplitude is slowly changed a little. When the outer diameter <b>of</b> <b>pipes</b> is more than 351 mm, both of the cutoff frequencies are not changed with varied of wall thickness <b>of</b> <b>pipes.</b> The experimental results are well agreed with theoretical computation of selected exciting frequency for pipes guided waves NDT...|$|R
