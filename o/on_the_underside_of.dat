5|$|The abdomen is {{long and}} slender and {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis. The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
5|$|The adult California condor is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the wings. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> its flight feathers.|$|E

5|$|Like other boletes, Boletus pinophilus has small pores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> its cap {{rather than}} gills. These are {{coloured}} white at first, becoming yellow {{with age and}} olivaceous-brown at full maturity. The spores are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil drops and dimensions 15.520 by 4.55.5µm. They produce an olive-brown spore print.|$|E
5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have been}} smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon also may have had large scutes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> its tail and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E
5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of beaked whale. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, {{but they all}} share a similar hunting style. They use a suction technique, aided {{by a pair of}} grooves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> their head, not unlike the throat pleats on the rorquals, to feed.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E

5|$|On fertile fronds, from 1 to 15 {{elliptical}} or narrow sori can {{be found}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> each pinna. They are 0.5 to 1.5millimeters long, covered by translucent, pale tan indusia with somewhat jagged edges. Each sporangium holds 64 spores. The species has a chromosome number of 2n = 72 in the sporophyte; it is a diploid.|$|E
5|$|Scales in {{the central}} or throat region, which are {{in contact with the}} first ventral scales of a snake's body and are flanked by the chin shields, are called gular scales. The mental groove is a {{longitudinal}} groove <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head between the large, paired chin shields and continuing between the smaller gular scales.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii (formerly Boletus frostii), {{commonly}} known as Frost's bolete or the apple bolete, is a bolete fungus first described scientifically in 1874. A {{member of the family}} Boletaceae, the mushrooms produced by the fungus have tubes and pores instead of gills <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> their caps. Exsudoporus frostii is distributed in the eastern United States from Maine to Georgia, and in the southwest from Arizona extending south to Mexico and Costa Rica. A mycorrhizal species, its fruit bodies are typically found growing near hardwood trees, especially oak.|$|E

5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, which is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods {{are thought to have}} fed.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Sclerodermatineae have {{fruit body}} shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies {{sometimes}} have hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with flaky particles), and lack the reticulation (a net-like pattern of interlacing lines) characteristic of {{some members of}} the Boletaceae. The pores are merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The flesh is usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface.|$|E
5|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} basal fish with {{numerous}} primitive anatomical features {{similar to those}} of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.|$|E

5|$|The Castillonais or Cheval Ariègeois de Castillon, {{once called}} the cheval du Biros or Saint-Gironnais, {{is an ancient}} breed of small riding horse from the Ariège département of southwestern France. The breed's {{phenotype}} is currently in flux, but overall it resembles (and is sometimes confused with) the more common Merens horse. Members of the breed are either dark bay or black, and all have pangare color modification, which results in paler color around the eyes and muzzle and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the body. Today it is used principally for pleasure riding (including equine tourism) and driving.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The Laserex P90 laser {{systems have}} a weight of 131 g (0.29lb), {{and they are}} {{activated}} {{by means of a}} green pressure switch located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the weapon's pistol grip. The lasers can be configured for three different internal settings: Off– disabled to prevent accidental activation, Training– low intensity for eye safety and extended battery life in training, or Combat– high intensity for maximum visibility. The Laserex P90 laser systems have a battery life of 250 hours when used on the Training setting, or a life of 50 hours when used on the Combat setting.|$|E
50|$|The female {{blackfly}} lays {{batches of}} {{eggs in a}} spiral pattern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> leaves. <b>The</b> eggs are golden-brown, but darken before hatching, which happens in seven to 10 days.|$|R
50|$|The {{red palm}} mite forms colonies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> leaves. There, they feed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{contents}} of {{the cells of the}} leaves. This feeding can cause localized yellowing of the leaves.|$|R
