The next day, Crane believes Katrina {{to be the one who}} controls the Headless Horsemen.|$|E

5|$|By then, {{violence}} {{had broken}} <b>out</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two sides; {{less than three}} months after it had been agreed, John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted. The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future Louis VIII, for help, offering him the English throne. The war soon settled into a stalemate. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry III as his heir.|$|E
5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes.

5|$|During the Civil War, the Union and Russia were allies {{against what}} they saw as their {{potential}} enemy, Britain. The Russian blue-water navy was stationed in San Francisco and from 1863 in New York—with sealed orders to attack British naval targets in case war broke <b>out</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> United States and Britain. This was threatened if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|Fighting broke <b>out</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{remnants}} of the East Timorese security forces and the rebels and gangs in late May. On 23 May Reinado's rebel group opened fire on F-FDTL and PNTL personnel in the Fatu Ahi area. On 24 May F-FDTL personnel near the Force's headquarters were attacked {{by a group of}} rebel police officers, petitioners and armed civilians. The attack was defeated when one of the F-FDTL naval component's patrol boats fired on the attackers. During the crisis the relationship between the F-FDTL and PNTL had deteriorated further, and on 25 May members of the F-FDTL attacked the PNTL's headquarters, killing nine unarmed police officers.|$|E
5|$|In 1294 the French king {{declared}} the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and war broke <b>out</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two countries. Edward I {{embarked on a}} wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on the Continent, and preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not {{in the company of}} the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.|$|E

5|$|In 1642 {{civil war}} broke <b>out</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{supporters}} of King Charles I {{and those of}} Parliament. Gravesend was controlled by Parliament, who placed it {{under the command of}} a military governor who oversaw both this fort and Tilbury, and was used to control traffic entering London and to search for spies. Charles II regained the throne in 1660 and was petitioned by several royalists who claimed that they should be restored to the command of the blockhouse; William Leonard was ultimately successful. The defences were repaired and may have been occasionally used by the King as a banqueting hall.|$|E

5|$|Later in the century, {{a series}} of civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses broke <b>out</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rival factions of the House of Lancaster and York. After the Battle of Northampton in 1460, Harlech formed a refuge for Queen Margaret of Anjou, and between 1461–68 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, {{under the command of}} Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV. Thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea, Harlech held out and {{eventually}} became the last major stronghold still under Lancasterian control. It finally fell after a month's siege, the events credited with inspiring the song Men of Harlech.|$|E

At the Battle of Mutina Mark Antony was defeated by the consuls Hirtius and Pansa, who were both killed.|$|E
5|$|Revolts also {{occurred}} across {{the rest of}} England, particularly in the cities of the north, traditionally centres of political unrest. In the town of Beverley, violence broke <b>out</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> richer mercantile elite and the poorer townspeople during May. By {{the end of the}} month the rebels had taken power and replaced the former town administration with their own. The rebels attempted to enlist the support of Alexander Neville, the Archbishop of York, and in June forced the former town government to agree to arbitration through Neville. Peace was restored in June 1382 but tensions continued to simmer for many years.|$|E

5|$|Sandown Castle did {{not play}} a {{prominent}} role during the first English Civil War that broke <b>out</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> supporters of King Charles I and Parliament; it was taken by Parliamentary forces {{at the start of}} the conflict in 1642. Following the few years of unsteady peace after 1645, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Sandown and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent.|$|E
5|$|The clash {{began after}} rebel Serbs seized the town's {{police station and}} {{municipal}} building and harassed Croatian government officials.

Despite an attempted intervention by the Yugoslav National Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA), the Croatian government reasserted its control over the town. After a standoff with the JNA, an agreement {{to pull out the}} special police and the JNA was reached, restoring the town to conditions before the Serb attempt to seize control of the police there.|$|E
