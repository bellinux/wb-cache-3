5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee,</b> Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft {{to say that the}} bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E

The meeting was controversial {{because it did not}} include representatives from groups calling for single-payer health care.|$|E
25|$|The {{next year}} Doolittle {{decided to run}} for the state senate, with {{encouragement}} from Richardson and other Republicans. Riding on the coattails of Governor Ronald Reagan's victory in the presidential race, in 1980 the 29-year-old Doolittle narrowly defeated incumbent Democrat Albert S.

25|$|At {{the next}} meeting {{on health care}} reform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee,</b> Baucus had five more doctors and nurses removed and arrested. Baucus {{admitted}} a few weeks later in June 2009 that {{it was a mistake to}} rule out a single payer plan because doing so alienated a large, vocal constituency and left President Barack Obama’s proposal of a public health plan to compete with private insurers as the most liberal position.|$|E

25|$|To {{facilitate}} {{reduction of}} the tariffs, Wilson garnered unexpected support from a previous rival Oscar Underwood, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Furnifold M. Simmons, Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee.</b> In May 1913, the Underwood Tariff passed in the House {{by a vote of}} 274 to 5; it would take a bit longer passing in the Senate—in September—and was signed by Wilson three weeks later. Its effects were soon overwhelmed by the changes in trade caused by World War I. Wilson mobilized public opinion behind the tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists in an address to Congress, and by staging an elaborate signing ceremony. The revenue lost by the lower tariff was replaced by a new federal income tax, authorized by the 16th Amendment.|$|E
25|$|In {{his inaugural}} address, Polk called upon Congress to re-establish the Independent Treasury System under which {{government}} funds {{were held in}} the Treasury and not in banks or other financial institutions. President Van Buren had previously established a similar system, {{but it had been}} abolished during the Tyler administration. After personally winning the support of Senator Dixon Lewis, the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee,</b> Polk was able to push the Independent Treasury Act through Congress, signing it into law on August 6, 1846. The act provided that the public revenues were to be retained in the Treasury building and in sub-treasuries in various cities, separate from private or state banks, to receive all government funds. The system would remain in place until the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.|$|E

500|$|In 1864, {{with the}} metal nickel, {{used in the}} cent in short supply, Mint Director James Pollock asked that year's {{commission}} to opine on {{a substitute for the}} copper-nickel used in the cent. [...] The members endorsed French bronze (95% copper and 5% tin or zinc) as a metal {{to be used in the}} cent and a proposed two-cent piece.

[...] On his {{first day on the}} job, he was greeted with a bouquet of flowers and a large pile of mail from office-seekers. [...] He gave receipts for the Mint property he was now responsible for, and found no errors in the accounts of his predecessor. On December 16, 1889, with the Senate in session, Harrison nominated Bosbyshell. The following day, Vermont Senator Justin Morrill, on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee,</b> to which Bosbyshell's nomination had been referred, recommended that he be confirmed.

500|$|Republican {{leaders had}} heard that Borah was an {{attorney}} for corporations, who had prosecuted labor leaders; they believed him sympathetic to their Old Guard positions and assigned him to important committees. [...] In fact, Borah believed in the rights of unions, {{so long as they}} did not commit violent acts. When Borah staked out progressive positions after his swearing-in, Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich, the powerful chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee,</b> hoped to put pressure on him through the Westerner's corporate clients, only to find that he had given up those representations before coming to Washington. Borah became {{one of a growing number}} of progressive Republicans in the Senate. Yet, Borah often opposed liberal legislation, finding fault with it or fearing it would increase the power of the federal government. Throughout his years in the Senate, in which he would serve until his death in 1940, his idiosyncratic positions would limit his effectiveness as a reformer.|$|E
500|$|On March2, 1864, Pollock wrote {{urgently}} to Chase, warning {{him that}} the Mint {{was running out of}} nickel and that demand for cents was at an all-time high. [...] He also informed the Secretary that the United States Assay Commission, composed of citizens and officials who had met the previous month to test the nation's silver and gold coinage, had recommended the use of French bronze (95% copper with the remainder tin and zinc) as a coinage metal for the cent and a new two-cent piece. Three days later, Chase sent Pollock's December letter and draft legislation for bronze one- and two-cent pieces to Maine Senator WilliamP. Fessenden, chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee.</b> [...] Fessenden took no immediate action, and on March 16, Pollock wrote again to Chase, warning that the Mint was {{going to run out of}} nickel, much of which was imported. Chase forwarded his letter to Fessenden. [...] Legislation was finally introduced by New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark on March22; Pollock's letters were read and apparently influenced proceedings as the Senate passed the bill without debate.|$|E
500|$|Concerned about likely Whig {{opposition}} to the coinage bill, McKay got his fellow Democrat, New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton, to introduce the bill in the Senate on February 1, 1849—Atherton was chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee.</b> [...] McKay introduced {{a version of the}} bill into the House on February 20; debate began the same day. The dollar was attacked on ground it would be too small; the double eagle on the claim that it would be heavily abraded in circulation, and would become lightweight. [...] McKay did not respond substantively, but stated that if no one wanted these denominations, they would be unasked-for at the Mint, and would not be coined. Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Ingersoll, a Whig, spoke against the bill, noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations. [...] Ingersoll stated that a twenty-dollar piece would be [...] "doubled into a ponderous and unparalleled size". Nevertheless, the bill providing for the issuance of the gold dollar and double eagle passed both houses by large margins, and was signed into law by President James K. Polk on March 3, 1849. According to numismatist David Lange, [...] "the double eagle was a banker's coin intended to simplify transfers of large sums between financial institutions and between nations".|$|E

500|$|McKay got {{his fellow}} Democrat, New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton, to {{introduce}} the bill to authorize the gold dollar and the double eagle in the Senate on February 1, 1849—Atherton was chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee.</b> [...] McKay introduced a version into the House on February 20; debate began the same day. The dollar was attacked by congressmen from the Whig Party, then in the minority, {{on the grounds that}} it would be too small, would be counterfeited and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a half dime, the coins being similar in size. [...] McKay did not respond substantively, but stated that if no one wanted these denominations, they would not be called for at the Mint, and would not be coined. Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Ingersoll, a Whig, spoke against the bill, noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations, and that the idea had been repeatedly turned down, whenever considered. Another Whig, Massachusetts's Charles Hudson, related that Patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference. McKay made no answer to these claims, but others did, including New York Congressman Henry Nicoll, who assured the House that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated. [...] The point was, he indicated, that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public, and, in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where banknotes were not accepted. Connecticut Representative John A. Rockwell, a Whig, tried to table the bill, but his motion was defeated. [...] The bill passed easily, and met only minimal opposition in the Senate, becoming law on March 3, 1849.|$|E
500|$|When Congress {{returned}} to Washington in December 1861, Sherman and the Finance Committee continued {{their attempts to}} fix the deepening financial crisis caused by the war. The financial situation had continued to worsen, resulting that month in banks suspending specie payments—that is, they refused to redeem their banknotes for gold. Gold began to disappear from circulation. With the 500,000 soldiers in the field, the government was spending the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million per day. Sherman understood that [...] "a radical change in existing laws relating to our currency must be made, or...the destruction of the Union would be unavoidable..." [...] Secretary Chase agreed and proposed that the Treasury Department issue United States Notes that were redeemable not in specie but in 6% government bonds. The bills would be [...] "lawful money and a legal tender in the payment of all debts". Nothing but gold and silver coin had ever been legal tender in the United States, but Congress yielded to the wartime necessities, and the resulting First Legal Tender Act passed both the House and the Senate. The Act limited the notes (later known as [...] "greenbacks") to $150 million, but two subsequent Legal Tender Acts that year expanded the limit to $450 million. The idea of making paper money legal tender was controversial, and William Pitt Fessenden of Maine, chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee,</b> was among many who opposed the proposal. Sherman disagreed and spoke {{in favor of the}} idea. He defended his position as necessary in his memoirs, saying [...] "from the passage of the legal tender act, by which means were provided for utilizing the wealth of the country in the suppression of the rebellion, the tide of war turned in our favor".|$|E

Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that [...] "there is no health care crisis in this country." ...|$|E
