5|$|Ctenophores form {{an animal}} phylum {{that is more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all <b>other</b> <b>animals).</b> Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.|$|E
5|$|Four orthopoxviruses cause {{infection}} in humans: variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox.

5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats and <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> pollinate flowers and humans and <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E

5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b> Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E

5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum {{that are more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b> However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey.

5|$|Like many mammals, {{elephants}} can {{contract and}} transmit diseases to humans, {{one of which}} is tuberculosis. , tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US, and because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos. In 2012, two elephants in Tete d'Or zoo, Lyon were diagnosed with the disease. Due to the threat of transmitting tuberculosis to <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> or visitors to the zoo, their euthanasia was initially ordered by city authorities but a court later overturned this decision. At an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee, a 54-year-old African elephant was considered to be the source of tuberculosis infections among eight workers.|$|E
