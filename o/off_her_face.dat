However, the movie correctly portrays the spherical nature of drops of liquid in a micro-gravity environment.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut <b>off,</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{featured}} {{the deaths of}} several recurring characters in the series. Faye Marsay, who portrayed the Waif, spoke about her participation in the episode, and leaving Game of Thrones after several seasons, saying [...] "As much as I'm sad that I'm now off of the show, I think that storyline needed to be concluded that way. I'm rooting for Arya and Maisie as well. Even though I won't be able {{to hang out with}} everyone again, I think it was done right and done properly. I think Arya deserved to rip <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and stick it on a wall." [...] Recurring guest actors Clive Russell as Blackfish, and Essie Davis as Lady Crane portrayed their characters for the last time in the series, as they were killed off on screen.|$|E

60|$|Then, {{unfolding}} {{the last}} {{writing of the}} poor fellow whom the Indians had styled Weeum the Good, I slowly translated it into the Indian language.

2500|$|In January 1995, Jesperson {{agreed to}} give a young woman, Angela Surbrize, a lift from Spokane, Washington, to Indiana. Approximately a week into the trip, Surbrize became {{impatient}} and began to nag Jesperson to hurry up, as {{she wanted to see}} her boyfriend. In response, Jesperson raped and strangled her. He then strapped her to the undercarriage of his truck and dragged her, face down, [...] "to grind <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and prints." [...] Her body was not found for several monthsand then only after Jesperson gave details to police. Two months after murdering Surbrize, Jesperson decided that his long-time girlfriend, Julie Ann Winningham, was interested in him only for money. On 10 March 1995, in Washougal, Washington, Jesperson strangled her. She was the only victim he had a link to, which ultimately set police on his trail.|$|E
2500|$|The President {{was rushed}} to Dallas' Parkland Hospital. At her request, the First Lady was allowed {{to be present in}} the {{operating}} room. After her husband was pronounced dead, Kennedy refused to remove her blood-stained clothing and reportedly regretted having washed the blood <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and hands, explaining to Lady Bird Johnson that she wanted [...] "them to see what they have done to Jack". She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she boarded Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as President. The unlaundered suit was donated to the National Archives and Records Administration in 1964, and under the terms of an agreement with her daughter Caroline Kennedy, will not be placed on public display until 2103. Johnson's biographer Robert Caro wrote that Johnson wanted Jacqueline to be present at his swearing-in in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of his presidency to JFK loyalists and to the world at large.|$|E

6000|$|Sniffs were audible {{all through}} {{the latter part of}} this scene; and when the curtain fell, people were so busy wiping their eyes that for a moment they forgot to applaud.

60|$|At last {{this state}} of affairs began to tell upon his constitution, which, strong as he was, could not at his age {{withstand}} such constant worry. He grew to look years older, his shoulders acquired a stoop, and his memory began to fail him, especially on matters connected with the mortgages and farm accounts. Ida, too, became pale and ill; she caught a heavy cold, which she could not throw <b>off,</b> and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> acquired a permanently pained and yet listless look.|$|R

60|$|She {{looked a}} very dainty picture of English rural life, {{and no wonder}} that the {{susceptible}} young Frenchman could scarce take his eyes <b>off</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>face.</b> The Vicomte de Tournay was scarce nineteen, a beardless boy, on whom terrible tragedies which were being enacted {{in his own country}} had made but little impression. He was elegantly and even foppishly dressed, and once safely landed in England he was evidently ready to forget the horrors of the Revolution in the delights of English life.|$|R
60|$|Louise {{leaned back}} in her chair. She had been carried <b>off</b> <b>her</b> feet, brought <b>face</b> to face with {{emotions}} which she dared not analyze. Perhaps, after all her self-dissection, there were still secret chambers. She thought almost with fear of what they might contain. Her sense of superiority was vanishing. She was, after all, like other women.|$|R

50|$|During filming, Jovovich's stunt double, British stuntwoman Olivia Jackson, was {{severely}} injured when her motorcycle {{collided with a}} camera crane, leaving her in a medically-induced coma for two weeks. She had been riding at high speed without a helmet, leading to the accident ripping <b>off</b> half <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and crushing <b>her</b> facial bones. Among Jackson's injuries were cerebral trauma, a crushed face, a severed artery in her neck, a paralyzed arm, several broken ribs, a shattered scapula, a broken clavicle, torn fingers with a thumb {{that needed to be}} amputated, and five nerves torn out of her spinal cord. The camera crane had malfunctioned and failed {{to move out of the}} way. Jackson announced in December 2015 that her paralyzed left arm will need to be amputated.

6000|$|This scheming Mother of Mayfair, {{angling for}} a rich son-in-law! Not a {{pleasing}} portrait to look upon, from {{one point of}} view. Let us look at it, for a moment, from another. How weary she must be! This is her third [...] "function" [...] to-night; the paint is running <b>off</b> <b>her</b> poor <b>face.</b> She has been snubbed a dozen times by her social superiors, openly insulted by a Duchess; yet she bears it with a patient smile. It is a pitiful ambition, hers: it is that her child shall marry money, shall have carriages and many servants, live in Park Lane, wear diamonds, see her name in the Society Papers. At whatever cost to herself, her daughter shall, if possible, enjoy these things. She could so much more comfortably go to bed, and leave the child to marry some well-to-do commercial traveller. Justice, Reader, even for such. Her sordid scheming is but the deformed child of Motherhood.|$|R

Mrs. Twit then faints, at which point Mr. Twit splashes a jugful of cold water onto <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She soon recovers, as the frog hops onto <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to get near the water.

6000|$|Gyp {{could detect}} Fiorsen subtly {{mimicking}} that drawl; and her ears began to burn. The puppies afforded a diversion--their points, noses, boldness, and food, held the danger in abeyance for some minutes. Then the mimicry began again.
