5000|$|Tepeaca Municipality is a {{municipality}} in Puebla {{in southeastern}} Mexico. Tepeaca is located 35 km (21.75 mi) from Puebla City {{and is the}} municipal seat of the municipality of the same name. Its name comes from a Spanish variant of [...] "Tepeyacac" [...] composed of the Nahuatl words tepetl ("hill") and yacatl ("nose tip, {{which is in the}} foreground") (can be translated in various ways: [...] "in the top of the hill" [...] or [...] "the principle of the hills").

50|$|In 1907 {{he married}} Margarethe Hilme, {{producing}} two children, Harry and Lucie. Initially the company created small ivory carvings {{of children and}} statuettes of classical form, often carved from old ivory billiard balls. From 1910 the firm grew to specialize in limited edition Art Deco cabinet sculptures that used painted bronze with ivory on plinths of <b>onyx</b> and <b>marble,</b> with an occasional foray into mantelpiece clocks and lampstands. He revolutionized the production of chryselephantine statues with his use of a dental drill for more precise and expeditious carving of the ivory.

A large engraved menorah—chosen as a symbol of Judaism after much debate within the congregation—graces the façade facing the plaza. Morris Gewirz, for whom the one of the building’s auditoriums was named (the other was named for his site commission co-chair Abraham Kay), declared, “This great edifice stands like a mighty colossus of spiritual strength.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} is most notable for its arcaded hypostyle hall, with 856 columns of jasper, <b>onyx,</b> <b>marble,</b> and granite. These {{were made from}} pieces of the Roman temple which had occupied the site previously, {{as well as other}} destroyed Roman buildings, such as the Mérida amphitheatre. The double arches were a new introduction to architecture, permitting higher ceilings than would otherwise be possible with relatively low columns. The double arches consist of a lower horseshoe arch and an upper semi-circular arch. The famous alternating red and white voussoirs of the arches were inspired by those in the Dome of the Rock. and also resemble those of the Aachen Cathedral, which were built almost at the same time. Horseshoe arches were known in the Iberian Peninsula since late Antiquity, as can be seen on the 3rd-century [...] "Estela de los Flavios", now in the arqueological museum of León. A centrally located honey-combed dome has blue tiles decorated with stars.|$|E
50|$|The {{exhibition}} {{also included}} two prototypes {{of the much}} acclaimed and prize-winning hydrochronometer invented in 1867 by Gian Battista Embriaco, O.P. (Ceriana 1829 - Rome 1903), professor at the College of St. Thomas in Rome.Among the horological exhibits, stood out a monumental model, an elaborate conical pendulum clock crafted by two of France's most important artisans {{of the second half}} of the 19th century—renowned clockmaker E. Farcot and sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Be Belleuse. Farcot exhibited several units, one of them it is currently in the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans. Its base, which features the clock's face and inner mechanical movements, is carved from solid <b>onyx</b> <b>marble.</b> Atop the base, a bronze sculpture depicting a robed female figure holds a scepter. Rotating soundlessly from the female subject's hand, the scepter provides consistent motion that adds to the clock's sense of grandeur and mystery. From its base to the top of the bronze figure stands at nearly 10 feet tall. Farcot, the most well-known of the French conical clock-makers, established himself in 1860 and mastered his craft over a period of 30 years, helping to popularize the unique pendulum escapement, the mechanism which controls the motion of the inner wheels. Carrier de Belleuse was one of the most important and renowned sculptors of the 19th century, as well as the teacher of Auguste Rodin. In 1857, his bronze sculptures grabbed the attention of Napoleon III, and he was commissioned for several important national works, including his most famous piece, Torchere, which still flanks the staircase of the Paris Opera House.|$|E
50|$|Tiles {{are often}} used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex mosaics. Tiles are most often made of ceramic, {{typically}} glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, concrete and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically <b>marble,</b> <b>onyx,</b> granite or slate. Thinner tiles {{can be used on}} walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.|$|R
50|$|Gregory, in the meantime, {{demonstrated}} {{his opposition}} to iconoclasm by emphasising his veneration of icons and relics. He repaired or beautified numerous churches, which involved their decoration with icons and images of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the saints. He ordered to be erected {{in the heart of}} St. Peter’s Basilica an iconostasis, situated between six <b>onyx</b> and <b>marble</b> columns which had been sent to Gregory as a gift from the exarch Eutychius. He built a new oratory in St. Peter's Basilica to house the relics of a number of saints, convoking a synod in 732 in order to regulate the prayers and masses to be said there. Gregory was an enthusiastic supporter of monasticism; he established the monastery of St. Chrysogonus and rebuilt the hospice of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, near St. Peter's, endowing it for the support of the poor.|$|R

40|$|Gemstone {{minerals}} in Serbia {{have never}} been regarded as an interesting and significant resource. Nevertheless, more than 150 deposits and occurrences have been recorded {{and some of them}} preliminarily explored in the last 50 years. The majority of deposits and occurrences are located within the Serbo-Macedonian metallogenic province and the most significant metallogenic units at the existing level of knowledge are the Fruska Gora ore district, Cer ore district, Sumadija metallogenic zone, Kopaonik metallogenic zone and Lece-Halkidiki metallogenic zone. The most important genetic type of deposits is hydrothermal, particularly in case of serpentinite/peridotite as host/parent rock. Placer deposits are also economically important. The dominant gemstones are silica minerals: chalcedony (Chrysoprase, carnelian, bluish chalcedony etc.), jasper (picture, landscape, red etc.), common opal (dendritic, green, milky white etc.), silica masses (undivided), and quartz (rock crystal, amethyst etc.). Beside silica minerals significant gemstones in Serbia include also beryl (aquamarine), garnet (almandine and pyrope), tourmaline, fluorite, rhodochrosite, carbonate-silica breccia, carbonate-silica onyx, silicified wood, howlite, serpentinite, <b>marble</b> <b>onyx,</b> and kyanite. This paper aims to present an overview of Serbian gemstone deposits and occurrences and their position based on a simplified gemstone metallogenic map of Serbia, as well as genetic-industrial classification of gemstone deposits and gemstone varieties...|$|R

In the rear is a large dome-capped tower with a cross perched on the peak. In front of the building {{at the peak of the}} highest pediment is a cross that is perched on a stand. Flanking it on the corner of the building are statues mounted on stands. A man stands near a horse-drawn carriage that is parked on the dirt road in front of the church.; "The Cathedral of St. Vibiana is the seat of the Los Angeles Archdiocese. It has been closed since May 1995 because of damage sustained during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Located at 114 E. 2 nd Street, surrounded by abandoned buildings and bordering Skid Row, the rundown and neglected cathedral's future is in doubt. Plans for a cathedral for Los Angeles began as early as 1859. Using land donated to the Church by Amiel Cavalier, architect Ezra Kysor designed the building. The cathedral was dedicated in 1876; four years and $ 80, 000 later St. Vibiana's was completed. Pope Pius IX chose the Cathedral's name, selecting St. Vibiana, a 3 rd century martyr whose remains had been buried in the Roman catacombs. Since cathedrals traditionally contain the relics of a saint, the remains of Vibiana are now in a gilt and plate glass sarcophagus located in a niche above the high altar. The interior was remodeled about 1895, using <b>onyx</b> and <b>marble.</b> The exterior facade of the building was changed 1922 - 24 to give it its present look, said to be based on a Roman design.
