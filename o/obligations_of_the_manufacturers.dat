40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{the great}} market {{competition}} makes {{that the companies}} look for high reliability and quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products manufacturing. The effective ways to ensure reliability signals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product is by offering better warranty terms and period associated with sale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product. In fact, warranty is a legal <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> or dealer in connection with <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product that defines <b>the</b> liability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> or dealer in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> <b>the</b> premature failure or defects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper is to}} propose a method for reliability analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warranty data and to validate the warranty policy. In order to applied neuro-fuzzy approach by optimizing warranty cost and period, modelling <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product must be beneficial.

40|$|Contract of sale {{is a basic}} legal {{instrument}} {{of international trade and}} therefore has a major role not only in domestic but also in international commodity trade. The corpus rights and <b>obligations</b> represent <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sales contract. By concluding the sales contract, whether in internal or international law, each party undertakes certain obligations, but also it is acquired with certain rights. <b>The</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buyer represent one part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract`s content <b>of</b> sale <b>of</b> goods. <b>The</b> subject <b>of</b> analysis in this paper will be <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buyer which are specified in <b>the</b> Contract Law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Macedonia, as well as the buyer obligations which are listed in the United Nations Convention on Contracts for <b>the</b> International Sale <b>of</b> Goods, but mainly, we will concentrate on <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buyer to pay the price for the goods to the seller.
