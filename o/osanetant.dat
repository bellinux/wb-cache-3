40|$|Talnetant and <b>osanetant,</b> two {{structurally}} diverse antagonists of neurokinin- 3 receptor (NK 3), displayed distinct {{modes of}} action in Ca 2 mobilization. Although talnetant showed a normal Schild plot with a slope close to unity and a Kb similar to its Ki value in binding, <b>osanetant</b> presented an aberrant Schild with a steep slope (3. 3 0. 5) and a Kb value (12 nM) significantly elevated compared with its Ki value (0. 8 nM) in binding. Kinetic binding experiments indicated a simple one-step binding mechanism with relatively fast on- and off-rates for both antag-onists, arguing against slow onset of antagonism {{as the reason for}} abnormal Schild. This conclusion was supported by pro-longed preincubation of antagonist that failed to improve the observed aberrant Schild. In ligand cross-competition binding, both talnetant and <b>osanetant</b> displayed linear reciprocal plots of identical slope when [MePhe 7]neurokinin B (NKB) was used as the other competition partner with 125 I-[MePhe 7]NKB as the radioligand, indicating competitive binding of either antagonist with regard to [MePhe 7]NKB. Similar patterns were obtained when talnetant was tested against <b>osanetant,</b> indicating com-petitive binding between the two antagonists as well. These results were reproduced when [3 H] 4 -quinolinecarboxamide (SB 222200), a close derivative of talnetant, was used as the radioligand. Taken together, these data strongly suggest bind-ing of both talnetant and <b>osanetant</b> at the orthosteric binding site with similar kinetic properties and do not support the hypothesis that the aberrant Schild observed in functional as-says for <b>osanetant</b> is derived from differences in the mecha-nism of binding for these NK 3 antagonists. Neurokinins (NKs) are a family of at least three neuropep-tides, substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B (NKB), with each mediating their biological effects through binding to a preferred G-protein-coupled receptor termed NK 1, NK 2, or NK 3, respectively (Holmes et al., 2003; Almeida et al. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{in vitro}} study investigates and compares {{the effects of}} NK 3 {{receptor}} ligands on the firing rate of rat and guinea pig midbrain dopamine neurons. The findings {{are discussed in the}} light of choosing suitable animal models for investigating pharmacological properties of NK 3 receptor antagonists, which have been proposed to possess therapeutic activity in neuropsychiatric diseases like e. g. schizophrenia. In vitro midbrain slice preparations of both species were used to record (extracellularly) the firing rates of dopamine neurons located in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Furthermore, the effect of the D 2 receptor agonist quinpirole on guinea pig SN and VTA dopamine neurons was investigated. The efficacy of quinpirole in inhibiting guinea pig dopamine neuron firing activity was much less as compared to that of rat dopamine neurons, suggesting a lower dopamine D 2 autoreceptor density on the guinea pig neurons. The NK 3 receptor agonist senktide induced in subpopulations of rat SN (55 %) and VTA (79 %) and guinea pig SN (50 %) and VTA (21 %) dopamine neurons an increase in firing rate. In responsive neurons this effect was concentration-dependent with EC 50 values of 3 - 5 nM (for both species). The selective NK 3 receptor antagonist <b>osanetant</b> (100 nM) was able to partly block the senktide-induced increase in firing rates of dopamine neurons and shifted the concentration-response relation curves for senktide to the right (pA 2 values were ∼ 7. 5). The fractional block of the senktide responses by <b>osanetant</b> appeared to be larger in guinea pig dopamine neurons, indicating that <b>osanetant</b> is a more potent blocker of NK 3 receptor-mediated responses with noncompetitive properties in the guinea pi...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe centromedial {{amygdala}} (CeM), {{a subdivision}} {{of the central}} amygdala (CeA), {{is believed to be}} the main output station of the amygdala for fear expression. We provide evidence that the Tac 2 gene, expressed by neurons specifically within the CeM, is required for modulating fear memories. Tac 2 is colocalized with GAD 65 and CaMKIIα but not with PKCd and Enk neurons in the CeM. Moreover, the Tac 2 product, NkB, and its specific receptor, Nk 3 R, are also involved in the consolidation of fear memories. Increased Tac 2 expression, through a stress-induced PTSD-like model, or following lentiviral CeA overexpression, are sufficient to enhance fear consolidation. This effect is blocked by the Nk 3 R antagonist <b>osanetant.</b> Concordantly, silencing of Tac 2 -expressing neurons in CeA with DREADDs impairs fear consolidation. Together, these studies further our understanding of the role of the Tac 2 gene and CeM in fear processing and may provide approaches to intervention for fear-related disorders...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the role of tachykinins in cough induced by citric acid (0. 8 M) in pigs. With this object, we have studied the effect of citric acid on substance P content in the tracheo-bronchial tree and the effects of substance P and of tachykinin receptor antagonists on citric acid-induced cough. Citric acid exposure significantly increased substance P concentration in both broncho-alveolar and tracheal lavage fluids, while it decreased significantly the substance P content in tracheal mucosa. Substance P did not elicit cough, but significantly potentiated the citric acid-induced cough frequency. Tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) or NK(3) receptor antagonists, SR 140333 (nolpitantium), SR 48968 (saredutant) and SR 142801 (<b>osanetant),</b> respectively, significantly inhibited citric acid-induced cough. The same inhibitory effect of tachykinin receptor antagonists was observed, when substance P was nebulised before citric acid challenge. We conclude that citric acid induces in pigs a release of substance P in the tracheo-bronchial tree, which plays a sensitising role on the cough reflex. The involvement of tachykinin NK(1), NK(2), NK(3) receptors are also demonstrated in this reflex. Peer reviewe...|$|E

But SP (20 nmol/kg, i. v.) {{was able to}} induce salivation, and plasma extravasation in the bladder and the trachea {{significantly}} (P 0. 05). R 116301 (ID 50 = 0. 7 mumol/kg) and R 115614 (ID 50 = 1. 2 mumol/kg) were able to inhibit the salivation response significantly (P septide (7. 9) (both NK 1 receptor agonists) > neurokinin A (NKA) (7. 7) > SP (7. 6) > GR 64349 (NK 2 receptor agonist) (7. 0). For the NK 1 receptor antagonists, the rank order of potency (based on pKB/pA 2 values) to inhibit ileal contraction was: R 116301 (7. 8 - 8. 2) ≈ R 115614 (7. 7 - 8. 3) > CP- 99, 994 (6. 4 - 7. 3) against various NK 1 receptor agonists. Furthermore, NK 2 receptor antagonist saredutant (pA 2 = 7. 3) competitively antagonised GR 64349 -induced ileal contraction. When injected intracerebroventricularly, SP (100 nmol), septide, [Sar 9 Met(O 2) 11] SP, NKA (all at 30 nmol), GR 64349 (10 and 30 nmol), and senktide (NK 3 receptor agonist) (3 - 30 nmol) significantly induced emesis in Suncus murinus (P< 0. 05). They were also effective in inducing locomotor hyperactivity, ano-genital grooming, circling, face washing, hindlimb licking, scratching, and straub tail (3 - 30 nmol, P< 0. 05). R 116301 and R 115614 (both at 3 and 10 mumol/kg, s. c.) significantly antagonised some {{of the actions of}} the agonists including emesis, locomotor hyperactivity, ano-genital grooming, licking, scratching, and straub tail (P< 0. 05). Saredutant and NK 3 receptor antagonist <b>osanetant</b> (both at 30 mumol/kg, s. c.) attenuated emesis induced by GR 64349 and senktide respectively (P< 0. 05). Saredutant (30 mumol/kg, s. c.) was also able to inhibit GR 64349 -induced face washing and scratching, while <b>osanetant</b> (30 mumol/kg, s. c.) also significantly attenuated senktide-induced straub tail (P< 0. 05).
