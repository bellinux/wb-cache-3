30|$|Reynolds and Pippenger (2010) {{suggested}} a possible interpretation <b>of</b> <b>Venezuela’s</b> behavior <b>of</b> exceeding OPEC production quotas {{because of its}} institutions and risk aversion especially when the oil price is high. Evidence can be easily found during the history <b>of</b> <b>Venezuela’s</b> state oil company (PDVSA), which directed Venezuela’s path to the oil-oriented economy (Zhao 2010). Indeed, Venezuela has been stressing the relationship between social organizations and government reforms and ruling. This interpretation is based on Wang’s (2011) analysis of Venezuelan society organizations during President Chavez’s time in power. According to Kolstad and Wiig (2009), the root <b>of</b> <b>Venezuela’s</b> dilemma lies in the government’s income-seeking behaviors, which result the dysfunction in the mechanism.|$|R
