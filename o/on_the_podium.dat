5|$|A {{moment of}} silence was also held for Weylandt before stage 11, as his funeral took place the same day.

After Alec hits his master's hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> he is standing on, Presto then spends {{the rest of the}} show trying to catch Alec through the opening between his top hat and the wizard's hat.|$|E

As the laureate was absent, Liu's place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> was unoccupied; Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann read I Have No Enemies, an essay that Liu had written for his trial in December 2009, in place of the acceptance speech.|$|E

5|$|Team member Wouter Weylandt {{died after}} {{crashing}} during stage 3 of the Giro d'Italia, {{leading to the}} team's mass withdrawal the next day.

5|$|The {{team was}} built for strong showings in the classic cycle races, and {{includes}} the best classics rider from the 2010 season, world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara. Though Cancellara did not win any race that awarded points to the UCI World Tour, he consistently placed highly enough that he was briefly the world number one rider {{in the midst of}} the classics season. Thanks to Cancellara's performances and the Schleck brothers both finishing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the team was also in the top spot for a time.|$|E
5|$|At the Tour de Luxembourg in June, Rast {{entered as}} {{defending}} champion {{and was considered}} among the favorites, but the team did not win any stage or finish <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium.</b> Leipheimer won the prologue time trial to the Dauphine Libéré later in the month, and wound up finishing third overall in the race. Klöden next took second overall in the Tour de Suisse, later in June. The following month, Leipheiemer and Horner raced as Astana (though {{they were the only}} Astana riders in the event) at the Cascade Cycling Classic, and Leipheimer was able to take the overall win there, largely thanks to a convincing victory in the third stage time trial. On the same day, René Haselbacher won a stage in Tour of Austria. Later in the month, Sergeui Ivanov won the Tour de Wallonie, without winning a stage.|$|E
