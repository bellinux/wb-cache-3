Libel is defined as [...] "public and malicious imputation of a crime, or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, condition, status, or circumstance tending to cause the dishonor, discredit, or contempt of a natural or juridical person, or to blacken the memory of one who is dead." [...] Slander is defined as <b>oral</b> <b>defamation.</b> Slander by deed is defined as [...] "any act not included and punished in this title, which shall cast dishonor, discredit or contempt upon another person."

A notable characteristic of these crimes under Philippine law is the specification that they apply to imputations both real and imaginary.|$|E
