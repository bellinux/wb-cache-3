Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> at the equinoxes.|$|E

In 1875, a farmer called J.N.R. van Reenen and his wife stopped here as they travelled to their new farm in Vuurland.

500|$|Altdorfer also {{produced}} {{a great deal}} of religious artwork, in reflection of his devout Catholicism. His most frequent subjects were the Virgin Mary and the life and crucifixion of Christ. As in The Battle of Alexander at Issus, these paintings often feature settings of great majesty and use the sky to convey symbolic meaning. This meaning is not uniform throughout Altdorfer's corpus – for example, the visage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> connotes loss and tragedy in , but serves as [...] "the emblem of power and glory" [...] in The Battle of Alexander at Issus.|$|E
500|$|Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore, one of Denmark's {{most popular}} works, was painted in 1892. It shows Marie {{standing}} on the beach with Rap by her side and the moonlight reflected in the sea. She is shown in profile and her melancholy face and bright dress glow under the light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun.</b> The painting {{is one of the}} works in which Krøyer tries to capture the light and mood on the Skagen shore during what he called [...] "l'heure bleue" [...] (the blue hour), the short period at dusk when the light casts a blue tint over the landscape. The Symbolists believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. The moon's reflection adds a slight feeling of depth to the otherwise flat background which consists mostly of the monolithic blue sea. Marie is depicted as being at a similar height to the viewer, but the horizon rises above her head, emphasizing her radiance against the muted, nearly monochrome background.|$|E

2500|$|By {{his first}} solo {{exhibition}} in 1900-1901 in the Art Pavilion in Zagreb, his painting style had changed, with brighter colours appearing, and themes of landscapes and seascapes which were {{to remain a}} favourite subject throughout his life. He depicted it {{in a variety of}} different moods – in lively colors with foaming white waves, in somber fog, in the glow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> and under [...] blue skies. An excellent landscape artist, he recorded characteristic scenes of the region, [...] especially Istria, the Croatian coast and Dalmatia. Some of Crnčić's marine and coastal landscapes were unsurpassed at the time. His painting [...] "Rain" [...] is an excellent example of his mature style, with elements of realism combined with a free composition and a dynamic interplay of colours.|$|E

2500|$|Electronic Design {{called the}} game a [...] " [...] wacky parody" [...] that reimagines the {{well-known}} island as {{something out of}} an industrial nightmare.

Plotting New Media Frontiers thought that the existence of parody games demonstrated that [...] "generic conventions are well established and part of the culture associated with computer game playing", citing Pyst as a prime example. Computer Shopper said the title was [...] "no-holds-barred" [...] and [...] "pulls no punches" [...] in its odd sense of humour, and deemed it a favourable alternative to those who were annoyed by Myst's [...] "inscrutable puzzles". CD Mag thought the game was [...] "somewhat witty".

2500|$|It was not {{originally}} {{the intention of}} the Mongol Empire to invade the Khwarezmid Empire. According to the Persian historian Juzjani, Genghis Khan had originally sent the ruler of the Khwarezmid Empire, Ala ad-Din Muhammad, a message seeking trade and greeted him as his neighbor: [...] "I am master of the lands of the rising sun while you rule those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun.</b> Let us conclude a firm treaty of friendship and peace." [...] or he said [...] "I am Khan of the lands of the rising sun while you are sultan those of the setting sun: Let us conclude a firm agreement of friendship and peace." [...] The Mongols' original unification of all [...] "people in felt tents", unifying the nomadic tribes in Mongolia and then the Turcomens and other nomadic peoples, had come with relatively little bloodshed, and almost no material loss. The Mongol wars with the Jurchens however had shown how cruel the Mongols could be. Shah Muhammad reluctantly agreed to this peace treaty, but it was not to last. The war started less than a year later, when a Mongol caravan and its envoys were massacred in the Khwarezmian city of Otrar.|$|E
60|$|The scenery {{here was}} more than usually beautiful, being diversified not only in form, but in its wealth and variety of trees, and twining parasites and graceful ferns, with, in one place, groves of tall trees covered with balls of wild cotton, as large as an orange, and, elsewhere, inextricable {{entanglements}} of gorgeously flowering creepers, such as the most vivid imagination would fail to invent or conceive.
