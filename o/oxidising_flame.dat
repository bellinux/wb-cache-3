50|$|A {{neutral flame}} is used. A {{reducing}} flame (fuel rich) gives trouble with soot deposits in the weld. An <b>oxidising</b> <b>flame</b> burns {{the lead and}} creates lead oxide dross, leading to poor welds with low malleability.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} measure the total gaseous phosphorus content in biogas. The amount of air needed for a neutral to <b>oxidising</b> <b>flame</b> was mixed with the biogas. The gas mixture was burnt in a closed quartz burner and the combustion gasses were bubbled through a nitric acid solution. The phosphate content in the bubbling liquid was determined with sector field ICP-MS. The {{technique was}} validated in the lab with phosphine. Afterwards the set-up was installed on a landfill. The total gaseous phosphorus content in the landfill gas, measured with the combustive technique, ranged from 1. 65 to 4. 44 mgrg P/m 3. At {{the same time the}} phosphine concentration in the landfill gas was determined gas chromatographically (GC). The phosphine (PH 3) content measured with GC ranged from 7. 6 to 16. 7 mgrg PH 3 -P/m 3. Since the phosphine-P content (GC) was consistently higher than the total gaseous phosphorus content (burner/ICP-MS), the hypothesised presence of highly toxic gaseous phosphorus compounds other than phosphine could not be demonstrated...|$|E
