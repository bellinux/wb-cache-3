5|$|Jain {{vegetarian}} diet is practised by {{the followers of}} Jain culture and philosophy. It {{is considered one of}} the most rigorous forms of a spiritually motivated diet on the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The Jain cuisine is completely vegetarian, and it also excludes potatoes, <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic,</b> like the shojin-ryori cuisine of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; indeed, {{the cuisine}} of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted {{of bread and}} beer, supplemented with vegetables such as <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic,</b> and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring <b>onions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic.</b> The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the root}} {{vegetables}} are also <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlics</b> which many Brahmin families refrain from considering them Tamasik. Though like other root vegetables <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlics</b> also have many medicinal values. People following Jainism also refrain from root vegetables.|$|R

5|$|Risotto is a dish {{made using}} Italian short-grain rice, {{which is both}} highly {{absorbent}} and resistant to turning into a pudding when cooked with stock and flavoured with <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic,</b> cooked in butter. Anna Gosetti della Salda's book of Italian regional cookery lists 37 risotto recipes, 18 {{of them from the}} Veneto. Variations among Veneto risottos include additions of fish and white wine; chicken; eel; mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese; quails; small pieces of beef; courgettes (zucchini); clams; ragù; beans; mussels; prawns; cuttlefish; and asparagus.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. <b>Onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|When a {{vegetable}} is harvested, it {{is cut off}} from its source of water and nourishment. It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops. Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can {{be left in the}} ground and harvested over an extended period. The harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to the crop. <b>Onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> can be dried for a few days in the field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm, moist surroundings, during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens. Before marketing or storage, grading {{needs to be done to}} remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality, size, ripeness, and color.|$|E
50|$|In certain {{versions}} of Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, vegetables of the onion genus are taboo. Many Hindus discourage eating <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> along with non-vegetarian food during festivals or Hindu holy months of Shrawan and Kartik. However, shunning <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> {{is not very}} popular among Hindus as compared to avoiding non-vegetarian foods, so many people do not follow this custom.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of varying dietary supplemental inclusion levels of <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> mixture on semen quality characteristics of Koekoek breeder cocks aged 35 - 41 weeks. The experimental diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous but with different supplemental inclusion levels of <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic.</b> A complete randomized design was used for the experiment. The three dietary supplemental levels based on <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> <b>onion</b> supplemental inclusion levels were Q 0 (0 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 0 g <b>garlic</b> per 600 g DM feed), Q 1 (2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed), and Q 2 (5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g <b>garlic</b> per 600 g DM feed) with each treatment having three replicates. A quadratic type equation was used to determine the <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> levels for optimum semen quality characteristics. Daily supplementation with 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g <b>garlic</b> per 600 g DM feed increased progressive motile cells (%), actual life sperm count (× 106 /nl), and live sperm (%) by 221. 20 %, 301. 51 %, and 352. 43 %, while 2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed reduced them by 28. 67 %, 12. 69 %, and 19. 00 %, respectively. However, daily supplementation with 2. 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 g garlic per 600 g DM feed increased sperm count (× 106 /nl) by 12. 82 %, whereas daily supplementation with 5 g <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> 5 g <b>garlic</b> per 600 g DM feed reduced it by 10. 26 % in Koekoek breeder cocks. Dietary <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> supplemental inclusion levels of 3. 009, 3. 191, 4. 621, 6. 601, 6. 719, 2. 327, 2. 385, and 2. 247 g per 600 g DM feed supported optimum progressive motile cells (%), immotile sperm cells (%), actual dead sperm count (× 106 /nl), actual live sperm count (× 106 /nl), live sperm (%), acrosome morphology defects (%), acrosome detachment (%), and acrosome swelling (%), with probability values ranging from 0. 003 to 0. 783, whereas minimum progressive motile cells (%) increase was achieved at an optimum <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> supplementation levels of 3. 009 g per 600 g DM feed. These findings have a lot of implications on the use of supplemental <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> inclusion levels to enhance reproductive efficiency in Koekoek breeder cocks...|$|R

25|$|Leeks, <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> were eaten both {{cooked in}} stews, and {{uncooked}} with bread, and their popularity may be {{indicated by the}} observation in the Bible that {{they are among the}} foods that the Israelites yearned for after leaving Egypt. Squash and melons were eaten raw, or flavored with vinegar. Black radishes were also eaten raw when in season during the autumn and winter. The Talmud mentions the use of radish seeds to produce oil, and considered eating radishes to have health benefits.|$|E
25|$|Pelmeni are a {{traditional}} Eastern European (mainly Russian) dish usually made with minced meat filling, wrapped in thin dough (made out of flour and eggs, sometimes with milk or water added). For filling, pork, lamb, beef, {{or any other}} kind of meat can be used; mixing several kinds is popular. The traditional Ural recipe requires the filling be made with 45% of beef, 35% of lamb, and 20% of pork. Traditionally, various spices, such as pepper, <b>onions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic,</b> are mixed into the filling.|$|E
2500|$|McArabia – {{there are}} two {{versions}} of the McArabia: grilled chicken, and grilled kofta (beef with spices). Both are served with lettuce, tomatoes, <b>onions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> mayonnaise in addition to two small patties of grilled chicken or kofta, all wrapped in an Arabian-style pita bread. McDonald's has performed a rather large advertising campaign for the McArabia since its introduction in 2003, largely focusing on the Arabian-themed nature of the sandwich, and it appears to have worked well. The McArabia has been very well received throughout Southwestern Eurasia. The same product is also introduced in Malaysia with [...] "Chicken Foldover" [...] as an alternative name.|$|E

2500|$|Rav and Samuel debated how to {{interpret}} the report of [...] that the Israelites complained: [...] "We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for free." [...] One read [...] "fish" [...] literally, while the other read [...] "fish" [...] to mean the illicit intercourse that they were [...] "free" [...] to have {{when they were in}} Egypt, before the commandments of Sinai. Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Assi disputed the meaning of the report of [...] that the Israelites remembered the cucumbers, melons, leeks, <b>onions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> of Egypt. One said that manna had the taste of every kind of food except these five; while the other said that manna had both the taste and the substance of all foods except these, for which manna had only the taste without the substance.|$|E
2500|$|Wingate {{was known}} for various eccentricities. For instance, he often wore an alarm clock around his wrist, which would go off at times, and had raw <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> on a string around his neck, which he would {{occasionally}} bite into as a snack (the reason he used to give for this was to ward off mosquitoes). He often went about without clothing. In Palestine, recruits were used to having him {{come out of the}} shower to give them orders, wearing nothing but a shower cap, and continuing to scrub himself with a shower brush. Lord Moran, Winston Churchill's personal physician, wrote in his diaries that [...] " [...] seemed to me hardly sane—in medical jargon a borderline case". Likewise, referring to Churchill's meeting with Wingate in Quebec, Max Hastings wrote that, [...] "Wingate proved a short-lived protegé: closer acquaintance caused Churchill to realise that he was too mad for high command".|$|E
2500|$|Galician cuisine often uses {{fish and}} shellfish. The {{empanada}} is a meat or fish pie, with a bread-like base, top and crust with the meat or fish filling usually {{being in a}} tomato sauce including <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic.</b> Caldo galego is a hearty soup whose main ingredients are potatoes and a local vegetable named grelo (Broccoli rabe). The latter is also employed in Lacón con grelos, a typical carnival dish, consisting of pork shoulder boiled with grelos, potatoes and chorizo. Centolla {{is the equivalent of}} king crab. It is prepared by being boiled alive, having its main body opened like a shell, and then having its innards mixed vigorously. Another popular dish is octopus, boiled (traditionally in a copper pot) and served in a wooden plate, cut into small pieces and laced with olive oil, sea salt and pimentón (Spanish paprika). This dish is called Pulpo a la gallega or in Galician [...] "Polbo á Feira", which roughly translates as [...] "Galician-style Octopus". There are several regional varieties of cheese. The best-known one is the so-called tetilla, named after its breast-like shape. Other highly regarded varieties include the San Simón cheese from Vilalba and the creamy cheese produced in the Arzúa-Ulloa area. A classical dessert is filloas, crêpe-like pancakes made with flour, broth or milk, and eggs. When cooked at a pig slaughter festival, they may also contain the animal's blood. A famous almond cake called Tarta de Santiago (St. James' cake) is a Galician sweet speciality mainly produced in Santiago de Compostela and all around Galicia.|$|E

60|$|Thus, too, the tree-clumps on the pampas {{were mostly}} {{remains of a}} {{vanished}} past. To these clumps or plantations we shall return later on when I come to describe the home life {{of some of our}} nearest neighbours; here the houses only, with or without trees growing about them, need be mentioned as parts of the landscape. The houses were always low and scarcely visible at a distance of a mile and a half: one always had to stoop on entering a door. They were built of burnt or unburnt brick, more often clay and brushwood, and thatched with sedges or bulrushes. At some of the better houses there would be a small garden, a few yards of soil protected in some way from the poultry and animals, in which a few flowers and herbs were grown, especially parsley, rue, sage, tansy, and horehound. But there was no other cultivation attempted, and no vegetables were eaten except <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>garlic,</b> which were bought at the stores, with bread, rice, mate tea, oil, vinegar, raisins, cinnamon, pepper, cummin seed, and whatever else they could afford to season their meat-pies or give a flavour to the monotonous diet of cow's flesh and mutton and pig. Almost the only game eaten was ostrich, armadillo, and tinamou (the partridge of the country), which the boys could catch by snaring or running them down. Wild duck, plover, and such birds they rarely or never tasted, as they could not shoot; and as to the big rodent, the vizcacha, which swarmed everywhere, no gaucho would touch its flesh, although to my taste it was better than rabbit.|$|E
