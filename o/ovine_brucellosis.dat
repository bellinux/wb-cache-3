40|$|Brucellosis is an {{important}} disease among livestock and people in sub-Saharan Africa. In general, the incidence is the highest in pastoral production systems and decreases as herd size and size of landholding decreases.

This species bias is also reflected in control activities. As with other public-sector animal health services, the surveillance and control of brucellosis in sub-Saharan Africa is rarely implemented outside southern Africa. Brucellosis is even more ignored in humans and most cases go undiagnosed and untreated, leading to considerable suffering for those affected. Decision-making to determine the importance of brucellosis control relative to other public concerns and what brucellosis control strategies should be applied is urgently required.

40|$|International audienceBrucella ovis causes ram {{contagious}} epididymitis, {{a disease}} {{for which a}} specific vaccine is lacking. Attenuated Brucella melitensis Rev 1, used as vaccine against <b>ovine</b> and caprine <b>brucellosis</b> caused by B. melitensis, is also considered the best vaccine available for the prophylaxis of B. ovis infection, but its use for this purpose has serious drawbacks. In this work, two previously characterized B. ovis attenuated mutants (Δomp 25 d and Δomp 22) were evaluated in mice, in comparison with B. melitensis Rev 1, as vaccines against B. ovis. Similarities, but also significant differences, were found regarding the immune response induced by the three vaccines. Mice vaccinated with the B. ovis mutants developed anti-B. ovis antibodies in serum of the IgG 1, IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b subclasses and their levels were higher than those observed in Rev 1 -vaccinated mice. After an antigen stimulus with B. ovis cells, splenocytes obtained from all vaccinated mice secreted similar levels of TNF-α and IL 12 (p 40) and remarkably high amounts of IFN-γ, a crucial cytokine in protective immunity against other Brucella species. By contrast, IL- 1 α -an enhancer of T cell responses to antigen- was present at higher levels in mice vaccinated with the B. ovis mutants, while IL- 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly more abundant in Rev 1 -vaccinated mice. Additionally, the B. ovis mutants showed appropriate persistence, limited splenomegaly and protective efficacy against B. ovis similar to that observed with B. melitensis Rev 1. These characteristics encourage their evaluation in the natural host as homologous vaccines for the specific prophylaxis of B. ovis infection...|$|R

The {{objective was}} to investigate the frequency of anti-Brucella abortus agglutinins in goats and sheep of the backlands of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. 700 samples of sanguine serums were processed, of which 340 were of the goat (115 males and 225 females) and 360 (136 males and 224 females) sheep. The technique of the Tamponed Acidified Antigen (AAT) dyed with Bengalese Rose (BR) was used. Of the 340 samples of goat evaluated two (0. 6 %) were reactive to AAT. Significant associations were not observed for the variable age group (p = 0. 430); race (p = 0. 936) and sex (p = 0. 562). Of the 360 sheep samples, nine (2. 5 %) were reactive. There also was no significant association between the analyzed variables and the seropositiveness for brucellosis: age group (p = 0. 522); race (p = 0. 576) and sex (p = 0. 461).

40|$|Objective(s) :Brucellosis, {{especially}} {{caused by}} Brucella melitensis, {{remains one of}} the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide with more than 500, 000 human cases reported annually. The commonly used live attenuated vaccine in <b>ovine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> prophylaxis is B. melitensis Rev 1. But due to different problems caused by the administration of this vaccine, a protective subunit vaccine against B. melitensis is strongly demanded. Brucella BP 26, Omp 31 and TF proteins have shown a considerable potential as protective antigens for brucellosis. Chimeric proteins carrying epitopes or adjuvant sequences increase the possibility of eliciting a broad cellular or humoral immune response. In silico tools are highly suited to study, design and evaluate vaccine strategies. Materials and Methods: In this study, a synthetic chimeric gene, encoding TF, BP 26 93 - 111 and Omp 3148 - 74 was designed.

40|$|Abstract. Pregnant goats {{were given}} Brucella abortus {{intravenously}} or in uterine arteries, and tissues from the uterus and placentae were examined at various post-inoculation intervals to study mechanisms of placental infection. Placentitis was present by 5 days post-inoculation and abortions occurred within 11 days. B. abortus was identified in placentae by light microscopy and immunoperoxidase techniques. B. abortus was first seen in erythrophagocytic trophoblasts of the placentome. Subsequently, {{high numbers of}} B. abortus were seen in periplacentomal chorioallantoic trophoblasts. Trophoblast necrosis, chorioallantoic ulceration, and large num-bers of B. abortus in chorionic villi were present in later stages of infection. These results suggest that entry and replication of B. abortus in trophoblasts precede placentome and fetal infection and that trophoblasts {{are the source of}} B. abortus for these tissues. Experimental caprine brucellosis closely resembles bovine and <b>ovine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> and it provides a model to study the intracellular development of B. abortus in trophoblasts. Brucella abortus has a marked predilection for the ruminant placenta.

40|$|Caprine and <b>ovine</b> <b>brucellosis,</b> {{caused by}} the {{zoonotic}} bacterium Brucella melitensis, is an economically important cause of abortion in small ruminants. This infection causes significant losses from decreased productivity and lost trade {{in much of the}} developing world. B. melitensis {{is considered to be a}} re-emerging pathogen in the Middle East. It has been eradicated from some nations, but the cost of surveillance to remain B. melitensis-free is significant. B. melitensis is also an important human pathogen. In humans, brucellosis is a serious, debilitating and sometimes chronic disease that can affect a variety of organs. Most cases are the result of occupational exposure to infected animals, but infections can also occur from ingesting contaminated dairy products. In addition, B. melitensis could be used in a bioterrorist attack. Etiology In sheep and goats, brucellosis is mainly caused by Brucella melitensis, a Gram– negative coccobacillus or short rod. This organism is a facultative intracellular pathogen. B. melitensis contains three biovars (biovars 1, 2 and 3). All three biovars cause disease in small ruminants, but their geographic distribution varies. Brucella abortus and Brucella suis infections also occur occasionally in small ruminants, but clinical disease seems to be rare.

40|$|Goat {{and sheep}} {{production}} in the semi-arid northeast of Brazil has shown great economic potential. However, health problems can compromise the productivity of these animals. Given the scarcity of studies about the occurrence of these diseases, {{the aim of the}} present study was to analyze the serological diagnosis of anti-Brucella and anti-lentivirus antibodies among small ruminants in municipalities located in the Brazilian states of Bahia and Pernambuco. The samples were collected from local slaughterhouses and dairy farms. In total, 997 serum samples from animals in slaughterhouses and dairy herds were collected. In order to diagnose the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), the samples underwent agarose gel immunodiffusion (AGID) testing. The buffered acidified antigen test (goats) and agarose gel immunodiffusion test (sheep) were used to detect anti-Brucella abortus and B. ovis antibodies following the methodology recommended by the Institute of Technology of Paraná (TECPAR). With anti-CAEV antibodies, seropositivity rates of 4. 1 % and 2. 2 % were recorded for animals from the slaughterhouses and dairy farms, respectively. None of the animals (goats or sheep) were positive for anti-B. abortus antibodies. With B. ovis, a seropositivity rate of 6. 5 % (n = 13) was recorded among the 199 sheep serum samples. Results of the present study confirmed the presence of the CAE virus in the meat and dairy herds studied, although the prevalence was low.

40|$|Sheep {{infected}} with Brucella ovis produce antibody {{responses to the}} rough lipopolysaccharide and to proteins present in hot saline (HS) extracts of B. ovis (J. I. Riezu-Boj, I. Moriyón, J. M. Blasco, C. M. Marín, and R. Díaz, J. Clin. Microbiol. 23 : 938 - 942, 1986). The distribution and antigenic relatedness of proteins in HS extracts and in outer membrane blebs were established by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting for 41 strains of B. ovis and 26 strains of Brucella melitensis of diverse geographic origin. Five major groups of proteins were identified in HS extracts of B. ovis that had been freed of rough lipopolysaccharide: proteins of 43 kilodaltons (kDa), group A (25. 5 to 32. 0 kDa), group B (21. 5 to 22. 5 kDa); group C (18. 0 to 19. 5 kDa), and group D (13. 0 to 15. 5 kDa). Group A, B, C, and D proteins were also present in blebs. The profiles of proteins in HS extracts or blebs from strains of both Brucella species were very similar. Cross-reactions were demonstrated among HS extracts and blebs of all strains tested in immunoblots performed with an antiserum against the HS extract of a reference strain of B. ovis. Evidence was also provided of an antigenic relationship between group 3 proteins of the outer membrane {{and some of the}} proteins in groups A, B, and C.

40|$|The <b>ovine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> {{caused by}} Brucella ovis has tropism for {{reproductive}} tissues but until now {{the mechanism of}} bacterial persistence is not understood. Cytokine expression profiles were studied for 8 months in rams after being experimentally infected with the rough virulent strain of B. ovis (R-B. ovis) to study the pathogenesis of B. ovis and immune mechanism possibly associated to bacteria tropism and persistence. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α), IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 12, interferon-γ (INF-γ) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) cytokines were quantified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in reproductive tissues (epididymus, testicles, ampolae, vesicular glands and bulbourethral glands), and non-reproductive (liver, spleen and kidneys) tissues at 30, 60, 120 and 240 days post infection (dpi). During the acute phase of infection at 30 dpi, the host immune response was most notable demonstrating an up-regulation of several cytokines in reproductive tissues, including the epididymus (IL- 6, IL- 1 β and IL- 1 α), testicles (INF-γ and IL- 12), bulbourethral glands (IL- 6 and TNF-α) and ampolae (INF-γ, IL- 10, IL- 1 β and IL- 1 α). During the development of infection, cytokine gene expression levels decreased, providing evidence of immunosuppression and evidence of immune evasion that favoured persistence of chronic R-B. ovis infection. During the chronic phase of R-B. ovis infection (120 and 240 dpi), cytokine production was down-regulated in the epididymus (IL- 1 β and IL- 1 α), testicles (INF-γ and IL- 12), and ampolae (INF-γ, IL- 10, IL- 1 β and IL- 1 α), {{with the exception of}} the bulbourethral glands (IL- 6 and TNF-α) and epididymus (IL- 6); in these tissues, R-B. ovis infection resulted in up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 6.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the {{efficacy}} and adverse effects of an inactivated Brucella ovis saline-in-oil vaccine administered either once or twice by either the subcutaneous or the intraperitoneal route. Seven Brucella ovis isolates from various sources, including the two used in the manufacture of the Brucella ovis vaccine, were subjected to Bacterial Restriction Endonuclease Analysis and no genetic differences were found. It was concluded that there is probably only one strain of the organism. It was found that rams vaccinated by the subcutaneous route in the neck invariably developed a palpable inflammatory lesion at the site of injection. The lesions had a mean diameter of approximately 3 cm, about one-third of them discharged, and the majority persisted for at least one year after vaccination. These lesions were chronic granulomatous inflammatory reactions arranged around droplets of the oily Brucella ovis vaccine. The intraperitoneal route of vaccination has been advocated in the past as a way of avoiding visible lesions. Necropsy of vaccinated animals revealed that in over 50 % of cases, {{at least some of the}} vaccine administered by this technique failed to reach the cavity and was deposited either beneath the parietal peritoneum or between the muscles of the abdominal wall. Regardless of the site of deposition, however, the vaccine always provoked a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the tissues with which it came into contact. Changing from a subcutaneous to an intraperitoneal vaccination technique merely moved the reaction to a site where it was less visible. Serological studies using the Brucella ovis complement fixation test, gel diffusion test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated a consistent difference in the antibody response of rams vaccinated by the subcutaneous technique in comparison with those vaccinated by the intraperitoneal technique. Those vaccinated by the subcutaneous route generally developed antibody titres more rapidly and often had higher peak titres. In the same way, animals vaccinated twice by either route generally had greater and more persistent antibody titres than those vaccinated once by the same method. The differences in the serological response of rams to different vaccination techniques vere reflected by similar differences in resistance to experimental infection. The administration of an inactivated Brucella ovis saline-in-oil vaccine by any of the techniques studied significantly increased resistance to challenge by the intravenous route. However, two spaced doses of vaccine appeared to be more effective than a single dose, and the subcutaneous technique appeared to be more effective than the intraperitoneal method. Using intravenous inoculation, the number of bacteria required to infect 50 % of unvaccinated animals was estimated to be 9. 5 x 104 organisms. The administration of a single dose of vaccine by the intraperitoneal technique raised that figure to approximately 6. 7 x 106, and the administration of two doses of vaccine by the subcutaneous route raised it to approximately 6. 8 x 107. A viable count of the number of Brucella ovis bacteria present in the semen of an infected ram showed that at least 3 x 109 organisms could be excreted in a single ejaculate. This was over 31, 000 times the number required to infect 50 % of unvaccinated rams after intravenous inoculation and 44 times that required to infect 50 % of animals vaccinated twice by the subcutaneous route. There is therefore a real possibility that natural challenge through homosexual activity may result in the infection of even vaccinated rams. It vas concluded that if vaccination is to be used as a means of controlling the spread of <b>ovine</b> <b>brucellosis,</b> a programme of two doses of vaccine administered at an interval of at least four weeks should he employed. The second dose of vaccine should be administered at least four weeks before the anticipated period of risk. If this method of control is adopted, a palpable lesion at the site of injection which is likely to persist for over a year should be expected. It should also be understood that rams vaccinated in this way may not be totally resistant to Brucella ovis and may still become infected...|$|E
