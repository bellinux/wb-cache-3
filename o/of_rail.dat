5000|$|The 216 km Hara Gebeya-Mek'ele Railway (with a {{total of}} 241 km <b>of</b> <b>rails)</b> did not receive any known loan from foreign {{institutions}} (there have been several and always contradictory reports but {{a look at the}} balance sheet provides the numbers). Given the total construction budget of US $1.5b, expected costs were US $6.2m per km <b>of</b> <b>rails,</b> which was substantially higher than that for the other railways. Without loans in place for buffering the investment, the ERC had to allocate more own budget for the construction of these 241 km <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> than for the in total ~1300 km <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> <b>of</b> the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway and of the Awash-Hara Gebeya Railway altogether. The China Communications Construction Company became the prime contractor for the railway.|$|R

5|$|Between 1942 and 1944 {{large numbers}} of Allied service {{personnel}} were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery. On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, 3,600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January–May 1948 and shipped to the United States for reburial. The railway service had been suspended in 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> services) {{was used as a}} temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} Hawkins's rail, an {{extinct species}} <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> from the Chatham Islands, {{as a new}} species of Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi. He found the Chatham Islands species more similar to the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands. These ideas were later criticised by writers such as the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews and the German ornithologist Hans Friedrich Gadow, and the bird was moved to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx.|$|E

This was reduced to four trains a day in March 2009. These services ceased in January 2011 after passenger number reduced; the closure was blamed on the Great Recession.|$|E
5|$|In Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau {{issued a}} land warning {{for the island}} {{in advance of the}} typhoon. Potential impacts, which would likely be {{enhanced}} by the East Asian Monsoon, prompted Taiwanese president Chen Shui-bian to postpone political marches and campaign rallies intended for the upcoming presidential elections. In anticipation for the typhoon, schools and businesses in southern and eastern Taiwan were closed, along with the delaying <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> and air traffic. Kaohsiung International Airport was closed during the morning of December4.|$|E

5|$|In Taiwan, {{the threat}} of Fanapi forced the closure <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> lines and {{cancellation}} of flights from Kaohsiung International Airport, and at least 156flights were canceled. The storm caused the Kaohsiung seaport in southern Taiwan to close, thus delaying shipments from nearby chemical plants. Many boats rode out the storm at port. Portions of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit system suspended their service, and the Maokong Gondola was shut down during the storm.|$|E

In the late 19th century, the small resort area of Virginia Beach developed in Princess Anne County after the 1883 arrival <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> service to the coast. The Virginia Beach Hotel was opened and operated by the Norfolk and Virginia Beach Railroad and Improvement Company at the oceanfront, near the tiny community of Seatack. The hotel was foreclosed and the railroad reorganized in 1887. The hotel was upgraded and reopened in 1888 as the Princess Anne Hotel.|$|E

5|$|London is {{the centre}} of the National Rail network, with 70 percent <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> {{journeys}} starting or ending in London.

5|$|Other service truncations {{also occur}} in the system during rush hour service only. On the Red Line, every other train bound for Shady Grove terminates at Grosvenor-Strathmore, in {{addition}} to the alternating terminations at Silver Spring mentioned above. For the Yellow Line, all trains bound for Fort Totten terminate at Mount Vernon Square. These are primarily instituted due to a limited supply <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> cars and the locations of pocket tracks throughout the system.|$|E
5|$|Pegler then {{persuaded the}} British Railways Board {{to let him}} run enthusiasts' specials; {{it was at the}} time the only steam {{locomotive}} running on the British Railways mainline. It worked a number <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tours, including a non-stop London to Edinburgh run in 1968, the year steam traction officially ended on BR. In the meantime, watering facilities for steam locomotives were disappearing, so in September 1966, Pegler purchased a second corridor tender which was adapted as an auxiliary water tank; retaining its through gangway, this was coupled behind the normal tender.|$|E
