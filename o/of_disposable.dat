5|$|Coming {{from a small}} {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which are also a form of external debt). Households also took on {{a large amount of}} debt, equivalent to 213% <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> income, which led to inflation. This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, the {{unemployment}} rate in Canberra was 3.4% which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%. As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest average level <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> income of any Australian capital city. The gross average weekly wage in Canberra is $1702 compared with {{the national average of}} $1485.80 (May 2013).|$|E

5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space for open pit garbage disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of garbage bags at traffic intersections and public areas. In some cities, stickers need to be purchased that allow for identification <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> garbage.|$|E

25|$|The {{recession}} {{of the early}} 1990s impacted on the average household budget, and affected the amount <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> income that the average consumer had to spend, and with rising inflation it hit Asda customers whose stores were more heavily concentrated in the north than in the more affluent south east harder.

25|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> {{batteries}} increases by 5–6% every year. In the past, used batteries {{ended up}} at landfill sites, but in 2004, disposal of alkaline batteries at landfill sites was forbidden by an EU regulation. EU member countries are committed to recycling 50% of alkaline batteries by 2016. The need for recycling thus equals to 125,000 tons per year. The share of alkaline batteries is approximately 80% of the whole.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this case study {{is to determine the}} cost difference between using a conventional type of inventory system in the operating room versus using a pack system in the operating room. In this study three different ways <b>of</b> delivering <b>disposables</b> for a laminectomy procedure were considered: 1) multiple distributors <b>of</b> <b>disposables,</b> 2) single distributor <b>of</b> <b>disposables,</b> and 3) the pack system (CDS by Medline). The first comparison was of multiple distributors vs. a single distributor with a cost difference of $ 90. 08 per procedure and $ 18, 916. 80 annually, multiple distributor costing less. The second comparison was between Medline as a single distributor and Medline’s CDS pack system; with a cost difference of $ 250. 13 per procedure and $ 52, 527. 30 annually, CDS pack system costing less. The third comparison was of multiple distributors vs. Medline’s CDS pack system, with differences of $ 167. 04 per procedure and annual differences of $ 35, 078. 40, CDS pack system costing less. Another way that the CDS benefits the hospital is that funds normally tied up in inventory are now available for use in other areas. In a report given to the hospital administration, the reduced inventory has made $ 50, 000. 00 available for other uses...|$|R

25|$|Some {{disposable}} diapers include fragrance, lotions or {{essential oils}} {{in order to}} help mask the scent of a soiled diaper, or to protect the skin. Care <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> diapers is minimal, and primarily consists of keeping them in a dry place before use, with proper disposal in a garbage receptacle upon soiling. Stool is supposed to be deposited in the toilet, but is generally put in the garbage {{with the rest of the}} diaper.|$|E
25|$|An average {{child will}} go through several {{thousand}} diapers in their life. Since disposable diapers are discarded after a single use, usage <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> diapers increases the burden on landfill sites, and increased environmental awareness {{has led to a}} growth in campaigns for parents to use reusable alternatives such as cloth or hybrid diapers. An estimated 27.4 billion disposable diapers are used each year in the US, resulting in a possible 3.4 million tons of used diapers adding to landfills each year.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{financial}} {{motivation was}} one of the main drivers of reuse. In the developing world this driver can lead to very high levels of reuse, however rising wages and consequent consumer demand for the convenience <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> products has made the reuse of low value items such as packaging uneconomic in richer countries, leading to the demise of many reuse programs. Current environmental awareness is gradually changing attitudes and regulations, such as the new packaging regulations, are gradually beginning to reverse the situation.|$|E

25|$|Since {{active sonar}} reveals the {{presence}} and position of the operator, and does not allow exact classification of targets, it is used by fast (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods {{to minimize the risk}} of detection. Consequently, active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar. In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{features}} <b>of</b> <b>disposable</b> diapers include {{one or more}} pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep the diaper securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool {{which has not been}} absorbed. Some diapers lines now commonly include wetness indicators, in which a chemical included in the fabric of the diaper changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that the diaper is wet.|$|E
25|$|Several EU member-states are in {{economic}} decline in both relative and absolute terms {{leading to a}} de facto Multi-speed Europe.

Globalization has brought increased competition in both internal and export markets for companies based within the European Union. European Union growth stimulus policies - artificially created monetary expansion to combat deflationary pressures through credit & fiscal easing - is only postponing absolute economic decline and burdening future generations with humongous debt repayments {{in the absence of}} innovation-led growth.|$|E
50|$|Opponents of VAT claim VAT is {{regressive}} and is paid by all consumers {{whether they}} be rich or poor, young or old. The poorest also spend a higher proportion <b>of</b> their <b>disposable</b> income on VAT than richest. An Office for National Statistics report showed that in 2009/10 the poorest 20% spent 8.7% of their gross income on VAT, whereas the richest 20% spent only 4.0% of their gross income on VAT. Similarly, the poorest 20% spent 9.7% <b>of</b> their <b>disposable</b> income on VAT, whereas the richest 20% spent only 5.2% <b>of</b> their <b>disposable</b> income on VAT. Supporters of VAT claim VAT is progressive as consumers who spend more pay more VAT. However, according to their definitions, VAT is neither progressive nor regressive, since the rate neither increases or decreases with the taxable amount.|$|R
