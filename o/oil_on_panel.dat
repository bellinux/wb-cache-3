The oil paint lent itself to a richer and deeper quality of colour than tempera, and permitted the painting of textures {{in ways that were}} highly realistic.|$|E

500|$|The Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych (or Diptych with Calvary and Last Judgement) {{consists}} of two small painted panels attributed to the Early Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck, with areas finished by unidentified followers or members of his workshop. This diptych [...] {{is one of the}} early Northern Renaissance <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>panel</b> masterpieces, renowned for its unusually complex and highly detailed iconography, and for the technical skill evident in its completion. It was executed in a miniature format; the panels are just [...] high by [...] wide. The diptych was probably commissioned for private devotion.|$|E

500|$|The major Netherlandish {{painters}} include Campin, van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Dieric Bouts, Petrus Christus, Hans Memling, Hugo van der Goes and Hieronymus Bosch. These artists {{made significant}} advances in natural representation and illusionism, {{and their work}} typically features complex iconography. [...] Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits, with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare. Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century. The painted works are generally <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>panel,</b> either as single works or more complex portable or fixed altarpieces {{in the form of}} diptychs, triptychs or polyptychs. The period is also noted for its sculpture, tapestries, illuminated manuscripts, stained glass and carved retables.|$|E
500|$|The {{panels are}} in {{relatively}} good condition given their age. The Philadelphia version is better preserved; it has superior tonalities and more prominent colours. [...] In 1906, Roger Fry {{gave it a}} well-documented restoration with overpaint removed. Fry {{was at the time}} Curator of Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum and performed restorations despite a formal lack of training; the St Francis was the second restoration he undertook. He attributed the work to Hubert van Eyck, and thought the Turin version a copy. His removal of a section at the top revealed a red border; he wrote that van Eyck had [...] "conceived it as a miniature in <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>panel,</b> and that it might indicate a date not very far removed from the drawings of the Turin Book of Hours" [...] (Milan-Turin Hours). In 1926 he recorded: [...] "When it came to me, the panel was considerably larger at the top, and dull opaque sky concealed the join where the extra piece had been added on to satisfy some owner who did not appreciate the compressed composition [...] of the original. The sky had been enlivened... with a crowd of small white-cloud like forms suggesting the presence of a cohort of angels." [...] His restoration removed more than 10 centimetres; before the restoration it measured , afterwards [...]|$|E
