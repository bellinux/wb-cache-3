The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E

5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{feedback}} {{has also}} been studied in relation to visual extinction. Patients were asked to touch a known target in a darkened room. A light attached to the patient’s hand was sometimes briefly illuminated, {{to provide information about}} where the hand was in relation to the target. In some of these trials, a distracting light was also lit, which induced an extinction event in the patient. Although the patient reported in such cases that he had not seen the indicator light <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> their performance was correspondingly better, similar to the results when visual feedback had been available. Although the patient was not cognizant of having received the information, they were able to correctly act upon it, {{in a manner similar to}} blindsight.|$|E
25|$|Second-year pitcher Hirokazu Sawamura started Game 2 for the Giants, marking {{his first}} Japan Series appearance. In {{the first pitch}} of the night, Sawamura hit Daikan Yoh.

Fighters starter Masaru Takeda took the mound in {{the bottom half of the}} inning and gave up a lead-off, solo home run to outfielder Hisayoshi Chono.
