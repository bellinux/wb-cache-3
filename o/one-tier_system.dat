40|$|A lack of prudent {{corporate}} governance practice {{has been identified}} as a significant contributor to the Asian economic crisis, which hit the region, including Indonesia, in 1997. In response to the crisis aftermath, in 2001, Indonesia implemented an improved set of {{corporate governance}} principles through the establishment of a national committee and corporate governance code. These corporate governance principles have also been incorporated into relevant laws and regulations. With the adoption of corporate governance principles, the remaining issue is the assessment of the effectiveness of corporate governance in Indonesia. On the one hand, reviews by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2004, 2010) have highlighted that Indonesia has mostly incorporated good corporate governance principles into its regulatory framework in the form of law, regulations and sanctions. However, these same commentators point out that corporate governance practices in Indonesia are often distant from what is required by regulation and code, and they recommended that Indonesia improve the effectiveness of its good corporate governance implementation and enforcement. Past studies have mostly focused on the effect of corporate governance on the behaviour of management, company performance, reporting quality and firm value. These studies appear less relevant for developing countries like Indonesia because the findings are inconclusive and are specific to the countries or regions in which the studies are conducted. Further, they are largely based on the conditions and environment of developed countries. Only a handful of studies have evaluated the relationship between corporate governance and the incidence of sanctions in developing countries. Even in these cases, the findings of these studies are subject to the legal, social and political environmental conditions of the economies in which they are conducted, and the findings have little or no relevance for the Indonesian situation. Further, Indonesia follows a civil law legal system and two-tier board system structure that differs from the <b>one-tier</b> <b>systems</b> found in many other countries. As such, in-depth analysis of corporate governance practices under a variety of governance structures and regulatory regimes, including under two-tiered systems such as that of Indonesia, is required...|$|R

This thesis deals with the monistic {{organisational structure}} in Czech legal system.

Such a conception, based on links on the dualistic system, creates many interpretation difficulties. In the beginning of this thesis, I introduce internal organisational structures in the view of broader framework of corporate governance.

40|$|For {{financial}} intermediaries governance {{is particularly important}} due to their special role within {{the economy in the}} aggregation and transfer of financial resources. Recent measures aimed at supporting the economy and banks have attached particular importance to governance practices, as also suggested by the Financial Stability Forum, which includes corporate governance in the Compendium of 12 key principles for sound financial systems. Though coordinated measures at European level have often been suggested, corporate governance systems in Europe are actually quite different. There are three different possible board structures: the <b>one-tier</b> board <b>system,</b> typical of the UK, Spain and many other countries, the vertical two-tier system, typical of Germany and of the Netherlands in the case of large companies and countries in which companies may choose between different models, such as France and Italy. Many large financial groups in Europe, including a number of Italian large banks, have adopted the two-tier board governance structure.

40|$|Board {{diversity}} is important especially in countries which practice a <b>one-tier</b> board <b>system,</b> such as Malaysia. Under the system, board appointments are usually {{controlled by the}} firm’s substantial shareholders, and as a result, directors are chosen based on “the old-boy” network or “people like us”, who are typically middle-aged males and from similar ethnicity {{which could lead to}} “group think”. Board diversity ensures breadth and depth of the board’s judgments. To this end, this study examines board diversity of the top 100 non-financial Malaysian firms, specifically directors’ gender, ethnicity and age and their effects on firm performance. Data are collected from the 2007 annual reports of the sample firms. The evidence indicates the lack of diversity of the Malaysian boards of directors. Results from the multivariate analyses reveal that gender {{diversity is}} negatively associated with Tobin’s q and r OA. Age diversity is found to be negatively related to r OA. Ethnic diversity, on the other hand, is found to be positively associated with r OA. Hence, findings on the effect of board diversity and firm performance are mixed.

The analysis, that is led on a sample of unlisted Italian corporations in 2008, shows that the <b>one-tier</b> <b>system,</b> characterizing firms not necessarily small, with more fragmented ownership structures and more likely to be under control and coordination, highlights lower costs than the traditional and the two-tier systems...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the seasonality in the variability and predictability of Indonesian monsoonal climate, {{dominated by the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, and interpret it in light of theories {{of the development of}} the global ENSO teleconnection which explain the evolution of the response of the tropical ocean atmosphere to ENSO’s perturbation. High predictability during the dry and transition seasons, which coincide with ENSO growth, is expected from the coherent large-scale response to ENSO’s initial perturbation. As the tropical ocean-atmosphere equilibrates to ENSO, and ENSO itself begins to decay, its direct influence diminishes, and regional features associated with the delayed response to ENSO become more prominent. Consistent with this interpretation, in a preliminary observational analysis of station data over Jawa we find that predictability is high during the growth phase of ENSO. We also find that at these regional scales there may be more predictability than previously thought as ENSO decays. Finally, we show that a simple <b>one-tier</b> prediction <b>system,</b> i. e., a system where the evolution of oceanic and atmospheric anomalies is internally consistent, better captures the intrinsic coupled nature of the ENSO teleconnection, compared to a two-tier system where the ocean forces the atmosphere, but does not respond to its feedback...|$|R
40|$|There have been, and {{continue}} to be, serious financial scandals involving accounting irregularities in leading companies. While responses to these occurrences include the introduction of tougher regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), further serious instances have occurred, notably the 2008 subprime mortgage and financial institution meltdown. The existence and persistence of such cases of financial scandals have led many investors, regulators, companies and academics to try to reduce such incidence by improving the effectiveness of corporate governance and increasing awareness of the red flags which could cause accounting scandals. The relationship between individual corporate governance dimensions and corporate governance as a system orientated toward accounting irregularities has been tested. However, empirical measurements and tests are limited and largely based in <b>one-tier</b> board <b>system</b> environments. The outcomes are almost impossible to apply in two-tier board systems, where relationships between governance mechanisms and accounting irregularities are not fully understood.

40|$|Regulation may {{impact on}} {{financial}} risk taking by financial intermediaries {{by way of}} the decision-making process envisaged in the various possible legal structures set forth by the law. In Europe there are three different possible board structures: the <b>one-tier</b> board <b>system,</b> typical of the UK, Spain and many other countries, the vertical two-tier system, typical of Germany and of the Netherlands in the case of large companies and countries in which companies may choose between different models, such as France and Italy.

In the last eighteen months it was chosen in three of the most recent bank mergers in Italy (Intesa-Sanpaolo IMI, Banca Popolare di Verona e Novara-Banca Popolare Italiana, Banche Popolari Unite-Banca Lombarda) and also by Italy’s largest investment bank Mediobanca. It was also suggested for Assicurazioni Generali by international institutional investors. This re-fuelled the debate concerning corporate governance in Italy. The adoption of the vertical dual system was appreciated by observers who pointed out the potential of the two-tier system in relation to the innovative role of the Supervisory Board and, especially, to its function as filter between ownership and management and in the definition of the risk appetite of financial intermediaries. Others alleged that there are no substantially innovative elements in its application compared to the traditional Italian horizontal two-tier system an...|$|R

German corporate law has been enriched by an interesting alternative which meanwhile seems to have gained momentum. This contribution focuses on SEs incorporated by German entrepreneurs and provides an interesting account concerning the use of SEs in Germany in practice, such as Allianz, Fresenius, BASF and Porsche. Has the SE been used to circumvent rigid company law provisions or is it a more flexible and effective tool, perhaps, for company mobility? The practical motives behind setting up this company form are also reflected upon. These include: the facilitation of cross-border mergers; transfer of the registered office; the ‘European’ image; a more flexible form of co-determination in large companies (reduction of the number of supervisory board members); avoidance and freezing of co-determination for medium-sized enterprises; the appeal of the <b>one-tier</b> <b>system</b> and its endangerment by German co-determination; and flat and uniform structures for company groups.

40|$|The {{main reason}} of the {{developmental}} delay of the RF livestock sector {{below the level of}} its inherent potential capacity is a detrimental alteration in methodological procedure of livestock and poultry management, occurring due to shortage of traditional feeds. As a result, a necessity to develop the yearlong production of additional fodders, allowing for balanced feeding throughout the year, arose. The method of hydroponic green fodder (HGF) cultivation meets these requirements. Analysis of HGF production methods and labor saver mechanisms makes possible to claim that existing systems are characterized by high costs and difficulties in fabrication, and require a number of additional mechanical devices to work. In the FSBEI HE “KSMTU”, a <b>one-tier</b> hydroponic <b>system</b> has been developed, fitted with curved (arched) guideways and rigid elastic load-carrying components, where loading of seeds and takeout of grown HGF occur by gravity without additional devices of labour input. Based on analysis performed on design features of the proposed system, it has been established that emergence of parametric resonances in the system under consideration is possible; and the study of tray dynamical stability has been carried out with the aim to prevent them. The motion of the hydroponic system tray under consideration is described by the classical Mathieu equation, including two parameters a and q. The further studies of sets of stable and unstable solutions in the plane of a and q parameters are presented by the Ince-Strutt diagram. As a result of the performed calculations, the diameter of the loadcarrying component was identified (d= 5 mm), which should ensure reliable working capacity and stability of the hydroponic system in whol...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} investigation is to consider the potential opportunities through which corporate governance may be developed to better suit the developing commercial culture within Poland. In order to do this, I formulate the following research questions: ‘What are the weaknesses of the Polish corporate governance system?’, ‘What changes {{should be made to}} corporate governance in Poland?’, and ‘Is a hybrid corporate governance model a choice for Poland?’ The concept of hybridisation is fairly new, and involves combining different approaches to corporate governance, eg it embraces combining elements of the board management and monitoring models. I examine several changes to corporate governance that can be called hybrid. They were implemented in South Africa, Japan, Malaysia, the UK and the US. The main focus, however, is put on Polish corporate governance, which I investigate from the angle of those changes. Doctrinal research is combined with a set of interviews conducted with business practitioners in Poland. Interviewees are asked to express their opinion about corporate governance in Poland. Questions are asked in the context of changes that were made to corporate governance in countries mentioned above. The interviews produce results that overlap with the doctrinal research. Polish companies have a highly consolidated share ownership structure, which has a negative influence on the allocation of power between corporate organs. The supervisory board is an organ through which the controlling shareholders extend their power. Under the Company Code 2000, the supervisory board usually appoints and removes members of the management board, and instructs them in the decision making process. The statutes might give a broader scope of powers to the supervisory board. All this results in various forms of expropriation in companies, such as, for example, stealing of profits by governing bodies, overpaying executives, or installing unqualified family members in managerial positions. In general, interviewees are pleased with the currently binding corporate governance in Poland. The majority of them are pessimistic about implementing such large changes in Poland as, for example, a <b>one-tier</b> board <b>system.</b> A significant number of interviewees propose minor changes to the Polish system of corporate governance. It should be highlighted that several non-managerial interviewees turn out to have more liberal approaches to potential changes to corporate governance in Poland. The research fills a gap in knowledge on hybrid corporate governance, as this issue has hardly been touched by the Polish legal doctrine. It also systematises and develops knowledge on hybrid corporate governance worldwide, and develops knowledge on legal transplant...|$|R
