25|$|There is no {{certainty}} {{about the}} future. Humanity has {{the capability of}} destroying itself, and {{it may very well}} do so. The hope is with the younger generation. They {{will not be able to}} run away from the problems of the world the way our generation did and the next generation has. But <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren</b> will have to deal with the contradictions.|$|E
25|$|When we {{talk about}} a {{permanent}} vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges the people that love her {{when they come to}} see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.|$|E

Come with me then, and you shall be a daughter {{to me and to}} my wife, and this babe shall be <b>our</b> <b>grandchild.</b> For I fear the Gods, and show hospitality to all strangers; knowing that good deeds, like evil ones, always return to those who do them.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2008, Entwistle's parents filed a {{complaint}} of harassment with the British Press Complaints Commission (PCC) against their local newspaper, the Worksop Guardian; the complaint was rejected. His parents continue to insist that their son is innocent of the murders, that Rachel was the true killer {{and that he will}} eventually be cleared and released from prison. Entwistle's mother said after the trial: [...] "The evidence points to Rachel murdering <b>our</b> <b>grandchild</b> and then committing suicide".|$|R

25|$|Artistically, {{the festival}} was a success. ("Something {{has taken place}} at Bayreuth which <b>our</b> <b>grand{{children}}</b> and their children will still remember", wrote Tchaikovsky, attending the Festival as a Russian correspondent.) Financially, however, the festival was a disaster and did not begin to make money until several years later. Wagner abandoned his original plan to hold a second festival the following year, and travelled to London to conduct a series of concerts {{in an attempt to}} make up the deficit. Although the festival was plagued by financial problems in its early years, it survived through state intervention and the continued support of influential Wagnerians, including King Ludwig II of Bavaria.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{appeared}} on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, {{along with the}} former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, [...] "I don't think it's {{good for the country}} to have a former president criticize his successor." [...] Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Barack Obama {{at a meeting of the}} Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: [...] "You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> That's how Americans should view the deal." [...] Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a [...] "strategic blunder", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.|$|E
500|$|In the March 15, 2003 {{episode of}} Saturday Night Live, Tina Fey {{reported}} {{this on the}} satirical Weekend Update: [...] "In a related story, in France, American cheese is now referred to as 'idiot cheese'." [...] The 2006 documentary Freedom Fries: And Other Stupidity We'll Have to Explain to <b>Our</b> <b>Grandchildren</b> directed by Carl Christman took a comedic viewpoint on American consumerism and patriotism. In the episode [...] "Stan Knows Best" [...] of American Dad!, after being asked how his French toast is, the main character Stan remarks: [...] "Smelly and ungrateful! But this American toast is delicious." [...] In the comic strip Doonesbury, the characters Mark Slackmeyer and Zonker Harris criticized the name change in French. Slackmeyer said that, translated, the U.S. liberated France in World War II; and that many French newspaper headlines after 9/11 were [...] "We are all American". At the end, he states that the anti-French were [...] "jingoistic, self-regarding conquer-monkeys!" [...] The French American indie band Freedom Fry chose their name based on the Freedom Fries phenomenon. In 2005, Robert Plant and his band Strange Sensation released the album Mighty ReArranger, which contains the track '"Freedom Fries", an anti-war song whose lyrics contains the words [...] "Freedom fries and burns and scars, the liberator goes too far".|$|E

2500|$|John Leland, {{author of}} Why Kerouac Matters: The Lessons of On the Road (They're Not What You Think), says [...] "We're no longer {{shocked by the}} sex and drugs. The slang is passé and at times corny. Some of the racial sentimentality is appalling" [...] but adds [...] "the tale of passionate {{friendship}} {{and the search for}} revelation are timeless. These are as elusive and precious in our time as in Sal's, and will be when <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren</b> celebrate the book's hundredth anniversary." ...|$|E

The last thing that we want to do is to squander away our hard-earned reserves and leave behind enormous debt for our children and <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> Now since we are sure that this is not going to be the case, we'll proceed with the MRT, and the MRT will usher in a new phase in Singapore's development and bring about a better life for all of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kenny Young, Founder and Trustee of APE, {{explains}} how the project emerged: [...] "The project was sparked {{off by the}} devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The idea came in to do a project with The Buena Vista Social Club to fuse their Latin sounds with Western artists and their familiar popular songs. The project evolved when more environmental disasters struck—the Asian Earthquakes and Hurricane Katrina. But the big picture was climate change. You can call these natural disasters but after all the research and scientific data, we know that we're at least partly to blame {{for some of these}} disasters. Global warming is now in the news daily. If we don't act in the time frame our experts give us, <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren</b> will curse us eternally." ...|$|E

50|$|The Millions More Movement is {{challenging}} {{all of us}} to rise above the things that have kept us divided in the past, by focusing us on the agenda of the Millions More Movement to see how all of us, with all of our varied differences, can come together and direct our energy, not at each other, but at the condition of the reality of the suffering of our people, that we might use all of our skills, gifts and talents to create a better world for ourselves, <b>our</b> children, <b>grandchildren</b> and great grandchildren.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{unveiling}} of a similar monument in Svatove, Luhansk Oblast in 2008, the vice-Mayor of Luhansk, Yevhen Kharin stated, [...] "The war is not over, the war continues. It is cruel and dirty. It has been waged for the souls of <b>our</b> children and <b>grandchildren,</b> whose parents and grandparents lie in graves." ...|$|R

At her antenatal classes, the advice has been to draw up a birth plan: warm baths, movement, partner support, and later, possibly, reluctantly, epidural … But if I do want an epidural, she asks, will it be available even at Christmas?

60|$|We {{hear the}} sweet, low {{voice of the}} mother, singing soft lullabies to her darling, and see the kindly, {{wrinkled}} face of the grandmother as she croons the old ditties to quiet our restless spirits. One generation is linked to another by the everlasting spirit of song; the ballads of the nursery follow us from childhood to old age, and they are readily brought from memory's recesses at any time to amuse our children or <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren.</b>|$|E

Do what you can, I fear there will be little gain from the Royalists. There is something very small about the biggest of them that I have ever fallen in with, unless you count old Hobbes a Royalist.|$|E
50|$|Today, in {{this modern}} period {{when there are}} many kinds of modern {{technology}} makes our young generation is not interesting enough to play a traditional game for example Sepak Tekong. This happens {{because there are many}} modern games which are more simple and easier to use for the young generation. This kind of situation makes the existence of Sepak Tekong start to extinct. We can see with our own eyes that only few children that know and play this game. Another reason why it happens is because when we want to play this game we need a large yard. Then we also know {{that it is difficult to}} find a free large land that we can use to play it because most of land was already changing to be big buildings, houses, and others. Besides the technology factor also becomes another reason why this game starts to extinct and young generations start to forget this game. In this globalization era, most of young generation think that play this game is not cool and they choose to play modern game to make them look like more impressive. We know that playing this traditional game has many advantages for our children, so we should find a way how to make this game exist and our children still can know and play this game forever. When we are doing nothing there are big chance for this game to get lost and finally <b>our</b> <b>grandchild</b> cannot find this game and cannot feel how great this game is.|$|R

60|$|The {{little man}} {{walked up and}} down, and wrung his hands. He cursed Tardrew for not telling him the truth; he cursed himself for letting the cottages go out of his power; he cursed A, B, and C, for taking the said cottages off his hands; he cursed up, he cursed down, he cursed all around, things which {{ought to have been}} cursed, and things which really ought not--for half of the worst sanatory sinners, in this blessed age of ignorance, yclept of {{progress}} and science (how <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren</b> will laugh at the epithets!) are utterly unconscious and guiltless ones.|$|E
6000|$|In Pope's writings, {{whatsoever}} {{he may not}} find, he {{will find}} the very excellences after which our young poets strive in vain, produced by their seeming opposites, which are now despised and discarded; naturalness produced by studious art; sublimity by strict self- restraint; depth by clear simplicity; pathos by easy grace; and a morality infinitely more merciful, {{as well as more}} righteous, than the one now in vogue among the poetasters, by honest faith in God. If he be shocked by certain peculiarities of diction, and by the fondness for perpetual antitheses, let him remember, that what seems strange to our day was natural and habitual in Pope's; and that, in the eyes of <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> Keats's and Shelley's peculiarities will seem as monstrous as Pope's or Johnson's do in ours. But if, misled by the popular contempt for Pope, be should he inclined to answer this advice with a shrug and a smile, we entreat him and all young poets, to consider, line by line, word by word, sound by sound, only those once well-known lines, which many a brave and wise man of fifty years ago would have been unable to read without honourable tears: ...|$|E
6000|$|Is Stevenson {{a classic}}? Well, it {{is a large}} word that. You mean by a classic {{a piece of work}} which passes into the {{permanent}} literature of the country. As a rule, you only know your classics when they are in their graves. Who guessed it of Poe, and who of Borrow? The Roman Catholics only canonize their saints a century after their death. So with our classics. The choice lies with <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> But I can hardly think that healthy boys will ever let Stevenson's books of adventure die, nor do I think that such a short tale as [...] "The Pavilion on the Links" [...] nor so magnificent a parable as [...] "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" [...] will ever cease to be esteemed. How well I remember the eagerness, the delight with which I read those early tales in [...] "Cornhill" [...] away back in the late seventies and early eighties. They were unsigned, after the old unfair fashion, but no man with any sense of prose could fail to know that they were all by the same author. Only years afterwards did I learn who that author was.|$|E
