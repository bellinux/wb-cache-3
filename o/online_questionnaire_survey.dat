40|$|The {{way that}} we build the {{foundations}} of our intellectual capital in management has changed. One example is the steady move in management research {{from the use of}} traditional paper-based <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires</b> to <b>online</b> technology-based formats. This paper considers this shift, particularly focusing {{on the question of whether}} the advantages of <b>online</b> <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires</b> outweigh their potential problems. The historical use of paper-based <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires</b> has produced a large body of literature on both the advantages and disadvantages in their use, which are reviewed here alongside those of <b>online</b> <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> In addition, welI-tested methods are available for increasing survey response rates in paper format, and these should not be thrown out in the quest to utilise online survey methodology.

40|$|International audienceMany {{studies of}} urban soundscapes have been {{performed}} with different aims ranging from auditory perception, to evaluation of noise annoyance, sound design for public places, speech learning, and urban planning, among others. A typical first step of most studies involves collecting soundscape samples, which has one major limitation: it is a selection from the scientist's own representation of the urban soundscape being studied. This paper addresses this issue with a method based on <b>online</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys.</b> In this study, we collected French linguistic data through a large-scale <b>questionnaire</b> <b>survey</b> to find the shared knowledge about soundscapes in three types of urban situations at different times during the day. From a linguistic analysis of the responses, we elaborated profiles {{to be used to}} guide the recording of soundscapes or the selection in a database. These profiles consist of a distribution of different sound sources and human activities that is different for each type of situation.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to make a}} survey about {{teaching}} of elective subject in the 8 th or 9 th grade named electrical engineering. The findings could be helpful to teachers of electrical engineering, engineering and technology, physics, as well as for amateur electrical engineering enthusiasts. It is also aimed at those who seek to make changes in the optional electrical engineering course curriculum which represents a plan of work for teachers of this course. It is therefore an important factor in the implementation and teaching of topics which are written in it and which the teachers must follow. In {{the second part of the}} thesis an inclusion of the optional electrical engineering course in the nine-year elementary school program is presented, after that (and then) the curriculum of this course is presented as well. This contains the definition of the course, the overall goals of the course, the operational goals of the course, special didactic recommendations, and assessment of knowledge, knowledge standards and attachments. The third section presents an <b>online</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>survey,</b> which is designed for teachers of the optional electrical engineering course in elementary schools. With it, we wanted to find out how teachers implement electrical engineering content, how they make use of project work in the classroom, what teaching materials they are using, what they think about the curriculum and sets which are given in it. We wanted to give some suggestions for curriculum changes as well. With help of the <b>online</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>survey</b> responses an analysis was made and also some suggestions to update the curriculum were given. How would this topic link with other areas, or where to do cross-course connections is stated at the end of the chapter. Conclusion of the thesis consists of <b>online</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>survey</b> findings. Teachers want less content and more project work. Some of the content would be replaced by new technologies, actions to save electricity energy for nature conservation purpose would be added and more time could be devoted to solar power plants. ...|$|E

5000|$|Participatory e-planning is {{relatively}} new way to engage citizens in urban planning. E-participation is defined as “technology-mediated interaction between the civil society sphere and the formal politics sphere” According to Horelli and Wallin (2010), “participatory e-planning, similarly to e-participation, {{can be an important}} instrument of e-democracy and e-governance”. Participatory e-planning is also related to engaging the general public to use tools traditionally used by urban planning experts, such as Geographic Information Systems and Planning Support Systems.Participatory e-planning research has focused on incorporating forms of participation with existing governance and urban planning processes. The e-planning research is also limited to needs of current participatory planning. The original investigations used tools like <b>online</b> <b>questionnaires,</b> <b>surveys,</b> and polls to consultant citizens. The feedback from participating citizens is then used or not used by experts and professionals.

Five pwMND and five fMND {{underwent}} semi-structured interviews. 82 % of pwMND and 87 % of fMND use technology every day with iPads and laptops being the devices most commonly used. pwMND used technology to help them continue to participate in everyday activities such as socialising, entertainment and accessing the internet. The internet provided peer support and information about MND but information could be distressing or unreliable. Participants preferred information from professionals and official organisations. Participants were generally supportive of using of technology to access medical care. Barriers to technology, such as lack of digital literacy skills and upper limb dysfunction, and potential solutions were identified. More challenging barriers included language and cognitive difficulties, and the fear of becoming dependent on technology. Addressing the barriers identified in this research could help pwMND access technology.

40|$|Investigating {{factors that}} drive people to cyberbully is critical, so that early {{interventions}} could be administered. Most cyberbullying studies {{were conducted in}} Western countries, {{with only a few}} focusing on Asia. This current study was undertaken to (i) design a cyberbullying behavioral model, and (ii) determine the predictors for intention to cyberbully. The first objective was achieved by integrating Sociocultural-Psychology-Technology factors into a model, aptly named SculPT, which was subsequently used to address the second objective. Additionally, a further analysis was conducted to identify specific influential sub-factors based on SculPT. The methodology involves a mixed method approach, namely focus groups and <b>online</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys.</b> Three hundred and ninety nine respondents between 17 and 36 years old (M = 22. 03, SD = 2. 77) were recruited. Path modeling analysis revealed SculPT to predict approximately 83 % of cyberbullying perpetration. All the predictors were found to have significant direct effects on intention to cyberbully, with Sociocultural having the strongest impact, followed by Technology and Psychology. A more in-depth analysis revealed five sub-factors to significantly predict cyberbullying intentions, namely Social Influence and Social Acceptability (Sociocultural), Availability and Ease of Use (Technology), and Entertainment (Psychology). Results generally concur with previous studies, and comparisons were made where appropriate. We conclude that cyberbullying prevalence still exists among young adults in the country, and with the revelation of factors behind cyberbullying, respective authorities could focus on the identified factors to help mitigate cyberbullying behaviors...|$|R
