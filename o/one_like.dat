5|$|Gliese 581d orbits Gliese 581 at 0.21847 AU, {{approximately}} {{a fifth of}} the distance that the Earth orbits the Sun, though its orbital eccentricity has not been confirmed. There are currently two models for its orbit, a circular <b>one</b> <b>like</b> Earth's, and an eccentric <b>one</b> <b>like</b> Mercury's. These are based on the four planet and six planet model for the Gliese 581 system, respectively. Under the four planet model Gliese 581d would most probably be in a spin-orbit resonance of 2:1, rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star. Therefore, the day on Gliese 581d should approximately be 67 Earth days long.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{the growth of}} Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has {{transformed}} the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial <b>one.</b> <b>Like</b> many other developed countries, the Canadian economy {{is dominated by the}} service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce. However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector, in which the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{voluntary}} system of recruitment proved unable {{to sustain the}} force structure of the AIF, failing to provide sufficient replacements for the heavy casualties it sustained and requiring a number of units to be disbanded {{towards the end of}} the war. In mid-1918 it was decided to allow the men who had enlisted in 1914 to return to Australia for home leave, further exacerbating the manpower shortage experienced by the Australian Corps. Regardless, by the last year of the war the AIF was a long-serving force—even if it was a citizen army and not a professional <b>one</b> <b>like</b> the pre-war British Army—containing 141,557 men with more than two-years service, including, despite the heavy casualties suffered at Gallipoli in 1915 and on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, 14,653 men who had enlisted in 1914. Battle hardened and experienced as a result, this fact partially explains the important role the AIF subsequently played in the final defeat of the German Army in 1918.|$|E

25|$|On this basis, Apatosaurus {{could not}} have had a reptilian {{respiratory}} system, as its tidal volume would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225−184=41liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath. Apatosaurus must therefore have had either a system unknown {{in the modern world}} or <b>one</b> <b>like</b> birds', with multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700liters of space available in a 30-ton Apatosaurus′ chest.|$|E

25|$|After the {{execution}} of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commanderwith Cleitusof the Companion cavalry, Philotas' former position. This dual appointment {{was a way of}} satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: <b>one,</b> <b>like</b> Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander's policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip's older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus. The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.|$|E
