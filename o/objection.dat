50|$|Meeting <b>objections</b> is an {{important}} step for a seller to learn to handle. When the client objects, it usually means they are interested in what has been presented to them.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I defend giving drug {{addicted}} {{persons who are}} {{convicted of a crime}} the choice between an anti-drug vaccine and prison. My claim is that, should such a vaccine be developed, there would be no good moral reasons not to make such an offer. To support this claim I discuss and reject a series of <b>objections</b> to it. The <b>objections</b> are grouped in three different types; <b>objections</b> to paternalism, <b>objections</b> from theories of penal justice and <b>objections</b> from the rights of prisoners. Which <b>objections</b> are voiced depends largely on which view one takes of the nature of addiction. Hence, the <b>objections</b> are discussed both from a liberal and brain disease view of addiction. ...|$|R

The trial judge dismissed the preliminary <b>objection,</b> holding that Order 123 was valid and constitutional, as the order concerned the public interest and was permitted under s 3(1) of the UPA.

5|$|A common neo-creationist <b>objection</b> to {{evolution}} is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific.

5|$|A related <b>objection</b> is that {{evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming {{that evolution}} is not even well-evidenced.

40|$|It {{is common}} for moral {{philosophers}} to reject a moral theory {{on the basis that}} its verdicts are unreasonably demanding—it requires too much of us to be a correct account of our moral obligations. Even though such <b>objections</b> frequently strike us as convincing, they give rise to two challenges: Are demandingness <b>objections</b> really independent of other <b>objections</b> to moral theories? Do standard demandingness <b>objections</b> not presuppose that costs borne by the comfortably off are more important than costs borne by the poor? These challenges have led some writers to question whether there really can be convincing demandingness <b>objections,</b> notwithstanding their strong initial appeal. David Sobel has argued that standard demandingness <b>objections</b> are ‘impotent’, Liam Murphy that they can be ‘dissolved’. In this paper, I aim to vindicate the possibility of demandingness <b>objections</b> by addressing these two challenges...|$|R

40|$|Computationalism – {{the view}} that {{cognition}} is computation – has been controversial from the start. It faces insufficiency <b>objections</b> and <b>objections</b> from neural realization. According to insufficiency <b>objections,</b> computation is insufficient for some cognitive phenomenon X. According to <b>objections</b> from neural realization, biological computations are realized by neural processes, but neural processes have feature Y and having Y is incompatible with being (or realizing) a computation. In this paper, I explain why computationalism has survived these <b>objections.</b> Insufficiency <b>objections</b> are at best partial: for all they establish, computation may be sufficient for cognitive phenomena other than X, {{may be part of}} the explanation for X, or both. <b>Objections</b> from neural realization are based either on a false contrast between feature Y and computation or on an account of computation that is too vague to yield the desired conclusion. To adjudicate the dispute between computationalism and its foes, I will conclude that we need a more precise account of computation...|$|R

Undeterred, Heffron asked New England about its willingness to conduct external studies.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{look at the}} modern state of Act-Consequentialism {{and how it can}} defend against five of the more {{prominent}} <b>objections</b> found in recent literature on the topic. The five <b>objections</b> are as follows: AC’s neglect of special personal relationships, its overdemandingness, its inability to handle expectation effects, its incompatibility with the claims of justice, and its suppression of our moral integrity. Although each of these <b>objections</b> differ significantly from one another, and this leads to separate treatment of each by chapter, all the <b>objections</b> deal on some level with the “derivativeness” of Act-Consequentialist moral thought when analyzing questions of a seemingly intrinsic quality, such as special personal relations or the dictates of justice. 	The approach taken towards the <b>objections</b> is broadly similar. By carefully considering the nature of the well-being that is promoted under AC, and how to most efficiently and organically promote it, the most severe aspects of the <b>objections</b> are softened. In working through the <b>objections</b> it is hoped that a more plausible form of Act-Consequentialism, with a stress on organic and efficient well-being promotion, will emerge...|$|R
