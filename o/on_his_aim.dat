60|$|It was a near thing. Had {{the ridge}} fallen the town must have followed, and history perhaps have been changed. In the old stiff-rank Majuba days {{we should have}} been swept in an hour from the position. But the wily man behind the rock was now to find an equally wily man in front of him. The soldier had at last learned {{something}} of the craft of the hunter. He clung to his shelter, he dwelled <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>aim,</b> he ignored his dressings, he laid aside the eighteenth-century traditions of his pigtailed ancestor, and he hit the Boers harder than they had been hit yet. No return may ever come to us of their losses on that occasion; 80 dead bodies were returned to them from the ridge alone, while the slopes, the dongas, and the river each had its own separate tale. No possible estimate can make it less than three hundred killed and wounded, while many place it at a much higher figure. Our own casualties were very serious and the proportion of dead to wounded unusually high, owing {{to the fact that the}} greater part of the wounds were necessarily of the head. In killed we lost 13 officers, 135 men. In wounded 28 officers, 244 men--a total of 420, Lord Ava, the honoured Son of an honoured father, the fiery Dick-Cunyngham, stalwart Miller-Wallnutt, the brave boy sappers Digby-Jones and Dennis, Adams and Packman of the Light Horse, the chivalrous Lafone--we had to mourn quality as well as numbers. The grim test of the casualty returns shows that it was to the Imperial Light Horse (ten officers down, and the regiment commanded by a junior captain), the Manchesters, the Gordons, the Devons, and the 2nd Rifle Brigade that the honours of the day are due.|$|E

Tests have been conducted in a Boeing 737 simulator to investigate pilot scan behavior during approach and landing for simulated IFR, VFR, motion versus no motion, standard versus advanced displays, and as a function of various runway patterns and symbology. Results of each of these studies are discussed. For example, results indicate that for the IFR approaches a difference in pilot scan strategy was noted for the manual versus coupled (autopilot) conditions. Also, during the final part of the approach when the pilot looks out-of-the-window he fixates <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>aim</b> or impact point on the runway and holds this point until flare initiation...|$|E
40|$|The internationally renowned artist Jimmie Durham, who {{now lives}} in Europe, {{elaborated}} throughout his career a work of contemporary art which is profoundly rooted in his Cherokee culture, while efficiently engaging the art world which gives him an increasingly important place (one of the rare such Amerindian artists). His artwork appears to combine: 1. Contemporary art devises and issues as well as western concepts and viewpoint which he uses and assesses within pieces which are made for a (western) art public, 2. his Cherokee perspective on objects and the world (and 3. his own poetics). The condensation of these two perspectives within art pieces is paradoxical, for they conceive and perceive things and relationships in the world in a priori incompatible ways. Paralleling his work, his own identity or persona is paradoxical, in that on the one hand he defines himself and is considered as an ‘international ’ artist, therefore denying the ethnic label which has been applied to him in his early career and which he had to fight, {{and on the other hand}} he maintains that his only way to be is as a Cherokee. The continuous colonisation and stereotypification of his peoples in the USA, and their impossibility to be seen as themselves, which the artist feels deeply, cast light <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>aim</b> to be a “homeless orphan”. Being truly a Cherokee however does not prevent his being an “international artist”, but rather contributes to it, and vice versa. Key words: contemporary art, Amerindia, multiple identity Jimmie Durham is an internationally renowned artist (plastic arts and installations, performances, videos, poems).
