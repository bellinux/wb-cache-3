40|$|Abstract—Occupational {{exposure}} concentrations are generally assumed to vary in a log-normal manner. However, because {{the mean of}} random samples from a log-normal distribution is not lognormally distributed, it cannot, in theory, deal with {{the changes in the}} distribution of timeweighted average (TWA) values when the averaging time varies. On the other hand, inverse Gaussian distribution, which is similar to a log-normal one, offers the advantage of reproducibility. This paper proposes the application of inverse Gaussian distribution to <b>occupational</b> exposure <b>data.</b> First, inverse Gaussian distribution was compared with the log-normal one. Second, in order to simplify the application, the percentiles of inverse Gaussian distribution with CV = 0. 25 to 4 were calculated. Finally, this distribution was applied to <b>occupational</b> exposure <b>data.</b> © 1997 British Occupational Hygiene Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|An establishment’s average wage, {{computed}} from administrative wage data, {{has been found}} to be related to occupational wages. These occupational wages are a primary outcome variable for the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics survey. Mo-tivated by the fact that nonresponse in this survey is associated with average wage even after accounting for other establishment characteristics, we propose a method that uses the ad-ministrative data for imputing missing occupational wage values due to nonresponse. This imputation is complicated by the structure of the <b>data.</b> Since <b>occupational</b> wage <b>data</b> is collected in the form of counts of employees in predefined wage ranges for each occupation, weighting approaches to deal with nonresponse do not adequately adjust the estimates for certain domains of estimation. To preserve the current data structure, we propose a method to impute each missing establishment’s wage interval count data as an ordered multinomial random variable using a separate survival model for each occupation. Each model incorpo-rates known auxiliary information for each establishment associated with the distribution of the <b>occupational</b> wage <b>data,</b> including geographic and industry characteristics.

Many of these categories combine 'Workers and Dealers' in different commodities, therefore {{it is hard to}} distinguish workers in manufacturing and services. The most common occupation of the time was agriculture. This is more than likely due to the surroundings of Belton; the parish has vast surroundings of arable land still used today. This factor, along with the fact that jobs today may not have existed back then, meant there was a limited amount of professionals to go into. Agriculture unsurprisingly was dominated by males at the time, where as many of the women's occupation were unknown, or in domestic services.|$|E

40|$|Occupational {{safety and}} illness {{surveillance}} {{has made a}} great effort to spread a "safety culture" to all workplaces {{and a great deal}} of progress has been made in finding solutions that guarantee safer working conditions. This paper analyses <b>occupational</b> injury <b>data</b> in order to identify specific risk groups and factors that in turn could be further analyzed to define prevention measures. A technique based on rule induction is put forward as a non-parametric alternative tool for analyzing <b>occupational</b> injury <b>data</b> which specifically uses the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) approach. Application of this technique to relevant work-related injury data collected in Italy has been encouraging. Data referring to 156 cases of injury in the period 2000 – 2002 were analyzed and lead to the factors that most affect work-related injuries being identified. According to the literature, up to the time of writing computer-intensive non-parametric modeling procedures have never been used to analyze occupational injuries. The aim of this paper is to use a real world application to illustrate the advantages and flexibility of applying a typical non-parametric epidemiological tool, such as CART, to an occupational injury study. This application can provide more informative, flexible, and attractive models identifying potential risk areas in support of decision-making in safety management...|$|R
