5|$|An {{important}} omission {{from the}} Atomic Energy of 1946 was {{any mention of}} non-governmental use of nuclear energy, since military applications overshadowed all <b>others</b> <b>at</b> the time. The restrictions of the act related to secrecy, the control of fissile materials, the ownership of patents and the operation of production facilities placed a number of legal roadblocks {{in the way of}} private nuclear power stations.|$|E

Two Welsh clubs play in England's Football League, one in the Premier league, and <b>others</b> <b>at</b> non-league level, whilst the Welsh Football League contains 20 semi-professional clubs. In Northern Ireland, 12 semi-professional clubs play in the IFA Premiership, the second oldest league in the world.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like <b>others</b> <b>at</b> the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946– April 9, 2005) was an American radical {{feminist and}} writer {{best known for}} her {{criticism}} of pornography, which she argued was linked to rape and other forms of violence against women. Her views were widely criticized by liberal feminists and <b>others.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, she maintained a dialogue with political conservatives, and wrote a topically-related book, Right-Wing Women. After suffering abuse from her first husband, she was introduced to radical feminist literature, and began writing Woman Hating. Coming to New York, she became an activist on several issues and a writer, eventually publishing 10 books on feminism.|$|E

5|$|As Grant {{continued}} to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led {{a group to}} meet with Lincoln, Seward, and <b>others</b> <b>at</b> Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as {{he walked through the}} city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{having been}} {{prompted}} by the new international situation and the recent strike wave in Poland, in September 1988 preliminary talks between government representatives and Solidarity leaders ensued in Magdalenka.

In November, Wałęsa debated on national TV Alfred Miodowicz, chief of the official trade unions. The encounter enhanced Wałęsa's image.|$|E

5|$|By 1940, the {{collections}} {{at the library}} had increased to total of about 130,000 and 1,400 serials. Included in {{the collections}} were a variety of rare items, such as {{a page from the}} 1642 printing of the Polychronicon, a 1628 book of poems written in Latin, and a 1769 bible printed by John Baskerville, among <b>others.</b> <b>At</b> that time the building was open from 7:50 am until 10 pm on weekdays, and 2 pm to 5 pm on Sundays. Construction on the new wing of the library started in 1940 and was designed by John V. Bennes, the same architect who designed the original structure. He also designed a matching wing for the other side as well, but that wing was never added.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning <b>others</b> <b>at</b> anchor in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple of days, before they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Willson {{sought the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination. He had {{the backing of}} William O.

After a ruling against a contested delegation to the convention, Willson withdrew his candidacy. Bradley, angered that the party had not united behind his candidate, boycotted the convention. Belknap was handily defeated by Democrat J. C. W. Beckham in the general election.|$|E

5|$|In March 2008, Kirchner {{introduced}} a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, so that rates fluctuated with international prices. This would effectively raise levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This new taxation scheme, proposed by Minister Martín Lousteau, led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, with the aim of forcing the government to back down on new tax system. They were joined on 25 March by thousands of pot-banging demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and the presidential palace. These demonstrations were followed by <b>others</b> <b>at</b> locations across the country that included road blockades and food shortages.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his work, Johnston himself {{has become part of}} the history of volcanic eruptions. With Harry Glicken, he is one of two volcanologists from the United States to die in a volcanic eruption. Glicken was being mentored by Johnston, who relieved Glicken of his watch at the ColdwaterII observation post 13 hours before Mount St. Helens erupted. Glicken died in 1991, eleven years later, when a pyroclastic flow overran him and several <b>others</b> <b>at</b> Mount Unzen in Japan. Despite the deaths of other volcanologists in later eruptions at Mount Unzen and Galeras, prediction methods similar to Johnston's allowed scientists to convince residents of settlements near the Mount Pinatubo volcano to evacuate, preventing thousands of deaths.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1941, just as ASO {{units were}} finding their feet, {{a large number}} of {{personnel}} and aircraft were sent to Malta (and the Desert Air Force) to interdict Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps supplies from Italy to North Africa. Adding to the problem was a shortage of materials and testing facilities. Restocking squadrons and re-equipping them was slow. Not until 1942 did the ASO squadrons get the recognition needed, {{in the wake of the}} German Operation Cerberus. Maintenance was also poor. Each service was to maintain an operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent. In Coastal Command it was 40, and not much higher in <b>others</b> <b>at</b> that point. Greater emphasis was made and serviceability increased.|$|E
