40|$|In {{the present}} work, we study {{tripartite}} quantum steering, which is weaker than genuine tripartite steering, {{in two different}} types of steering scenarios, where two <b>parties</b> <b>perform</b> two qubit projective measurements and the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> <b>performs</b> two black-box dichotomic measurements. We derive steering inequalities by using the structure of the Svetlichny and Mermin Bell-type inequalities for detecting tripartite steering in these two scenarios. It is demonstrated that these steering inequalities also detect genuine tripartite steering when the violation is greater than certain bound. We also consider two biseparability inequalities which detects genuine tripartite entanglement of 2 × 2 × 2 systems in the two steering scenarios that we have considered. It is shown that tripartite steering in the two particular steering scenarios considered implies the presence of genuine tripartite entanglement of 2 × 2 × 2 quantum system, even if the correlation does not exhibit genuine nonlocality or genuine steering.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{provisions}} of the Rotterdam Rules 2009 relating to the <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> in general and the maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> in particular. <b>Performing</b> <b>party</b> means a person who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations under a contract of carriage with respect to the receipt, loading, handling, stowage, carriage, keeping, care, unloading or delivery of the goods, to the extent that such person acts, either directly or indirectly, at the carrier’s request or under the carrier’s supervision or control. Maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> means a <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> who <b>performs</b> or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations during the period between the arrival of goods at the port of loading and their departure from the port of discharge of a ship. The maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> is a new concept introduced by the Rotterdam Rules. The central intention {{of this paper is to}} study and analyse the concept, legal standing and liability of a maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> under the Rotterdam Rules. A comparative analysis of the legal standing of persons analogous to the <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> in conventions regulating the carriage of goods by sea is also provided...|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} arises {{as to why}} any party would want to provide notice of anticipatory breach. The reason is that once the <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> is informed of the anticipatory breach, a duty is then created for the <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> to mitigate damages {{as a result of}} the breach. Another situation where anticipatory repudiation can occur is where a party has reason to believe the other party is not going to perform and requests reasonable assurances that the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> will <b>perform</b> (see UCC 2-609(1)). If such reasonable assurances are not given, it will constitute anticipatory repudiation, for which the <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> has various remedies, including termination. However, anticipatory repudiation only applies to a bilateral executory contract with non-performed duties on both sides. Additionally, the repudiation must be unequivocal.|$|R

In particular, delegating a choice (such as a wage) to the <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> may imbue this party {{with a sense of}} responsibility, leading to improved outcomes for both the delegating entity and the <b>performing</b> <b>party.</b> This strategy can be risky, as some people will still choose to act in a selfish manner, causing adverse consequences for productivity and earnings. An important issue to consider is therefore how to encourage a sense of responsibility in the <b>performing</b> <b>party...</b>|$|R

40|$|In 23 September 2009 the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, shortly the Rotterdam Rules, was signed. Its {{success is}} yet a mystery because only three states have {{ratified}} the Rules. This is mainly {{due to the}} growing liabilities of the carrier side and higher limitation of liability. The new definition maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> has raised questions and criticism, too. The definition of a maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> develops the third party protection to a wider scope than before. This article will enlighten the actual impact of the maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> to the Finnish Maritime Code. How do the Rotterdam Rules change {{the position of a}} non-contractual third party? What changes will the rules on maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> bring to Finnish maritime law as part of the Nordic maritime legislation? There are three existing conventions on carriage of goods by sea. The Hague Rules do not cover the issue of a sub-carrier at all but the Hague-Visby Rules added an article that allows agents and servants of the carrier to enjoy the benefits of the contract of carriage if the shipper claims damages directly from a sub-carrier. The Hamburg Rules took third party protection a bit further by including independent contractors to the sphere of the protection of third parties. The same result can be attained through a so called Himalaya clause that means a contract clause benefitting a third party. The Rotterdam Rules define a maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> as any sub-carrier performing the carrier’s duties in port area or at sea. The definition expands the scope of the sub-carrier’s that can be covered and it would include sea carriers, stevedores, terminal operators, agents, lightering companies, freight forwarders, and all modes of inland carriers when used exclusively in the port area. The Finnish maritime code resembles the Hamburg Rules concerning the protection of third parties; a shipper can bring a direct action against a third party that is protected with the carrier’s defences and limits of liability. Under the Finnish maritime code the third parties can be sea carriers and stevedores. If the Rotterdam Rules were implemented in Finland, the coverage of the maritime code would be clearer and wider...|$|R

5000|$|... ==Repudiation and retraction== A {{party is}} {{considered}} to have repudiated a contract when they evidence a lack of willingness or an inability to perform their contractual obligations. A repudiation of a contract by one party (the repudiating party) will entitle the other party (the aggrieved party) to elect to terminate the contract. This is based on objective intentions i.e. the repudiating party's words or conduct.; This unwillingness or inability to perform a condition must deprive the aggrieved party of substantially {{the whole of the}} benefit that they would have received if the remaining obligations were performed under the contract. When such an event occurs, the <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> to the contract is excused from having to fulfill his or her obligations. However, the repudiation can be retracted by the promising party so long as there has been no material change in the position of the <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> in the interim. A retraction of the repudiation restores the performer's obligation to perform on the contract.|$|R
40|$|The Rotterdam Rules {{were created}} to provide uniformity, modernise the law {{governing}} the international carriage of goods wholly or party by sea and answer the industry’s needs. As international carriage of goods by sea no longer simply involves the shipper and the carrier, the Rotterdam Rules furthermore focus on the other actors involved in the carriage process either by the carrier, such as maritime <b>performing</b> <b>parties,</b> or the shipper such as the consignee. In addition to regulating the rights, obligations and liabilities of the carrier and the shipper, the Rotterdam Rules also contain provisions related to the obligations and liabilities of the maritime <b>performing</b> <b>parties,</b> and the rights, obligations and liabilities of the documentary shipper and the consignee. Therefore the binding character of the new Convention will be broader and if it enters into force the issue of identification will arise regarding to the parties included its scope. For {{the purpose of this}} thesis, the word “parties” refers to the carrier (Article 1 (5)), maritime <b>performing</b> <b>party</b> (Article 1 (7)), shipper/documentary shipper (Articles 1 (8) - 1 (9)) and consignee (Article 1 (11). And, the main objective of this thesis is to analyse how these parties will be identified under the Rotterdam Rules when the applicable law is English law. The Convention includes provisions on the definition of these parties and provides specific provisions related to identification of some of these parties. To shed some light on the issue of identification of the parties, the thesis comprehensively examines these provisions with the aid of applicable law...|$|R
