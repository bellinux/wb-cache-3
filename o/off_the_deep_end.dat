5000|$|Following <b>the</b> {{success of}} <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>Ends</b> lead single [...] "Smells Like Nirvana", Yankovic desired to release [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore" [...] as the album's second single. Yankovic's record label Scotti Brothers reluctantly {{adhered to the}} request, on the {{condition}} that the song's music video be a parody. Released on June 19, 1992, the single received moderate amounts of radio airplay and peaked at number 26 on the singles chart of Canadian magazine The Record. Its airplay levels surprised Yankovic, who had observed that radio stations [...] "usually just go for the parodies." [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore" [...] was also issued as a 12-inch single in the Philippines by Mobile Disco Records - the release featured a dance music remix of the song, the only authorized extended mix of a Yankovic track not to be issued by his label.|$|R
5000|$|IGN writer Spence D. wrote, [...] "Given the {{components}} of the band—live Limp Bizkit is one tight, intense sonic unit that delivers bristling renditions of their catalog—one would hope that they had chosen to go <b>off</b> <b>the</b> musical <b>deep</b> <b>end</b> and deliver an album that dares to explore rather than rehash. Sadly, only a few brief moments of The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) exhibit this kind of much needed direction. Here's to hoping that Part 2 expands on the potential hinted at here." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B rating {{saying that the}} episode {{returned}} to the more typical {{twists and turns of}} the show. [...] "If last week was more about the evolution of character with a little plot momentum thrown in, tonight was just <b>the</b> opposite. Ticking <b>off</b> plot boxes was more the focus ... The reason these plot grinding episodes don’t feel like complete drags is they are all cleverly rooted in character motivations, which keeps the entire affair from careening <b>off</b> into <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> plot churning pool." ...|$|R

500|$|Critical {{response}} to <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was generally positive. Many critics praised not only Yankovic's parodies, {{but also his}} originals. Barry Weber, of Allmusic, wrote, [...] "In addition to re-establishing his satirical craftsmanship, Deep End showcases some of Yankovic's best originals ever; [...] "Trigger Happy," [...] "When I Was Your Age," [...] and [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore" [...] {{prove to be the}} album's greatest songs." [...] Christopher Thelen, of the Daily Vault, wrote, [...] "In fact, it's strange to admit, but the originals on <b>Off</b> <b>The</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> actually are, at times, stronger than the parodies." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide, <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was awarded 3.5 stars out of 5, denoting that the album averaged between good and excellent. Not all reviews were so positive, however. Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne noted that the video for <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> lead single [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] was [...] "an old-fashioned laugh riot", but that half of Yankovic's humor was merely visual, meaning that the songs without videos were not as funny.|$|E
5000|$|... "Why Don't We Just Dance" [...] {{received}} mostly {{positive feedback}} from critics. Juli Thanki of Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs up, describing it as [...] "three minutes of escapist fun, and Turner’s charming {{performance on the}} track is further proof that he’s one of country music’s most talented young A-listers; {{this may not be}} the greatest vocal turn of his career but it’s still a pleasure to listen to." [...] She also drew comparisons to Neal McCoy’s 1995 single [...] "They're Playin' Our Song" [...] and Turner's 2007 single [...] "Firecracker." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave a positive review, describing the song as [...] "a step in the right direction." [...] He thought Turner's performance [...] "recalled the seductive swagger of Conway Twitty" [...] and praised the production for having [...] "an infectious, syncopated rhythm and a catchy melody that shows <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>end</b> of Josh's range quite effectively." [...] Kevin J. Coyne of Country Universe gave the song a B rating. Although he thought that [...] "Turner is charming as ever," [...] he added that [...] "he has a bit of trouble keeping up with the beat as he tosses <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lyrics" [...] and said the song is [...] "about as deep as Vegas rainfall." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2003, after {{recording}} <b>The</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End,</b> Volume 1 (2001) and Volume 2 (2002), Gov't Mule gathered several musicians {{that had}} worked on <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> sessions {{as well as a}} few other friends for a live concert.

500|$|The {{cover for}} <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> parodies the famous cover of Nirvana's album Nevermind, which depicts an infant {{in the deep}} end of a pool chasing after a dollar bill on a hook and line. The <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> cover shows Yankovic in the baby's place {{apparently}} chasing after a doughnut on a string. While the Nirvana cover has a fully nude baby, Yankovic instead wore a bathing suit {{in a way that}} his body position hid it; he later jokingly noted, [...] "I never really anticipated going full-frontal on any of my album covers." [...] The CD, liner notes, and artwork continue the parody of Nirvana's album, borrowing the same blue, wave-light graphics from the printed surface of Nevermind.|$|E
500|$|Yankovic's 1992 album <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End,</b> his best-selling album since 1984's [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic in 3-D, had revived {{his career}} and {{displayed}} his [...] "credibility as an evolving artist" [...] after the commercial failures of his 1986 work Polka Party! and his feature film UHF. By the time production for <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was nearing completion, Yankovic had already written all of the original songs that would be eventually included on Alapalooza. Fearing that his track [...] "I Was Only Kidding" [...] would be outdated {{by the time of}} his next album, he rearranged <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> to allow for the song to be released with the album, saving [...] "Waffle King" [...] for Alapalooza. Nevertheless, [...] "Waffle King" [...] was released as a B-side to Off the Deep Ends [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] single, [...] "just in case there wasn't going to be a next album." [...] He recorded all of the album's original songs, except [...] "Talk Soup" [...] and [...] "Harvey the Wonder Hamster", by the end of 1992 and, in July 1993, recorded all of Alapaloozas remaining tracks, aside from [...] "Livin' In The Fridge". Yankovic eventually decided to title his new album Alapalooza, a reference to the Lollapalooza music festival. The Yankovic dinosaur in the album's booklet was designed by David Peters, who had worked previously with the singer on the [...] "Dare to Be Stupid" [...] video.|$|E
500|$|<b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews and peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard 200. The album also [...] produced one of Yankovic's most famous singles, [...] "Smells Like Nirvana," [...] a parody of Nirvana's major rock hit [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit," [...] which peaked at number thirty-five on the Billboard Hot 100. This song was Yankovic's second-highest charting single, after [...] "Eat It," [...] which was released in 1984. The cover also parodies the cover of Nirvana's album, Nevermind. The original had a naked baby in {{the water with a}} dollar bill cast by a fishing rod, Yankovic's replaced the baby with himself, and the dollar bill by a doughnut. <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was Yankovic's fourth Gold record, and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States. In addition, the album was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1993.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{original}} songs recorded in the 1990 sessions was [...] "Waffle King." [...] However, when Yankovic resumed recording in 1992, he recorded a new original called [...] "I Was Only Kidding." [...] Originally, [...] "Waffle King" [...] was supposed to appear on <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End.</b> However, {{by the time the}} recording of the parodies for this album began, Al had written all {{the original}} songs that were to appear on his next album, Alapalooza. Because he was concerned that one of the jokes from the song [...] "I Was Only Kidding" [...] might be dated by the time his next album would finally be released—a line that references the movie Wayne's World: [...] "I really love you... not!"—Yankovic included [...] "I Was Only Kidding" [...] on <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> in place of [...] "Waffle King". [...] "Waffle King" [...] was instead used as the b-side of the [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] single and would later resurface on Alapalooza.|$|E

These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like The Beach Boys and Jan and Dean.|$|E
