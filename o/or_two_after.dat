5|$|The {{script was}} based on an {{unpublished}} book by I. A. R. Wylie. RKO Pictures bought the book in outline form in April 1941, but encountered casting difficulties and sold the rights to MGM in December 1941 for $50,000. A day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> they had obtained the rights, MGM Vice-President Eddie Mannix realized the source material was political in nature and tried to abandon the project. However, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mannix relented and the production went forward. Once the film went into production at MGM, the book was published by Random House in April 1942.|$|E

25|$|In a rare {{cooperative}} move, a posse under Sheriff Simmons {{combined with}} Mexican Army soldiers succeeded in capturing {{a few of}} the outlaws somewhere near Pirate Island a day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> the shootout. All were put in the jail at Ciudad Juarez, but because President Porfirio Diaz was angered by the American's violation of Mexico's sovereignty, he refused to have the outlaws extradited to the United States. As a result, the outlaws were never prosecuted and they were later released from jail.|$|E
25|$|On 17 August 2015, SCDF {{serviceman}} Pte Shek Salmin Bin Murad {{committed suicide}} at around 1am {{because of an}} alleged abuse of authority by his superior, and problems he was facing at home. Shek alleged that he was given four daysâ€™ detention for being late; and a week <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> {{he was released from}} detention, he was charged for being late again, and was supposed to get charged on Monday 17 August, the date that he committed suicide. SCDF extended condolences.|$|E

25|$|Marlovians (as {{those who}} {{subscribe}} to the theory are usually called) base their argument on supposed anomalies surrounding Marlowe's reported death and on the significant influence which, according to most scholars, Marlowe's works had on those of Shakespeare. They also point out the coincidence that, despite their having been born only two months apart, {{the first time the}} name William Shakespeare is known to have been connected with any literary work whatsoever was with the publication of Venus and Adonis just a week <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> the apparent death of Marlowe.|$|E
25|$|What is {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} fourth phase shifted the dental fricatives to plosives. This shift occurred late enough that unshifted forms {{are to be found}} in the earliest Old High German texts, and thus it can be dated to the 9th or 10th century. This shift spread much further north than the others, eventually reaching all continental West Germanic languages (hence excluding only English). It is therefore not uniquely High German; it is nonetheless often grouped together with the other shifts, as it did spread from the same area. The shift took several centuries to spread north, appearing in Dutch only during the 12th century, and in Frisian and Low German not for another century <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> that.|$|E
25|$|But Charles {{was in no}} case {{to resume}} his {{northern}} march. Fairfax and the New Model, after reducing Bridgwater, had turned back to clear away the Dorsetshire Clubmen and to besiege Sherborne Castle. On the completion of this task, it had been decided to besiege Bristol. On 23 August 1645, while the King's army was still in Huntingdon, and Goring was trying to raise a new army to replace {{the one he had}} lost at Langport and Bridgwater, the city was invested. In these urgent circumstances Charles left Oxford for the west only a day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> he had come in from the Eastern Association raid. Calculating that Rupert could hold out longest, he first moved to the relief of Worcester.|$|E

25|$|Prognosis {{depends on}} the amount of lung that is {{affected}} and on the co-existence of other medical conditions; chronic embolisation to the lung can lead to pulmonary hypertension. After a massive PE, the embolus must be resolved somehow if the patient is to survive. In thrombotic PE, the blood clot may be broken down by fibrinolysis, or it may be organized and recanalized so that a new channel forms through the clot. Blood flow is restored most rapidly in the first day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> a PE. Improvement slows thereafter and some deficits may be permanent. There is controversy over whether small subsegmental PEs need treatment at all and some evidence exists that patients with subsegmental PEs may do well without treatment.|$|E
25|$|For {{its first}} five series shown between 2003 and 2007, which {{corresponded to the}} first five letters of the alphabet, episodes premiered on BBC Four before {{receiving}} their first analogue airing on BBC Two a week later. From 2008 and 2011, the show was moved to BBC One, with an extended-length edition of each episode it broadcast introduced under the title of QI XL, and shown on BBC Two, often a day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> the regular show's broadcast, with Series G and H seeing the regular show broadcast in a pre-watershed slot; the extended edition remained within a watershed slot for its broadcast. Beginning with the I series, the regular show returned to a post-watershed slot on BBC Two. Syndicated episodes of previous series are regularly shown on UKTV G2/Dave.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer, domesticity {{was just}} not in his line. He began his innings usually as one who, {{suffering}} from violent astigmatism, has not only mislaid his glasses, but had in addition a fearful headache. He made a pass <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> the ball had gone past him: he lunged fitfully and missed: he stabbed down just in time at the straight ones: he sliced the rising offside ball over the second slip: he snicked hazily past his leg stump. So, for {{about a quarter of}} an hour, it went on: or, to such an agonized onlooker as I, it seemed to go on. Then suddenly, he would catch a half volley or a long hop such a crack that the bowler, fearful of his own safety, lost all his aggressive intention, and, with it, any idea of length.|$|E

[...] It is not known for certain who produced the film, though its style {{is believed to be}} that of Bray Productions. [...] Filmmaker Buster Keaton rode the back of a clay-animated dinosaur in homage to Gertie in Three Ages(1923).|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Ford {{declined}} offers {{to run for}} either the Senate or the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become Speaker of the House, which he called [...] "the ultimate achievement.

I think I got that ambition within a year <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> I was in the House of Representatives".|$|E
500|$|The {{thematic}} {{material of}} the suite's second movement (which is {{not found in}} the final version of The Oceanides) is closely related to a piece for solo piano called Till trÃ¥naden (To Longing, JS 202). Assuming The Bard was inspired by Finnish poet J. L. Runeberg's poem of the same name (toward the end of his life, Sibelius denied any Runeberg connection), in the first volume of the poet's [...] "Collected Works" [...] the title Till trÃ¥naden appears a page <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> The Bard, supporting the idea of a link between The Bard and the suite.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} three Burger King-themed Xbox Games, {{including}} Sneak King, began when [...] senior executives from Microsoft and Burger King met at Cannes to accept awards for their I Love Bees and Subservient Chicken advertising campaigns. Microsoft and Burger King's executives decided to produce Xbox games {{that would take}} place in Burger King-themed context {{that would not be}} reduced to blatant advertisements. [...] Blitz Games Studios would become involved in the project after Blitz Games Studios' co-founder, Philip Oliver, discussed an interest in producing Xbox Live games with Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade portfolio manager, Ross Erickson. Oliver's interest was hampered by a lack of funding, but Erickson agreed to notify Oliver of any leads on advertisers looking for product placement. A week <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> that, Oliver received a call from Erickson about Burger King's interest in creating three games. In the fall of 2005, Blitz Games entered into talks with Burger King and the development began in February 2006.|$|E
500|$|Isaac Newton {{was born}} (according to the Julian calendar, {{in use in}} England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643) [...] "an hour <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> midnight", at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough {{reportedly}} {{said that he could}} have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: [...] "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them." [...] Newton's mother had three children from her second marriage.|$|E
500|$|The average {{gestation}} period is around 110days, the female {{giving birth to}} a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area) usually away {{from the rest of}} the pride. She will often hunt by herself while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept. The cubs themselves are born blind â€“ their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh [...] at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>after</b> birth and walking around three weeks of age. The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.|$|E
