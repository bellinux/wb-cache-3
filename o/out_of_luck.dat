5|$|NHL {{broadcaster}} Darren Eliot {{attributes the}} {{apparent lack of}} playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, {{the goal is to}} advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular-season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they may be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.|$|E
25|$|Glamorgan Dragons were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> at Bristol, {{as their}} top order {{collapsed}} to the bowling of Carl Greenidge. Only a last-wicket partnership between Robert Croft and Dean Cosker ensured that Glamorgan batted out 20 overs, {{as they were}} 70 for 8 at one point but finished on 128 for 9. However, it was never enough. Croft took two wickets with his off-spin, but Craig Spearman's 39 built the platform as Gloucestershire Steelbacks eased to victory with 17 balls to spare.|$|E
25|$|The Jolly Club {{pairing of}} Carlo Facetti and Martino Finotto, were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> again, when the ETCC landed in Kent for the Brands Hatch 500km. They lost {{the lead of}} the race they had comfortably headed for 100 of a {{scheduled}} 120 laps, when the gear lever broke! Once again the rival Luigi team were on hand to take a well deserved win, this time being driven the Belgian team of Raymond van Hove, Jean Xhenceval and Pierre Dieudonné with the familiar BMW CSL.|$|E
50|$|Shue Fly was {{registered}} with the American Quarter Horse Association (or AQHA) as number 717. She was a chestnut mare, foaled in 1937 and bred by Lloyd Miller of Chamita, New Mexico. She was owned by the Hepler Brothers of Carlsbad, New Mexico {{at the time she}} was registered. Her sire was Cowboy P-12, and she was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Lady <b>Luck</b> by Booger Red by Rancocas, a Thoroughbred. The second dam was an unnamed Thoroughbred mare. Through her sire, she descended from Yellow Jacket and Peter McCue twice. Her dam was a descendant of Iroquois, the first American bred Thoroughbred to win a major race in England. Some early reports had her dam as a mare named Nancy M who was by Jack McCue (a son of Peter McCue) and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Fanny by Jack McCue. However, the Hepler brothers, who raced and then used Shue Fly as a broodmare, investigated her background and {{came to the conclusion that}} she was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Lady <b>Luck.</b>|$|R

50|$|Since childhood, Hirasawa {{showed a}} love for machines, and {{thought of himself as}} an engineer. He was a RC plane enthusiast (at one point in time wanting to be a pilot) and {{repaired}} broken devices (such as radios and flashlights) given to him by his parents. He studied in the electronics department of Honjo Technical High School, where {{he was the first to}} finish the graduation project, the construction <b>of</b> a TV, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sheer <b>luck,</b> since he did not fully understand the circuits. He also had motocross as a hobby for a time.|$|R
25|$|Not once, {{but three}} times, the stumps were plucked by players eager to grab souvenirs of an {{historic}} occasion. First of all, the Australian captain bowled a full toss down the leg side {{and took it}} for granted that Compton would hit the ball to the boundary rails. He forgot that Compton was out of form and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck.</b> Instead of the ball going to the rails, it was missed completely and poor Tallon, with his arms full of stumps and bails, had to drop the lot and take the ball.|$|E
25|$|Lord Sugar told Lewis and Gbemi {{they had}} been lucky to escape the boardroom, and that had {{either one of them}} been brought back instead of Harry M. or Zara they would have been fired over Hannah, as Lewis sold the {{smallest}} number of flowers on either team and contributed little to the task overall, whilst Gbemi was responsible for the team's overly conservative pricing (though Hannah inexplicably tried to claim that Gbemi made the £150 sale rather than Harry M., despite not being present herself and the footage showing otherwise). Lord Sugar saw no reason to fire Zara as she secured two of the three business deals and sold the most flowers, and despite his continued failure to get on with his teammates, Harry M.'s salesmanship allowed him to continue the process, leaving a defenseless Hannah <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck.</b>|$|E

60|$|Siron's inn, that {{excellent}} artists' barrack, was managed upon easy principles. At any {{hour of the}} night, {{when you}} returned from wandering in the forest, {{you went to the}} billiard-room and helped yourself to liquors, or descended to the cellar and returned laden with beer or wine. The Sirons were all locked in slumber; there was none to check your inroads; only at the week's end a computation was made, the gross sum was divided, and a varying share set down to every lodger's name under the rubric: estrats. Upon the more long-suffering the larger tax was levied; and your bill lengthened in a direct proportion to the easiness of your disposition. At any hour of the morning, again, you could get your coffee or cold milk, and set forth into the forest. The doves had perhaps wakened you, fluttering into your chamber; and on the threshold of the inn you were met by the aroma of the forest. Close by were the great aisles, the mossy boulders, the interminable field of forest shadow. There you were free to dream and wander. And at noon, and again at six o'clock, a good meal awaited you on Siron's table. The whole of your accommodation, set aside that varying item of the estrats, cost you five francs a day; your bill was never offered you until you asked it; and if you were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck's</b> way, you might depart for where you pleased and leave it pending.|$|R

"Behind {{the eight}} ball" [...] (or [...] "behind the eight") {{is a common}} idiom meaning to be in trouble, stymied or thwarted, in an awkward {{position}} or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck.</b> It is often assumed that the expression derives from the inability to use the 8 ball in a combination {{in the game of}} eight-ballif the cue ball is directly behind the 8 ball a player has no direct shot route.

500|$|After {{a series}} of serious roles, Mukerji sought to play a part {{that would be a}} [...] "clutter-breaker" [...] for her. She found the role in Kunal Kohli's Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic (2008), a children's film about an angel who comes to Earth to help four troubled kids. In a {{particularly}} scathing review, Khalid Mohamed criticised Mukerji's choice of roles and wrote, [...] "As a Geeta Poppins, she's one-dimensional, either darting full blast smiles or tetchy scowls. Her costumes, too, are uneasy-on-the-eyes". The film had low box office returns and further contributed to a decline in Mukerji's career prospects.

Eventually, out of money and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> he died in Venice from a stroke on 25 October 1913. [...] He was buried on the Isola di San Michele, Venice.|$|E
5000|$|First-order wins, {{based on}} pure run differential, are {{the number of}} {{expected}} wins generated by the [...] "pythagenport" [...] formula (see above). In addition, to further filter <b>out</b> the distortions <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> Sabermetricians can also calculate a team's expected runs scored and allowed via a runs created-type equation (the most accurate at the team level being Base Runs). These formulas result in the team's expected number of runs given their offensive and defensive stats (total singles, doubles, walks, etc.), which helps to eliminate the <b>luck</b> factor <b>of</b> {{the order in which}} the team's hits and walks came within an inning.

2500|$|The {{march of}} the athletes showed a clear example of CCTV proudly {{emphasizing}} a cultural particularity that NBC strained to contain {{within the bounds of}} the acceptable. When the athletes entered the stadium, CCTV [...] pointed out that the banners carrying the names of the countries were written by brush in Chinese and English, reflecting another Chinese cultural particularity. NBC described the arrangement not as an expression of Chinese cultural pride, but in pragmatic terms that covered a sense of dismissiveness. [...] As the athletes began marching into the stadium, Bob Costas explained why Guinea followed Greece: [...] "There is no alphabet here.

2500|$|The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) {{has many}} {{affluent}} members and a famous golf course. A large sized Rotary Club is also located in Tijuana.

Around the country club and Agua Caliente, many developments of wealthy and luxurious gated communities have filled the hillsides, most of which have views similar to Mount Soledad in San Diego or areas of Orange County. Tijuana's most prestigious entertainment center is the Tijuana Country Club golf club, but the Agua Caliente Racetrack {{would be the most}} notable that is open to the general public. Parque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a park located downtown with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns. All public libraries in Tijuana have Internet access; unfortunately, many of the available computers are not in service. Plus a library card is needed to use the computers. To get a library card one must have a government issued id card plus one has to provide two special size photographs. This of course leaves much of the huge immigrant population of Tijuana <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> as many of them don't have identification cards.|$|E
