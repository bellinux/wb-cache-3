5|$|The latter {{three were}} {{canceled}} {{before reaching the}} market. By 1997, {{it was apparent that}} the IA-64 architecture and the compiler were much more difficult to implement than <b>originally</b> <b>thought,</b> and the delivery timeframe of Merced began slipping.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies of}} the DNA of European cattle and {{fragments}} of Eurasian aurochs, in particular female mitochondrial DNA and male Y chromosomes, indicate that the link between modern Limousins and their presumed Eurasian aurochs ancestors {{is more complex than}} <b>originally</b> <b>thought.</b> While many European cattle breeds probably evolved from domesticated Near East ancestors, their genetics were heavily influenced by different herd management approaches across Europe.|$|E
5|$|The idea to {{have the}} episode in flashbacks was <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> up in the color {{screening}} stage of production. This is the first episode directed by Rich Moore. This {{is the first time}} Jebediah Springfield is mentioned, as well as the first time the Simpsons go to church. The announcer of the football game Homer is listening to at church is based on Keith Jackson.|$|E

5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised when he saw the additions, because he <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
5|$|Petrossian <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> {{to write}} a video {{treatment}} about a refugee trying to enter the United States, but knew that the band was going to receive several treatments with the same idea. Instead, he decided to portray {{the plight of the}} refugee from a different angle. The band members unanimously agreed upon Petrossian's treatment. The video deals various themes, including consumerism, fair trade, and sweatshops, and attempts showcase how conventional business models allow for various human rights violations.|$|E

5|$|Some {{time after}} the Permian–Triassic {{extinction}} event (251.4Ma), a fungal spike (<b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> to be an extraordinary abundance of fungal spores in sediments) formed, suggesting that fungi were the dominant life form at this time, representing nearly 100% of the available fossil record for this period. However, the relative proportion of fungal spores relative to spores formed by algal species is difficult to assess, the spike did not appear worldwide, and in many places it did not fall on the Permian–Triassic boundary.|$|E
5|$|The Norfolk Spaniel or Shropshire Spaniel is an extinct {{breed of}} dog {{since the early}} 20th century. It was <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> to have {{originated}} {{from the work of}} one of the Dukes of Norfolk, but this theory was disproven after being in doubt during the later part of the 19th century. The term was used to designate springer type spaniels that were neither Sussex nor Clumber Spaniels, and attempts were made to use it to specify a breed that would later become known as the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|The Platanistidae were <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> to hold {{only one}} species (the South Asian river dolphin), {{but based on}} {{differences}} in skull structure, vertebrae and lipid composition, scientists declared the two populations as separate species in the early 1970s. In 1998, {{the results of these}} studies were questioned and the classification reverted to the pre-1970 consensus. Thus, at present, two subspecies are recognized in the genus Platanista, P. gangetica minor (the Indus river dolphin) and P. g. gangetica (the Ganges river dolphin).|$|E
50|$|OpenUsability was <b>originally</b> a <b>thought</b> that {{developed}} at the KDE developers conference in 2003 after a comparison of usability in Windows XP and KDE 3.1 was performed. Open source projects were able to register with OpenUsability from 2004 onwards.|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} the book was first {{published}} as Ces plaisirs... ("These pleasures") in 1932. In 1941 a substantially revised version was published as Le Pur et l'impur, which was the title Colette <b>originally</b> had <b>thought</b> of for the book.|$|R

5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the blacktip shark were <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> to be the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides) and the spinner shark (C. brevipinna), due to similarities in morphology and behavior. However, this interpretation has not been borne out by studies of mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA, which instead suggest affinity with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). More work is required to fully resolve {{the relationship between the}} blacktip shark and other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|The planets were <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> to {{have formed}} {{in or near}} their current orbits. However, this view {{underwent}} radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Currently, {{it is thought that}} the Solar System looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was much closer to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{felt that}} Brother Justin shares {{patterns}} with certain religious leaders who were often persecuted for their delusional visions. Historical figures like Father Coughlin, Aimee Semple McPherson and Brigham Young served as inspiration, although the writers refrained from re-telling their particular stories. Daniel Knauf <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> of making Brother Justin a Protestant minister, {{but when the}} producers needed to decide on a specific religious affiliation, Knauf contested their plans {{to make him a}} Catholic priest. Knauf, a Catholic himself, settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less clichéd, suspicious or controversial. When asked whether God had influenced him to write the story, Knauf replied no.|$|E
50|$|<b>Originally,</b> critics <b>thought</b> that Sarah Fielding {{wrote the}} work herself, {{based on the}} {{republication}} and revision of the work. However, with recent discovery of Collier's notes and other documents, {{it is certain that}} Collier and Fielding together wrote the work.|$|R
50|$|<b>Originally,</b> Mainframe <b>thought</b> they'd {{follow up}} {{the second season}} with a film.

50|$|However, Japan {{maintains}} {{de facto}} armed forces, {{referred to as}} the Japan Self-Defense Forces, which may have <b>originally</b> been <b>thought</b> of as something akin to what Mahatma Gandhi called the Shanti Sena (soldiers of peace) or a collective security police (peacekeeping) force operating under the United Nations.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Cindy was a {{tropical}} cyclone that briefly reached minimal hurricane {{strength in the}} Gulf of Mexico during July in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and made landfall in Louisiana. It was the third named storm and first hurricane of the season. Cindy was <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> to have been {{a tropical}} storm at peak strength, but was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane in the post-storm analysis. Cindy initially formed on July3 just east of the Yucatán Peninsula in the Caribbean Sea. The depression soon made landfall on the peninsula and weakened before reemerging in the Gulf of Mexico on July4. The storm strengthened as it moved north becoming a hurricane just before making landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, on July5. The storm weakened as it moved overland and became extratropical on July7.|$|E
5|$|In {{a game in}} Boston in January of the 1952–53 season Kennedy {{suffered}} a separated shoulder in a scuffle with Milt Schmidt of the Bruins and underwent surgery. <b>Originally</b> <b>thought</b> lost for the season, Kennedy trained hard {{and was able to}} return to the Leafs in mid-March. However, Toronto still finished out of a playoff position. Despite missing more than two months of the schedule Kennedy still finished second in points on the team. For his efforts Kennedy received the J. P. Bickell Memorial Trophy which is awarded by the Maple Leaf Gardens board of directors as the player most valuable to the Leafs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum appenninum) is a common species at the site, occurring in abundance on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing here, which were <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae). Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E

50|$|Miss X is an {{unidentified}} deceased woman whose {{body was found}} March 18, 1967, near the towns of Bear, Wilmington, and Glasgow, Delaware. <b>Originally,</b> investigators <b>thought</b> she died during (or as the result of) an illegal abortion. A more detailed examination, however, proved she and her unborn child died of septicemia.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Telomere- Creator of Lil` Heroes Handbook. He {{can live}} {{for a very}} long time (currently 273 years old).

5|$|Major {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Port Arthur and Beaumont. Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes in Louisiana were also devastated with the towns of Cameron and Holly Beach completely wiped out. Offshore oil platforms throughout Rita's path also suffered significant damage, though the refineries of Houston, <b>originally</b> <b>thought</b> to be at risk, escaped {{the brunt of the}} storm. Seven people are confirmed dead from Rita's direct effects, and total damage from the storm is estimated at $10billion, almost entirely in Texas and Louisiana. 55-112 indirect deaths have also been reported, most resulting from incidents during the evacuation of Houston when the storm was predicted to strike the city. Many of the indirect deaths were caused by a single bus fire in the mass exodus.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2016, the MassDOT Board {{approved}} {{spending an}} additional $19 million {{to finish the}} station {{by the end of}} September, bringing the total cost of the extension to $93.3 million. The additional cost included replacement for several Pan Am Southern-owned bridges which were in poorer shape than <b>originally</b> <b>thought,</b> and night and weekend work to speed completion. Service to the station had to begin by September 30, or the state risked a revocation of the $59.2 million in federal funds. Limited service began on September 30, 2016, with two weekday round trips; full service began with the schedule change on November 21, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri {{is known}} from one {{specimen}} which might contain a pathology. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae {{at the base}} of the neck. <b>Originally</b> <b>thought</b> to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology. The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology, even though some illustrations of Parasaurolophus restore the skin flap.|$|E
25|$|According to Bronkhorst, this {{indicates}} that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which <b>originally</b> was <b>thought</b> to be sufficient {{for the destruction of}} the arsavas. Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.|$|R
