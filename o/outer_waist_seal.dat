25|$|The Pirelli {{dry suit}} was {{designed}} in the 1930s and used by Italian frogmen during World War II. It became available for recreational divers {{after the war and}} was patented (US Pat. No. 2,570,019) in 1951 for Pirelli by Eugenio Wolk, listed as the inventor. This two piece suit was made from thin and elastic rubber, optionally bonded to a knit fabric reinforcement liner except at the sealing areas at the neck, wrists and <b>waist.</b> The <b>waist</b> <b>seal</b> was achieved by overlapping the jacket and trousers and folding the overlap down more than once before securing it in place over a profiled heavy rubber waistband using an elastic belt which pulls the rolled part into a groove in the waistband. Neck and cuff seals were the forerunners of the latex seals still used for this application. The patent claims this to be the first application of thin and flexible form-fitting rubber for the manufacture of dry suits, and also patents the <b>waist</b> <b>seal</b> system. The suits were intended to be worn over woolen underwear for thermal protection. There was no facility to inject air during a dive. These suits were available in four sizes and five styles, three of which were full length two-piece suits with integral boots, one of which was lined with cloth, and two of which had an optional integral hood on the jacket. The other two models were a two-piece with short sleeves and legs, and a one piece short trouser unit with suspenders which sealed on the chest and thighs.|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from an experiment {{to determine whether}} lower body negative pressure (LBNP) produces a footward force equal to {{the product of the}} pressure differential and body cross-sectional area at the <b>waist</b> <b>seal.</b> Twelve male volunteers were sealed at the superior iliac crest in upright and supine LBNP chambers. Each subject was exposed to 10 mm Hg increments of LBNP up to 70 mm HG (standing) or to 50 - 100 mm Hg (supine), depending upon individual tolerance. Static reaction force was measured at each LBNP level for about 1 - 2 min. The forces measured during LBNP agreed well with forces calculated from the cross-sectional areas of the subjects' waists. It is inferred from these results that exercise in microgravity against 100 mm Hg LBNP could produce static and inertial forces similar in magnitude to those occurring on earth. It is concluded that this gravity-independent technique can help maintain the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems of crew members during prolonged exposure to microgravity...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{exposure}} of the entire vasculature to the ath-erogenic effects of systemic risk factors, atherosclerotic plaques develop at specific regions of the arterial tree where disturbed and low flow occurs and progress focally and eccen-trically in an independent manner. 1, 2 Endothelial shear stress (ESS), the tangential stress generated by the friction of the flowing blood on the endothelial surface of the vessel wall, regulates much of endothelial function, and low ESS [<≈ 1. 0 Pascal (Pa) ] activates a myriad of intracellular pathways, leading to endothelial dysfunction, lipoprotein accumulation, and inflammation. 3 Autopsy studies and animal models have demonstrated that atherosclerotic lesions with vulnerable features preferentially develop in areas with low ESS, such as the inner curvature of coronary arteries, the <b>outer</b> <b>waist</b> of a coronary bifurcation, and downstream from a luminal obstruction. 4 – 6 In contrast, normal ESS (≈ 1 – 2. 5 Pa), occurrin...|$|R
50|$|For a {{few years}} after C.E. Heinke & Co. Ltd. was taken over by Siebe-Gorman and Company in 1961, dry suits were marketed under the Siebe-Heinke label. The Siebe-Heinke Dip Suit for {{recreational}} diving, swimming, yachting and fishing, was advertised in Lillywhites’ 1964 underwater catalogue.

40|$|Bone, muscular strength, aerobic capacity, {{and normal}} fluid {{pressure}} gradients {{within the body}} are lost during bed rest and spaceflight. Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) exercise may create musculoskeletal and cardiovascular strains equal to a greater than those experienced on Earth and elucidate some of the mechanisms for maintaining bone integrity. LBNP exercise simulates gravity during supine posture by using negative pressure to pull subjects inward against a treadmill generating footward forces and increasing transmural pressures. Footward forces are generated which equal {{the product of the}} pressure differential and the cross-sectional area of the LBNP <b>waist</b> <b>seal.</b> Subjects lie supine within the chamber with their legs suspended from one another via cuffs, bungee cords, and pulleys, such that each leg acts as a counterweight to the other leg during the gait cycle. The subjects then walk or run on a treadmill which is positioned vertically within the chamber. Supine orientation allows only footward force production due to the negative pressure within the chamber. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the kinematics, kinetics, and metabolic rate during supine walking and slow running on a vertical treadmill within LBNP are similar to those on a treadmill in 1 -g environment in an upright posture...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare footward forces, gait kinematics, and muscle {{activation}} patterns (EMG) generated during supine treadmill exercise against LBNP with the same parameters during supine bungee resistance exercise and upright treadmill exercise. We hypothesize that the three conditions will be similar. These results will help validate treadmill exercise during LBNP as a viable technique to simulate gravity during space flight. We are evaluating LBNP as a means to load the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems without gravity. Such loading should help prevent physiologic deconditioning during space flight. The best ground-based simulation of LBNP treadmill exercise in microgravity is supine LBNP treadmill exercise on Earth because the supine footward force vector is neither directed nor supplemented by Earth's gravity. Previous results from HR- 95 ("Dynamics of footward force and leg intramuscular pressure during exercise against supine LBNP and upright standing in normal gravity") indicate that supine plantar-/dorsiflexion exercise in LBNP at 100 mm Hg produces similar ground reaction forces, musculoskeletal stress, and VO 2 to those during upright exercise against Earth's gravity. However, elevations of leg volume and heart rate indicate that cardiovascular stress during 100 mm Hg LBNP exercise exceeds that during 1 g exercise. Therefore, the need arose to reduce the cardiovascular stress of LBNP, while maintaining LBNP-induced reaction forces. To this end, we determined that mild plantar-/dorsiflexion exercise during LBNP significantly improves tolerance to LBNP via musculovenous pumping and sympathoexcitation; more intense exercise such as walking and running may further improve LBNP tolerance. In addition, two methodological advances have permited us to simulate upright 1 g exercise better with supine LBNP exercise. First, a newly-designed <b>waist</b> <b>seal</b> allows decreased levels of LBNP (50 - 60 mm Hg) to produce a footward force equaling one body weigh...|$|R
40|$|The {{engineering}} model {{designed for the}} spacelab is a collapsible, accordion-like cylinder (length expanded: 156 cm, diameter: 64 cm, weight: approximately 42 kg) comprising five rings joined by four sets of struts, covered by Kapton.

2500|$|Modern {{dry suits}} have a {{watertight}} zipper for entry and exit. The original bronze-toothed version {{was developed by}} NASA to hold air inside space suits. This complex and special zipper {{is one of the}} most expensive parts of the suit. Heavy duty. medium and lightweight versions are made. A later design uses injection moulded plastic teeth, and these are lighter, more flexible and less costly. The zipper is commonly installed across the back of the shoulders, since this placement compromises overall flexibility the least — but this design normally means the wearer requires assistance to close and open the zipper. The other common zipper placement is diagonally across the torso, which allows self-donning. Other designs place the zipper straight down the middle of the back (early Poseidon Unisuit), Up one side of the front, around the back of the neck and partway back down the front (later model Poseidon Unisuit) or on a wide tubular chest entry opening which is folded down and clipped round the <b>waist</b> after <b>sealing</b> the zip (some Typhoon suits). The waterproof-zipper is stiff, and cannot stretch at all, which can make it difficult for a user to get into and out of the suit. Dry suits may also be fitted with an extra waterproof [...] "fly", [...] "relief" [...] or [...] "convenience" [...] zipper to let the user urinate when out of the water when the suit is worn for long periods.|$|R
