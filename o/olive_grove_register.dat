40|$|Southern Portugal is {{experiencing}} a rapid change in land use due {{to the spread of}} intensive farming systems, namely olive production systems, which can cause strong negative environmental impacts and affect the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. This study aimed to identify the main environmental disturbances related with <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> intensification on Mediterranean climate streams in southern Portugal, and to evaluate their effects on fish assemblage structure and integrity. Twenty six stream sites within the direct influence of traditional, intensive, and hyper-intensive <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> were sampled. Human-induced disturbances were analyzed along the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> intensity gradient. The integrity of fish assemblages was evaluated by comparison with an independent set of least disturbed reference sites, considering metrics and guilds, based on multivariate analyses. Along the gradient of <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> intensification, the study observed overall increases in human disturbance variables and physicochemical parameters, especially organic/nutrient enrichment, sediment load, and riparian degradation. Animal load measured the impact of livestock production. This variable showed an opposite pattern, since traditional <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> are often combined with high livestock production and are used as grazing pasture by the cattle, unlike more intensive <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> Stream sites influenced by <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> were dominated by non-native and tolerant fish species, while reference sites presented higher fish richness, density and were mainly occupied by native and intolerant species. Fish assemblage structure in <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> sites was significantly different from the reference set, although significant differences between <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> types were not observed. Bray–Curtis similarities between <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> sites and references showed a decreasing trend in fish assemblage integrity along the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> intensification gradient. <b>Olive</b> production, even in traditional groves, led to multiple in-stream disturbances, whose cumulative effects promoted the loss of biota integrity. The impacts of low intensity traditional <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> on aquatic ecosystems can be much greater when they are coupled with livestock production. This paper recommends best practices to reduce negative impacts of olive production on streams, contributing to guide policy decision-makers in agricultural and water management...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the groups}} of {{beneficial}} arthropods present in the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> canopy are hoverflies, hymenopteran parasitoids and bees. In this research we test {{the hypothesis that the}} abundance of these groups in <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> increases with increasing landscape complexity. In spring 2015 and 2016 we determined the abundance of the beneficial insect groups in 15 <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> by identification of insects captured on 4 yellow sticky traps in each <b>olive</b> <b>grove.</b> Indices of landscape structure were calculated in circular areas with radii ranging from 250 to 1500 m around the 15 <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> selected. Preliminary results indicate that in both sampling dates, the abundance of hoverflies was negatively correlated with the patch size of the <b>olive</b> <b>grove,</b> but positively correlated with the total area of scrublands and oak forests and with the diversity index of land uses. The abundance of hymenopteran parasitoids and bees was also positively correlated with the total area of scrublands with oak, in both years, but negatively correlated with the patch size of <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> in the case of bees. Not all these relationships were significant at all radii and years analysed. These results indicate that intermingling of spontaneous vegetation with <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> favours the presence of beneficial arthropods...|$|R
40|$|Olive growers need {{relevant}} information about economic justifications of their {{investments in the}} construction of new <b>olive</b> <b>groves,</b> and about economic effects of olive growing. In that context, the purpose of the research is the analysis of an investment in <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> establishment and of the economic indicators of production of olives in full growth. The purpose is to establish the economic justification of investments in the <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> establishment, and to establish the economic effectiveness of olive growing. In the course of work, the method of simulation modeling was applied. For the purpose of the research, a deterministic simulation model was constructed, consisting of a sub-model of <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> establishment, and a sub-model of olive growing. Total investment value of 1 hectare of <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> establishment amounts to 65, 500 kn. Profit evaluation indicates that investment of 1 hectare of <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> establishment is economically justifiable. An <b>olive</b> <b>grove,</b> 1 hectare large, in one year of full yield, makes a profit in the amount of 34, 751 kn, and the olive grower has to evaluate if the economic results satisfy his expectations for the work he put in...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{breeding}} birds {{as indicators of}} sustainable management in <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> was investigated. The data revealed significantly higher alpha diversity in organic and abandoned <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> and maquis than in conventional ones. The highest beta diversity {{was found between the}} following pairs: organic olive groves-maquis, and abandoned olive groves-maquis. Breeding bird diversity, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Coleoptera densities positively influenced bird species richness in organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> and maquis, and additionally, manure application positively influenced bird species richness in organic ones. Bird species richness was negatively influenced by pesticide and inorganic fertilizer application in conventional ones. Moreover, isopod density was unimportant in explaining breeding bird richness in organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> Finally, our study suggests a difference in bird communities of various <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> as a result of different management and practices, and concludes that birds might serve as indicators of overall <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> health. Furthermore, these findings {{could be used as a}} tool for prediction {{of breeding}} bird species richness probability in different <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> management systems and maquis. Finally, the results of the present study may contribute to highlighting some aspects of the effect of different farming practices on the dynamics of Mediterranean bird communities...|$|R

40|$|Earthworms {{can be used}} as bioindicators of soil {{management}} as they are easy to classify and very sensitive to changes of both physical and chemical soil parameters. The aim of this work was to study relations between earthworm species (richness and density) and the physicochemical soil properties such as pH, organic matter, soil moisture, and texture (percentages of sand, silt, and clay) under different farming practices (organic and conventional) in <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> in central Greece. The data revealed significantly greater values of earthworm species richness, density, soil organic matter, and moisture in the organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> than in the conventional ones. Furthermore, total earthworm density was positively correlated to earthworm Shannon diversity index, soil moisture, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> However, total earthworm density was negatively correlated to soil pH and silt in conventional <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> It can be concluded that species richness and density of earthworms in <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> can be considered as sensitive indicators of management practices...|$|R
40|$|Serpa and Moura region, in the South of Portugal, have {{important}} agricultural potential {{as well as}} important agricultural resources that {{can and should be}} used and developed, in spite of economic and social depression signs reinforced by demographic difficulties that can lead to desertification in some areas. The main farms' Technical-Economic Orientation (TEO) is olives production, to produce olive oil, since this region has excellent conditions for the activity development. Some mobilizations traditionally made in <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> lead to soil erosion and make the farm vehicles mobility much more difficult, namely those used in cultural operations. The maintenance of a soil cover in the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> space between lines is good, both because it favours the vehicles mobility, it promotes the rain water infiltration and, last but not the least, the soil airing. The objective of this work has been to make a socio-economic characterization of a zone of Serpa and Moura Councils in which a project of soil covers under olive trees is being developed. At the same time cultural accounts were made for the different situations under the study - irrigated <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with spontaneous vegetation in the space between lines, irrigated <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with seeded vegetation in the space between lines, irrigated <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with herbicide application in the space between lines, dry <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with spontaneous vegetation in the space between lines, dry <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with seeded vegetation in the space between lines and dry <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> with herbicide application in the space between lines. The survey shows farmers in this area are younger then usual, although they don't have a high level of formal education, general or specific in agriculture. Farm areas are usually high, which can be determinant for the proposed technology adoption. Installation and operation costs for the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> are higher on the irrigated <b>olive</b> <b>grove,</b> but of course expected productions are also higher. For this production technology profits coming from olives production are higher then the operation costs. However, in the dry <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> technology costs are always higher then the profits, being profitability only due to subsidies. The importance of soil cover maintenance, in this region, beside the benefits in what concerns erosion, infiltration and soil airing, is also due to its capacity to minimize the risk farmer's face...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in Magnesia Prefecture, central Greece, during the period May-June 2007. It aimed at the comparison between conventional and certified organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> with regard to olive and olive oil production, diversity of plants (herbaceous and woody) and diversity and abundance of avifauna. Correlations between variables within herbaceous plants (linear regression) and woody plants (Principal Component Analysis), and the role of integration time of <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> to the organic system were investigated. Also, finding easily measurable parameters indicating high bird diversity levels within organic and conventional management systems was a main target of the study. According to our findings, neither edible olive yield nor olive oil yield showed significant differences between conventional and certified organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> There is an increasing trend for alpha and beta diversity of herbaceous plant species, woody plant beta diversity, density and cover of woody plants, and density of breeding birds in certified organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> (10 years) in comparison with conventional ones. The effect of time since the adoption of organic procedures is very important and produces benefits for the biodiversity. In the total <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> 15 insectivorous, six granivorous and three insectivorous/granivorous birds species were recorded. Nine bird species distinguished by Ward's hierarchical clustering were identified as typical (indicator value, IndVal> 50 %) of specific farming systems. Among them, the Eurasian jay, associated with the 10 -year certified organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves,</b> and the common cuckoo, Orphean warbler and Red-backed shrike, associated with the 6 -year certified organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves,</b> should be regarded as characteristic species (IndVal> 70 %). Conclusively, organic farming favors some aspects of diversity of herbaceous and woody plants of <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> ecosystems. On the contrary, similar effects on breeding bird diversity and density were not clearly recorded. However, breeding bird density proved a good indicator of their richness...|$|R

40|$|In {{southern}} Italy, {{the olive}} oil sector {{is an important part}} of the primary sector and its development requires support from research to ensure its sustainability. This work proposes the first step for set up a decision support system (DSS) for establishing mechanisation in agricultural operations for different <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> To contribute to this goal researches have been carried out to test the ability of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) to map <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> and their agronomic characteristics. In detail, this study aimed to classify <b>olives</b> <b>grove</b> areas in terms of agronomic suitability and detect horticultural characteristics of <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> in order to develop a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method for managing mechanical harvesting and pruning. The detection and interpretation of horticultural traits was conducted on two different <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> areas of Sicily.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} two predominant management types (mowing vs. tilling) in <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> on plant diversity, we have surveyed <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> at ten localities in the surroundings of Šibenik (Dalmatia, Croatia). Among the surveyed groves, 12 were managed by tilling and 11 were managed by mowing. Altogether 323 taxa from 207 genera and 58 families were recorded. The families with the highest numbers of taxa were Fabaceae, Poaceae, Cichoriaceae and Asteraceae. Mowed <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> were significantly richer in flora (280 taxa) {{in relation to the}} tilled ones (181 taxa), with 138 taxa in common to the both management types. An analysis of the life forms showed the domination of therophytes (54. 18 %) and the phytogeographycal analysis showed that the most frequent floral element was Mediterranean (46. 13 %). Mowed <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> almost exclusively contained endemic and endangered species while the invasive alien plant taxa were recorded mostly in the tilled <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> Mowing seems as much better management practice {{from the standpoint of the}} nature conservation.
