5|$|As it happened, the Japanese commander, Major General Masutaro Nakai of the 20th Division, {{had ordered}} a {{sizeable}} force {{to move to}} Kaiapit {{under the command of}} Major Yonekura Tsuneo. Yonekura's force included the 9th and 10th Companies of the 78th Infantry Regiment, the 5th Company of the 80th Infantry Regiment, a heavy machine-gun section, a signals section and an engineer company—a total of about 500 troops. From Kaiapit it was to threaten the Allied position at Nadzab, creating a diversion to allow the Japanese garrison at Lae time to escape. The main body left Yokopi in the Finisterre Range on 6 September but was delayed by heavy rains that forced the troops to move, soaking wet, through muddy water for much of the way. Only the advance party of this force had reached Kaiapit by 18 September, by which time Lae had already fallen. Yonekura's main body, moving by night to avoid being sighted by Allied aircraft, was by this time no further from Kaiapit than King, but had two rivers to cross. Since both were heading for the same <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> clash was inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Operation Summer '95 {{started at}} 0500 on 25 July. The HV 7th Guards Brigade {{advanced}} north-west along the LivnoBosansko Grahovo road towards {{the town of}} Bosansko Grahovothe offensive's main <b>objective.</b> <b>A</b> composite company drawn from the HV 114th Infantry Brigade attacked VRS positions on the right flank of the advance. The 7th Guards Brigade managed to move forward by about , but had to suspend its effort as the 114th Brigade company could not defeat the VRS' entrenched defences at Marino Brdo to cover the 7th Brigade's right flank. The VRS defences were well prepared all along the front line attacked by the HV and the HVO. The Bosansko Grahovo zone was particularly well prepared for defencefortifications, shelters and covered trenches were built to establish defence in depth, with obstacles, including minefields, in between them.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the Canadian Corps was {{to take control of}} the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The village of Thélus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest of the ridge, once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient against considerable German resistance. The final <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> fortified knoll located outside the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line.|$|E

5|$|To {{the south}} of the Canadian Corps, diversionary {{activities}} by X Corps involved formations from the British 5th and 7th Divisions. The 7th Division commander only refrained from protesting against the attack, because it was intended to pin German reserves and stop them moving north against the main attack. The 7th Division attacked Gheluvelt with the 20th and 91st Brigades, while the 5th Division attacked Polderhoek and the Scherriabeek valley immediately to the north with the 13th Brigade. On the 91st Brigade's front, the battalion on the right advanced rapidly, protected by a rise which hid them from most of the German machine-gunners nearer to the Menin road. They attacked their <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> fortified mound near Hamp Farm, and overwhelmed the garrison stationed there after hand-to-hand fighting. The other two battalions of the brigade suffered far worse, having to advance along the forward slope of the spur running south-east from Tower Hamlets ridge. The area was dominated by a group of pillboxes at Lewis House which held several machine-guns. The centre battalion could not keep pace with the barrage and its advance was stopped well short of Lewis House. Troops began to converge on the area near Lewis House, which caused crowding and gaps in the line. An attempt to outflank the pillboxes failed and the brigade fell back to its assembly positions.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Rowlett's Station (also {{known as}} Battle of Woodsonville or Green River) was a land {{battle in the}} American Civil War, fought at the {{railroad}} whistle-stop of Rowlett's in Hart County, Kentucky, on December 17, 1861.

While studying at the University of Toronto, King also contributed to the campus newspaper The Varsity.|$|E
25|$|In rest camp the {{battalion}} {{was reinforced by}} a draft of nearly 200 troops from the East Surrey Regiment and returning wounded men of the 7th. It {{then returned to the}} High Wood sector on 5 October for another general attack, this time with little preparation. Thebattalion was to attack through the 1/8th Londons (Post Office Rifles) and seize the <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> mound known as the Butte de Warlencourt. At first casualties were light, but after some 300 yards the leading waves reached the skyline and were virtually wiped out by machine-gun fire. The survivors dug in as darkness fell, with the nearest supports some 600 yards away. After a day under shellfire {{the battalion}} was withdrawn the following night. Casualties had been another 300 officers and men. This action won the regiment the battle honour Le Transloy.|$|E

25|$|On 21 August, 1/4th Battalion {{relieved}} 11th Battalion Cheshire Regiment in {{the line}} south of the Leipzig Redoubt, preparatory to {{an assault on the}} redoubt. Just before 18:00, B and C Companies moved forward, and under cover of an artillery bombardment that commenced at 18:00 they launched their attack. They reached the German wire, and at 18:05, when the barrage lifted to the German second line, they occupied the first line against little opposition. At 18:10 the barrage lifted to the third line, allowing the Glosters to take the second line. Having thus reached their <b>objective,</b> <b>A</b> Company followed up and reinforced them. At 20:00 the next day the Germans began shelling the 1/4th positions, and from 22:00 they launched three separate counter-attacks, all of them repulsed.

25|$|In April 1944, Stilwell {{launched}} his final offensive {{to capture the}} Burmese city of Myitkyina. In support of this objective, the Marauders were ordered to undertake a long flanking maneuver towards the town, involving a grueling 65-mile jungle march. Having been deployed since February in combat operations in the jungles of Burma, the Marauders were seriously depleted and suffering from both combat losses and disease, and lost additional men while {{en route to the}} <b>objective.</b> <b>A</b> particularly devastating scourge was a severe outbreak of amoebic dysentery, which erupted shortly after the Marauders linked up with the Chinese Army in India, called X Force. By this time, the men of the Marauders had openly begun to suspect Stilwell's commitment to their welfare, and no effort to hide their displeasure with their hard-driving commander. Despite their sacrifices, Stilwell appeared unconcerned about their losses, and had rejected repeated requests for medals for individual acts of heroism. Initial promises of a rest and rotation were ignored; the Marauders were not even air-dropped replacement uniforms or mail until late April.|$|E
25|$|With an {{authorised}} {{strength of}} 1,023 men, the 40th Battalion {{arrived at the}} front in December, but its first major battle did not come until June 1917 when it fought in the Battle of Messines. The introduction to war proved costly, with the battalion losing over 350 men killed or wounded. Its next major effort came four months later during the Battle of Broodseinde Ridge on 4 October, {{where one of the}} battalion's soldiers, Sergeant Lewis McGee of 'B' Company, performed the deeds for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. As McGee's platoon advanced, it began taking heavy machine gun fire from a German pillbox. Alone, McGee ran over open ground and, with only his service revolver, he killed the machine-gun's crew and captured the remainder of the pillbox's garrison. Later, he returned to his platoon and gathered a group of men to take another machine gun post; the battalion was subsequently able to take its <b>objective.</b> <b>A</b> week later, the battalion took part in a follow-up attack as the Battle of Passchendaele continued. Advancing across muddy ground, the battalion came under machine gun fire from their front and flanks, and the attack ultimately failed due to the weather. Combined with their losses at Broodseinde Ridge, the 40th Battalion suffered 248 casualties during the fighting around Passchendaele, including McGee who was killed in action trying to silence a machine-gun post during the failed follow-up attack.|$|E

Just when the M113 crews closed in on their <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> Viet Cong squad leader and his men jumped out of their foxholes and tossed grenades at the lead formation of the attack force.

500|$|On the {{northern}} flank, the 3rd Canadian Division was again met with exceptional German resistance. The 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade managed to capture Source Farm and later Vapour Farm at the corps boundary, {{just short of}} the objective line. However, the brigade had difficulty getting through the swampy ground in the Woodland Plantation, resulting in a division in the line. The 58th Division and 63rd (Royal Naval) Division infantry were caught by German artillery fire at their jumping-off line and made only slight progress in deep mud against German machine-gun fire and were unable to reach their rendezvous objectives, leaving the Canadian troops at Source Farm and Vapour Farm in precarious and largely unsupported positions. Two companies later advanced through the Canadian sector to capture Source Trench but were only able to reinforce the Canadian outpost at Source Farm and form a defensive flank to Vapour Farm. In the centre of the assault was the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Advancing between Ravebeek creek and the roadway to Meetcheele, one section of the brigade captured its intermediate <b>objective,</b> <b>a</b> pillbox known as Duck Lodge, by [...] To the west of the roadway and Meetcheele, the advance captured Furst Farm, albeit with heavy casualties. Later in the afternoon, the brigade succeeded in overcoming a number of pillboxes and captured the crossroads at Meetcheele.

Following the 33rd, the division passed through the village of Forest, Croix-Caluyau and Englefontaine, before halting {{in front of the}} Forêt de Mormal. Here the division paused until 4 November and was subjected to artillery and aerial bombardments as well as minor skirmishes with German infantry. At 06:15 on 4 November, over a [...] front, the 115th Brigade pushed forward subjected to a heavy German artillery bombardment. The brigade cleared fenced-off orchards before pushing [...] into the forest against stiff resistance. They were followed by the 113th Brigade, who then leapfrogged ahead to achieve the division's second objective inside the forest. A lull in the fighting followed as the artillery was moved forward.
