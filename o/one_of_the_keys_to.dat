Both teams had 1,000+ yard rushers (Zach Line for SMU, Robbie Rouse for Fresno State), but SMU's rush defense (24th in FBS) was better than Fresno State's (73rd in FBS). Many analysts predicted that Fresno State would emerge victorious, some going {{as far as to}} predict a blowout, but said that for SMU to emerge victorious, they would have to win the field position battle as well as create turnovers.|$|E

25|$|The next match became Fiji's {{first victory}} on tour, against Wellington, and Bula's efforts were <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> the victory. Fiji {{had taken a}} 47-run lead on first innings, despite Bula scoring 1 – {{one of only two}} single-figure scores in his career. Three Wellington batsmen hit half-centuries, however, leaving Fiji 247 for the victory in a little less than a day – and after losing opener Patrick Raddock for 0, it looked difficult. But Bula added 88, lifting Fiji to 161 for 2 before they lost three wickets for no run. However, 25 from Maurice Fenn took them over the line.|$|E
25|$|Branyan {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Seattle Mariners on December 3, 2008. The Mariners gave him the starting first base job before spring training. At {{the end of the}} 2009 season, Branyan was the team leader in home runs. Branyan stated <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> his success with the Mariners was a vision training program with Chicago ophthalmologist Dr. Barry Seiller. The exercises strengthen eye muscles and improve focus at the plate. The program is one like designated hitter Edgar Martínez used when he played for the Mariners. In Branyan's first at-bat of the game on August 7, he hit a home run. This was his 25th home run on the year, but it also set a new career high. The previous, 24, was achieved during the 2002 season. He has also set career records in RBIs, doubles, hits, runs and total bases in the 2009 season.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> {{developing}} COX-2 selective {{drugs is}} the larger active site of COX-2, {{which makes it}} possible to make molecules too large to fit into the COX-1 active site but still able to fit the COX-2. The larger active site of COX-2 is partly due to a polar hydrophilic side-pocket that forms because of substitution of Ile523, His513, and Ile434 in COX-1 by Val523, Arg513, and Val434 in COX-2. Val523 is less bulky than Ile523, which increases the volume of the active site. Substitution of Ile434 for Val434 allows the side-chain of Phe518 to move back and make some extra space. This side-pocket allows for interactions with Arg513, which is a replacement for His513 of COX-1. Arg513 is thought to be a key residue for diaryl heterocycle inhibitors such as the coxibs. The side-chain of Leu384, {{at the top of the}} receptor channel, is oriented into the active site of COX-1, but, in COX-2, it is oriented away from the active site and makes more space in the apex of the binding site.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, a study {{proposed}} that immediate human ancestors and wolves may have domesticated {{each other through}} a strategic alliance that would change both respectively into humans and dogs. The effects of human psychology, hunting practices, territoriality and social behavior would have been profound. Wolves and dogs mark their territory with scent; however, humans {{do not have a}} keen sense of smell and may have begun to mark their territories with symbols, which became the first art and may have been generative of human culture. Wolves hunt large game; however, {{there is no evidence of}} pre-sapiens hunting large game. Early humans moved from scavenging and small-game hunting to big-game hunting by living in larger, socially more-complex groups, learning to hunt in packs, and developing powers of cooperation and negotiation in complex situations. As these are characteristics of wolves, dogs and humans, it can be argued that these behaviors were enhanced once wolves and humans began to cohabit. Communal hunting led to communal defense. Wolves actively patrol and defend their scent-marked territory, and perhaps humans had their sense of territoriality enhanced by living with wolves. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> recent human survival has been the forming of partnerships. Strong bonds exist between same-sex wolves, dogs and humans and these bonds are stronger than exist between other same-sex animal pairs. Today, the most widespread form of inter-species bonding occurs between humans and dogs. The concept of friendship has ancient origins but it may have been enhanced through the inter-species relationship to give a survival advantage.|$|E

Historian Richard Gott remarked that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> Castro's success was his ability to utilize the [...] "twin themes of socialism and nationalism" [...] and keep them [...] "endlessly in play". Castro described Karl Marx and Cuban nationalist José Martí as his main political influences, although Gott believed that Martí ultimately remained more important than Marx in Castro's politics. Castro described Martí's political ideas as [...] "a philosophy of independence and an exceptional humanistic philosophy", and his supporters and apologists repeatedly claimed that there were great similarities between the two figures.|$|E
