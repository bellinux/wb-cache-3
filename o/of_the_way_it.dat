The show was reasonably well received. Wessex Scenes Darren Richman said [...] "what the series lacked in budget, it made up for in magnificent material" [...] and went on to call it [...] "far superior to the vastly overrated Little Britain" [...] and [...] "perhaps the greatest forgotten sketch show of modern times." [...] Eureka! TV, which released The Mitchell and Webb Situation on DVD in 2005, said that the show [...] "gushes forth an hilarious stream of surreal and quirkily inventive sketches", as well as calling it a [...] "cult success". In the interview with Wessex Scene, Mitchell stated that he was [...] "more proud <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> turned out than annoyed that it was only aired on a small channel." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{acknowledging}} that [...] "American citizenship enjoys strong protection against loss under Afroyim and Terrazas", retired journalist Henry S.

[...] Matteo also said, [...] "Under Afroyim {{there is a lack of}} balance between rights and protections on one hand, and obligations and responsibilities on the other, all four elements of which have been an integral part of the concept of citizenship, as history shows." [...] Political scientist P. Allan Dionisopoulos wrote that [...] "it is doubtful that any [...] created a more complex problem for the United States than Afroyim v. Rusk", a decision which he believed had [...] "since become a source of embarrassment for the United States in its relationships with the Arab world" [...] because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> facilitated dual U.S.–Israeli citizenship and participation by Americans in Israel's armed forces.|$|E

[...] Writing The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A-, noting that the episode [...] "has {{a lot of really}} strong moments" [...] and praising Duchovny's acting. However, he felt that the episode marked {{the point at which the}} series' overarching mythology would begin to lose focus, explaining that [...] "it's troubling that instead of answering any big issues here ... the show only gives us new directions". Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I'm proud <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> came together, what it did for the series, and the overwhelmingly positive response it has gotten. I'm very pleased beginning season three with where this episode put us—which is that it posed more questions than it answered." [...] He later said in 2005 that the episode brought a lot of interest to the show due to the apparent death of agent Mulder. The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline [...] "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series", adding that it [...] "brought much more significance to what is to come".|$|E

500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If you were the reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff {{from the likes of}} his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If this is what a post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E

2500|$|Amongst analgesics {{there are}} {{a small number of}} agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid {{receptor}} system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain—a euphoria that, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction. [...] Foremost amongst these are nefopam, orphenadrine, and perhaps phenyltoloxamine or some other antihistamines. [...] Tricyclic antidepressants have painkilling effect as well, but they're thought to do so by indirectly activating the endogenous opioid system. Paracetamol is predominantly a centrally acting analgesic (non-narcotic) which mediates its effect by action on descending serotoninergic (5-hydroxy triptaminergic) pathways, to increase 5-HT release (which inhibits release of pain mediators). It also decreases cyclo-oxygenase activity. It has recently been discovered that most or all of the therapeutic efficacy of paracetamol is due to a metabolite, AM404, which enhances the release of serotonin and inhibits the uptake of anandamide.|$|E

2500|$|Goodale's Cutoff, {{established}} in 1862 {{on the north}} side of the Snake River, formed a spur of the Oregon Trail. This cutoff had been used as a pack trail by Indians and fur traders, and emigrant wagons traversed parts of the eastern section as early as 1852. After crossing the Snake River the [...] cutoff headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte following the Lost River part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> passed near the present-day town of Arco, and wound through the northern part of what is now Craters of the Moon National Monument. From there it went southwest to Camas Prairie and ended at Old Fort Boise on the Boise River. This journey typically took two to three weeks and was noted for its very rough lava terrain and extremely dry climate, which tended to dry the wooden wheels on the wagons, causing the iron rims to fall off the wheels. Loss of wheels caused many wagons to be abandoned along the route. It rejoined the main trail east of Boise. Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along U.S. Highway 20, U.S. Highway 26, and U.S. Highway 93 between Craters of the Moon National Monument and Carey.|$|E
