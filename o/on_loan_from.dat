5|$|In January 2011, Gannon was one {{of three}} {{candidates}} reported to have impressed in interviews for the vacant Port Vale job, making him one of the favourites for the position. However, Paul Simpson's dismissal at Stockport County led to hopes of a return to the club for some County fans. Therefore, he was installed as the bookies favourite to become the next Port Vale manager, and also the bookie's favourite for the Stockport job. Gannon was confirmed as the manager of Port Vale on 6 January 2011, succeeding Micky Adams {{at the helm of the}} promotion chasing club, signing a contract that lasted until summer 2012. Saying that finishing outside of the top seven would be a failure, the Cheshire-based manager's first task after 'burying the hatchet' with Gareth Owen was to look for a new striker. Two weeks into his reign club captain Tommy Fraser left the club by mutual consent, as signs of what would be an unhappy relationship between club and manager quickly came to the surface. Gannon then brought in Romaine Sawyers and Kayleden Brown <b>on</b> <b>loan</b> <b>from</b> West Bromwich Albion, Jay O'Shea <b>on</b> <b>loan</b> <b>from</b> Birmingham City, Exodus Geohaghon <b>on</b> <b>loan</b> <b>from</b> Peterborough United, and striker Tom Pope <b>on</b> <b>loan</b> <b>from</b> Rotherham United.|$|E
40|$|In {{order for}} {{e-services}} to work, {{a certain level}} of dependability is necessary in the consumers and providers involved. I draw on an unusual source - microcredit schemes - in order to find ways of promoting this dependability. Microcredit schemes lend money to people who normal banks won't lend to, because they're too poor. However, the default rate <b>on</b> <b>loans</b> <b>from</b> microcredit schemes can be lower than the default rate <b>on</b> <b>loans</b> <b>from</b> normal banks. I put forward hypotheses as to why this might be. These hypotheses suggest some ways to promote dependability in the context of e-services. Finally, I discuss whether e-services can be used by microcredit organizations...|$|R
