50|$|In Sydney, Australia an <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> with {{directional}} <b>signs</b> {{and traffic}} lights erected in 1962 gained the Meccano Set nickname.|$|R
50|$|Sam Cooper Boulevard {{is owned}} and {{maintained}} by the City of Memphis. No route number is assigned to Sam Cooper Boulevard {{and it is not}} a designated business route for interstate traffic headed for Memphis. The exit numbering system on Sam Cooper Boulevard has not been changed since the route was planned. The exits are still numbered as if I-40 ran along Sam Cooper Boulevard as it was proposed to be built straight through Memphis to connect to Arkansas over the Hernando de Soto Bridge. In fact, <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> <b>signs</b> still told westbound motorists that they were heading towards Little Rock until the lettering was removed from the signs in March 2016.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the Tipner Gateway Project was resurrected {{along with}} plans for a junction. As previously, preparatory works {{have been carried out}} for the junction. Due to the {{regulations}} regarding junction spacing, the speed limit on the main carriageway of the M275 has been reduced to 60 mph, and 50 mph on the slip roads and from the southern end of Mile End Road to the Kingston Crescent Junction. The latter junction is to be renamed Junction 2, with the new Tipner Junction becoming Junction 1. Most of the road signs have been replaced and the M27/M275 interchange has been remodelled {{to make it easier for}} drivers, including splitting one lane into two, although this has meant that some of the <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> <b>signs</b> are now redundant. Completion of the junction was achieved April 2014. The junction is now to Tipner West and a large park and ride site for over 600 cars alongside the junction.|$|R
5000|$|In fall 2008, most of {{the older}} Aluminum Tapered Leg (ATL) <b>overhead</b> <b>sign</b> <b>gantries</b> (commonly {{referred}} by the MTO as a [...] "Type 1" [...] structure) which had been installed {{back in the late}} 1980s were replaced with the newer triangular truss gantries.|$|R
50|$|In December 1962 a large <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> with {{directional}} <b>signs</b> {{and traffic}} lights, was erected by the Department of Main Roads. It quickly nicknamed {{with reference to}} the children's construction toy Meccano. At that stage, the intersection was a junction for through traffic between Brisbane and Melbourne. Although this was superseded by the Cumberland Highway in August 1988, it remains an important intersection.|$|R
5000|$|State Road 39 {{begins at}} the SR 60 and County Road 39 in Hopewell. The road enters the Plant City Limits at Trapnell Road. An <b>overhead</b> <b>sign</b> <b>gantry</b> points to a truck detour as the road {{approaches}} State Road 39A (West Alexander Street), and further north, although East Alexander Street continues as a four-lane divided highway toward Jim Johnson Road. Another truck detour <b>sign</b> <b>gantry</b> {{can be found at}} the southern terminus of State Road 553 (Park Road). A third [...] "temporary" [...] truck route is signed along Alabama and Wheeler Streets through downtown. At Grant Street, the James L. Redman Parkway becomes South Collins Street, but from there it also shares a concurrency with County Road 574A, until it reaches East Alsobrook Street. Further into the city, SR 39 has a pair of at-grade crossings with the west end of CSX wye between the Yeoman and Plant City Subdivisions at the intersection with Laura Street.|$|R

50|$|The multi-lane {{free flow}} ETC system {{operates}} without any toll booths. Cameras and other sensors mounted on <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries</b> register either the e-tag or the vehicle license plate number, and an amount is deducted from an eTag registered road user's account. For verification each vehicle is photographed from above for length classification, with additional {{photos of the}} front and rear number plates. The 43 <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries</b> are spaced at about 10 km intervals on the N1, N3, N12 and R21 highways.|$|R

50|$|On February 10, 2012, during {{construction}} of the replacement bridge, an <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> crane collapsed, causing a 90-tonne concrete box-girder segment to drop into the water below. While no one was injured, the accident delayed subsequent construction. WorkSafeBC inspectors evaluated the safety practices on the construction site.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} anti-sway angle control approaches for a two-dimensional <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> crane with disturbances effect in the dynamic system. Delayed Feedback Signal (DFS) and proportional-derivative (PD) -type fuzzy logic controller are the techniques used in this investigation to actively control the sway angle of the rope of gantry crane system. A nonlinear <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> crane system is considered and the dynamic model {{of the system is}} derived using the Euler-Lagrange formulation. A complete analysis of simulation results for each technique is presented in time domain and frequency domain respectively. Performances of both controllers are examined in terms of sway suppression, disturbances cancellation, time response specifications and input force. Finally, a comparative assessment of the impact of each controller on the system performance is presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|In a split-axis system, the {{placement}} head {{moves in the}} X, theta and Z directions, while the PWB moves in the Y direction. As two moving components are involved, split-axis machine slightly more difficult to achieve to achieve high accuracy comparing to the <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> machine. But it greatly improves placement speed.|$|R
5000|$|Taiwan Highway Electronic Toll Collection System (ETC) {{is used to}} [...] {{electronically}} collect tolls {{on national}} freeways in Taiwan. All tolls are collected electronically by <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries,</b> not at traditional toll booths. Taiwan is the first country to switch from manual tolling to all electronic, multi-lane free flow tolling on all of its freeways.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear of the}} {{building}} is divided into symmetrical gable ended sections that have central openings originally intended for goods delivery and serviced by small <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries.</b> These openings are flanked by double-hung windows on both levels. The end bay at the rear has been extended across the laneway. The laneway and rear of {{the building}} are also visually important.|$|R
50|$|The new {{transfer}} bridges {{appear to}} be a simplified design: single two track span with no apron, <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry,</b> counterbalanced with electrically operated span hoist. The design appears to be a variant of the type seen on the West Coast and possibly an improvement on the design of the transfer bridge located at the Independent Subway (IND) 207th Street Yard in Manhattan.|$|R
50|$|The tolls are {{collected}} via a 'free-flow tolling system', an electronic tolling {{system based on}} <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries</b> reading a tag fitted inside vehicles or by taking a photograph of number plates, avoiding the need for vehicles to slow or stop. The Go via system is used. Any other Australian toll road tag will work on the Airport Link toll road.|$|R

No panel rotation is being considered.|$|R
50|$|In England and Wales both Severn {{crossings}} {{were closed}} on 6 February because ice began falling from <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries,</b> affecting both the M4 and M48 motorways across the Severn Estuary; traffic was diverted into Gloucestershire {{and onto the}} M50. This was the first closure because of a weather-related incident of the second Severn crossing since the structure opened in 1996. They reopened on 10 February.|$|R
50|$|Open-road cashless tolling {{started on}} January 4, 2017 at 3 am. The tollbooths are being dismantled, and drivers {{can no longer}} pay cash at the tunnel. Instead, cameras mounted onto <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries</b> located on the Manhattan side take photos of license plates of cars {{that do not have}} E-ZPass transponders, and tolls are mailed to them. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.|$|R
25|$|Open-road cashless tolling {{began on}} July 8, 2017. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers {{are no longer}} able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, there are cameras mounted onto new <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries</b> near where the booths were located. Drivers without E-ZPass will have a picture of their license plate taken, and the toll will be mailed to them. For E-ZPass users, sensors will detect their transponders wirelessly.|$|R
50|$|These cameras come in many forms, {{some free}} {{standing}} on poles; others mounted on bridges or <b>overhead</b> <b>gantries.</b> The cameras may {{consist of a}} box for taking photographs, {{as well as a}} smaller box for the flash, or only a single box containing all the instruments. Recently introduced infrared cameras, do not emit a blinding flash and can therefore be used to take front-on photographs showing the driver's face.|$|R

5000|$|The viaducts {{were built}} utilising pre-cast, post-tensioned, {{segmental}} concrete-steel box girder sections. An <b>overhead</b> <b>gantry</b> crane with self-launching capability was custom {{built on the}} site to lay the superstructure of the precast segments. The Pre-Cast segments are joined together using high strength epoxy glue with nominal pre-stressing initially. The end segments adjacent to the pier are short segments [...] "cast-in-situ joints". Geometrical adjustments of the span are made before primary continuous tendons are stressed.|$|R
