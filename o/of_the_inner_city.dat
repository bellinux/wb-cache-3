5|$|The {{site of the}} {{hospital}} has been in use for 700 years helping the townspeople. There was an Augustinian friary on the site from the thirteenth century, then an almshouse for housing retired freemen, then a soup kitchen was built next to Almshouse in the nineteenth century, before the site acquired its current function as a working office. The building also serves as the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>City</b> Project of the National Trust. This project takes people of ages 12–25 and over 50 out to the countryside {{in order to increase}} appreciation of the city's natural surroundings.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthen ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were abandoned to accommodate expansion. Parts of the ramparts {{are still in}} existence today and can be experienced as steep slopes at the riverside and they have also survived in some place names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city,</b> including the streets of Volden (The Rampart) and Graven (The Moat). Aarhus grew {{to become one of}} the largest cities in the country by the early 16thcentury. In 1657, octroi was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades. Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling, with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares, Mejlgade and Studsgade. The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where merchant quarters were built.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} music festivals; the eight-day Aarhus International Jazz Festival features jazz in many venues across the city. It {{was founded in}} 1988 and takes place in either July, August or September every year. There are several annually recurring music festivals for contemporary popular music in Aarhus. NorthSide Festival presents well known bands every year in mid June on large outdoor scenes. It is a new event, founded in 2010, but grew from a one-day event to a three-day festival in its first three years, now with 35,000 paying guests in 2015. Spot festival is aiming to showcase up-and-coming Danish and Scandinavian talents at selected venues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b> The outdoor Grøn Koncert music festival takes place every year in many cities across Denmark, including Aarhus. Danmarks grimmeste festival (lit. Denmark's ugliest Festival) is a small summer music festival held in Skjoldhøjkilen, Brabrand.|$|E

25|$|With the {{redevelopment}} of the Beltline and the Downtown East Village at the forefront, efforts are underway to vastly increase the density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city,</b> {{but this has}} not stopped the rate of sprawl. In 2012, the combined population of the downtown neighbourhoods (including the Downtown Commercial Core, the Downtown East Village, the Downtown West End, Eau Claire, Chinatown, and the Beltline) was 36,228. However, looking {{at all of the}} inner-city neighbourhoods, the combined population was 179,304.|$|E
25|$|The {{suburb of}} Roslyn lies atop a crest which forms {{part of the}} inner ring of hills around Dunedin. Excellent views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> can be gained from the Roslyn overbridge, which is 1,500 metres {{northwest}} of the city centre, and 150 metres above sea level. Several of the city's most prestigious schools are located close to this suburb and its northern neighbour, Maori Hill. Its southwestern end merges imperceptibly into Belleknowes. Roslyn's 2001 population was 3,957.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time that this {{suburban}} development was taking place, the most central areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> were being redesigned, known as Norrmalmsregleringen. Sergels Torg, with its five high-rise office towers was created in the 1960s, followed by the total clearance of large areas to make room for new development projects. The most notable buildings from this period include the ensemble of the House of Culture, City Theatre and National Bank at Sergels Torg, designed by architect Peter Celsing.|$|E

25|$|The present façade {{was built}} in 1792 in a Neoclassical style by Ernest Koch, a typical style for the reign of emperor Joseph II. Above the entrance, {{on top of the}} pediment, resting on Doric columns by Antonio Beduzzi, stands a group with winged angels and St. Michael slaying Lucifer (1725). These sculptural figures were {{executed}} by the Italian sculptor Lorenzo Mattielli, who also sculpted the Hercules figures at the Hofburg entrance, just opposite the church.

25|$|Along with St Clair, Maori Hill is {{regarded}} as one of Dunedin's more exclusive suburbs. Many fine houses are located among the trees of the city's Town Belt, which snakes around the slopes of the crest which surrounds much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b> Unlike neighbouring hill suburbs like Roslyn, Maori Hill was not served by a cable car, possibly underlying its greater degree of exclusivity. Maori Hill's 2001 population was 1,956. Prospect Park, a small suburb centred on the park of the same name, is sited at the northern end of the ridge which runs through the hill suburbs south to Lookout Point, overlooking the broad canyon of the Leith Valley.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, Beijing's moat {{system was}} {{measured}} at 41.19 kilometres.

The western, eastern, and northern moat systems were covered in the 1970s.

5000|$|In December 1985 Thatcher was criticised {{from another}} former Tory bastion when <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> England report Faith in the <b>City</b> blamed decay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> on <b>the</b> Government's {{financial}} stringency {{and called for}} a redistribution <b>of</b> wealth. However <b>the</b> Government had already introduced special employment and training measures, and ministers dismissed the report as [...] "muddle-headed" [...] and uncosted. The breach with the Church and its liberal bishops remained unhealed until William Hague called for renewed co-operation in 1998.|$|R
40|$|Firearm {{violence}} is often framed {{as a problem}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criminal justice system. However, this focus may direct attention away from smaller communities that also face firearm violence, including suicide. Ten years ago, the Firearm and Injury Center at Penn (FICAP) developed and implemented a model program in three smaller cities, using trauma centers to spearhead community partnerships. This Issue Brief describes {{the development and implementation}} of these partnerships, and highlights one community’s ongoing activities to reduce firearm injury...|$|R
25|$|Due to this {{planning}} a modern city with tall offices, apartment buildings, broad boulevards and busy shops is present.

The design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> roads and main roads are quite organised. Starting from the Corniche, all horizontal streets are oddly numbered, while all vertical streets are evenly numbered. Thus, the Corniche is Street #1, Khalifa is Street #3, Hamdan is Street #5, Electra street is Street #7 and so on. Conversely, Salam Street is St #8.|$|E
25|$|The city {{entered a}} recent period of {{economic}} recovery and prosperity {{in the late}} 1990s, aided by a strong recovery in oil prices and further economic diversification.

Downtown Edmonton and parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city,</b> after years of extremely high office vacancy rates and neglect, have recovered to a great degree, with office vacancy rates in downtown Edmonton at 5.0%. The downtown area is still undergoing a renaissance of its own, with further new projects underway or about to become reality and more people choosing to live {{in or near the}} downtown core (although suburban sprawl is still growing significantly).|$|E

People shouted anti-government remarks and sang the national anthem and the Szekler anthem, then marched to the nearby city hall. Later, at the proposal of the MIÉP chairman, they went to the Hungarian Socialist Party's (MSZP) headquarters on Corvin Street, which was secured by the police. Traffic was blocked by the demonstrators in parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the United States, ethnic {{succession}} {{has been}} seen both among Europeans groups and between European-American and other ethnic groups. By the late nineteenth century, some cities were served by commuter railroads and trolley public transportation, which made longer commutes to work easier.

Such new transportation systems stimulated residential real estate development in train and trolley suburbs, and people who could afford to move out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> started to do so.|$|R
