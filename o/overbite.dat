25|$|Harold (Patrick McKenna) is Red's nephew and {{the fictional}} {{producer}} {{and director of}} The Red Green Show. He is a nerd—he has a significant <b>overbite,</b> wears thick glasses, is very eager and sensitive. He is often appalled by the behaviour of the other lodge members (and even Red himself), and he {{puts a lot of}} effort into trying to change everyone's behaviour, usually with little or no success.|$|E
25|$|Elpidio Quiñones (sometimes {{referred}} to by the diminutive, Elpidito) {{is the son of}} Eleuterio, and is also played by Logroño. Contrary to Eleuterio, Elpidio has a very public profile. He is a special education patient, reportedly 39 years old but with the mental age of an eighth grader, with the sophomoric sense of humor to match. He constantly wears a Superman t-shirt, and has a large <b>overbite</b> (Logroño plays the character wearing a dental prosthesis).|$|E
5000|$|Herbst {{appliance}}: A Herbst appliance corrects <b>overbites</b> {{by holding}} the lower jaw in a protrusive position. It {{is similar to}} the twin block appliance except that it is fixed in place and hence non-removable. This appliance is most commonly used in non-compliant patients. The Herbst appliance is very effective in correcting large <b>overbites</b> due to small lower jaws in patients that are growing.|$|R
50|$|Headgear is an {{orthodontic}} appliance for {{the correction}} of Class II correction, typically used in growing patients to correct <b>overbites</b> by holding back {{the growth of}} the upper jaw, allowing the lower jaw to catch up.|$|R
50|$|Dental braces (also {{known as}} braces, {{orthodontic}} cases, or cases) are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help position them {{with regard to}} a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. They are often used to correct underbites, as well as malocclusions, <b>overbites,</b> open bites, deep bites, cross bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw. Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often {{used in conjunction with}} other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws.|$|R
25|$|Unlike modern lizards, dinosaur teeth grew {{individually}} in the sockets of the jawbones, {{which are}} known as the alveoli. These differ from teeth of other vertebrates, which are directly fused to {{the bones of the}} jaw. Teeth that were lost were replaced by teeth below the roots in each tooth socket. Occlusion refers to the closing of the dinosaur's mouth, where the teeth from the upper and lower parts of the jaw meet. If the occlusion causes teeth from the maxillary or premaxillary bones to cover the teeth of the dentary and predentary, the dinosaur is said to have an <b>overbite,</b> the most common condition in this group. The opposite condition is considered to be an underbite, which is rare in theropod dinosaurs.|$|E
500|$|Turner {{was born}} {{weighing}} [...] Within his first year, he endured chicken pox, pneumonia, asthma, and measles. The 1989 Chicago measles epidemic caused Turner to desperately need emergency room services. [...] He encountered severe breathing problems {{that required the}} removal of his adenoids and tonsils. [...] At the age of three, {{he was hit by}} a car, resulting in a concussion and stitches. [...] Oversized baby teeth and an <b>overbite</b> caused a speech impediment that necessitated speech therapy.|$|E
500|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{characterized}} by their long, canine-like muzzle, which includes a significant <b>overbite.</b> The face is mostly black, with furry [...] "ruffs" [...] running from the ears to the neck. Depending on the species, these ruffs are either white (V. variegata) or deep reddish (V. rubra). Likewise, the coloration of the fluffy fur also varies by species, while the coloration pattern varies by subspecies in the black-and-white ruffed lemur. There are also intermediates in color variation between the two species.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced <b>overbites</b> and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} comics, Japanese {{soldiers}} {{are portrayed as}} squinty-eyed, sallow-skinned war criminals with <b>overbites,</b> driven by pure hatred and/or sadism. Furthermore, in the series of three episodes following World War II that finds the heroes in the Middle East, one of the negative characters is Jewish, named [...] "Bronstein," [...] and depicted in a manner reminiscent of the antisemitic strips of the World War II era. It {{is only in the}} 1950s that youth commissions, notably in France, insisted on the non-stereotyping of characters. By the 1960s, the series in fact alluded to racial tensions in the US as part of its story arcs, with Buck Danny taking a strong stance against discrimination and racism, such as in the album [...] "Les Anges bleus" [...] (The Blue Angels).|$|R
5000|$|Successful {{treatments}} {{have shown}} that causes are functional rather than physical: that is, most lisps are caused by errors in tongue placement within the mouth rather than caused by any injury or congenital deformity to the mouth. The most frequently discussed of these problems is tongue thrust in which the tongue protrudes beyond the front teeth. This protrusion affects speech as well as swallowing {{and can lead to}} lisping. Ankyloglossia or tongue-tie can also be responsible for lisps in children. However it is unclear whether these deficiencies are caused by the tongue-tie itself or the muscle weakness following the correction of the tongue-tie. [...] <b>Overbites</b> and underbites may also contribute to non-lingual lisping. Temporary lisps can be caused by dental work, dental appliances such as dentures or retainers or by swollen or bruised tongues.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{marks the}} debut {{appearance}} of Lurleen on The Simpsons. She {{was created by}} one of the show's character designers, John Rice. Kirkland thought the first design Rice drew of Lurleen was too [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "plain", so they decided to model her after D'Angelo and add [...] "every kind of pretty girl cliché" [...] into the design. Rice and Kirkland then sent the character to Groening, who sent back a note saying [...] "wow". Reiss's show runner partner Al Jean said that [...] "one of the most difficult things when translating real people to a Simpsons look is for women to look beautiful", as the Simpson <b>overbite</b> and facial construction make it particularly difficult to design women's looks. Lurleen's last name, Lumpkin, came from the country bumpkin character Tony Lumpkin in the 1773 comedy play She Stoops to Conquer by Oliver Goldsmith.|$|E
500|$|While at Fox, her roles {{had been}} that of a [...] "girl next door"; at Columbia, she was modeled after Rita Hayworth. Monroe's {{hairline}} was raised by electrolysis {{and her hair was}} bleached even lighter, to platinum blonde. She also began working with the studio's head drama coach, Natasha Lytess, who would remain her mentor until 1955. Her only film at the studio was the low-budget musical Ladies of the Chorus (1948), in which she had her first starring role as a chorus girl who is courted by a wealthy man. During the production, she began an affair with her vocal coach, Fred Karger, who paid to have her slight <b>overbite</b> corrected. Despite the starring role and a subsequent screen test for the lead role in Born Yesterday (1950), Monroe's contract was not renewed. Ladies of the Chorus was released in October and was not a success.|$|E
2500|$|When {{measuring}} the vertical range of motion, the measurement must be adjusted for the <b>overbite.</b> [...] For example, if the measurement {{from the edge}} of the lower front teeth to the edge of the upper front teeth is 40 millimeters and the <b>overbite</b> is 3 millimeters, then the jaw opening is 43 millimeters.|$|E
40|$|Exaggerated {{curve of}} Spee is {{frequently}} observed in dental malocclusions with deep <b>overbites.</b> Such excessive curve of Spee alters the muscle imbalance, ultimately {{leading to the}} improper functional occlusion. It has been proposed that an imbalance between the anterior and the posterior components of occlusal force can cause the lower incisors to overerupt, the premolars to infraerupt, and the lower molars to be mesially inclined. This altered condition requires specialized skills for the practitioner. It would be useful {{if we have a}} thorough knowledge of how and when this curve of Spee develops, so that it will aid us in our treatment. The understanding of why the curve of Spee develops is limited in literature. The {{purpose of this article is}} to increase our knowledge regarding the development and its effect on dentition and its treatment in exaggerated cases...|$|R
30|$|Group 2 {{consisted}} of 27 patients (13 female; 14 male), {{with an initial}} mean age of 16.77  years and final mean age of 18.47  years, treated with 0.022 [*]×[*] 0.028  in. preadjusted Roth prescription, non-self-ligating appliances, at the University of São Paulo, Bauru Dental School, Brazil. The mean treatment time was 1.70  years. Non-extraction treatment with the preadjusted appliances is characterized by leveling and alignment with round 0.012, 0.014, and 0.016  in. NiTi archwires. Subsequently, round 0.016, 0.018, and 0.020  in. stainless steel archwires are used, followed by rectangular 0.019 [*]×[*] 0.025 or 0.021 [*]×[*] 0.025  in. stainless steel archwires. The archwire sequence is dependent upon the treatment needs. Deep <b>overbites</b> are usually corrected by reversing and accentuating the curve of Spee of the stainless steel archwires since the beginning, until an overcorrection is obtained. This overcorrection is maintained by accentuating and reversing the curve of Spee in the rectangular wire as well. Thereafter, finishing procedures were conducted.|$|R

2500|$|Pacu (...) is {{a common}} name {{used to refer to}} several species of {{omnivorous}} South American freshwater serrasalmid fish that are related to the piranha. Pacu and piranha do not have similar teeth, the main difference being jaw alignment; piranha have pointed, razor-sharp teeth in a pronounced underbite, whereas pacu have squarer, straighter teeth, which are uncannily similar to human teeth, and a less severe underbite, or a slight <b>overbite.</b> [...] Pacu, unlike piranha, mainly feed on plant material and not flesh or scales. Additionally, the pacu can reach much larger sizes than piranha, at up to [...] in total length and [...] in weight.|$|E
40|$|Background: Reports of occlusal {{variation}} in ancient populations consistently show a low prevalence of malocclusion coupled with heavy attritive wear. Materials and methods: The dentitions of 28 individual remains from a pre-contact native North American population were examined {{and the extent}} and nature of occlusal variation recorded. Results: The prevalence of malocclusion was low (mean IOTN = 2. 14) and where crowding existed, was limited to intraarch variability as opposed to inter-arch discrepancies. Increased <b>overbites,</b> overjets and other classical features of Class II malocclusions were almost entirely absent. These {{findings suggest that the}} ideal mutually protected Class I occlusion occurs only as a transient juvenile arrangement in nature, where, due to rapid attrition fo lowing establishment of the occlusion, there is an increasing tendency towards mild Class Ill, edge-to-edge incisor and buccal segment relationships. Conclusion: Whilst of limited therapeutic benefit, an understanding of the anthropology of malocclusion provides an insightful perspective, and suggests that function may be of more importance than heredity in its aetiology. It is suggested that future occlusal studies in ancestral populations would benefit from the use of a standard methodology...|$|R
5000|$|A disproportionately grown upper {{or lower}} jaw causes dentofacial deformities. Chewing becomes problematic, {{and may also}} cause pain due to {{straining}} of the jaw muscle and bone. Deformities range from micrognathia, which is when the mandible doesn't grow far forward enough (over bite), and when the mandible grows too much, causing an under bite; {{all of which are}} uncomfortable. Also, a total maxilla osteotomy is used to treat the [...] "long face syndrome," [...] known as the skeptical open bite, idiopathic long face, hyper divergent face, total maxillary alveolar hyperplasia, and vertical maxillary excess. Prior to surgery, surgeons should take x-rays of the patient's jaw to determine the deformity, and to make a plan of procedures. Mandible osteotomies, or corrective jaw surgeries, benefit individuals who suffer from difficulty chewing, swallowing, TMJ pains, excessive wear of the teeth, open bites, <b>overbites,</b> underbites, or a receding chin. The deformities listed above can be perfected by an osteotomy surgery of either the maxilla or mandible (whichever the deformity calls for), which is performed by an oral surgeon who is specialized in the working with both the upper and lower jaws.Orthognathic surgery is also available as a very successful treatment (90-100%) for obstructive sleep apnea.|$|R
50|$|They are {{generally}} quite hardy, often living longer on average than some full-sized horse breeds; the average {{life span of}} miniature horses is from 25 to 35 years. However, {{there are also some}} health issues that are more frequently found in miniature horses than their full-sized relatives. Overfeeding is a common problem in miniature horses, leading to obesity; this is especially true when owners are used to owning full-sized horses. Dental issues, including crowding, brachygnathism (<b>overbites)</b> and prognathism (underbites) are frequently seen, due to having the same number of teeth in a much smaller mouth. They can also experience retention of deciduous teeth (baby teeth) and sinus problems from overcrowding. The combination of a propensity for overeating and dental problems can lead to an increased occurrence of colic. A major metabolic problem seen more frequently in miniature horses is hyperlipemia, where an appetite-reducing stressor can cause the body to break down significant amounts of fat, overwhelming the liver and potentially leading to liver failure. Reproduction is also more difficult in miniature horses, with a higher incidence of difficult births and a greater potential for eclampsia. The majority of the health problems seen more frequently in miniature horses are easily rectified with proper feeding and maintenance.|$|R
2500|$|Sarcosuchus {{was a giant}} {{relative}} of crocodiles, with fully grown individuals estimated to have reached up to [...] in total length and [...] in weight. It had somewhat telescoped eyes and a long snout comprising 75% {{of the length of}} the skull. There were 35 teeth in each side of the upper jaw, while in the lower jaw there were 31 teeth in each side. The upper jaw was also noticeably longer than the lower one leaving a gap between them when the jaws were shut, creating an <b>overbite.</b> In young individuals the shape of the snout resembled that of the living gharial but in fully grown individuals it became considerably broader.|$|E
2500|$|Determining {{the cause}} of death was inconclusive, as the severe {{decomposition}} on the body had removed all signs of possible violence from the remains. However, the case is believed to have been a murder, as suicide was eliminated as a possibility of the girl's death. The circumstances of the location of the remains had also sparked suspicion among authorities. Toxicology tests were conducted to see if any drugs or alcohol had been in her system, yet the results were never released. Although the body was found in autumn, she had died in the summer, two to four months previously. This was established by examining traces from insects that were found on the remains. She had an <b>overbite,</b> and some fillings and dental sealants were found on the upper molars with no current cavities. The <b>overbite</b> was not described as extreme, but may have been noticeable, which could be a reliable feature depicted in her facial reconstruction. The estimated height was between 4'10" [...] and 5'4", the victim being between fifteen and twenty-one years old and weighing between 110 to 135 pounds, at an [...] "average frame". Examiners believe she was either white or Hispanic, although Native American and Asian races cannot be ruled out. She also may have been biracial. Other physical characteristics included a healed rib fracture and being pigeon toed or knock-kneed, which may have been noticeable when she walked, as her feet were slanted inward. She also suffered from spina bifida occulta, but may have been unaware of the condition. To obtain DNA information, her femur was transported to the University of Texas.|$|E
2500|$|Another long running Burger King tie-in {{partnership}} {{has been}} with 20th Century Fox's property The Simpsons. Burger King's first promotion with Fox began in 1990, when the show was launched as a full-time series. Burger King sold a set of [...] dolls featuring {{each member of the}} Simpsons family.

50|$|Kryten {{is asked}} for his {{decision}} regarding getting his corrupted systems repaired, and the mechanoid still can't say no. In order {{to give him the}} courage, he steals a security guard's gun and (taking Kochanski's advice too seriously) forces the superior officers present to sit on toilets. Amused by this, Kryten finally refuses to have his systems restored; however, his actions have caused the crew to decide to proceed anyway. Afterwards, Kryten has been returned to his old ways of servitude and politeness. Lister breaks Kochanski out of her quarters and, while in the lift, decides {{to make the most of}} the opportunity to try out the sexual magnetism virus on himself. Although it works at first and Kochanski practically throws herself at her ex-boyfriend, she returns to normal after a few seconds and Lister realises that the positive viruses cancel each other out. Later, after getting the Cat released, the three look for Kryten so they can all escape only to discover that he doesn't recognise them and has returned to his factory settings. Lister, Kochanski and the Cat start looking for a new disguise (since the Cat refuses to wear his over his normal clothes). Suddenly Cat hits on a great idea... with black mop heads and fake teeth with <b>overbites</b> they can pretend to be the Dibbley family.|$|R
40|$|Palatal {{augmentation}} prostheses {{are commonly}} used in the treatment for dysphagia. By lowering the palatal contours, the tongue contact is increased and thus the bolus propulsion facilitated. However, the unfavourable weight of such appliances may be avoided when using lingual plates. Hence, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate the effect of two different types of lingual plates on the vertical dimension in rest position. Eleven healthy dentate subjects with an average age of 35. 5  years (26 - 60  years) volunteered in this pilot study. The vertical <b>overbites</b> were measured on plaster models. Two different designs of the experimental lingual plates were tested in this pilot study (P-type & D-type). The inter-occlusal freeway space was measured using the electromagnetic K 7 jaw-tracking system (Myotronics, U. S. A.), while the subjects were seated in an upright position. They were asked to close from rest position into maximum intercuspation for about 2  s. Recordings were performed without the plates and subsequently with each of the two plate designs in situ. All recordings were performed three times and the second closing movement of each recording was used for the analysis. After averaging the repetitions without experimental lingual plates, with P-type and D-type plates, the differences were analysed using a Kruskall-Wallis test. The results showed no significantly increased freeway space while using both types of lingual plates. Hence, it can be concluded that any altered tongue pressure during swallowing with lingual plates is not related to an increase in vertical dimension...|$|R
5000|$|The changes {{manifested}} by the tame foxes {{over the}} generations, moreover, {{were not only}} behavioral but also physiological, just as Belyayev had expected. The first physiological change detected in the tame foxes was a lower adrenaline level. Belyayev and his team [...] "theorized that adrenaline might share a biochemical pathway with melanin, which controls pigment production in fur", a hypothesis that has since been confirmed by research. As they became tamer, {{more and more of}} the foxes began showing [...] "signs of the domestication phenotype"; Trut later recalled that in the early 1980s [...] "we observed a kind of explosion-like change of the external appearance." [...] After eight to ten generations, the tame foxes began to develop particolored coats, a trait found more in domesticated animals than in wild ones; this was followed by the development of [...] "floppy ears and rolled tails similar to those in some breeds of dog". After 15 to 20 generations, a very small percentage of the tame foxes developed shorter tails and legs and underbites or <b>overbites.</b> The experimenters also discovered that the domesticated foxes show a [...] "fear response" [...] several weeks later than their wild counterparts, and that this delay is [...] "linked to changes in plasma levels of corticosteroids, hormones concerned with an animal's adaptation to stress". After 12 generations of selective breeding, the corticosteroid level in the tame foxes' plasma was [...] "slightly more than half the level in a control group". After 28 to 30 generations, [...] "the level had halved again." [...] At the same time, the tame foxes' brains contained higher levels of serotonin.

2500|$|Greg Cannom {{was chosen}} to create the makeup effects for A Beautiful Mind, {{specifically}} the age progression of the characters. Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on The Insider. Howard had also worked with Cannom on Cocoon. Each character's stages of makeup were broken down {{by the number of}} years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of [...] "Older Nash". The production team originally decided that the makeup department would age Russell Crowe throughout the film; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup was used to push his look to resemble the facial features of John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate skin and be used for overlapping applications; this shortened make-up application time from eight to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight <b>overbite</b> in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Tutankhamun was slight of build, and {{was roughly}} [...] tall. He had large front incisors and an <b>overbite</b> {{characteristic}} of the Thutmosid royal line to which he belonged. Between September 2007 and October 2009, various mummies were subjected to detailed anthropological, radiological, and genetic studies {{as part of the}} King Tutankhamun Family Project. The research showed that Tutankhamun also had [...] "a slightly cleft palate" [...] and possibly a mild case of scoliosis, a medical condition in which the spine deviates to the side from the normal position. X-rays clearly show that the king suffered from Klippel–Feil syndrome. All seven vertibrae in his neck were completely fused together, so he was unable to move his head. Examination of Tutankhamun's body has also revealed deformations in his left foot, caused by necrosis of bone tissue. The affliction may have forced Tutankhamun to walk {{with the use of a}} cane, many of which were found in his tomb. In DNA tests of Tutankhamun's mummy, scientists found DNA from the mosquito-borne parasites that cause malaria. This is currently the oldest known genetic proof of the disease. More than one strain of the malaria parasite was found, indicating that Tutankhamun contracted multiple malarial infections. According to National Geographic, [...] "The malaria would have weakened Tutankhamun's immune system and interfered with the healing of his foot. These factors, combined with the fracture in his left thighbone, which scientists had discovered in 2005, may have ultimately been what killed the young king." ...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the craniofacial morphology of Malay children with repaired UCLP {{and compare the}} data with non-cleft Malay children. Twenty Malay children with repaired UCLP (12 boys, 8 girls; Mean age: 10. 5 years) and 20 normal Malay children (8 boys, 12 girls; Mean age: 9. 72 years) were recruited from the Combined Cleft Lip and Palate Clinic and the Department of Children's Dentistry and Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Malaysia. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken with the head orientated parallel to the floor. Thirty-one linear and angular variables were measured on the lateral cephalometric radiographs with Dolphin Imaging Software Version 10. 0 (Dolphin Imaging, Chatsworth, CA, USA). The data were analysed with the Mann-Whitney U test {{and the level of}} significance was set at p < 0. 05. In the UCLP group, the girls had deeper <b>overbites</b> than the boys (p = 0. 011), and in the Control group the girls had a significantly more acute cranial base angle (NSBa, p = 0. 017) and a less protrusive lower lip (LL-E line, p = 0. 21). The data for the boys and girls were combined. Subjects in the UCLP group had a more acute cranial base angle, shorter and more retruded maxillae and were more skeletal III than the subjects in the Control group. In the UCLP group, the upper and lower incisors were less proclined than in the Control group, the interincisal angle was more obtuse and the overjet reduced by 6 mm. There were no significant facial height differences. The nasolabial angle (Col-Sn-UL) was significantly more obtuse and the upper lip relative to the E line more retrusive in the UCLP group. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups in facial heights or the maxillo-mandibular planes angle. Malay children with repaired UCLP have small, retrusive maxillae.
