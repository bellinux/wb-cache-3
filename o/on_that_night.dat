5|$|<b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage.

Certainly something special happened <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E

Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead.
