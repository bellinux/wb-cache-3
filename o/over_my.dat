5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E

25|$|Some {{material}} in <b>Over</b> <b>My</b> Dead Body would in later decades be thought inappropriate {{at the very}} least.

25|$|COL Oran K. Henderson – 11th Infantry Brigade commander, {{who ordered}} {{the attack and}} flew in a {{helicopter}} <b>over</b> <b>Mỹ</b> Lai during it.

25|$|Isolated {{strands of}} liberal thought had existed in Western {{philosophy}} since the Ancient Greeks, and in Eastern philosophy since the Song and Ming period, {{but the first}} major signs of liberal politics emerged in modern times. Many of the liberal concepts of Locke were foreshadowed in the radical ideas that were freely aired at the time. The pamphleteer Richard Overton wrote: To every Individuall in nature, is given an individuall property by nature, not to be invaded or usurped by any...; no man hath power <b>over</b> <b>my</b> rights and liberties, and I over no mans.|$|E
25|$|MG Samuel W.

However, during the operation he flew <b>over</b> <b>My</b> Lai and monitored the radio communications. Afterward, Koster did not follow up with the 11th Brigade commander COL Henderson on the initial investigation, and later {{was involved in the}} cover-up. Was charged by the Army with failure to obey lawful regulations, dereliction of duty, and alleged cover-up; charges dropped. Later was demoted to brigadier general and stripped of a Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
