Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ <b>oligomers</b> (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic <b>oligomers,</b> also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ <b>oligomers</b> may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

5|$|In aprotic solvents, <b>oligomers,</b> {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base.

Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800.

5|$|In the 1950s, Har Gobind Khorana and {{co-workers}} developed a phosphodiester method where 3’-O-acetylnucleoside-5’-O-phosphate 2 (Scheme 3) was activated with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Ts-Cl). The activated species were reacted with a 5’-O-protected nucleoside 1 {{to give a}} protected dinucleoside monophosphate 3. Upon the removal of 3’-O-acetyl group using base-catalyzed hydrolysis, further chain elongation was carried out. Following this methodology, sets of tri- and tetradeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized and were enzymatically converted to longer oligonucleotides, which allowed elucidation of the genetic code. The major limitation of the phosphodiester method consisted {{in the formation of}} pyrophosphate <b>oligomers</b> and oligonucleotides branched at the internucleosidic phosphate. The method seems to be a step back from the more selective chemistry described earlier; however, at that time, most phosphate-protecting groups available now had not yet been introduced. The lack of the convenient protection strategy necessitated taking a retreat to a slower and less selective chemistry to achieve the ultimate goal of the study.|$|E

Major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP 1), which consists of oligomeric and monomeric forms, is an abundant proliferative protein in royal jelly. We previously reported that MRJP 1 <b>oligomer</b> has biochemical heat resistance. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of several heat treatments (56, 65 and 96 °C) on the proliferative activity of MRJP 1 <b>oligomer.</b> Heat resistance studies showed that the <b>oligomer</b> molecular forms were slightly maintained until 56 ℃, but the molecular forms were converted to macromolecular heat-aggregated MRJP 1 <b>oligomer</b> at 65 ℃ and 96 ℃. But, the growth activity of MRJP 1 <b>oligomer</b> treated with 96 °C was slightly attenuated when compared to unheated MRJP 1 <b>oligomer.</b> On the other hand, the cell proliferation activity was preserved until 96 ℃ by the cell culture analysis of Jurkat cells. In contrast, those of IEC- 6 cells were not preserved even at 56 °C. The present observations suggest that the bioactive heat-resistance properties were different by {{the origin of the}} cells. The cell proliferation analysis showed that MRJP 1 <b>oligomer,</b> but not MRJP 2 and MRJP 3, significantly increased cell numbers, suggesting that MRJP 1 <b>oligomer</b> is the predominant proliferation factor for mammiferous cells...|$|R

5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form <b>oligomers</b> with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., <b>oligomers)</b> that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E

In this study, using small-angle X-ray scattering, we characterized CEL-III and its <b>oligomer</b> induced by the binding of lactose. The molecular mass of the <b>oligomer</b> was determined as 1019 kDa from its forward scattering value, compared with 47   490 Da for the monomer. This <b>oligomer</b> size is much larger than that estimated using SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 270 kDa). The monomer has a 24. 6 Å radius of gyration and can be approximated by a rod which has a 20 Å radius and a height of 75 Å, while the <b>oligomer</b> has a 101. 4 Å radius of gyration. Together with the comparison of the radii of gyration and the forward scattering of the cross-section of the monomer and <b>oligomer,</b> it is suggested that in aqueous solution the <b>oligomer</b> comprises three or four molecules of a smaller unit which was observed by SDS-PAGE (270 kDa), held by a relatively weak interaction. The scattering profile also suggests that the <b>oligomer</b> has a hole in its central axis which might be associated with the formation of ion-permeable pores in the erythrocyte membrane by CEL-III during the hemolytic process...|$|R

All mice immunized with 8 micrograms of B <b>oligomer</b> survived aerosol challenge and had peripheral leukocyte counts and weight gains {{similar to those}} of mice immunized with pertussis toxoid before challenge and to those of control mice that were not challenged. Unprotected mice challenged with an aerosol of B. pertussis had an increase in peripheral leukocyte count, failed to gain weight, and died within 21 days of challenge. Protection appeared to be dose dependent, since a dose of 1 microgram of B <b>oligomer</b> per mouse prevented death in 100 % of the mice challenged with B. pertussis, whereas 0. 4 micrograms of B <b>oligomer</b> protected 50 % of the challenged mice. Mice immunized with the B <b>oligomer</b> had increases in immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-B <b>oligomer</b> in sera and in IgG and IgA anti-B <b>oligomer</b> in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids 1 to 3 weeks after respiratory challenge. Specific anti-B <b>oligomer</b> antibodies could not be detected in unimmunized, infected mice at the same time after challenge. Intravenous administration of the monoclonal antibody 170 C 4, which binds to the S 3 subunit of the B <b>oligomer,</b> protected neonatal mice from B. pertussis respiratory challenge, while administration of an IgG 1 anti-tetanus toxin monoclonal antibody, 18. 1. 7, was not protective.

The regulatory mechanisms controlling these two distinct activities, however, are unknown.

25|$|Galectin-1 {{has been}} shown to enhance HIV {{infection}} due to its galactose binding specificity. HIV preferentially infects CD4+ T cells and other cells of the immune system, immobilising the adaptive immune system. HIV is a virus that infects CD4+ cells via binding of its viral envelope glycoprotein complex, which consists of gp120 and gp41. The gp120 glycoprotein contains two types of N-glycan, high mannose <b>oligomers</b> and N-acetyllactosamine chains on a trimannose core. The high mannose <b>oligomers</b> are pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) and are recognised by the C-type lectin DC-SIGN found on dendritic cells. The N-acetyllactosamine chains are ligands for galectin-1. Galectin-1 is expressed in the thymus. In particular it is secreted in abundance by Th1 cells. In its normal function, galectin-1 binds to glycans on the CD4 co-receptor of T cells to prevent auto reactivity. When HIV is present, the galectin bridges between the CD4 co-receptor and gp120 ligands, thus facilitating HIV infection of the T cell. Galectin-1 is not essential for HIV infection but assists it by accelerating the binding kinetics between gp120 and CD4. Knowledge of the mechanism between galectin and HIV may provide important therapeutic opportunities. A galectin-1 inhibitor can be used in conjunction with antiretroviral drugs to decrease the infectivity of the HIV and increase the efficacy of the drug.|$|E

Here, we demonstrated that both endogenous and transfected optineurin exist as <b>oligomer,</b> rather than monomer in NIH 3 T 3 cells using BNE or immunoprecipitation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). We also applied in situ proximity ligation assay to visualize the self-interaction of optineurin in fixed HeLaS 3 cells and reveal that the optineurin <b>oligomer</b> was localized diffusely in cytoplasm. Optineurin <b>oligomer</b> was usually detected as a single band at the size equal to optineurin monomer by SDS-PAGE, while there was an additional protein band with larger size observed when cells were treated with H 2 O 2 before cell lysis followed by SDS-PAGE. The protein complex with larger size was proved to be optineurin <b>oligomer</b> by immunoprecipitation and therefore called covalent optineurin <b>oligomer.</b> Interestingly, in most common glaucoma-associated mutation of optineurin, E 50 K expressing cells, the covalent <b>oligomer</b> was formed even without H 2 O 2 stimulation.
