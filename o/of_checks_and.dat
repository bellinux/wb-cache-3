5|$|A {{complex set}} <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and {{governed by the}} magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check {{the power of the}} magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|The General Court, as the {{legislative}} and judicial bodies, and the Governor, {{as the chief}} executive of the colony, constituted a political system of division of power. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin's political theory to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances in order to minimize the misuse of political power. In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony. The colony was de facto a republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influence—a representative democracy governed on the principles of the Mayflower Compact ("self-rule").|$|E
5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates {{have to make sure that}} the church can fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E

5|$|These {{powers were}} {{generally}} devolved {{to the prime}} minister and ministers. The matters are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control. Thus, Parliament is the most appropriate forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive. However, in practice, parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective. The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown, coupled with a weak system <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances between the Parliament and the executive, can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to the people. The possibility of such abuse, coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s– a period of judicial activism– led courts in the United Kingdom to take an increasing interest {{in the manner in which}} prerogative powers had been exercised.|$|E
5|$|Turkey is {{a charter}} {{member of the}} UN, an early member of NATO, the IMF and the World Bank, and a {{founding}} member of the OECD, OSCE, BSEC, OIC and G-20. After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. Turkey's economy and diplomatic initiatives led to its recognition as a regional power while its location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. Turkey's current administration headed by president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has reversed many of the country's earlier reforms which had been in place since the founding of the modern republic of Turkey, such as Freedom of the Press, and a Legislative System <b>of</b> <b>Checks</b> <b>and</b> Balances. A set of standards for secularism in government, as first enacted by Atatürk have also diminished in favour of conservative religionist governance, to the grievance of much of the Turkish public.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the second {{principle}} is equally true. Secrecy in government is antithetical to democratic governance. Too much secrecy shields officials from oversight and inevitably breeds abuse and misconduct; it thus can fatally weaken the system <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances that defines {{our system of}} government.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} of powers brings its merits in just governance. However, where each branch wields more power than it legitimately should, {{there is room for}} abuse, leaving the rest of the society open to the potential of being ruled by tyranny of the majority.

25|$|Since independence, Singapore's {{legal system}} has evolved {{increasingly}} towards its local context. Developments {{in government and}} constitutionalism have brought about distinctive features in its system <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances. A few issues arise due to the long-standing one-party dominance in Singapore's political system. Since the 1963 general election, the People's Action Party has repeatedly prevailed as the majority party in Parliament. In the recent 2011 general election, it managed to capture 81 of 87 seats contested.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} of powers in Singapore is also enhanced by intra-branch checking mechanisms. Within the executive, the Elected President adds to the overall scheme <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances through his discretionary power to block certain government actions. However, {{the presence of an}} override mechanism wielded by Parliament blunts the office's powers. The Presidential Council for Minority Rights also serves as a check on the legislature by reviewing bills to ensure that they do not discriminate against racial and religious minorities. However, the Council's powers are constrained by the presence of an override mechanism as well.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in Federalist No. 51, Madison {{argued that}} {{to create a}} {{government}} that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly. Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders. Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing. Thus, all {{three branches of government}} must have some control over the military, and the system <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.|$|E

25|$|The elders {{circumscribed}} {{the power}} of the Ashantihene, and the chiefs of other divisions considerably checked {{the power of}} the King. This in practical effect created a system <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances. As the symbol of the nation, the Ashantihene received significant deference ritually, for the context was religious in that he was a symbol {{of the people in the}} flesh: the living, dead or yet to be born. When the king committed an act not approved of by the counsel of elders or the people, he could possibly be impeached, and demoted to a commoner.|$|E
25|$|The 1960 Constitution {{provided}} {{for a presidential}} system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches {{as well as a}} complex system <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.|$|E
25|$|The Ashanti {{government}} was built upon a sophisticated bureaucracy in Kumasi, with separate ministries {{to handle the}} state's affairs. Of particular note was Ashanti's Foreign Office based in Kumasi; despite its small size, it allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments to handle relations separately with the British, French, Dutch, and Arabs. Scholars of Ashanti history, such as Larry Yarak and Ivor Wilkes, disagree over {{the power of this}} sophisticated bureaucracy in comparison to the Asantahene, but agree that it was a sign of a highly developed government with a complex system <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances.|$|E
