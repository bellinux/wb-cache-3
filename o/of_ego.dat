5|$|Roark {{is arrested}} and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides {{to use his}} papers to defend his friend. This unpopular stance hurts the {{circulation}} of his newspapers, and Wynand's employees go on strike after Wynand dismisses Toohey for disobeying him and criticizing Roark. Faced {{with the prospect of}} closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a speech about the value <b>of</b> <b>ego</b> and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the Banner and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.|$|E

5000|$|The {{system has}} both classificatory and {{descriptive}} terms. In addition to gender and generation, Iroquois kinship also distinguishes 'same-sex' and 'cross-sex' parental siblings: the brothers <b>of</b> <b>Ego's</b> (the subject from whose perspective the kinship is based) father, and the sisters <b>of</b> <b>Ego's</b> mother, {{are referred to}} by the same parental kinship terms used for Ego's Father and Mother.

25|$|An {{advantage}} of psychedelic drugs in exploring the unconscious {{is that a}} conscious sliver of the adult ego usually remains alert during the experience. Throughout the session, patients remain intellectually alert and remember their experiences vividly. In this highly introspective state, they also are actively cognizant <b>of</b> <b>ego</b> defenses such as projection, denial, and displacement as they react to themselves and their choices {{in the act of}} creating them.|$|E
25|$|Professorial {{misconduct}} includes improper grading of students' {{papers and}} oral exams, grade fraud, deliberate negligence towards cheating or assistance in cheating. This {{can be done}} for reasons of personal bias towards students (favoritism) or a particular viewpoint (intellectual dishonesty), for a bribe, or to improve the teacher's own perceived performance by increasing the passing rate. It is still occasionally done for matters <b>of</b> <b>ego</b> or to procure sexual favors (sexual harassment).|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{conservation}} hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if {{the stakes are}} high enough. Offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts the effects <b>of</b> <b>ego</b> depletion. This may seem surprising but in fact it may be highly adaptive. Given the value and importance of the capacity for self-control, it would be dangerous for a person to lose that capacity completely, and so ego depletion effects may occur because people start conserving their remaining strength. When people do exert themselves on the second task, they deplete the resource even more, as reflected in severe impairments on a third task that they have not anticipated.|$|E

50|$|Elements <b>of</b> <b>Ego's</b> insane {{attempt to}} 'awaken' other sentient worlds {{can be seen}} in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, where Ego- here capable of manifesting himself in a {{humanoid}} form- has 'seeded' other planets with his essence with the goal of 'reproducing' across the universe, although this plan has been put on hold as he lacked the energy to trigger the process by himself. He gains the opportunity when he tracks down his son, Peter Quill, who has inherited enough <b>of</b> <b>Ego's</b> abilities to process Ego's power once instructed in its use, but Quill rejects Ego when he learns that Ego killed his mother, using his control <b>of</b> <b>Ego's</b> power to destroy his father.|$|R

25|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>ego</b> {{depletion}} do {{not appear}} to be a product of mood or arousal. In most studies, mood and arousal has not been found to differ between participants who exerted self-control and those who did not. Likewise, mood and arousal was not related to final self-control performance. The same is true for more specific mood items, such as frustration, irritation, annoyance, boredom, or interest as well. Feedback about success and failure of the self-control efforts does not appear to affect performance. In short, the decline in self-control performance after exerting self-control appears to be directly related to the amount of self-control exerted and cannot be easily explained by other, well-established psychological processes.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 Adolf Dittrich and Daniel Lamparter {{did a study}} {{where they}} found that DMT-induced altered state of {{consciousness}} (ASC) is strongly influenced by habitual, rather than situative factors. In the study researchers used three dimensions of the APZ questionnaire to describe ASC (rating scales of ASC). First, oceanic boundlessness (OB) refers to dissolution <b>of</b> <b>ego</b> boundaries mostly associated with positive emotions. Second, anxious ego-dissolution (AED) includes disorder of thoughts, loss of autonomy and self-control and third, visionary restructuralization (VR) that includes auditory and visual illusions, hallucinations. Results showed strong effects within first and third dimensions for all conditions, especially DMT and suggested strong intrastability of elicited reactions independently of the condition for the OB and VR scales. Importantly, the experiment was conducted in a safe laboratory environment. This particular setting had a certain influence on found results that might be very different outside the laboratory environment.|$|E

500|$|After {{the deal}} with RCA, the Strokes started working with Gil Norton, who had {{produced}} recordings for alternative rock group Pixies. Although a rapport developed between the two parties, the band remained unhappy at the results of preliminary sessions which sounded [...] "too clean" [...] and [...] "too pretentious"; the three songs recorded with Norton were scrapped. Like The Modern Age, Is This It was eventually recorded with Gordon Raphael at Transporterraum in Manhattan's East Village in New York City. The studio {{is located in a}} basement with poor lighting, but despite its poor infrastructure, it includes modern Pro Tools Digital Audio Workstation hardware.

500|$|The Beatles was {{the third}} album to be {{released}} by Apple Records, following Harrison's Wonderwall Music, and Two Virgins. Martin {{has said that he}} was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested to the group that they reduce the number of songs to form a single album featuring their stronger work, but that the band decided against this. Interviewed for the Beatles Anthology television series in the 1990s, Starr said that he now felt that it should have been released as two separate albums (that he nicknamed [...] "The White Album" [...] and [...] "The Whiter Album"). Harrison felt on reflection that some tracks could have been released as B-sides, but [...] "there was a lot <b>of</b> <b>ego</b> in that band." [...] He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the backlog of songs that the group had at the time. By contrast, McCartney said that it was fine as it was, adding: [...] "It's the bloody Beatles' White Album. Shut up!" ...|$|E
500|$|Flack notes a {{distinction}} between the [...] "strong sense" [...] of Nonviolent Communication as a virtue that is possible with care and attention, and the [...] "weak sense," [...] a mimicry of this born <b>of</b> <b>ego</b> and haste. The strong sense offers a language to examine one's thinking and actions, support understanding, bring one's best to the community, and honor one's emotions. In the weak sense, one may take the language as rules and use these to score debating points, label others for political gain, or insist that others express themselves in this way. Though concerned that some of what Rosenberg says could lead to the weak sense, Flack sees evidence confirming that Rosenberg understands the strong sense in practice. Rosenberg's work with workshop attendees demonstrates [...] "the real thing." [...] Yet Flack warns that [...] "the temptation of the weak sense will not be absent." [...] As an antidote, Flack advises, [...] "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others," [...] (also known as the robustness principle) and guard against the [...] "metamorphosis of nonviolent communication into subtle violence done in its name." ...|$|E

40|$|Using {{images from}} the Spitzer GLIMPSE Legacy survey, we have {{identified}} more than 300 extended 4. 5 micron sources (abbreviated EGO, Extended Green Object, for the common coding of the [4. 5] band as green in 3 -color composite IRAC images). We present a catalog <b>of</b> these <b>EGOs,</b> including integrated flux density measurements at 3. 6, 4. 5, 5. 8, 8. 0, and 24 microns from the GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL surveys. The average angular separation between a source in our sample and the nearest IRAS point source is > 1 arcminute. The majority <b>of</b> <b>EGOs</b> are associated with infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), and where high-resolution 6. 7 GHz methanol maser surveys overlap the GLIMPSE coverage, EGOs and 6. 7 GHz methanol masers are strongly correlated. Extended 4. 5 micron emission is thought to trace shocked molecular gas in protostellar outflows; the association <b>of</b> <b>EGOs</b> with IRDCs and 6. 7 GHz methanol masers suggests that extended 4. 5 micron emission may pinpoint outflows specifically from massive protostars. The mid-infrared colors <b>of</b> <b>EGOs</b> lie in regions of color-color space occupied by young protostars still embedded in infalling envelopes. Comment: 47 pages, 13 figures. AJ, in press.

40|$|EGO is a {{parallel}} molecular dynamics program running on Transputers. We conducted a performance analysis <b>of</b> the <b>EGO</b> program {{in order to}} determine whether it was effectively using the computational resources of Transputers.

With the assistance of performance tools such as UPSHOT, and Author to whom correspondence should be sent 1 with instrumentation <b>of</b> the <b>EGO</b> program itself, we were able to determine that only 8 % of the execution time <b>of</b> the <b>EGO</b> program was spent in non-overlapping communication.
