5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 <b>octane</b> aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 <b>octane</b> fuel was +6 pounds per square inch (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 <b>octane</b> fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 horsepower (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 horsepower (984kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 horsepower (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E

5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} <b>octane</b> rating of low <b>octane</b> petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased <b>octane</b> ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

5|$|Wasteland Angel is a {{vehicular}} combat shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{created by the}} Finnish independent developer team <b>Octane</b> Games. Released on September 1, 2011, the game is published by Meridian4 for Windows and is distributed online through Steam, Impulse, GamersGate, Direct2Drive, and Amazon Download.|$|E
5|$|Wasteland Angel {{was first}} {{announced}} on May 17, 2011, with a prospective release date for summer {{of the same}} year. The game was developed by <b>Octane</b> Games, an independent development team in Kotka, Finland that is owned by Nitro Games. The company was founded in Spring 2011, shortly after Nitro Games completed the arcade shooter Woody Two-Legs. Wasteland Angel would be their first release under the <b>Octane</b> Games brand. Before the release, the group had already announced the second game they were working on: a pirate role-playing game titled Raven's Cry. Although Wasteland Angel is published by Meridian4, Raven's Cry was signed {{to be published by}} TopWare Interactive. In the announcement for Wasteland Angel, the publisher noted plans to make additional downloadable content available for the game after it was launched. In an August 2011 interview, <b>Octane</b> Games CEO Jussi Tähtinen stated that the company was focusing on multiplatform development and that Wasteland Angel seemed in ideal fit to be marketed for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but he declined to share any specific plans to bring the game to either platform. When asked {{about the possibility of a}} multiplayer mode, Tähtinen again declined to make any announcement.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{directed}} towards the synthesis and base promoted rearrangements of some saturated and unsaturated halogenotricyclo-octanes. The preparation {{of a number of}} previously unknown 4, 4, 8 - and 4, 4, 8, 8 -tetra-halogeno-anti-tricyclo[5, 1, 0, 03, 5]- <b>octanes</b> and the corresponding 3, 3, 8 -tri- and 3, 3, 8, 8 -tetra-halogeno-anti-tricyclo[5, 1, 0, 02, 4] <b>octanes</b> has been accomplished and the stereo-chemistries of their ring systems established. The former tricyclo-octanes are base sensitive and on treatment with potassium t-butoxide give rise to mixtures of (E) - and (Z) -Beta-t-butoxystyrenes. However, the anti-tricyclo[5, 1, 0, 02, 4] <b>octanes</b> give no characterisable products on treatment with base. The mechanistic implications of the tricycle-octane - styrene conversion have been studied in some detail and halogenocyclo-octatetraenes and phenylacetylenes have been eliminated as intermediates. The behaviour of several methoxy-substituted 4, 4, 8, 8 -tetrahalogeno-anti-tricyclo[5, 1, 0, 03, 5] <b>octanes</b> with the same base has been studied, and it has been found that homotropilidenes are formed regiospecifically by 1, 4 -elimination. These conversions constitute the first known examples of such elimination experienced by ring-fused halogenocyclopropanes. From these studies, evidence is presented which implicates homotropilidenes and bicyclo[4, 2, 0]octa- 2, 4 -dienes as intermediates in the production of styrenes, and a mechanism for the tricyclo-octane - styrene rearrangement has been proposed. A new and potentially versatile synthesis of 3, 3 -dihalogeno-anti tricyclo[5, 1, 0, 02, 4] oct- 5 -enes (anti-bishomobenzenes) has been developed. The new route employs readily available starting materials, involves sequential introduction of the cyclopropyl, gem-dihalogenocyclopropyl, and olefinic moieties and proceeds in an overall yield of about 14 %. This represents a five-fold increase over the previously reported yields...|$|R

Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
5|$|From 1978, Ecclestone was {{president}} of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this view, at the end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis that ground effect would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months. At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the Drivers' Championship by Piquet, protested that the Research <b>Octane</b> Number (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} version to {{incorporate}} changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, {{which was designed}} to run on 100 <b>octane</b> fuel. This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures, which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal supercharger. The Merlin XX also utilised the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, was the use of a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol, and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I, II and III series.|$|E

5|$|Square {{accumulated}} four SGI Origin 2000 series servers, four Onyx2 systems, and 167 <b>Octane</b> workstations for the film's production. The basic {{film was}} rendered at a custom render farm created by Square in Hawaii. It housed 960 Pentium III-933MHz workstations. Character movements were filmed using motion capture technology. Animator Matthew Hackett stated that while motion capture was effective {{for many of}} the scenes, in others animators still had to add movements manually. Hand and facial movements were all done manually. Some of General Hein's facial features and poses were based on Hackett. As animators did not want to use any actual photographs in the film, all backgrounds were done using matte paintings. 1,327 scenes in total needed to be filmed to animate the digital characters. The film consists of 141,964 frames, with each frame taking an average of 90 minutes to render. By the end of production Square had a total of 15 terabytes of artwork for the film. It is estimated that over the film's four-year production, approximately 200 people put in a combined 120 years of work on it.|$|E
5|$|Human Entertainment's Dance Aerobics was {{an early}} rhythm-based video game {{released}} in 1987, and allows players to create music by stepping on Nintendo's Power Pad peripheral for the NES video game console. The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper has been credited as the first true rhythm game, and {{as one of the}} first music-based games in general. It requires players to press buttons in the order that they appear on the screen, a basic mechanic that formed the core of future rhythm games. The success of PaRappa the Rapper sparked the popularity of the music game genre. In 1997, Konami released the DJ-themed rhythm game Beatmania in Japanese arcades. Its arcade cabinet features buttons similar to those of a musical keyboard, and a rubber pad that emulates a vinyl record. Beatmania was a surprise hit, inspiring Konami's Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game, and to begin experimenting with other rhythm game concepts. Its successes include GuitarFreaks, which features a guitar-shaped controller, and 1998's Pop'n Music, a game similar to Beatmania in which multiple colorful buttons must be pressed. While the GuitarFreaks franchise continues to receive new arcade releases in Japan, it was never strongly marketed outside of the country. This allowed Red <b>Octane</b> and Harmonix to capitalize on the formula in 2005 with the Western-targeted Guitar Hero. In general, few Japanese arcade rhythm games were exported abroad because of the cost of producing the peripherals and the resulting increases in retail prices. The 1999 Bemani title DrumMania featured a drum kit controller, and could be linked with GuitarFreaks for simulated jam sessions. Similarly, this concept was later appropriated by Harmonix for their game Rock Band.|$|E
