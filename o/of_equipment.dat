Another piece <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E

5|$|In August 1941, McAloney {{was posted}} to the Directorate <b>of</b> <b>Equipment</b> at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. In this {{capacity}} he advised on the procurement <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and spare parts for RAAF aircraft. He was further tasked with compiling a register of aeroplane equipment at RAAF flight training units and operational bases throughout Australia. The latter entailed McAloney visiting several Air Force units in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to check equipment stores. On 1 March 1942, he was commissioned as a flying officer. Transferred to the Directorate <b>of</b> <b>Equipment</b> Administration in July, McAloney was made Officer Commanding Technical and Photographic Staffs {{and served as}} a liaison between his own directorate and that of Technical Services.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, some major units were disbanded {{and a lot}} <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> was phased out or {{scrapped}} due to a severe shortage of funds. The whole land forces structure was reorganized from armies into territorial corps, and from regiments into battalions. In the mid-1990s, {{the situation of the}} land forces was critical: the military budget was three times lower than in 1989 (636 million dollars), 50% of the equipment was older than 30 years, and 60% of the armoured vehicles and 85% of the missile units were non-operational. Due to lack of fuel and training, the level of combat readiness and military capability was extremely low (only about 30% of the entire land forces were operational). However, after 1996 the government took serious action; the military budget was increased greatly, and modernisation <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> commenced. Officially, the program to modernize and restructure the armed forces began on 11 April 2000.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Battalion was {{unprepared}} {{for a fight}} as it was poorly trained and had no tanks or anti-tank guns to fight North Korean armor.

Communications equipment, weapons, and ammunition was largely absent, large amounts <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> were en route but the division had been under-equipped in Japan. Most of the radios available to the division did not work, and batteries, communication wire, and telephones to communicate among units were in short supply. The division had no tanks: its new M26 Pershing and older M4A3 Sherman tanks had not yet arrived. One of the few weapons that could penetrate the North Korean T-34, high explosive anti-tank ammunition, was in short supply. The paucity of radios and wire hampered communication between and among the American units.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A life {{management}} approach on in-service device in refining unit {{was presented in}} this paper. By means of this method, corporate resources can reasonably be allocated.

First, according to the type <b>of</b> the <b>equipments,</b> statistical analysis <b>of</b> <b>equipments</b> was carried out to obtain the life stages: early life stage, middle life stage, late life stage, extended life stage. Then, based on damage mechanism residual life <b>of</b> the <b>equipments</b> was calculated out. At the same time, the recommended maintenance cycle was given. If the operational life <b>of</b> the <b>equipments</b> cannot meet the expected life, the cause analysis should be done. The subsequent processing steps, such as maintenance, repair and renewal were proposed. Next, the equipments in the corporation were classified. For different class <b>of</b> the <b>equipments,</b> the different management methods were given. Finally, a re-evaluation of life was conducted...|$|R
