The literature review was commissioned to evaluate screening programs designed to detect vision conditions such as diminished visual acuity, amblyopia, strabismus or squint, refractive error, cataracts and glaucoma. The review examines the effectiveness of <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> programs for populations with a low to moderate risk of developing a vision condition. Populations who {{are at high risk}} of developing a vision disorder, including children born prematurely, children in remote indigenous communities and children with multiple disabilities, require separate assessment, diagnosis and follow-up treatment and care. <b>Vision</b> <b>screening</b> programs alone are not considered appropriate to meet the particular needs of these populations. <b>Vision</b> <b>screening</b> is different to assessment and diagnosis, and this review focuses solely on the former. Screening consists of a test or tests, generally quick and easy to administer and score, that determine whether a child meets certain criteria considered normal or ‘healthy’ for his or her age group. A screen does not provide a definitive diagnosis, but determines who should and should not be referred on for a more comprehensive eye examination. The decision to commence, terminate or modify a health screening program can be contentious. There are certain criteria that screening programs ought to meet in order to effectively identify health conditions, and in order to effectively refer on for reduction, treatment or amelioration of these conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Single optotype {{tests of}} visual acuity {{are widely used}} for {{preschool}} <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> in order to optimise cooperation with testing. These tests may, however, underestimate the visual acuity deficit in amblyopia because they lack visual crowding. This study assessed the resultant negative predictive value (NPV) for amblyopia.  METHODS—Cohort study of 936  children in the Cambridge Health District selected by date of birth. The presence of amblyopia among children who had passed preschool <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> was determined using Snellen line acuity as the reference test. Preschool <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> was conducted at 3. 5  years of age by community orthoptists. The screening assessment comprised Sheridan-Gardiner single optotype test of visual acuity (referral criterion 6 / 9 or worse in either eye), cover test, ocular movements, 20 prism test, and TNO stereotest.  RESULTS—The overall NPV of preschool <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> for amblyopia was 100 % (95 % CI 99. 4 % to 100 %). Most children with amblyopia were detected by the Sheridan-Gardiner single optotype test of visual acuity, but the other screening tests were necessary to prevent any false negatives. In isolation, the Sheridan-Gardiner single optotype test of visual acuity has a NPV for amblyopia of only 99. 6 % (95 % CI 98. 7 % to 99. 9 %).  CONCLUSION—Preschool <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> using a single optotype test of visual acuity does achieve a high NPV for amblyopia, but only under certain conditions. These comprise a low threshold for referral (6 / 9 or worse in either eye) and {{the inclusion of a}} cover test and tests of binocular function in the screening assessment. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Refractive {{error is}} defined as the {{inability}} of the eye to bring parallel rays of light into focus on the retina, resulting in nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (Hyperopia) or astigmatism. Uncorrected refractive error in children is associated with increased morbidity and reduced educational opportunities. <b>Vision</b> <b>screening</b> (VS) is a method for identifying children with visual impairment or eye conditions likely to lead to visual impairment. Objective: To analyze the utility of <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> conducted by teachers and to contribute to a better estimation of the prevalence of childhood refractive errors in Apurimac, Peru. Design: A pilot <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> program in preschool (Group I) and elementary school children (Group II) was conducted with the participation of 26 trained teachers. Children whose visual acuity was< 6 / 9 [20 / 30] (Group I) and≤ 6 / 9 (Group II) in one or both eyes, measured with the Snellen Tumbling E chart at 6 m, were referred for a comprehensive eye exam. Specificity and positive predictive value to detect refractive error were calculated against clinical examination. Program assessment with participants was conducted to evaluate outcomes and procedures. Results: A total sample of 364 children aged 3 – 11 were screened; 45 children were examined at Centro Oftalmológico Monseñor Enrique Pelach (COMEP) Eye Hospital. Prevalence of refractive error was 6. 2 % (Group I) and 6. 9 % (Group II); specificity of teacher <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> was 95. 8 % and 93. 0 %, while positive predictive value was 59. 1 % and 47. 8 % for each group, respectively.

Methods. A 7 -year birth cohort study of 4624 children was started in 1996 / 1997 in Rotterdam. <b>Vision</b> <b>screening</b> data {{were obtained from the}} child screening centers. Treating orthoptists working at the regional ophthalmology departments provided information about diagnosis and treatment. The diagnosis was reviewed by two experts. The parents provided additional information on their child's eye history through written questionnaires and telephone interviews. At age 7 years, the children underwent a final examination by the study orthoptists. Results. Of the 3897 children still living in Rotterdam by 2004, 2964 (76. 1 %) underwent the final examination. Amblyopia was diagnosed in 100 (3. 4 %) of these (95 % CI, 2. 7 - 4. 0). At age 7, 23 % had visual acuity > 0. 3 logMAR. Amblyopia was caused by refractive error (n = 42), strabismus (n = 19), combined-mechanism (n = 30), deprivation (n = 7), or unknown (n = 2). Eighty-three amblyopia cases had been detected before age 7. Amblyopia detection followed positive results in <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> in 56 children, either preverbal (n = 15) or preschool (n = 41). Twenty-six other amblyopes were self-referred (n = 12, before a first positive screening test), especially strabismic or combined-mechanism amblyopia; data were uncertain for one other positively screened amblyopic child. Amblyopia remained undetected until age 7 due to unsuccessful referral (n = 4, three with visual acuity > 0. 3 logMAR at age 7) or false-negative screening (n = 13). Conclusions.

40|$|<b>Vision</b> <b>screening</b> at {{an early}} age in {{children}} is important as it can identify aspects in the visual system that may need to be managed to enable a child to function optimally at school.   The National School <b>Vision</b> <b>Screening</b> Programme was discontinued in many provinces of South Africa, often {{due to a lack of}} financial resources or adequately trained personnel. This action has resulted in the majority of children not having a visual examination during their school career.   In a few instances where vision screenings are performed, these are usually limited to visual acuity (VA) evaluation alone; an endeavour that may miss many significant visual problems.   The purpose of this article is to highlight the need for <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> to be conducted in schools and for the screening protocols to include the various accommodative tests.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of vision abnormalities in children is amblyopia (also known as "lazy eye"). Amblyopia is an alteration in the visual neural pathway in a child's developing brain that can lead to permanent vision loss in the affected eye. Among children younger than 6 years, 1 % to 6 % have amblyopia or its risk factors (strabismus, anisometropia, or both). Early identification of vision abnormalities could prevent the development of amblyopia. Studies show that screening rates among children vary by race/ethnicity and family income. Data based on parent reports from 2009 - 2010 indicated identical screening rates among black non-Hispanic children and white non-Hispanic children (80. 7 %); however, Hispanic children were less likely than non-Hispanic children to report <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> (69. 8 %). Children whose families earned 200 % or more above the federal poverty level {{were more likely to report}} <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> than families with lower incomes.

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> tests and the benefits and harms of <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> and treatment. Surgical interventions were considered to be out of scope for this review. Treatment of amblyopia is associated with moderate improvements in visual acuity in children aged 3 to 5 years, which are likely to result in permanent improvements in vision throughout life. The USPSTF concluded that the benefits are moderate because untreated amblyopia results in permanent, uncorrectable vision loss, and the benefits of screening and treatment potentially can be experienced over a child's lifetime. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of treatment (ie, higher false-positive rates in low-prevalence populations) as small. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that the overall net benefit is moderate for children aged 3 to 5 years. The USPSTF recommends <b>vision</b> <b>screening</b> at least once in all children aged 3 to 5 years to detect amblyopia or its risk factors.
