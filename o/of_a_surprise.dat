5|$|Taylor v. Illinois, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court held that defense witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances, even if that hurts the defense's case. Taylor was the first case to hold {{that there is no}} absolute bar to blocking the testimony <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> witness, even if that is an essential witness for the defendant, a limitation of the broad right to present a defense recognized in Washington v. Texas.|$|E
5|$|The final polls {{from before}} the {{announcement}} of candidates gave Labour a four-point lead over the Conservative Party. From early in the campaign, the contest was presumed to be between the Labour and Conservative candidates, with both expected to comfortably reach {{the second round of}} voting. While Goldsmith – who was the last of the main candidates to be announced, on 3 October 2015 – was widely anticipated to be the Conservative candidate, Khan's selection was more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Clark's men easily {{captured}} Vincennes and Fort Sackville. Prior {{to their}} arrival in 1778, Clark had sent Captain Leonard Helm to Vincennes to gather intelligence. In addition, Father Pierre Gibault, a local priest, helped persuade the town's inhabitants {{to side with}} the Americans. Before Clark and his men set out to recapture Vincennes in 1779, Francis Vigo provided Clark with additional information on the town, its surrounding area, and the fort. Clark was already aware of the fort's military strength, poor location (surrounded by houses that could provide cover), and dilapidated condition before his arrival. Clark's strategy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> attack and strong intelligence were critical in catching Hamilton and his men unaware and vulnerable.After hatcheting five captive Indians to death within view of the fort, Clark forced its surrender.|$|E

5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dutch Army and the German 18th Army, a third force, not all that much smaller than either, would operate on Dutch soil: the French 7th Army. It had its own objectives within the larger French strategy, and French planning had long considered the possibility of operations in Dutch territory. The coastal regions of Zealand and Holland were difficult to negotiate because of their many waterways. However, both the French and the Germans saw the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> flanking attack in this region. For the Germans this would {{have the advantage of}} bypassing the Antwerp-Namur line. The Zealand Isles were considered to be strategically critical, as they are just opposite the Thames estuary, so their capture would pose a special menace to the safety of England.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the ten gliders {{carrying}} the airborne troops assigned to Group Iron were able to land next to their objective, the bridge at Kanne. Due to a navigation error by the pilots of the transport aircraft towing the gliders, one of the gliders was dropped in the wrong area. The other nine gliders were towed through heavy anti-aircraft fire and released at 05:35. As the gliders began to descend towards their objective, the bridge was destroyed by several demolition explosions set off by the Belgian garrison. Unlike the garrisons of the other two bridges, the Belgian defenders at Kanne had been forewarned, as the German mechanized column heading for the bridge to reinforce Group Iron arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Its appearance ruined any chance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> assault and gave the defenders sufficient time to destroy the bridge. As the gliders came in to land, one was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into the ground killing most of the occupants. The remaining eight landed successfully, and the airborne troops stormed the Belgian positions and eliminated the defenders.|$|E

5|$|In March 1801 Gibraltar {{took part}} in the pursuit of Contre-amiral Honoré Ganteaume, whose {{squadron}} had made a further attempt to reinforce the French troops in Egypt. Having sailed from Brest on 7January, the French force of three 80-gun and four 74-gun ships-of-the-line, plus two frigates, passed into the Mediterranean on 9February, where it captured the only British ship in the area, the 32-gun frigate, Success. Rear-admiral Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron, comprising Gibraltar, the seventy-fours , , , , and the 64-gun Haerlem, on hearing of the event, set off in pursuit. Forced into Port Mahon on 27February by a storm, the squadron remained there for several days while repairs were undertaken. The search continued on 4March, minus Généreux, which was left to defend the island in the event <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> attack by French and Spanish forces. After Warren's squadron had visited Naples and Palermo, it received reinforcements on 18 and 22March {{in the form of the}} 64-gun Athénien and the 74-gun , respectively. Now, with seven ships-of-the-line, Warren turned towards Toulon, hoping to find Ganteaume there.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{victory at}} Unsan {{was as much}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to the Chinese {{leadership}} {{as it was to}} the UN forces. The accidental encounter between the Chinese and US forces at Unsan eased the fear of the Chinese leadership about intervening in Korea, while the performance of the US 1st Cavalry Division was studied in great detail by Chinese commanders. For the UN forces, on the other hand, despite the heavy losses suffered by the US Eighth Army at Unsan, the unexpected Chinese withdrawal made the United Nations Command believe that China did not intervene in Korea on a large scale. PVA Commander Peng Dehuai incorporated the lessons from Unsan for the upcoming Second Phase Campaign, while General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive under the assumption that only a weak Chinese force was present in Korea, resulting in the decisive battles at the Ch'ongch'on River and the Chosin Reservoir later that year.|$|E

The result was considered somewhat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> as Tadić had exploited his resignation for the presidential vote to coincide with parliamentary elections.|$|E
