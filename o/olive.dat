40|$|Harvested <b>olives</b> require further {{processing}} {{to make them}} edible due to their content in the bitter substance oleuropein. However, some <b>olives</b> of the Erkence cultivar naturally de-bitter on the tree giving rise to the so-called Hurma <b>olives.</b> In this study, {{the evolution of the}} chemical characteristics of Erkence and Hurma <b>olives</b> harvested from the northeast and southwest area of trees located in the Karaburun Peninsula was assayed. It was confirmed that the oleuropein content in Hurma <b>olives</b> was much lower (< 2000 mg/kg fresh weight) than Erkence, which reached 35. 000 mg/kg fresh weight {{at the beginning of the}} season. In addition, no free or polymerized anthocyanins were found in Hurma fruit in contrast to ripened Erkence fruit. The concentration of glucose was also lower in Hurma than Erkence <b>olives.</b> These results suggest that the enzymatic oxidation of oleuropein could be responsible for the natural de-bittering of Hurma <b>olives</b> during their ripening on the tree...|$|R
25|$|Salt-cured type (<b>olives</b> {{with minor}} fermentation): Applied only to ripe <b>olives,</b> {{they are usually}} {{produced}} in Morocco, Turkey, and other eastern Mediterranean countries. Once picked, the <b>olives</b> are vigorously washed and packed in alternating layers with salt. The high concentrations of salt draw the moisture out of <b>olives,</b> dehydrating and shriveling them until they look somewhat analogous to a raisin. Once packed in salt, fermentation is minimal and only initiated by the most halophilic yeast species such as Debaryomyces hansenii. Once cured, they are sold in their natural state without any additives. So-called Oil-cured <b>olives</b> are cured in salt, and then soaked in oil.|$|R

5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of <b>olive</b> oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to <b>olive</b> pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and <b>olive</b> mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman <b>olive</b> press. <b>Olive</b> oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own <b>olive</b> presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The <b>olive</b> oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study on the}} {{evolution}} of physicochemical parameters during processing of black <b>olives,</b> with particular emphasis on anthocyanins and colour, are reported. <b>Olives</b> of two cultivars collected at a technological black-ripe stage were processed by the traditional anaerobic system. At regular intervals, brines and <b>olives</b> were inspected for different parameters. The routine physicochemical values in brines and <b>olives</b> changed as expected. Total anthocyanin, cyanidin- 3 -glucoside and cyanidin- 3 -rutinoside content showed a rapid decrease at 15 days of processing, presenting apparently a zero-order kinetic, and later they completely disappeared. Chromatograms revealed other unidentified peaks. The colour stability of the <b>olives</b> was probably assured by the formation of new more stable pigments...|$|R

40|$|Quality indices, {{antioxidant}} compounds, and antioxidant {{activities of}} extra-virgin oils from Coratina <b>olives</b> were evaluated during a 12 -mo storage.

A 90 -minmalaxation trial was also performed for the stoned <b>olives.</b> The following parameters were monitored: free acidity, peroxide value, K 232 and K 270 indices, sensory profile, total phenolic content (TPC), phenolic profiles, tocopherol compounds, and antioxidant activity (AA). The highest TPC, AA, and sensory score {{were found for}} the oils obtained by <b>olives</b> picked at lowMI and by stoned <b>olives.</b> After 12 mo, all the oils were still included into the “extra-virgin” category, and those deriving from whole <b>olives</b> picked at the lowest MI showed the best sensory characteristics due to high fruity and well-balanced pungent and bitter tastes...|$|R

5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the <b>olive</b> baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the <b>olive</b> baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The <b>olive</b> baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E

For some species, sequence analysis of the 26 S rRNA gene was necessary. These techniques allowed the identification of three yeast species (Issatchenkia occidentalis, Geotrichum candidum and Hanseniaspora guilliermondii) which had not been described previously in table <b>olives.</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida boidinii were the most frequent species in green seasoned <b>olives</b> and processed black <b>olives,</b> respectively.
