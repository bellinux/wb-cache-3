The advent of <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> is due to the manner in which criteria are applied to the taxation of income or wealth.

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>taxation</b> {{is known}} as restricting {{the free flow of}} capital and {{accordingly}} results in a limited access of the internal market. Although, not many Member States have entered into <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> conventions in order to avoid juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> of inheritances. The question then arises whether this failure to eliminate juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> is restricting the free movement of capital. The ECJ‟s case law regarding inheritance taxes are very varying. In its initial case law, the ECJ stated that national measures which reduce the value of the inheritance are in breach of EC law. Even measures which could restrict investors in one Member State from investing in other Member States are considered to be a breach of EC law. The ECJ also stated that discriminating situations could not be justified with the argument that these situations arise due to the co-existence of national tax systems. Given these facts, it seems like juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> is likely to constitute a breach of EC law. The ECJ has however only concentrated on which effect the national provisions in a single Member State may have and have not given concern to which effect these provisions may have in connection with the tax provisions in other Member States. The author believes that the Court takes this approach because of a respect of the Member States fiscal sovereignty. This respect also shows in the Block case. In this case the ECJ made it clear that juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> caused by the co-existence of national tax systems, is not considered to be a breach of EC law. The ECJ also stated that when the Member States develops their tax systems, {{due to the lack of}} harmonised Community rules regarding direct taxation, they are not obliged to adapt to the tax systems of other Member States in order to avoid <b>double</b> <b>taxation.</b> The ECJ also made it clear that the citizens are not guaranteed a neutral tax situation when transferring their place of residence. In this thesis a comparison has also been made to judgements where the ECJ considers economic <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> to be a breach of EC law. After studying all these cases it seems like the ECJ considers juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> to be an undesirable restriction of the free flow of capital. But even though the ECJ encourages the Member States to enter into <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> conventions, there are no consequences when the Member States fail to do this. The difference between cases regarding economic <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> and juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> could be that the ECJ considers it to be too far reaching to judge juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> as a breach of EC law and do not want to regulate how this restriction shall be avoided and thereby take the role of the Community legislator or breach the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States. The author believes that it would be more beneficial for the internal market if juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> was avoided and that it would not be harmful if the ECJ would give the Member States some incentives for entering into <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> conventions in order to eliminate or alleviate situations where juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> occurs...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{phenomenon}} of international <b>double</b> <b>taxation.</b> Collection of taxes is a manifestation of state sovereignty. Each state lays down its own rules determining which persons and economic facts {{will be subject to}} taxation. As a result a situation may occur that more states claim the right to impose a tax of comparable nature on the same fact and entity. Such situations ordinarily occur in connection with cross-border labour mobility, international investments, and in many other cases. <b>Double</b> <b>taxation</b> is a burden for taxpayers and represents a barrier to international movement of persons and capital. States may provide relief to taxpayers by unilateral measures. However, a more effective instrument for the avoidance of <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> is international cooperation. The 20 th century saw the development of international treaties on avoidance of <b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> which have a privileged position in the tax law. These treaties not only serve as a relief to taxpayers, but are also the basis of comprehensive cooperation in tax collection. Therefore, this thesis focuses on <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> treaties, which are currently the most effective tool for resolving a conflict of tax laws of different states.

40|$|In {{this article}} we sought to address the {{international}} <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> phenomenon from two different standpoints. To begin with, {{in the first part}} we analysed the framework of international <b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> and how this topic was tackled in both Romanian and international literature. International <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> has been analyzed, mutatis mutandis, from an economic perspective, more precisely in terms of the implications that it generates on economies, on added value, on capital flows, on the internationalisation of business. Second, I believed it was important to analyse international <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> from a legal perspective, through the jurisdictional effects of obtaining income or holding property at the European or international level. Romania's case is carefully approached in this paper, aiming to highlight the issues Romania is facing concerning cooperation in tax matters with authorities from other countries, how the more than 80 <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> conventions are applied and interpreted, but also other aspects that should be considered by the Romanian tax authorities, based on the provisions of the Fiscal Code and the Fiscal Procedure Code.

40|$|The South African fiscal {{legislators have}} found it {{necessary}} to introduce anti-avoidance legislation which governs controlled foreign companies in order to counteract schemes devised by taxpayers where companies are established outside South Africa for the purpose of diverting income from the South African fiscal net. Whilst the enforcement of such legislation does have merit in that the intention behind the introduction of such domestic legislation is to prevent the erosion of the South African tax base, it is submitted that this does pose a problem from an international perspective. The objective of this treatise is to conduct a critical analysis of how compatible the South African fiscal legislation which governs controlled foreign companies is with the provisions of the <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreement as prescribed in terms of the OECD Model Tax Convention (which was published in July 2010). In addition, the aim {{of this study is to}} deduce whether the purpose of the <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreement is not only the avoidance of juridical <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> but also that it addresses the avoidance of economic <b>double</b> <b>taxation.</b> This will assist in determining whether domestic controlled foreign company legislation (as embodied in section 9 D of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962) conflicts with the purpose of the <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreement. By conducting an extensive research study and by depicting a certain scenario which addresses the issue at hand, the following is concluded: The tax treatment of the business profits generated by a controlled foreign company resident in a State outside South Africa and which have been generated from active business operating activities, is held to be in agreement with the provisions of the <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreement. By contrast, the tax treatment of the controlled foreign company’s passive income in the form of interest income, is found not to correlate with the aforesaid agreement. As will be demonstrated in the chapters that follow, the controlled foreign company’s interest income is subjected to economic <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> in terms of the scenario depicted in this treatise. This means that such income is taxed twice in the hands of two different taxpayers in two different States. As a result of this it is submitted that the following problem arises: Because section 9 D of the Income Tax Act causes economic <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> to occur (as illustrated in the previous paragraphs) and owing to the fact that the purpose of the <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreement is the avoidance of economic <b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> it can be shown that the section 9 D domestic legislation conflicts with the terms of the <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreement. This conflict is considered to be an area of concern because a contravention of the purpose of the <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreement is regarded as a breach of the Contracting States’ international obligations in terms of the aforesaid agreement. It is further submitted that paragraph 23 of the OECD Commentary on article 1 and paragraph 14 of the OECD Commentary on article 7 are incorrect when they express the sentiment that domestic controlled foreign company legislation does not conflict with the provisions of the <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreement. It is proposed that this be corrected to state the contrary...|$|R
40|$|International {{and local}} aspects of <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> Abstract The purpose of my thesis is to analyze {{international}} <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> {{taking into account}} both local legislation and international aspects. <b>Double</b> <b>taxation</b> is the situation, where the same income (or capital) {{is subject to the}} same tax more than once. Mostly, the international <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> appears when the state of the source of income implies taxes on the income of the non-residents and the state of residence of the income receiver subject the same income to taxation based on the residency of the taxpayer. Since this is inequitable, many nations make bilateral <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreements with each other. In some cases, the tax is paid in the country of residence and {{is at the same time}} exempt in the country in which it arises directly based on the provisions of <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> agreement. In the remaining cases, the country where the gain arises implies taxation at source and the taxpayer receives a compensating foreign tax credit/foreign taxation exemption in the country of residence to reflect the fact that tax has already been paid. The thesis is divided into seventeen chapters that could be divided into five main parts. The first part is aimed at the description of basic terms used in international taxation and basic principles of the system [...] ...|$|R
