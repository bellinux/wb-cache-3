5|$|Chas. H. Ross and Mr. Haybeck then {{testified to}} the {{articles}} he recovered from the Spray. The prosecutor, William H. Jelliffe, asked for another adjournment to await the arrival of Willis to testify to the collision. Voorhees opposed the adjournment and moved for Jackalow's immediate release <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe replied {{that he intended to}} charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Alexander adopted some {{elements}} of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>that</b> Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies {{of many of his}} countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} time in Spain, in April 1616 Hasekura met again with the King, who {{declined}} to sign a trade agreement, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese Embassy {{did not appear to be}} an official embassy from the ruler of Japan Tokugawa Ieyasu, who, on the contrary, had promulgated an edict in January 1614 ordering the expulsion of all missionaries from Japan, and started the persecution of the Christian faith in Japan.|$|E

5|$|In Marbury, the Supreme Court {{held that}} Madison's failure {{to deliver the}} {{commission}} to Marbury was illegal, but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction. Stuart v. Lairdinvolving a civil judgment rendered by a circuit court constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by a circuit court constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit. In a brief opinion, the Court rejected both challenges.|$|E
5|$|On Burton's first appeal, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} {{his convictions}} because venue and vicinage {{could not be}} proper in the Eastern District of Missouri on the sole ground that Burton's bank sent the check to St. Louis after he cashed it. Further, the Court cited the prejudicial refusal of jury instructions. After Burton was retried and convicted, the Court affirmed, inter alia, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> the agreement between Burton and Rialto had occurred in St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 2007, Mauffray {{found that}} Bell had {{violated}} {{the terms of}} his probation for previous convictions. The judge sentenced Bell to 18 months in a juvenile facility on two counts of simple battery and two counts of criminal destruction of property, and Bell was taken into custody. According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> retrying Bell would amount to double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E
50|$|National church-state {{separation}} {{groups have}} spoken out {{in opposition to}} Question 790 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> allowing religious groups to access state grants could tempt them away from their main mission.

50|$|As psychoanalysts {{continued}} {{to explore the}} glossed of unconscious motives, Otto Fenichel distinguished different sorts of rationalization—both the justifying of irrational instinctive actions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> they were reasonable or normatively validated, and the rationalizing of defensive structures, whose purpose is unknown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> they have some quite different but somehow logical meaning.|$|R
50|$|This {{conviction}} was quashed in July 2004 by the Court of Criminal Appeal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> had {{new evidence}} of bank accounts {{been available to}} the trial jury they might have had raised doubts therefore rendering the conviction unsafe. A retrial was not ordered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> Redmond had served virtually all his sentence.|$|R
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> {{he or she}} has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of untouchability {{has been declared}} an offence punishable by law under Article 17, and the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 has been enacted by the Parliament to further this objective. Article 18 prohibits the State from conferring any titles other than military or academic distinctions, and the citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign state. Thus, Indian aristocratic titles and title of nobility conferred by the British have been abolished. However, awards such as the Bharat Ratna have been held to be valid by the Supreme Court <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> they are merely decorations and cannot {{be used by the}} recipient as a title.|$|E
5|$|Following the Act of 1819, in 1820 the Court {{began to}} {{distinguish}} Palmer. In United States v. Klintock (1820), the Court distinguished Palmerin {{a case involving}} piracy by a U.S. citizen, claiming to act {{under the authority of}} the Mexican Republic, committed against a Danish ship and citizens, under the fraudulent claim that the Danes were Spanish (Spain being at war with the Mexican Republic)on the grounds that the victims in Palmer were not subjects of a nation recognized by the United States. In United States v. Furlong (1820), sometimes referred to as United States v. Pirates, authored by Justice Johnson (a dissenter in Palmer), the Court distinguished Palmer again, primarily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> the pirate vessel had no nationality (it was an American ship prior to being hijacked). United States v. Holmes (1820) distinguished Palmer on the same ground, further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag.|$|E

5|$|In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court {{granted the}} writ to {{two members of}} the Burr conspiracy. Dr. Erick Bollman and Samuel Swartwout, having been apprehended in New Orleans, were transported to Charleston and then Baltimore on a navy vesselnotwithstanding the writs of habeas corpus issued by a {{territorial}} judge in New Orleans and a district judge in Charlestown. The United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia issued an arrest warrant for Bollman and Swartwout (who were already in military custody), slated the case for trial in D.C., and denied the prisoners bail; Judge William Cranch (also the Supreme Court's reporter of decisions) dissented in part <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> there was no probable cause for the arrest warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment. The Senate passed, but the House rejected, legislation that would have suspended the writ for three months and legalized Bollman and Swartwout's arrests. Nearly every member of Congress attended the oral arguments in the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong, the {{respondent}} challenged his conviction for corruption <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which extends {{the effect of}} the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens (but not non-citizens) occurring outside Singapore, discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12(1). The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued that this results in the {{different}} treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed. However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest, and to advance its policies step by step. Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12(1).|$|E
50|$|The Missionaries didn't {{recognize}} Tavita as rightful heir, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{excuse that}} he was not born in church wedlock. The opposition opposed Tione as heir, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> he was part Rarotongan. Tavita, however, died before his father. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> death of Numangatini, in 1878, a district chief installed No'oroa as ariki <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> he was of senior descent, and full Mangaian.|$|R

5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} Czech {{government}} and the Sudeten Germans dragged on through mid-1938. They achieved little result; Sudeten leader Konrad Henlein was under private instructions from Hitler not to reach an agreement. On 3 August, Walter Runciman (by now Lord Runciman) travelled to Prague as a mediator sent by the British government. Over the next two weeks, Runciman met separately with Henlein, the Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš and other leaders, but made no progress. On 30 August Chamberlain met his Cabinet and Ambassador Henderson and secured their backing—with only First Lord of the Admiralty Duff Cooper dissenting against Chamberlain's policy to pressure Czechoslovakia into making concessions, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> Britain was then {{in no position to}} back up any threat to go to war.|$|E
5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that,</b> among other things, the declarant {{did not apply}} for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself {{to be a member of}} the community to which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities. During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities may be given an opportunity by the Community Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E
