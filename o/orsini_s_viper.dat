40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of animal and human physiological processes owes much to {{over a century}} of study of natural toxins. The neurotoxins of kraits (bungarotoxins from Bungarus spp.) and cobras (Naja spp.) have helped define the acetylcholine receptor and neuromuscular transmission. Axonal trafficking and sodium channels have been studied using tetrodotoxin from the blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena spp.) and puffer fish (fugu). Unravelling {{the complexities of the}} human coagulation pathways (intrinsic and extrinsic) has involved studies using haemotoxins from various snakes, including Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vipers</b> (Daboia russelii), the saw-scaled vipers (Echis spp.) and the Australian taipans (Oxyuranus spp.).

40|$|Background:Snake bite {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{neglected}} public health issues in poor rural communities worldwide. In addition to the clinical effects of envenoming, treatment with antivenom frequently causes serious adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and pyrogenic reactions. We aimed to investigate the immune responses to Sri Lankan snake envenoming (predominantly by Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>viper)</b> and antivenom treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings:Plasma concentrations of Interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), soluble TNF receptor I (sTNFRI), anaphylatoxins (C 3 a, C 4 a, C 5 a; markers of complement activation), mast cell tryptase (MCT), and histamine were measured in 120 Sri Lankan snakebite victims, both before and after treatment with antivenom. Immune mediator concentrations were correlated with envenoming features and the severity of antivenom-induced reactions including anaphylaxis. Envenoming was associated with complement activation and increased cytokine concentrations prior to antivenom administration, which correlated with non-specific systemic symptoms of envenoming but not with coagulopathy or neurotoxicity. Typical hypersensitivity reactions to antivenom occurred in 77 / 120 patients (64...|$|R
50|$|On Wednesday 12 September 1471, Pope Sixtus {{decided to}} take a {{vacation}} from the heat and persistent pestilences, and so travelled north some twenty miles to the lakeside town of Bracciano, which belonged to Virginio Orsini. Cardinal Cosma <b>Orsini</b> of <b>Ss.</b> Nereo ed Achilleo was with him, despite a severe case of the gout, to protect the family interests. On 1 October Sixtus decided to visit the alum mines at Tolfa, and then on 2 October he proceeded to Civitavecchia, where he wanted to see the fleet under the command of Cardinal Paolo Fregosi. After wandering around Tuscany, the Pope returned to Rome on 17 October. Cardinal Cosma remained at Bracciano.|$|R
5000|$|Cardinal Robert de Pontigny {{participated in}} the Conclave to elect Pope Benedict's successor. Fifteen {{cardinals}} {{participated in the}} Conclave, but only ten were in the Conclave for the final vote. The two Colonna cardinals, who had been deposed by Boniface VIII in 1297, were not in attendance. [...] The Conclave began on 17 July 1304. [...] There was, however, no easy decision. The French faction was led by Cardinal Napoleone Orsini, and included Giovanni Boccamazza (Tusculum), Giovanni Minio (Porto), Niccolò Alberti da Prato (Ostia), Landolfo Brancaccio (S. Angelo in Pescheria), Guglielmo Longhi (S. Nicola in Carcere Tulliano), Jean Le Moine (SS. Marcellino e Pietro), Robert de Pontigny (S. Pudenziana), Riccardo Petroni (S. Eustachio), and ultimately Walter Winterburn (S. Sabina). His opponent was another Orsini, Cardinal Matteo Rosso Orsini, whose group {{is known to have}} included his nephews Francesco <b>Orsini,</b> (<b>S.</b> Lucia) and Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi (S. Giorgio in Velabro), Teodorico Ranieri (Palestrina), Leonardo Patrassi (Albano), Pedro Rodriguez (Sabina), Francesco Caetani (S. Maria in Cosmedin), Gentile Partino (S. Martino ai Monti), and Luca Fieschi, (S. Maria in Via Lata). Archbishop Bertrand de Got, the younger brother of the late Cardinal Bérard de Got, Archbishop of Bordeaux since 1299, and a subject of the King of England, had been nominated by the faction of Cardinal Matteo Rosso Orsini as long as six months before his final election (approximately the first half of December, 1304). [...] Finally, on 5 July 1305, after some dirty tricks, a two-thirds vote in favor of the Archbishop of Bordeaux was achieved. [...] He became Clement V, and was crowned in Lyons on 14 November 1305. He never visited Rome. The Papacy had moved to France.|$|R

50|$|Then, on June 3, 1273, Vicedomino de Vicedominis {{was one of}} five {{cardinals}} {{created by}} his uncle, Pope Gregory X (1271-1276). He was transferred from Aix to the Suburban Roman See of Palestrina. The creation {{took place during the}} Ecumenical Council of Vienne, and therefore Vicedomino did not proceed immediately to his new diocese, but instead participated in the Council. On 25 June 1275, he was granted the titular church of San Marcello in Rome in commendam ('as caretaker'). When the Council ended, and Pope Gregory began his return journey to Rome, Vicedomino was (unaccountably) not one of the travelling party. The Oath of Fidelity of the Emperor Rudolf mentions seven cardinals as present in Lausanne on 20 October 1275: Petrus Ostiensis, Ancherus Pantaleone of S. Prassede, Guglelmus de Bray of S. Marco, Ottobono Fieschi of S. Adriano, Giacomo Savelli of S. Maria in Cosmedin, Gottifridus de Alatri of S. Giorgio in Velabro, and Mattheus Rosso <b>Orsini</b> of <b>S.</b> Maria in Porticu—but not Vicedomino de Vicedominis, Cardinal Bishop of Palestrina. And when the Pope died at Arezzo on 10 January 1276, only three Cardinal Bishops were with him: Peter of Tarantaise, Peter Juliani and Bertrand de St. Martin—but not Vicedomino de Vicedominis, Cardinal Bishop of Palestrina.|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{the last}} decade {{combining}} transcriptomics with established proteomics methods have made possible rapid identification and quantification of protein families in snake venoms. Although over 100 studies have been published, the value of this information is increased when it is collated, allowing rapid assimilation and evaluation of evolutionary trends, geographical variation, and possible medical implications. This review brings together all compositional studies of snake venom proteomes published {{in the last}} decade. Compositional studies were identified for 132 snake species: 42 from 360 (12 %) Elapidae (elapids), 20 from 101 (20 %) Viperinae (true vipers), 65 from 239 (27 %) Crotalinae (pit vipers), and five species of non-front-fanged snakes. Approximately 90 % of their total venom composition consisted of eight protein families for elapids, 11 protein families for viperines and ten protein families for crotalines. There were four dominant protein families: phospholipase A 2 s (the most common across all front-fanged snakes), metalloproteases, serine proteases and three-finger toxins. There were six secondary protein families: cysteine-rich secretory proteins, l-amino acid oxidases, kunitz peptides, C-type lectins/snaclecs, disintegrins and natriuretic peptides. Elapid venoms contained mostly three-finger toxins and phospholipase A 2 <b>s</b> and <b>viper</b> venoms metalloproteases, phospholipase A 2 s and serine proteases. Although 63 protein families were identified, more than half were present in < 5 % of snake species studied and always in low abundance. The importance of these minor component proteins remains unknown...|$|R
5000|$|Peter of Tarantaise was {{elevated}} to the cardinalate on 3 June 1273, in a Consistory held at Orvieto by Pope Gregory X, and named Bishop of the suburbicarian See of Ostia. He {{participated in the}} Second Ecumenical Council of Lyons. [...] During the Council, he sang the Funeral Mass and delivered the sermon at the funeral of Cardinal Bonaventure, Bishop of Albano, who had died on 15 July 1274, and was buried {{on the same day}} in the Church of the Franciscans in Lyons. Pope Gregory, the Fathers of the Council and the Roman Curia all attended. [...] After the conclusion of the Council, Pope Gregory spent the Autumn and Winter in Lyons. He and his suite departed Lyons in May, 1275; he left Vienne shortly after 30 September 1275, and arrived in Lausanne on 6 October. There he met with the Emperor-elect Rudolph, King of the Romans, and on October 20 received his oath of fealty. There were seven cardinals with the Pope at the time, and their names are mentioned in the record of the oath-taking: Petrus Ostiensis, Ancherus Pantaleone of S. Prassede, Guglelmus de Bray of S. Marco, Ottobono Fieschi of S. Adriano, Giacomo Savelli of S. Maria in Cosmedin, Gottifridus de Alatri of S. Giorgio in Velabro, and Mattheus Rosso <b>Orsini</b> of <b>S.</b> Maria in Porticu. The party reached Milan on Tuesday, 12 November 1275, and Florence on 18 December. The papal party reached Arezzo in time for Christmas, but the Pope was weak and ill. The stay in Arezzo was prolonged until Gregory X died, on 10 January 1276. Only three cardinals were at his deathbed: Peter of Tarantaise, Peter Juliani of Tusculum, and Bertrand de Saint-Martin of Sabina, all cardinal-bishops. [...] According to the Constitution [...] "Ubi Periculum" [...] which had been approved by the Council of Lyons, the Conclave to elect his successor should begin ten days after the pope's death.|$|R
40|$|In The Human Stain (2000), Philip Roth invokes {{what has}} come to be Philip Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s most lasting {{literary}} claim, railing against the bridle [that] is still on public rhetoric, the inspiration it provides for personal posturing, the persistence just about everywhere of this de-virilizing pulpit virtue-mongering that H. L. Mencken identified with boobism, that Philip Wylie thought of as Momism, that the Europeans unhistorically call American puritanism, that the likes of Ronald Reagan call America 2 ̆ 7 s core values, and that maintains widespread jurisdiction by masquerading itself as something else—as everything else [,…] a dominatrix in a thousand disguises (his emphasis, Roth 153). ^ Although Roth does not cite Wylie as being correct in laying blame for this “virtue-mongering” at the door of the feminine—for he writes that Wylie “thought of [this] as Momism” (my emphasis, Roth 153) —Roth redeploys a set of anxieties regarding the fear of emasculation and effeminization that are central to Wylie 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Generation of <b>Vipers</b> (1942), Tomorrow! (1954), and Triumph (1962). Within Roth 2 ̆ 7 s The Human Stain, this fear of a “de-virilizing” presence in American society is referenced to the feminine: The Human Stain anthropomorphizes “propriety” in the figure of a “dominatrix,” a cruel and harsh mistress of culture (Roth 153). I use Roth 2 ̆ 7 s invocation of Philip Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s literary contributions to call attention to the lasting, but subtle, influence of this writer on American culture—and to note that Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s influence builds upon pre-existing aspects of American culture, such as the “American puritanism” that Roth directly refers to, and the Anglo-European traditions that inform this same “puritanism” (Roth 153). Philip Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s work modernizes, for his time, traditional modes of blaming, targeting, and taming the feminine, doing so under the guise of producing national, cultural, and personal reform. Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s backdrop—the field against which these injurious acts are performed, which is also a functional setting and means of injuring—is the possible event of nuclear holocaust. Tomorrow! and Triumph employ nuclear war in a process of violent cultural reformation. ^ Given his toxification of the feminine, Wylie has understandably come to be a somewhat toxic literary personage himself. However, this is one of the most pressing reasons that his writing demands study—especially from a feminist perspective. Reading Wylie through Michel Foucault, Elaine Scarry, and other like critics of process by which the human is an object of power, I approach the textual set of Generation of Vipers, Tomorrow!, and Triumph as a tripartite case: a body of knowledge, or a knowable body of sorts, which may be studied and written about so as to generate information that sheds light on archaic and persistent cultural pathologies, and provide an illustration of the culture of the Cold War. ...|$|R
