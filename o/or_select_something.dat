50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of selections, cut buffers, and drag-and-drop in the X Window System allow a user to transfer data from one window to another. Selections and cut buffer are used (typically) when a user <b>selects</b> text <b>or</b> some other {{data in a}} window and pastes in a different window. Drag-and-drop is used when a user <b>selects</b> <b>something</b> in a window, then clicks on the selection and drags it into another window.|$|R
40|$|In view {{navigation}} a user moves {{about an}} information structure by <b>selecting</b> <b>something</b> {{in the current}} view of the structure. This paper explores the implications of rudimentary requirements for effective view navigation, namely that, despite the vastness of an information structure, the views must be small, moving around must not take too many steps and the route to any target be must be discoverable. The analyses help rationalize existing practice, give insight into the difficulties, and suggest strategies for design...|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} tree aspect which dominated the gameplay {{of the first}} game is largely absent in the sequel, where decision making is more focused on <b>selecting</b> <b>something</b> on-screen rather than the choice between rigid alternatives. For example, upon entering a room, the player can choose between several actions, such as looking around the room, examining a wardrobe or examining a bodybag. These choices are not presented as text choices {{as they were in}} the first game, but are instead available directly in the in-game interface.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} section of the article Asheim goes over the {{difference}} of censorship of a book by the law or by a town, versus the choice of a librarian not to <b>select</b> <b>something</b> for her library. He states that the librarian is not censoring because she is making a choice that only affects her specific institution, whereas the choice the censors are making affect an entire town or nation. The librarian is not saying that the book cannot be circulated, only that she is not going to circulate it. Patrons are still able to get it elsewhere.|$|R

30|$|Attention is {{initially}} drawn {{to everything that}} increases the quality of decisions currently under discussion. In an “extended present”, future research is increasingly transformed into an evaluation technique: the future is essentially dependent {{on the way in}} which something new is identified and ordered. It is concerned both with discarding irrelevant terms from the complex of simultaneity and with <b>selecting</b> <b>something</b> that is specific, important, complex, insecure, is not yet in existence or only appears diffuse. This intelligent modularisation of possibilities is becoming the core competence of future research. In any case, the focus is no longer on the intrinsic value of what is new, of what is yet to be: the future.|$|R
50|$|Audition {{pieces are}} not always from the show the actor is being {{considered}} for; an actor wishing to be cast in Hamlet may not do a monologue from that play. Most performers do {{have a range of}} audition pieces and <b>select</b> <b>something</b> appropriate; an actor auditioning for Hamlet would have a dramatic Shakespearean monologue ready, and not perform a monologue from an Oscar Wilde comedy, or a contemporary playwright. Some auditions involve cold reading, or performing a script that the actor is not familiar with. Auditions often involve monologues or speeches, but not always. In some cases, an auditionee is asked to read a scene (with a second person reading the other character).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate how the Australian public's energy preferences may change when {{information on the}} costs and carbon dioxide emissions profiles of energy technologies are provided {{with a view to}} informing policy makers, technology developers and those in the energy industry. In addition, the research explored the effect of presenting this information in differing formats through the use of an online tool versus providing information in a tabular format. Previously, on average people have been reluctant to agree to price increases when asked the general question. However, when given very specific detail about cost-emission trade-offs and how to achieve them they appear to be more comfortable <b>selecting</b> <b>something</b> with reasonable ambition...|$|R
