5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (1852–1952), {{also known}} as TCI and the Tennessee Company, was a major American steel {{manufacturer}} with interests in coal and iron <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> and railroad operations. Originally based entirely within Tennessee, it relocated most of its business to Alabama {{in the late nineteenth}} century. With a sizable real estate portfolio, the company owned several Birmingham satellite towns, including Ensley, Fairfield, Docena, Edgewater and Bayview.|$|E
5|$|When M-35 was {{routed through}} {{downtown}} Negaunee, it joined Bus. M-28 northward {{from the east}} fork of Silver Street on to US41/M-28. This routing was moved to bypass the city in 1964 when iron <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> activity destabilized {{a portion of the}} M-35 routing southeast of town. From this point on, Bus. M-28 has not shared its routing with any other state trunklines.|$|E
5|$|Bus. M-28 {{begins at}} a signalized {{intersection}} on US41/M-28 with Lakeshore Drive {{in the city}} of Ishpeming. The trunkline runs south along Lakeshore Drive under the tracks of the Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad (LS) and southeasterly towards Lake Bancroft. South of the lake, Bus. M-28 turns east on Division Street. Traffic along the highway here can view the towers of the Cliffs Shaft Mine Museum; the museum is dedicated to telling the story of underground iron <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> in the region.|$|E

5000|$|The {{hamlet of}} Sling derives {{its name from}} a local iron <b>ore</b> <b>mine.</b> In 1838 G. E. Jackson, a Birmingham ironmaster, sank [...] "Old Sling" [...] <b>ore</b> <b>mine</b> below old {{workings}} at Clearwell Meend. It {{was one of the}} larger iron <b>ore</b> <b>mines</b> in the Forest of Dean, and in the mid-1860s it employed nearly 100 people. The mine had closed by 1921.|$|R
50|$|Iron <b>ore</b> <b>mines</b> {{were also}} worked {{near the town}} in the 19th century until {{the closure of the}} Cinderford {{ironworks}} led to the abandonment of Buckshaft and other <b>ore</b> <b>mines</b> near the town in 1899.|$|R
5|$|In 1931, Stojanović was {{contracted}} to the Prijedor {{branch of the}} state railway company to provide healthcare for its employees. In 1936, he was {{contracted to}} an iron <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> company in Ljubija, a town near Prijedor, and would visit the mining company clinic twice a week. He also taught hygiene at the gymnasium in Prijedor. Together with other intellectuals from the town, he gave lectures to the miners at their club in Ljubija. His lectures were usually about medical issues, but he also described {{the economic and social}} position of workers in more advanced countries. He socialised with the miners and treated their family members for free. He was very active socially, and also participated in sports. In 1932, he founded the tennis club of Prijedor, which continues to bear his name. Stojanović once bought new kit for all members of the Rudar Ljubija football club. His contracts with the railway company and the mining company were both terminated in 1939. The railway employees protested in Prijedor, and Stojanović's contract with that company was subsequently renewed.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{impending}} cyclone halted local industries such as oil production and iron <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> and exporting. The Port of Port Hedland, a highly important iron ore shipping terminal, was forced to close for about 52 hours, contributing to inflated iron ore prices and delayed shipments. Multiple companies suspended work at oil fields and mines throughout the region, cutting national oil production by 25% and iron ore exports by 4.7% versus the previous month. Overall, Lua is attributed to $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in lost revenue. Lua produced strong winds and widespread rainfall on land, but damage was limited {{by the lack of}} population in the storm's path. The Pardoo Roadhouse bore the brunt of the storm, and damage was reported at several other cattle stations and homesteads; at these sites, the storm damaged the exteriors of various structures and brought down swaths of trees. Central Western Australia endured several days of record-breaking rainfall and cool weather. The Government of Western Australia provided disaster relief funds to the hardest-hit areas, and Lua was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|The {{documented}} {{history of}} Strandzha dates back several millennia. The oldest traces of human habitation are stone axes and ceramic fragments {{found in the}} Ahtopol peninsula and are dated from the Neolithic period (c. 6000—3000 BC). Since the mid-1st millennium BC the mountain was inhabited by the Thracian tribes Thyni and Asti and {{was part of the}} Odrysian kingdom. The Thracians of Strandzha were infamous for their pirate raids. By the 2nd century BC, the power of the Odrysian kingdom declined and it became a client state of the Roman Republic. However, it kept its independence until 46 BC, when it was annexed by the Roman Empire, forming the province of Thracia. The region remained part of the Roman Empire and its successor the Byzantine Empire. In Roman times, Strandzha was a centre of copper and iron <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> and metallurgy. In the late 6th and early 7th centuries the Slavs settled in most of the Balkans, including Strandzha. The whole territory of the modern park was included in the Bulgarian Empire {{for the first time in}} the aftermath of the Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896. Strandzha remained a contested region between Bulgaria and Byzantium throughout the Middle Ages. In the 14th century, Bulgarian emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371) gave refuge to the Hesychastic monk Gregory of Sinai and provided funds for the construction of a monastery near Paroria, in the homonymous protected area in the modern park, which attracted clerics from Bulgaria, Byzantium and Serbia.|$|E
50|$|As {{the steel}} {{furnaces}} modernized, labor cost rose, and geological faults {{in the local}} <b>ore</b> <b>mines</b> made the <b>ore</b> harder to reach, it became more economical to purchase pelletized ore from distant sources than to continue <b>mining</b> <b>ore</b> from Red Mountain. The last <b>ore</b> <b>mine</b> on Red Mountain closed in 1962 and was operated by US Steel. The last <b>ore</b> <b>mine</b> in the Birmingham district closed in 1972. It was the Pyne Mine off Highway 150 near Bessemer and was operated by the Woodward Iron Company.|$|R

25|$|Since the {{shutdown}} of Bellefonte Furnace, President Frazer {{had been trying}} to reach a rate agreement with John Reilly of the furnace company. They came to terms in July 1892, and Reilly began making arrangements to restart <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> and put the furnace back in blast. It resumed ironmaking in March 1893, and the Bellefonte Central acquired additional ore cars to serve the traffic. At the end of April, Tom Shoemaker resigned as superintendent to tend to his expanding duties supervising Bellefonte Furnace and <b>ore</b> <b>mining</b> at Graysdale. He was replaced by Francis H. Thomas, a long-time Reading employee. Unfortunately, the new furnace traffic would prove ephemeral. The Panic of 1893 forced Bellefonte Furnace to shut down again in July, after only four months of operation. While the railroad was still shipping ore to the McCoy and Linn Iron Works, Shoemaker could find few other customers for Graysdale ore and its importance to the railroad again declined.|$|E
