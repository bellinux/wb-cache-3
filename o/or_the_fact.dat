5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when {{reared in}} isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches {{were less likely to}} leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} minimum range {{continued}} to be raised, working {{its way through the}} Air Ministry and eventually to Harold Lardner, head of what was then known as the Stanmore Research Centre. Rowe and his deputy Bennett Lewis were called to meet with Lardner to discuss the issue. Apparently without informing Lardner of Bowen and Hanbury Brown's potential solution, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they could not work on it due to the ongoing installations, they agreed to have Lewis investigate the matter. Lewis then sent a contract to EMI to see what they could do. According to both Bowen and Hanbury Brown, Rowe and Lewis instigated these events deliberately to pull control of the AI project from the AI team.|$|E

5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E

40|$|Classical logical {{systems are}} closed worlds. Assertions are true or false, {{relationships}} between different {{components of the}} system do not change, and a chain of inferences, once made, endures for ever. The systems are monotonic. The real world is not so simple; {{but there are plenty}} of cases where classical logic is sufficiently close to reality (or vice versa) for conventional logic to be useful- if that were not so, classical logic would presumably never have been invented! Expert systems rely on knowledge bases which contain, along with factual information, rules for arguments which we know to be reliable or to which we can attach some measure of reliability. In either case, the results are derived by logical processes, and, though their reliability may be in question, the question attaches to the validity of the rules, not to the logical process themselves. In other cases, though, the rules themselves may be inconsistent with <b>the</b> known <b>facts.</b> If this happens, either the rules are wrong, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> are, in some sense, unacceptable- we have a conflict, and to resolve it we must change either <b>the</b> rules <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts.</b> Which one we choose to change depends on circumstances. If our facts are well established and the rules are meant to describe <b>or</b> interpret <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> in some way, then we must change the rules. A...|$|R

The reason why the almond shape was favoured is not clear: it is possible that there is some aerodynamic advantage, but it seems equally likely that there is some more prosaic reason, such as the shape being easy to extract from a mould, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it will rest in a sling cradle with little danger of rolling out.|$|E
25|$|Fibers {{have many}} uses in remote sensing. In some applications, the sensor is itself an optical fiber. In other cases, fiber {{is used to}} connect a non-fiberoptic sensor to a {{measurement}} system. Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that no electrical power is needed at the remote location, or because many sensors can be multiplexed {{along the length of}} a fiber by using different wavelengths of light for each sensor, or by sensing the time delay as light passes along the fiber through each sensor. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an optical time-domain reflectometer.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} death in 1695, Huygens {{completed}} Cosmotheoros, published posthumously in 1698. In it he speculated on the existence of extraterrestrial life, on other planets, which he imagined was similar to that on Earth. Such speculations were not uncommon at the time, justified by Copernicanism or the plenitude principle. But Huygens went into greater detail, though without the benefit of understanding Newton's laws of gravitation, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that oxygen is necessary for life and distinct from other atmospheric gases. The work, translated into English in its year of publication, has been seen as in the fanciful tradition of Francis Godwin, John Wilkins and Cyrano de Bergerac, and fundamentally Utopian; and also to owe in its concept of planet to cosmography in the sense of Peter Heylin.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability of}} a curved mirror to form an image may have been known {{since the time of}} Euclid and had been {{extensively}} studied by Alhazen in the 11th century. Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. Niccolò Zucchi, an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book Optica philosophia of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that his head partially obstructed the image.|$|E
25|$|In reality, {{just as one}} can {{discover}} from his poems and letters and just as Caragiale remembered, Eminescu was seldom {{under the influence of}} boisterous subconscious motivations. Eminescu's life was but an overlap of different-sized cycles, made up of sudden bursts that were nurtured by dreams and crises due to the impact with reality. The cycles could last from a few hours or days to weeks or months, depending on the importance of events, or could even last longer, when they were linked to the events that significantly marked his life, as such was his relation with Veronica, his political activity during his years as a student, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he attended the gatherings at the Junimea society or the articles he published in the newspaper Timpul. He used to have a unique manner of describing his own crisis of jealousy.|$|E
25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E

500|$|The word, [...] "untrimmed" [...] in line eight, can {{be taken}} two ways: First, {{in the sense of}} loss of {{decoration}} and frills, and second, in the sense of untrimmed sails on a ship. [...] In the first interpretation, the poem reads that beautiful things naturally lose their fanciness over time. [...] In the second, it reads that nature is a ship with sails not adjusted to wind changes in order to correct course. [...] This, in combination with the words [...] "nature's changing course", creates an oxymoron: the unchanging change of nature, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the only thing that does not change is change. [...] This line in the poem creates a shift from the mutability of the first eight lines, into the eternity of the last six. [...] Both change and eternity are then acknowledged and challenged by the final line.|$|E
500|$|Following the court's decision, {{an appeal}} was lodged {{by the state}} {{prosecutor}} against Patrick Head and Adrian Newey. On 22 November 1999, the appeal absolved Head and Newey of all charges, stating that no new evidence had come to light (there was missing data from the black box recorder on Senna's car due to damage, and 1.6 seconds of video from the onboard camera of Senna's car was unavailable because the broadcaster switched to another car's camera just before the accident), and so under Article 530 of the Italian Penal Code, the accusation had to be declared as [...] "non-existent <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> doesn't subsist". This appeal result was annulled in January 2003, as the Court of Cassation believed that Article 530 was misinterpreted, and a retrial was ordered. On 27 May 2005, Newey was acquitted of all charges while Head's case was [...] "timed out" [...] under a statute of limitations. The Italian Court of Appeal, on 13 April 2007, stated the following in the verdict numbered 15050: [...] "It has been determined that the accident {{was caused by a}} steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control". Even being found responsible for Senna's accident, Patrick Head was not arrested, as the verdict was delivered past the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter.|$|E

On May 7, 1998 Virus defeated El Oriental to win the vacant Mexican National Lightweight Championship, a title CMLL had brought back to help showcase smaller workers such as Virus. After winning the title Virus worked a storyline feud against El Oriental, centering on Virus' Mexican Lightweight title and Orientál's Districto Federatl Lightweight title. Despite several title matches neither belt changed hands {{during the course of the}} storyline. By 1999 CMLL decided that it was time to crown a new CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion as Virus was still technically the champion despite not having worked as a mini for over a year. Instead of making Virus return to the Minis division to lose the title CMLL decided to give the championship to Ultimo Dragoncito and then subsequently announce that Ultimo Dragoncito had [...] "won" [...] the title on an undisclosed day in October, 1999. In 1999 to 2000 CMLL made several tours of Japan to establish a [...] "CMLL Japan" [...] branch, Virus was one of the workers who regularly toured Japan and would capture the CMLL Japan Super Lightweight Championship on November 25, 1999. On August 6, 2000 Virus lost the CMLL Japan Super Lightweight title to Ricky Marvin and then on November 29, 2000 also lost the Mexican National Lightweight title to Ricky Marvin.
