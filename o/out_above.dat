5|$|Government {{officials}} {{stood on}} trucks, using loudspeakers to call <b>out</b> <b>above</b> the noise, urging the Buddhists — primarily {{high school and}} university students who had arrived on bicycles — to disperse. The announcements were met by jeers when the government spokesperson blamed the unrest on the Vietcong. At 18:30, the military personnel at the scene dispersed the crowd by emptying vials of brownish-red liquid on the heads of praying protestors, resulting in 67 Buddhists being hospitalized for chemical injuries. The symptoms consisted of severe blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments. The crowd responded angrily to the apparent use of poison gas, and the incident became a public relations disaster for Diệm.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project <b>out</b> <b>above</b> the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E

5|$|The tomb monument's design {{included}} {{figures of}} the three Virtues in niches, Cossa's family arms, a gilded bronze recumbent effigy laid <b>out</b> <b>above</b> an inscription-bearing sarcophagus supported on corbel brackets, and above it a Madonna and Child in a half-lunette, with a canopy over all. At {{the time of its}} completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence, and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo. The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements to each of them has been debated by art historians, as have the interpretations of its design and iconography.|$|E
5|$|The three-storey {{north tower}} is reached by a 13th-century {{staircase}} in the hall, which leads onto the first floor. The first floor {{was divided into}} two separate rooms shortly after {{the construction of the}} tower, and contain various decorative tiles, probably from Laurence's house in Ludlow. The walls of the second floor are mostly half-timbered, jettying <b>out</b> <b>above</b> the stone walls beneath them; the tower has its original 13th-century fireplace, although the wooden roof is 19th-century, modeled on the 13th-century original, and the windows are 17th-century insertions. The details and the carpenters' personal marks on the woodwork show that the hall, solar and north tower were all constructed {{under the direction of the}} same carpenter in the late 1280s and early 1290s.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{even as the}} Americans were {{attempting}} to clear the tunnels, heavy hand-to-hand fighting broke <b>out</b> <b>above</b> ground and Haldane was later awarded the Silver Star for his actions when he rushed a bunker while under fire armed only with a pistol, {{in order to give}} first aid to a number of wounded soldiers. His courage inspired his men to complete the assault, and ultimately helped ensure the successful evacuation of the casualties and the capture of their objective. That evening the battalions of US 3rd Infantry Brigade had completed searching their assigned area of operation, and the following morning they were withdrawn from the operation. The brigade's involvement in Crimp had been limited, losing six killed and 45 wounded, while 22 Viet Cong had been killed. It was subsequently redeployed on Operation Buckskin.|$|E

5|$|In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens {{a little}} girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. The bird is later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} an unseen monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking {{for a woman who}} is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking <b>out</b> <b>above</b> the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks all over her face.|$|E

25|$|The present mansion house {{hotel is}} of a baronial style in dressed red sandstone, {{constructed}} around an earlier house in 1873 by the architects Barbour and Bowie and extended {{by the same}} architects 1905 – 09. The principal (south-east) range has a complex wide faced frontage and incorporates a peculiar round tower with a rectangular second stage corbelled <b>out</b> <b>above.</b> An armorial panel dated 1598 was built into the entrance tower range in 1909. The house has a fine panelled entrance hall and snooker room, together with an elegant staircase and 21 en suite bedrooms; it is placed within 18.2 ha (45 acres) of parkland and woodland.|$|E
25|$|During {{the initial}} {{restoration}} period from 1922 to 1929, {{a considerable amount}} of structural repair work was carried <b>out</b> <b>above</b> the waterline and mainly above the middle deck. In 1928, King George V was able to unveil a tablet celebrating the completion of the work, although restoration and maintenance still continued {{under the supervision of the}} Society for Nautical Research. Restoration was suspended during the Second World War, and in 1941, Victory sustained further damage when a bomb dropped by the Luftwaffe destroyed one of the steel cradles and part of the foremast. On one occasion, German radio propaganda claimed that the ship had been destroyed by a bomb, and the Admiralty had to issue a denial.|$|E
