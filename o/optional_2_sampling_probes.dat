A total of 41 clinical specimens were positive for echoviruses (23 samples), herpes simplex virus type <b>2</b> (4 <b>samples),</b> varicella-zoster virus (4 samples), human herpesvirus 7 (1 sample), human herpesvirus 6 A (1 sample) and 6 B (<b>2</b> <b>samples),</b> Epstein-Barr virus (three samples), polyomavirus JC (1 <b>sample),</b> and cytomegalovirus (<b>2</b> <b>samples).</b> <b>Probes</b> for herpes simplex virus type 1, polyomavirus BK, and mumps and measles viruses were also included on the array. Three samples were false negative by the microarray assay due to discordant results between the multiplex PCR for all 13 viruses simultaneously and the virus-specific PCR alone. Fifteen CSF specimens were true negative. The clinical sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of the assay were 93, 100, 100, and 83 %, respectively, when the results were compared to those of the single-virus PCR, which was used as the “gold standard. ” The microarray-based virus detection assay is qualitative and provides a single-format diagnostic tool for the detection of panviral CNS infections...|$|R

The tests conducted by PNNL during July 2010 on the HFEF system are described in this report. The <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> location is approximately 20 feet {{from the base of the}} stack. The stack base is in the second floor of the HFEF, and has a building ventilation stream (limited potential radioactive effluent) as well as a process stream (potential radioactive effluent, but HEPA-filtered) that feeds into it. The tests conducted on the duct indicate that the process stream is insufficiently mixed with the building ventilation stream. As a result, the air <b>sampling</b> <b>probe</b> location does not meet the criteria of the N 13. 1 - 1999 standard.

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been recently received {{on the impact of}} aircraft-produced aerosols upon the global climate. Sampling particles directly from jet engines has been performed by different research groups in the U. S. and Europe. However, a large variation has been observed among published data on the conversion efficiency and emission indexes of jet engines. The variation results surely from the differences in test engine types, engine operation conditions, and environmental conditions. The other factor that could result in the observed variation is the performance of <b>sampling</b> <b>probes</b> used. Unfortunately, it is often neglected in the jet engine community. Particle losses during the sampling, transport, and dilution processes are often not discussed/considered in literatures.

40|$|The {{appearance}} time of an analyte {{relative to}} {{the timing of the}} <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> insertion is an important factor that determines the integrated intensity and precision of direct sample insertion inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. The ICP background drops significantly with the insertion of a <b>sample</b> <b>probe.</b> Matrix effects can be severe if the the analyte appearance times are shifted {{relative to the}} background drop. In this study, matrix effects of NaCl on the temporal emission profiles and integrated emission intensities of Zn I and Zn II were shown to relate to the appearance time of the analyte. The peak maxima of the temporal profiles of Zn I and Zn II emissions were displaced by about 0. 2 s in an aqueous matrix, but the maxima coincided in NaCl matrices. In addition, integrated emission intensities of the more difficult to excite Zn II species increased with an earlier appearance time. The changes in peak profiles and relative intensities are due to redistribution in the proportion of Zn atoms and Zn ions in the vaporized Zn population. The effects of the appearance time of Zn were further demonstrated using different <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> insertion speeds to change the appearance time of the analyte relative to the background drop. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The {{concentration}} of {{salt in the}} sample is a factor {{that needs to be}} considered when preparing a MALDI sample as well. Salts can aid a MALDI spectra by preventing aggregation or precipitation while stabilizing the sample. However, interfering signals can be observed due to side reactions of the matrix with the sample, such {{as in the case of}} the matrix interacting with alkali metal ions which can impair the analysis of the spectra. Typically the amount of salt in the matrix only becomes a problem in very high concentrations, such as 1 molar. The problem of having too high a {{concentration of}} salt in the sample can be solved by first running the solution through liquid chromatography to help purify the sample, but this method is time consuming and results in the loss of some of the sample to be analyzed. Another method is focused on purification once the sample solution is deposited onto the <b>sample</b> <b>probe.</b> Many <b>sample</b> <b>probes</b> can be designed to have a membrane on the surface that can selectively bind the sample in question to the probe surface. The surface can then be rinsed off to remove all unnecessary salts or background molecules. The matrix of appropriate salt concentration can then be deposited directly onto the <b>sample</b> on the <b>probe</b> surface and crystallized there. Despite these negative effects of salt concentration, a separate desalting step is usually not necessary in the case of proteins, because the selection of appropriate buffer salts prevents the occurrence of this problem.How the sample and matrix is deposited on the surface of the <b>sample</b> <b>probe</b> needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well.
