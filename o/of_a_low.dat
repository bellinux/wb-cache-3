Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E

5|$|Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal {{indicate}} that the city's newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of Caracol and Ucanal in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse. It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River. Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul.

Following improvement in the convective structure, the JTWC began warning on the cyclone as Tropical Depression 18W at 18:00UTC, at which time the depression was situated roughly 665km (415mi) west-northwest of Guam.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the risk <b>of</b> having <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant associated {{with changes in}} social, environmental, and genetic factors. DESIGN: Population based, historical cohort study using the Danish medical birth registry and Statistic Denmark's fertility database. SUBJECTS: All women who had <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant (or = 2500 g and to a subsequent liveborn infant (unexposed cohort, n = 10, 211). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk <b>of</b> having <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant in the outcome birth as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> changes in male partner, area of residence, type of job, and social status between the two births. RESULTS: Women in the exposed cohort showed a high risk (18. 5 %) <b>of</b> having <b>a</b> subsequent <b>low</b> birthweight infant while women in the unexposed cohort had <b>a</b> risk <b>of</b> 2. 8 %. After adjustment for initial social status, a decline in social status increased the absolute risk <b>of</b> having <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant by about 5 % in both cohorts, though this was significant only in the unexposed cohort. Change of male partner did not modify the risk of low birth weight in either cohort. CONCLUSION: Having had <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant {{and a decline in}} social status are strong risk factors for having <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant subsequently...|$|R

5|$|At daylight, German tanks {{caught the}} 24th and 25th Battalions, {{positioned}} {{in the relatively}} shallow El Mrier Depression together with 6th Brigade headquarters, by surprise. Firing from the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> cliff overlooking the depression, the Germans caused heavy losses amongst the 24th and 25th Battalions before passing through their positions {{in pursuit of the}} British armour. George, the battalion's commander, was captured along with 149 others. Over 200 other men were also killed or wounded. The survivors, back under the command of Burton who was once again the senior surviving company commander, were aggrieved at the lack of armoured support. The 6th Brigade moved to the southern section of the Alamein line where it manned defensive positions during the Battle of Alam Halfa, Rommel's failed attempt to cut off the 8th Army. The battalion at this time numbered 362 personnel, which included one company which had been left back at Maadi and brought forward to rejoin the survivors of the El Mrier battle. Burton, promoted to lieutenant colonel, commanded the battalion until 12 September at which time he went on leave and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Ian Bonifant.|$|E
5|$|Located to the {{southeast}} of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to the west <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> to mid-level ridge, Omar took a counter-clockwise turn on October14. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo {{an extended period of}} rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, an 11.5 to 17.2mi (18.5 to 27.7km) wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75mph (120km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well-defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features.|$|E

5|$|The National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) over the Gulf of Mexico and {{northern}} Yucatán Peninsula on June1. The TWO indicated {{the probability of}} the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> pressure area, which would have a 20% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone {{in the next five}} days. By June3, a concentrated area of showers and thunderstorms developed in the western Caribbean Sea, resulting in an increasing probability of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. Despite land interaction with the Yucatán Peninsula and unfavorably strong wind shear, the system reached an 80% chance of developing in the next 48hours by early on June5. It then moved inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, but continued to organize. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the system developed a well-defined circulation, according to surface data and satellite imagery. Thus, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Three at 15:00UTC on June5, while located about 20mi (30km) north of Río Lagartos, Yucatán. The northward-moving depression was lopsided, with the circulation being well to the west of an elongated band of deep convection.|$|E
5|$|The United States has {{the most}} tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than {{estimated}} in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts. This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> pressure area downwind {{to the east of}} the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong, while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone. Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.|$|E
