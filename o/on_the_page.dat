5|$|Southern Min dialects undergo {{considerable}} tone sandhi, i.e. {{changes to}} the tone depending on {{the position of the}} syllable in any given sentence or utterance. However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than the tone which is actually spoken. This means that when reading aloud the reader must adjust the tone markings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner.|$|E
5|$|Bembo's {{technical}} production followed Monotype's {{standard method}} of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team, led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz Steltzer, {{both of whom}} Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female {{and in many cases}} recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. From these drawings, Benton-pantographs were used to machine metal punches to stamp matrices. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> before completing the remaining characters.|$|E
5|$|Guy B., born 1862, first {{worked as}} a seaman. By 1900, he was married with several {{children}} and {{worked as a}} salesman. His youngest daughter was named Antoinette. In 1850, the senior Smith's household included four older women: Lavinia Smith, age 67 (his mother: b. c.1783 - d. bet.1860-1870), born in South Carolina and listed first as head of household; Sarah Williams, 57; Amelia Jones, 47; and Mary Hewlitt, 53, who were likely relatives or friends. By then Smith and his wife Malvina had three children: James, Henry and Amy. Each member of the household was classified as mulatto (or of mixed ancestry), and all but Lavinia Smith were born in New York. They lived in a mixed neighborhood in the Fifth Ward; in the census, nearly all other neighbors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> were classified as white; many were immigrants from England, Ireland, and France.|$|E

5|$|Monotype's 1922-3 design, {{based on}} Jannon's {{work in the}} Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with many Microsoft products. Its italic, {{faithful}} to Jannon's, is extremely calligraphic, with a very variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters. Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, featuring additional features such as swash capitals and small capitals, although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its digitisation has been criticised for having too light a colour <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> for body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period. Monotype's 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp triangular serif at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full serif.|$|E
5|$|The passage {{beginning}} at bars 231 ("NUN: Scrutemur vias nostras") presents a rhythmic texture new to Stravinsky, which strongly resembles the multilayered rhythms of Stockhausen's Zeitmaße, which Robert Craft was rehearsing in Stravinsky's home {{at precisely the}} time of composition (16 January to 14 February 1958). Stravinsky attended not only these rehearsals but also the recording sessions for Zeitmaße, following the score with great interest. The published score of Threni is also the first of Stravinsky's works to adopt the notational device of replacing the staves in silent measures with whites space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> a feature frequently found in Stravinsky's manuscripts as early as 1916, but only in print from this point onward. This feature {{is also found in}} Stockhausen's score.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual {{elements}} have become {{an important part of}} the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as to accentuate meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to concrete poetry or asemic writing.|$|E

25|$|In 1941, IBM {{announced}} the Electromatic Model 04 electric typewriter, featuring the revolutionary concept of proportional spacing. By assigning varied rather than uniform spacing to different sized characters, the Type 4 recreated {{the appearance of}} a printed page, an effect that was further enhanced by a typewriter ribbon innovation that produced clearer, sharper words <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> The proportional spacing feature became a staple of the IBM Executive series typewriters.|$|E
25|$|As Tate's Lear {{disappeared}} from the stage (except when revived as a historical curiosity), and as critics were no longer faced with the difficulties of reconciling a happy ending on the stage with a tragic ending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> the expressions of indignation and disgust became less frequent, and Tate's version, when mentioned at all by modern critics, is usually mentioned simply as an interesting episode in the performance history of one of Shakespeare's greatest works.|$|E
25|$|Sutton SignWriting, or simply, SignWriting, is {{a system}} of writing sign languages. It is highly {{featural}} and visually iconic, both in {{the shapes of the}} characters, which are abstract pictures of the hands, face, and body, and in their spatial arrangement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> which does not follow a sequential order like the letters that make up written English words. It was developed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton, a dancer who had two years earlier developed DanceWriting.|$|E

25|$|Attribute {{substitution}} {{explains the}} persistence of some illusions. For example, when subjects judge the size of two figures in a perspective picture, their apparent sizes can be distorted by the 3D context, making a convincing optical illusion. The theory states that the three-dimensional size of the figure (which is accessible because it is automatically computed by the visual system) is substituted for its two-dimensional size <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> Experienced painters and photographers are less susceptible to this illusion, because the two-dimensional size is more accessible to their perception.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{tendered}} {{drawings of}} plants and flowers from the late 1940s on. Ailanthus (1948) is the first plant drawing that he executed in Boston, Hyacinth (1949) {{was the first one}} he did when he was in Paris. Beginning in 1949, while living in Paris (and influenced in this choice of subject by Henri Matisse and Jean Arp) he began to draw simple plant and seaweed forms. The plant studies are, for the most part, contour drawings of leaves, stems and flowers done in clean strokes of pencil or pen and centered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{colophon}}, {{at the end}} of the codex, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> 444 informs: Η παρουσια θεια βιβλος εγραφη μεν, και ετελεστη κατα την μεγαλην πολιν εν τη σεβοτατη των μαγγανων μονη κατα το ςωοβ ετος. εδοθη δε και αφιερωθη παρ εμου νικηφορου του μυζιθρα της λακεδαιμονος καστρω περιεχουσα το ιερον ευαγγελιον και τον πραξαποστολον και το ψαλτηριον μετα της αυτου προθεωριας και της του θεολογου αποκαλυψεως. According to this colophon {{the manuscript}} was written in 6872, it means in 1364 CE, by Nicephorus Cannavus at Constantinople. Nicephorus, son of Kannabe, presented it to the monastery to Myzithra.|$|E

5000|$|A {{commercial}} {{variation of}} the dictionary test is known as [...] "Flashback," [...] and {{comes in the form}} of a complete gimmicked book. Instead of the word appearing faintly at the top of <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> it is arranged so <b>the</b> last word <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>page</b> is <b>the</b> same as <b>the</b> first word <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>page.</b> In some forms <b>the</b> antonym appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mirror <b>page,</b> instead of <b>the</b> same word. For instance, if the word [...] "day" [...] appears as <b>the</b> first word <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>page,</b> a straight flashback would put the word [...] "day" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>page,</b> while an antonym version puts [...] "night" [...] there instead. Flashback variations are often incorporated in gimmick books supporting other methods as well.|$|R
