25|$|Often these {{conditional}} distributions include parameters {{which are}} unknown {{and must be}} estimated from data, sometimes using the maximum likelihood approach. Direct maximization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> (or of the posterior probability) is often complex when there are unobserved variables. A classical approach to this problem is the expectation-maximization algorithm which alternates computing expected values of the unobserved variables conditional on observed data, with maximizing the complete likelihood (or posterior) assuming that previously computed expected values are correct. Under mild regularity conditions this process converges on maximum likelihood (or maximum posterior) values for parameters.|$|E
