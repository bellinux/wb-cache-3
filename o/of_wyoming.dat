5|$|Another {{formation}} with tyrannosaur {{remains is}} the Lance Formation <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming.</b> This {{has been interpreted}} as a bayou environment similar to today's Gulf Coast. The fauna was very similar to Hell Creek, but with Struthiomimus replacing its relative Ornithomimus. The small ceratopsian Leptoceratops also lived in the area.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} an important component <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming's</b> economy. Its overall importance to the performance <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming's</b> economy has waned. However, agriculture is still an essential part <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming's</b> culture and lifestyle. The main agricultural commodities produced in Wyoming include livestock (beef), hay, sugar beets, grain (wheat and barley), and wool. More than 91% <b>of</b> land in <b>Wyoming</b> is classified as rural.|$|R

5|$|Early Jurassic uplift {{created an}} {{unconformity}} above the Chinle Formation that represents about ten million years of missing sedimentation {{between it and}} the next formation, the Moenave. Periodic incursions of shallow seas from the north during the Jurassic flooded parts <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming,</b> Montana, and a northeast–southwest trending trough on the Utah/Idaho border. The Moenave was deposited in a variety of river, lake, and flood-plain environments.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, the United States National Helium Reserve {{accounted}} for 30 {{percent of the}} world's helium. The reserve was expected {{to run out of}} helium in 2018. Despite that, a proposed bill in the United States Senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming,</b> but they were not expected to ease the shortage.|$|E

5|$|Brown had {{collected}} seventy-seven osteoderms while excavating a Tyrannosaurus specimen in the Lance Formation <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming</b> in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in {{his description of}} Ankylosaurus, but thought they belonged to the Tyrannosaurus instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when he described the Tyrannosaurus specimen as the now invalid genus Dynamosaurus in 1905. Later examination has shown them {{to be similar to}} those of Ankylosaurus, and that Brown had compared them with some Euoplocephalus osteoderms, which had been erroneously catalogued as belonging to Ankylosaurus at the AMNH.|$|E
5|$|Business M-21 (Bus. M-21) was a {{business}} route of M-21 in the Grand Rapids area.

From there, the highway ran along industrial areas {{on the north side}} <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming,</b> running parallel to the I-196 freeway. At the intersection with Clyde Park Avenue, Bus. M-21 turned northward along Grandville Avenue and entered the city of Grand Rapids. At Franklin Street, the business route turned eastward and terminated at US131.|$|E

5|$|He {{attended}} Yale University, but by his {{own account}} had problems adjusting to the college, and failed out twice. Among the influential teachers from his days in New Haven was Professor H.

He subsequently started, but did not finish, doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E
5|$|Idaho Territory {{was created}} from Dakota Territory, Nebraska Territory, and Washington Territory on March 4, 1863. Initially, the {{territory}} included all of modern-day Idaho and Montana, and most <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming.</b> On May 26, 1864, Montana Territory was split from Idaho Territory, {{and most of}} the Wyoming portion was reassigned to Dakota Territory. The portion east of the 111th meridian was split off as part of the new Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868, giving Idaho Territory its final borders.|$|E

5|$|Shoshone National Forest borders Yellowstone National Park and Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The Continental Divide demarks the {{boundary}} between Shoshone and Bridger-Teton National Forests. Along the Montana border, Shoshone National Forest borders Custer National Forest to the north. Private property, property belonging to the state <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming</b> and lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management form the eastern boundaries. Lastly, the Wind River Indian Reservation also borders on the east, and bisects a smaller southern section which includes the Popo Agie Wilderness and the Washakie Ranger District.|$|E
5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a {{practical}} matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

5|$|The Snake River also {{shares a}} {{boundary}} with the Green River to the southeast; the Green River drains parts <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming</b> and Utah {{and is the}} largest tributary of the Colorado River.

On the north the Snake River watershed is bounded by the Red Rock River, a tributary of the Beaverhead River, which flows into the Jefferson River and into the Missouri River, part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage basin.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds {{in western}} North America, its range {{extending}} from southwestern British Columbia along the Pacific coast to northern Baja California, and east to New Mexico and southern Montana. It winters mostly in Mexico, from southern Baja California to Oaxaca state. It has spread into parts <b>of</b> <b>Wyoming</b> and Montana only recently, as Juniperus osteosperma {{has expanded its}} range due to a warming climate. Vagrants have been recorded across eastern North America and in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{counties}} in Wyoming.
