5|$|Early investors earned {{three to}} four times their money back due to {{increasing}} property values in Southern California, high <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates,</b> and increasing storage rental prices. By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E

25|$|One {{empirical}} study supports performance-based pricing {{by analyzing}} the block-level price elasticity of parking demand in the SFpark context. The study suggests that block-level elasticities vary so widely that urban planners and economists cannot accurately predict the response in parking demand to a given change in price. The public policy implication is that planners should utilize observed <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> in order to adjust prices so that target <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> are achieved.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{validate}} {{emergency department}} (ED) <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> against ambulance diversion status at an urban academic ED in Taipei, Taiwan. MethodsThis is a retrospective study conducted at an urban academic ED with annual census of 70, 000 visits. From January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010, the hourly ED <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> and other customary measures were collected via the hospital information system. To assess {{the performance of}} ED <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> {{as a measure of}} ED overcrowding, we used ambulance diversion status as the reference standard. The ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity were analyzed and the predictive ability of ED <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> in terms of the 1 -hour later and 2 -hour later diversion status was examined. ResultsA total of 8, 728 data points together with their corresponding ambulance diversion status were analyzed. The ED <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> was found to be moderate associated with ambulance diversion status (area under curve, AUC = 0. 84, p = 0. 004). When the sensitivity was fixed at 91 %, the specificity was 60 % and the corresponding ED <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> was 1. 25. ED <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> was also associated with 1 -hour and 2 -hour later diversion status having AUCs of 0. 83 and 0. 82, respectively. ConclusionThis study suggests that ED <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate,</b> a simple index that can be easily implanted into any hospital information system, has the potential to become an universal ED crowding index and offers the opportunity for international comparison...|$|R

40|$|Background: Assessment of {{hospital}} performance {{plays an important}} role in improving the quantity and quality of services. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the teaching hospitals of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences using Pabon Lasso model during 2006 - 2011. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was carried out to assess the performance of six teaching hospitals of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences during 2006 - 2011 using Pabon Lasso Model. This model uses three indexes of bed <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate,</b> bed turnover rate and the average length of stay, simultaneously. The data were collected using a standardized checklist, and Excel software was used for analyzing the data and charting Pabon Lasso. Results: The results showed that one of the studied hospitals had high bed <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> and low turnover rate, two hospitals had high turnover rate and low bed <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate,</b> one hospital had high bed <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate</b> and high bed turnover rate, and two hospitals had low bed turnover rate and high bed <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate.</b> Conclusion: According to this study, about 85 percent {{of hospital}}s had low performance in indexes of bed <b>occupancy</b> <b>rate,</b> bed turnover rate or both. So, the reasons for the low performance must be evaluated and analyzed. Also, based on the characteristics of the hospitals, proper strategies can be applied to improve the performance of hospitals and increase the efficiency of resources...|$|R

25|$|In 2005, D.C. Mayor Williams {{proposed}} Metro {{move its}} headquarters {{to a site}} near the Anacostia station, setting off a years-long controversy.

City officials and Anacostia residents said that the move would spur economic growth in the area, although private-sector developers said that was not clear. Although the D.C.

25|$|Hotel {{operators}} in Downtown reacted favorably, predicting {{that the move}} would cause an increase in <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> in their hotels.

Steven Biegel, the {{senior vice president of}} Studley Inc. and a representative of office building tenants, said that if Continental's space went vacant, the vacancy would not have had a significant impact in the Downtown Houston submarket as there is not an abundance of available space, and the empty property would be likely that another potential tenant would occupy it. Jennifer Dawson of the Houston Business Journal said that if Continental Airlines left Continental Center I, the development of Brookfield Properties's new office tower would have been delayed. As of September 2011 the headquarters moved out, but Continental will continue to house employees in the building. It will have about half of the employees that it once had.|$|E

25|$|Culturally, {{the state}} {{is best known for}} the annual Festival Internacional Cervantino, which takes place in the city of Guanajuato and some other {{affiliated}} venues in the state.

The festival hosts events such as opera, theater productions, film showings, art exhibitions, academic conferences and talks, concerts and dance recitals. The performances occur in 70 different venues over most of the month of October. In addition to the major events in venues, artists such as dancers, clowns and more, give small and sometimes impromptu shows on the streets, sidewalks and small plazas that are located in the city. Because of this, the event brings many visitors to the city who wander the streets, visiting the many sights of the city. During the event, hotel <b>occupancy</b> <b>rates</b> are as high as 98%. In 2010, invited artists included the Da Motus! Swiss dance company. The event is named in honor of Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote. The festival began in 1972, as short plays performed by University of Guanajuato students based on the works of Cervantes. In 2010, special guests included the state of Querétaro and the country of Colombia.
