40|$|Empirical {{studies do}} not make a clear {{distinction}} between the quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>disclosure.</b> As it is generally assumed that the quantity of information has an implication in determining its quality, quantity measures are often used as proxy for disclosure quality. Nonetheless, the measurement of the quality <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> is recognized as a relevant question that is still open and the importance of developing measures <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> quality is emphasized in literature. This paper disputes the idea that the quantity <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> is a sound proxy for the quality <b>of</b> <b>disclosure.</b> The adoption <b>of</b> multidimensional frameworks for the appreciation <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> is discussed and an index for quality disclosure is proposed. Moving from the assumption that high-quality information should usefully support external users in the judgment of past and future performance, we hypothesize that highquality disclosure is positively associated with accuracy and negatively associated with the dispersion of analysts’earnings forecasts. We show analytically that the proposed framework captures dimensions <b>of</b> annual report <b>disclosure</b> that are considered useful by financial analysts in forecasting earnings and that the proposed measure <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> quality has a stronger positive statistical association with accuracy and a stronger negative association with the dispersion of financial analysts’ earnings forecasts than a simple index <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> quantity has...|$|R
