50|$|Once Chandole Rishi went {{to visit}} Kanchi Chandrasekharendra Saraswati at his place of {{residence}} in Vijayawada. P.V.Narasimha Rao (28 June 1921 - 23 December 2004), an ardent devotee of Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, was also there. Being a scholar in multiple languages including Sanskrit, Narasimha Rao composed and read out a poem in praise of Kanchi Chandrasekharendra Saraswati almost instantaneously. Having heard it, Kanchi Paramachaarya instantaneously made some prosodic amendments to it. At the same time, Chandole Maharshi also composed a poem on Kanchi Paramachaarya and recited it loudly. Narasimha Rao has said to Kanchi Seer {{that there are some}} mistakes in the poem. But, Kanchi Paramachaarya said that by birth, by nature, by character and by scholarship, Chandole Saastri is an error-free personality. In fact, though both these Maharshis lived thousands of miles away, both used to be in communication with each other. Chandole Saastri's conversations with Goddess Bala <b>on</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day</b> basis are simultaneously heard by Kanchi Paramachaarya wherever he is. When both happened to meet at any place on certain occasions, Kanchi Paramachaarya used to ask Chandole Maharshi to recite these poetic conversations with Bala once again before him or He (Kanchi Seer) used to reproduce himself those conversations (which Chandole Maharshi had with Goddess Bala) and used to ask him to explain why he had to discuss those matters with Goddess Bala. Some of these instances are well documented in the book Nadiche Devudu written by Neelamraju Venkata Seshaiah, formerly an editor of Andhra Prabha, a renowned Telugu daily published from The Indian Express group that time.).|$|E
