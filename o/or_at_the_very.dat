5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns <b>or</b> (<b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E

25|$|Although the Professional Lawn Tennis Association issued rankings {{at the end}} of 1952 {{in which}} they called Segura the world pro no. 1, with Gonzales second, the PLTA rankings were {{notoriously}} quirky. The year before, for instance, when Kramer had beaten Segura 64 matches to 28 (or 58-27 according to Kramer) in their championship tour, they had nevertheless ranked Segura as the world no. 1 player. A strong case can therefore be made that Gonzales was actually the world pro no. 1 player for 1952 <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least, shared that position with Segura.|$|E

A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera's spread.

25|$|Other critics such as Martin Evans expand upon Mack's {{notion of}} built in mystery, {{claiming}} {{that even the}} textual discrepancies between the three known versions may actually be deliberate (<b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least they add to the effect). Evans also argues that Shakespeare's impenetrable text and Hamlet's 'unplayable' strings could be meant to reflect the deep anxieties that were felt {{in an era of}} philosophical, scientific and religious disorientation. The works (and actions) of Machiavelli, Copernicus and Luther had upset hierarchical notions of virtue, order and salvation that had persisted since the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Despite his disappointments in Arkansas and Louisiana, Price {{managed to}} {{convince}} his superiors to permit him to invade Missouri {{in the fall of}} 1864, hoping to yet seize that state for the Confederacy <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least imperil Abraham Lincoln's chances for reelection that year. Confederate General Kirby Smith agreed, though he was forced to detach the infantry brigades originally detailed to Price's force and send them elsewhere, thus changing Price's proposed campaign from a full-scale invasion of Missouri to a large cavalry raid. Price amassed 12,000 horsemen for his army, and fourteen pieces of artillery.|$|E

However, Austria felt threatened by the Russian troops in the nearby Danubian Principalities. When Britain and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Principalities, Austria supported them; and, though it did not immediately declare war on Russia, it refused to guarantee its neutrality. When, in the summer of 1854, Austria made another demand for the withdrawal of troops, Russia (fearing that Austria would enter the war) complied.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} scientifique {{nomenclature}} {{offered to}} the spectator (the relativity of simultaneity), that artists themselves, art critics and art historians have not failed to notice. Some have attempted to refute such connections and others have embraced them. Though the name Einstein was not yet a household word in 1912, {{there has been a}} rapprochement of the concept of multiplicity described above and the concept of relativity in the Einsteinian sense. While, as Einstein writes, the physicist can generally limit herself to one system of coordinates for the description of physical reality, the Cubist (particularly Gleizes and Metzinger) attempted to show the simultaneity of several such views, <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least, they were unwilling to commit themselves to a single coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|Philip II {{spent much}} of his youth as a hostage at Thebes, where he studied under the renowned general Epaminondas, whose reforms formed the basis of Philip's later tactics. The {{equipment}} of the Macedonian phalangite {{is believed to have been}} influenced by the 'peltast' developed by the Athenian general Iphicrates. The Iphicratean peltast was not a skirmisher but a form of light hoplite, characterised by using a longer spear and smaller shield. However, the introduction of the sarissa pike in conjunction with a smaller shield seem to have been innovations devised by Philip himself, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least he produced the definitive synthesis of earlier developments. Diodorus claimed that Philip was inspired to make changes in the organisation of his Macedonian infantry from reading a passage in the writings of Homer describing a close-packed formation.|$|E
500|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{took many}} other {{forms in the}} following decades. In 1962, physicist Al G.W.

In 1964, Fred Whipple, who popularised the famous [...] "dirty snowball" [...] hypothesis for cometary structure, thought that a [...] "comet belt" [...] might be massive enough to cause the purported discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus that had sparked the search for Planet X, <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least, massive enough to affect the orbits of known comets. Observation ruled out this hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|When Portman Lodge was {{demolished}} in 1930 suspicions {{were raised}} that Tregonwell, <b>or</b> Symes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least, {{were involved in}} some way with smuggling.

An additional consideration was the recovery of the remains of UB-45s crew. On 19 July 1934, after a two-year search, Bulgarian minesweepers discovered the location of the wreck, which was resting at position , near the then Bulgarian–Romanian border. UB-45s wreck was raised in an operation that cost several times less than the cost of a new 8.8-centimeter gun. The remains recovered were buried on 26 February 1936 in a Varna cemetery, after a procession through the town.|$|E
