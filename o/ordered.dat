After {{two of the}} class, UB-1 and UB-15, were sold in February 1915 to ally Austria-Hungary (becoming U-10 and U-11 in the Austro-Hungarian Navy), the German Imperial Navy <b>ordered</b> UB-16 and UB-17 from Weser.

The flying column departed Merawi on 29 July 1897, and, marching north-east along the Nile for eight days, {{arrived at the}} town as dawn broke on August 7. Forming his battalions in a broad semi-circle that pitted Abu Hamed’s defenders against the river, Major-General Hunter <b>ordered</b> his troops to advance at approximately six-thirty that morning. In the action that followed, the outnumbered Mahdist riflemen were driven from their defensive positions through the town, while a small contingent of Mahdist cavalry fled south without engaging to report the loss.

She was moored in Brunsbüttel with her sister-ship , en route to Kiel via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on the morning of 28 August 1914. That morning, the British attacked the German patrol line in the Heligoland Bight. During the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, München and Danzig were recalled and <b>ordered</b> to steam to the mouth of the Elbe and wait for further orders.
