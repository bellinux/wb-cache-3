40|$|<b>Funds</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> are an {{increasingly}} popular avenue for hedge fund investment. Despite the increasing interest in hedge funds {{as an alternative}} asset class, the high degree <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> specific risk {{and the lack of}} transparency may give fiduciaries pause. In addition, many of the most attractive hedge funds are closed to new investment. <b>Funds</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> resolve these issues by providing investors with diversification across manaager styles and professional oversight <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> operations that can provide the necessary degree of due diligence. In addition, many such funds hold shares in hedge funds otherwise closed to new investment allowing smaller investors access to the most sought-after managers. However, the diversification, oversight and access comes at the cost of a multiplication of fees paid by the investor. One would expect that the information advantage <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> would more than compensate investors for these fees. Unfortunately, individual hedge <b>funds</b> dominate <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> on an after-fee return or Sharpe ratio basis. In this paper we argue that the disappointing after-fee performance <b>of</b> some <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> may be explained by the nature of this fee arrangement. <b>Fund</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> providers pass on individual hedge fund incentive fees in the form of after-fee returns, although they are {{in a better position to}} hedge these fees than are their investors.

40|$|In {{spite of}} a {{somewhat}} disappointing performance throughout the crisis, {{and a series of}} high-profile scandals, investors are showing interest in hedge <b>funds.</b> Still, <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds</b> keep on experiencing outflows. Can this phenomenon be explained by the failure <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>fund</b> managers to deliver on their promise to add value through active management, or is it symptomatic of a move toward greater disintermediation in the hedge fund industry? Little attention has been paid so far to the added value, and the sources of the added value, <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds.</b> The lack <b>of</b> transparency that is characteristic <b>of</b> the hedge <b>funds</b> arena and makes the performance attribution exercise particularly challenging is probably an explanation.

The results of our empirical study suggest that <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds</b> are <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> like others.
