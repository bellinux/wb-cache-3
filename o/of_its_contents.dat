5|$|Alexander died in 1944, and {{the death}} duties proved {{crippling}} to Geoffrey. In 1949 he sold the castle and 3,480 hectares (8,600acres) of the lands to the Ashdale Property Company, retaining a tenancy of the castle for himself. The Crown Estate bought the estate from Ashdale and sold the castle back to Geoffrey in 1954. His son Colonel Walter Luttrell lived away from Dunster, and {{following the death of}} his mother– the last Luttrell to live in the property– gave the castle and most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>contents</b> to the National Trust in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems.

5|$|None of Monteverdi's {{music for}} Andromeda has survived. The {{libretto}} was also {{thought to have}} been lost, until its rediscovery in 1984. As was customary in Monteverdi's time, the manuscript makes no mention of the composer's name—librettos were often the subject of numerous settings by different composers. The libretto's frontispiece confirms that Andromeda was performed during Mantua's Carnival, 1–3 March 1620. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>contents</b> reveals some influence from Rinuccini's libretto for Arianna, such as use of identical metre and length in the prologues of each work, and several common characters in the respective cast lists. The document remains in private hands and has not been published.|$|E
5|$|Holden died on 1 May 1960. His {{body was}} cremated at Enfield crematorium and his ashes were {{spread in the}} garden of the Friends' Meeting House in Hertford. On 2 June 1960 a {{memorial}} service was held at St Pancras New Church, where Holden had designed the altar in 1914. Obituaries were published in daily newspapers The Manchester Guardian, The Times and The Daily Telegraph and in construction industry periodicals including The Builder, Architectural Review, Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Journal of the Town Planning Institute. Generally, the obituaries were positive about Holden's early work and the stations for London Underground, were neutral about Senate House and were negative about his practice's later works. The Harmer Green house and most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>contents</b> were auctioned with the proceeds left to family members. Holden also left £8,400 to friends and staff and £2,000 to charity.|$|E

5|$|Milburn {{felt that}} the opening {{chapters}} (and introduction) did well to establish the volume, and was happy with {{the inclusion of the}} more empirical contributions, given their potential theoretical significance. He picked out the chapters by Driessen, Boyer and Wissenburg respectively as highlights, suggesting that the contributions of Driessen and Boyer seemed to challenge the volume's second stated goal, and noting that, though it was strong, he disagreed with the claims of Wissenburg's chapter. Garner highlighted the contributions of Flanders and Driessen, and commended the editors for putting together the book. Hooley concluded his review by claiming that the book offered something to those interested in the place of animals in politics, but that much <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>contents</b> would be of more interest for those looking to read about environmental political theory.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>contents</b> for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E
5|$|There are 202 {{scheduled}} monuments in West Somerset. Some of the oldest, {{particularly on}} Exmoor and the Quantock Hills are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hill forts, cairns, bowl barrows and other tumuli. More recent sites include several motte-and-bailey castles. Dunster Castle has been fortified {{since the late}} Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site {{as part of the}} pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege {{during the early years of}} the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who expanded it several times during the 17th and 18th centuries. The medieval castle walls were mostly destroyed following the siege of Dunster Castle at the end of the English Civil War. In the 1860s and 1870s, the architect Anthony Salvin was employed to remodel the castle to fit Victorian tastes; this work extensively changed the appearance of Dunster to make it appear more Gothic and Picturesque. In 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>contents</b> to the National Trust, which operates it as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Dunster is {{mentioned}} as a manor and Dunster Castle as belonging to William I de Moyon (alias de Moion, also de Mohun) in the 1086 Domesday Book. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, he constructed a timber castle on the site {{as part of the}} pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege {{during the early years of}} the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century. During the English Civil War, Dunster was initially held as a garrison for the Royalists. It fell to the Parliamentarians in 1645 and orders were sent out for the castle to be demolished. However, these were not carried out, and the castle remained the garrison for Parliamentarian troops until 1650. Dunster is regularly home to Taunton Garrison who re-enact plays, battles, and life in the civil war. Major alterations to the castle were undertaken by Henry Fownes Luttrell who had acquired it through marriage to Margaret Fownes-Luttrell in 1747. Following the death of Alexander Luttrell in 1944, the family was unable to afford the death duties on his estate. The castle and surrounding lands were sold off to a property firm, the family continuing to live in the castle as tenants. The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954, but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>contents</b> to the National Trust, which operates it as a tourist attraction.
