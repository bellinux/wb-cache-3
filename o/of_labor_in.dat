Patricia Roberts Harris, who was Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare before the department split and had earlier served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1977, became the first female Secretary of Health and Human Services in 1979.

The next part focuses on the actual development <b>of</b> the <b>labor</b> migration <b>in</b> the Czech Republic. First, there is described the development <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> migration <b>in</b> the Czech Republic between years 2000 and 2011. Subsequently, {{on the basis of}} statistical data, is described a model <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> migration <b>in</b> the Czech Republic.

5|$|Historically, Deir Ghassaneh {{depended}} {{primarily on}} olive cultivation, {{and until the}} present day most of Bani Zeid's cultivable land is covered by olive orchards. The cultivation of other fruit trees is significantly lower, with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams. Other crops grown include grains which cover 135 dunams and onions, dry legumes and fodder to a lesser degree. Only 1% of the town's residents own livestock {{and according to the}} Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, there were 1,880 goats, 268 sheep, 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009.

5|$|In many {{bacterial}} communities, {{natural or}} engineered (such as bioreactors), {{there is significant}} division <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> <b>in</b> metabolism (Syntrophy), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others. In one such system, the methanogenic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several syntrophic species (Syntrophobacterales and Synergistia) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste (methane). Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with microarrays or proteomics researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with metabolomics and proteomics) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Gompers of the AFL {{recognized}} that the strike was damaging the cause <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> <b>in</b> the public mind and advised the strikers to return to work. Commissioner Curtis refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. The strike proved a setback for labor unions, and the AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice-president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{entrepreneurs}} {{transformed the}} economy from small, craft-organized factories located {{inside the city}} limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, {{the division of labor}} increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> <b>in</b> production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.|$|E
