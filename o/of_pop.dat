50|$|Evaluation of {{the effects}} <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> on health is very {{challenging}} in the laboratory setting. For example, for organisms exposed to a mixture <b>of</b> <b>POPs,</b> the effects {{are assumed to be}} additive. Mixtures <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> can in principle produce synergistic effects. With synergistic effects, the toxicity of each compound is enhanced (or depressed) by the presence of other compounds in the mixture. When put together, the effects can far exceed the approximated additive effects <b>of</b> the <b>POP</b> compound mixture.|$|R

40|$|This book {{covers all}} aspects of bioavailability, as related to {{environmental}} contaminants. After {{a discussion of the}} definition of bioavailability and its context, focus is placed on the role of risk assessment and bioavailability. Methods of analysis are then discussed including a range of atomic spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques for metal analysis and chromatographic approaches for persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The occurrence, properties and eco-toxicity <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> and metals in the soil/sediment environment are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on the uptake <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> and metals by plants (phytoextraction). Examples <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> and metals in the environment are reviewed. Methods to assess the bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> and metals in the environment are discussed. The particular approaches considered are: non-exhaustive extraction techniques; single extraction techniques; sequential extraction techniques; use of cyclodextrin and surfactants; in-vitro gastrointestinal methods including physiological-based extraction test; the use of bioasssays including earthworms. Finally, selected case studies highlight the importance of determining the bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> and metals...|$|R

5|$|Marla F. Prather {{observed}} that Whaam!s grand scale and dramatic depiction contributed to its {{position as a}} historic work <b>of</b> <b>pop</b> art. With As I Opened Fire, Lichtenstein's other monumental war painting, Whaam! {{is regarded as the}} culmination of Lichtenstein's dramatic war-comics works, according to Diane Waldman. It is widely described as either Lichtenstein's most famous work, or, along with Drowning Girl, as one of his two most famous works. Andrew Edgar and Peter Sedgwick describe it, along with Warhol's Marilyn Monroe prints, {{as one of the most}} famous works <b>of</b> <b>pop</b> art. Gianni Versace once linked the two iconic pop art images via his gown designs. According to Douglas Coupland, the World Book Encyclopedia used pictures of Warhol's Monroes and Whaam! to illustrate its Pop art entry.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{microplastic}} {{particles in}} the cycling and bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is discussed. Five common concepts, sometimes misconceptions, {{about the role of}} microplastics are reviewed. While there is ample evidence that microplastics accumulate high concentrations <b>of</b> <b>POPs,</b> this does not result in microplastics being important for the global dispersion <b>of</b> <b>POPs.</b> Similarly, there is scant evidence that microplastics are an important transfer vector <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> into animals, but possibly for plastic additives (flame retardants). Last, listing microplastics as POPs could help reduce their environmental impact...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the analysis of}} anthropogenic substances of the compound class known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Sample preparation perspectives for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> in the environmental matrices water, soils and sediments are presented. This thesis features reasonably cheap and uncomplicated methodology capable of fast screening <b>of</b> <b>POPs.</b> It displays how quantitative extraction <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> {{can be made in}} a sustainable manner and how selectivity can be increased generating faster and less solvent consuming procedures compared to common practice. Also demonstrated is the potential of how selective SFE can be used in bioavailability-predictive extractions. This fast and uncomplicated methodology is capable of generating information enhancing the quality and credibility of risk assessment procedures at contaminated sites. Furthermore, the possibility of environmental analytical chemistry <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> becoming green chemistry is been highlighted throughout the text...|$|R

5000|$|Current studies {{aimed at}} {{minimizing}} POPs {{in the environment}} are investigating their behavior in photo catalytic oxidation reactions.

Photochemical degradation is negligible compared to photocatalytic degradation. [...] However, proper removal techniques <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> from the environment are still unclear, due to fear that more toxic byproducts may result from uninvestigated degradation techniques.

40|$|Most birds preen their {{feathers}} with an oily excrete {{from the}} uropygial (preen) gland. This oily excrete contains {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs), which make the preen gland a potential route <b>of</b> depuration <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> in birds. Black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) were studied during two periods of high energy demand: incubation and chick-rearing. A rather high concentration <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> in preen gland tissue indicates that the preen gland secrete is an excretory pathway for POPs in kittiwakes. The similarity in the POP profile detected {{in this study of}} liver, preen gland and feathers suggests that POPs found in the feathers are excreted through the preen gland. The finding also indicates that excretion <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> through the preen gland is compound unspecific. This qualitative study should be followed up by a new quantitative study to determine the importance <b>of</b> excretion <b>of</b> <b>POPs</b> through the preen gland...|$|R
