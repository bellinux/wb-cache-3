40|$|Background: Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne disease {{caused by}} Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The variety of {{characteristic}} and non-specific clinical manifestations is partially explained by its genetic diversity. We investigated {{the ability of}} B. burgdorferi sl isolates to cause <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> Methods. The genetic constellation of isolates from ticks was compared to isolates found in <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> PCR and sequence analysis {{was performed on the}} plasmid-encoded ospC and the chromosomal 5 S- 23 S rDNA spacer region (IGS). Results: Seven different B. burgdorferi sl genospecies were identified in 152 borrelia isolates from ticks and <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> biopsies. B afzelii (51 %) and B. garinii (27 %) were the most common in ticks. From the 44 sequences obtained from <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> samples 42 were B. afzelii, one B. garinii and one B. bavariensis. Significant associations with <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> formation were found for four IGS and two ospC types. Five from 45 ospC types were associated with more than one genospecies. Conclusions: B. burgdorferi sl isolates differ in their propensity to cause <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> These differences were also found within genospecies. In other words, although B. afzelii was mostly associated with <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> some B. afzelii isolates had a low ability to cause <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> Our data further support the occurrence of plasmid exchange between borrelia genospecies under natural conditions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Lyme {{disease is}} an {{emerging}} worldwide infectious disease with major foci of endemicity in North America and regions of temperate Eurasia. The <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> rash associated with early infection {{is found in}} approximately 80 % of patients and can {{have a range of}} appearances including the classic target bull’s-eye lesion and nontarget appearing lesions. Methods. A survey was designed to assess the ability of the general public to distinguish various appearances of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> from non-Lyme rashes. Participants were solicited from individuals who visited an educational website about Lyme disease. Results. Of 3, 104 people who accessed a rash identification survey, 72. 7 % of participants correctly identified the classic target <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> commonly associated with Lyme disease. A mean of 20. 5 % of participants was able to correctly identify the four nonclassic <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> 24. 2 % of participants incorrectly identified a tick bite reaction in the skin as <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> Conclusions. Participants were most familiar with the classic target <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> of Lyme disease but were unlikely to correctly identify the nonclassic <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> These results identify an opportunity for educational intervention to improve early recognition of Lyme disease and to increase the patient’s appropriate use of medical services for early Lyme disease diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To compare {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) amplification of borrelial DNA and culture isolation of spirochaetes for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis by direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in patients with <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans lesions. METHODS: Skin biopsy specimens from <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans lesions were subdivided and tested by PCR amplification assay and culture using two artificial growth media, Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly II (BSK II) and modified Kelly-Pettenkofer (MKP). Five classes of lesions were studied: typical <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> spontaneously resolved <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> atypical/partially treated <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> typical acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, and atypical/partially treated acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. RESULTS: For both <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans lesions, the most sensitive detection method was MKP culture. PCR was less sensitive than MKP culture, but more sensitive than BSK II culture. Results for 758 typical <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> specimens showed positivity rates of 36 % for MKP, 25 % for PCR, and 24 % for BSK II. Differences were statistically significant. The overall positivity rate for all three methods combined was 54 %, but few specimens (6 %) were positive by all three methods. Examination of multiple <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> lesions from the same patient increased the diagnostic yield. These findings, and similar results for acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans lesions, suggest that the distribution of spirochaetes in skin biopsies is not homogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: Although possessing the potential to provide a rapid diagnosis, PCR is not more sensitive than culture for the direct detection of borrelia. Spirochaetes appear to be unevenly distributed throughout biopsy specimens, suggesting that diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis by direct detection of the causative agent in skin lesions in vulnerable to sample bias...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Nationwide {{surveys have}} shown a {{threefold}} increase in general practitioner (GP) consultations for tick bites and early Lyme borreliosis from 1994 to 2009 in the Netherlands. We now report an update on 2014, with identical methods as for the preceding GP surveys. Methods To all GPs in the Netherlands, a postal questionnaire was sent inquiring {{about the number of}} consultations for tick bites and <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> diagnoses (most common manifestation of early Lyme borreliosis) in 2014, and the size of their practice populations. Results Contrasting to the previously rising incidence of consultations for tick bites between 1994 and 2009, the incidence decreased in 2014 to 488 consultations for tick bites per 100, 000 inhabitants, i. e., 82, 000 patients nationwide. This survey revealed a first sign of stabilization of the previously rising trend in GP diagnosed <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> with 140 diagnoses per 100, 000 inhabitants of the Netherlands. This equals about 23, 500 annual diagnoses of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> nationwide in 2014. Conclusions In contrast to the constantly rising incidence of GP consultations for tick bites and <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> diagnoses in the Netherlands between 1994 and 2009, the current survey of 2014 showed a first sign of stabilization of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> diagnoses and a decreased incidence for tick bite consultations...|$|R

40|$|Regional {{variations}} in the clinical spectrum of Lyme borreliosis have been described previously. These {{may be related to}} strain variations, or reflect selection bias. We compared the clinical and epidemiological profiles of Dutch patients presenting with solitary <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> alone, with the profiles in other European studies, and studies from the U. S. A., and cultured Borrelia burgdorferi from <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> to identify the genospecies. Seventy-seven consecutive patients with a final diagnosis of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> were admitted into the study. Various clinical and epidemiological data were obtained, and serum was evaluated for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Skin biopsy specimens were taken from the border of the <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and cultured in modified Kelly's medium. The different genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi were identified by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies H 3 TS, LA- 26, LA- 31 and D 6, and by rRNA gene restriction patterns. Patients were treated with tetracycline or doxycycline, and were seen for follow-up 6 weeks after treatment. Long-term follow-up was by telephone interview. A tick bite had been noticed by 45 % of the patients. The onset of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> occurred in 97 % of these patients within 3 months of the tick bite. <b>Erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> was present for 1 - 319 days (median 2 months). No concomitant manifestations were spontaneously reported. Borrelia burgdorferi was cultured from 52 (84 %) of 62 skin biopsy specimens. Fifty isolates (96 %) were identified as Borrelia burgdorferi group VS 461. No therapy failures occurred among patients treated with tetracycline (follow-up 1 - 4 years, median 27 months) or doxycycline (follow-up 6 - 31 months, median 19 months).

40|$|Fifty-one {{patients}} with <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> were followed up prospectively with serial clinical evaluations, serologic determinations for antiborrelial antibodies, and lymphocyte stimulation responses to Borrelia burgdorferi antigens to determine (i) the {{factors associated with}} sustained cellular immune responses and (ii) whether lymphocyte stimulation is a good indicator of prior exposure to B. burgdorferi in patients treated early after <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> Positive lymphocyte stimulation responses (> 2 standard deviations above normal control values) were found in 15 (29 %) of 51 patients 3 months after treatment for <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and in 8 (18 %) of 44 patients 1 year posttreatment. Heightened lymphocyte responses were not associated with the number or duration of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> lesions prior to treatment, the mean size of the largest <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> lesion, {{or the number of}} symptoms at the time of presentation. The development of Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, choice of antibiotic, and clinical outcome also were not associated with a positive lymphoproliferation assay result. Changes in the lymphocyte stimulation indices between the two time points assessed (3 months and 1 year posttreatment) also did not correlate with the above variables. When serologic results and lymphoproliferative responses were evaluated as categorical or continuous variables, there were no correlations between values.

40|$|The three skin {{disorders}} of Lyme borreliosis in Europe include <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> an acute, self-limited lesion; borrelial lymphocytoma, a subacute lesion; and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, {{a chronic}} lesion. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we determined mRNA expression of selected chemokines, cytokines, and leukocyte markers in skin samples from 100 patients with <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> borrelial lymphocytoma, or acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and from 25 control subjects. Chemokine patterns in lesional skin {{in each of}} the three skin disorders included low but significant mRNA levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL 1 and the dendritic cell chemoattractant CCL 20 and intermediate levels of the macrophage chemoattractant CCL 2. <b>Erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and particularly acrodermatitis lesions had high mRNA expression of the T-cell-active chemokines CXCL 9 and CXCL 10 and low levels of the B-cell-active chemokine CXCL 13, whereas lymphocytoma lesions had high levels of CXCL 13 and lower levels of CXCL 9 and CXCL 10. This pattern of chemokine expression was consistent with leukocyte marker mRNA in lesional skin. Moreover, using immunohistologic methods, CD 3 + T cells and CXCL 9 were visualized in <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and acrodermatitis lesions, and CD 20 + B cells and CXCL 13 were seen in lymphocytoma lesions. Thus, <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans have high levels of the T-cell-active chemokines CXCL 9 and CXCL 10, whereas borrelial lymphocytoma has high levels of the B-cell-active chemokine CXCL 13...|$|R

40|$|Background: Lyme {{disease has}} a wide {{spectrum}} of clinical manifestations. Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical and serologic picture rather than on microbiological confirmation. Objective: To examine the clinical presentation and treatment outcome of early Lyme disease in patients with microbiologically confirmed <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: 31 university-based or clinician-practice sites in 10 en-demic states. Participants: 10 936 participants enrolled in a phase III trial of Lyme disease vaccine; 118 participants had <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> in which Borrelia burgdorferi was detected by culture or polymerase chain reaction. Measurements: Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome were noted. Skin biopsies of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> were performed for culture and detection of B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction; serologic responses were determined by Western blot. Results: The 118 patients with microbiologically confirmed ery-thema migrans presented a median of 3 days after symptom onset. Early <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> commonly had homogeneous or central redness rather than a peripheral erythema with partial central clearing. The most common associated symptoms were low-grade fever, headache, neck stiffness, arthralgia, myalgia, or fatigue. By convalescence, 65 % of patients had positive IgM or IgG antibody responses to B. burgdorferi. Most patients re-sponded promptly to antibiotic treatment.

40|$|<b>Erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> is {{the initial}} {{sign in the}} {{majority}} of patients infected with Borrelia, the genus of spirochetes that causes Lyme disease.

40|$|Skin biopsies of 36 {{patients}} with <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) before therapy {{and those of}} 8 patients after therapy were examined for Borrelia burgdorferi DNA by PCR. Skin biopsies of 27 {{patients with}} dermatological diseases other than Lyme borreliosis and those of 10 healthy persons were examined as controls. Two different primer sets targeting 23 S rRNA (PCR I) and 66 -kDa protein (PCR II) genes were used. PCR was performed with freshly frozen tissue (FFT) and paraffin-embedded tissue (PET). For FFT specimens of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> 73 % were positive by PCR I, 79 % were positive by PCR II, and 88 % were positive by combining PCR I and II. For PET specimens, PCR was less sensitive (PCR I, 44 %; PCR II, 52 %). For FFT specimens of ACA, PCR I was positive for two of five patients and PCR II was positive for four of five patients. B. burgdorferi was cultured from 79 % of the <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> specimens but not {{from any of the}} ACA lesions.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} physician-diagnosed Lyme disease in an endemic area of California, an active surveillance program was implemented in Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, and southern Humboldt counties. More than 200 medical care providers were called monthly for their list of suspected cases of Lyme disease. Pertinent information was abstracted from the medical record of each patient. Of 153 cases of possible early Lyme disease ascertained from July 1991 to December 1992, 37 % consisted of physician-diagnosed <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> Only 58 % of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> rashes were at least 5 cm in diameter. An additional 43 patients had suspicious rashes not classified as <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans.</b> Of 166 patients with possible late-stage Lyme disease, 31 % had specific clinical symptoms and 75 % had a positive serologic test. With an incident case defined as physician-diagnosed <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> of at least 5 cm in diameter, the annual incidence of Lyme disease in northwestern coastal California according to active surveillance only was 5. 5 per 100, 000. The rate of Lyme disease in California is substantially lower than that in the Atlantic northeastern United States. Many suspected cases of Lyme disease in this endemic area do not meet surveillance criteria, which are intentionally restrictive.

40|$|<b>Erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> the {{characteristic}} skin manifestation of acute Lyme borreliosis, is a self-limited lesion. In contrast, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, the typical cutaneous manifestation of late Lyme borreliosis, is a chronic skin condition. In {{an effort to}} understand pathogenic factors that lead to different outcomes in dermatoborrelioses, skin biopsy samples from 42 patients with <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> and 27 patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans were analyzed for mRNA expression of five pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin- 1 β, interleukin- 6, interferon-γ, and interleukin- 2) and two anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin- 4 and interleukin- 10) by in situ hybridization with cytokine-specific riboprobes. Among the 27 patients who had <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> alone with no associated signs or symptoms, the major cytokines expressed in perivascular infiltrates of T cells and macrophages were the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 10. In the 15 <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> patients who had associated signs and symptoms, including headache, elevated temperature, arthralgias, myalgias, or fatigue, {{a larger number of}} macrophages and greater expression of macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin- 1 β, and interleukin- 6, were also found. In comparison, infiltrates of T cells and macrophages in the skin lesions of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans patients had very little or no interferon-γ expression. Instead, they usually expressed only the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 4. Thus, the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> lesions, particularly interferon-γ, seems to be important in the control of the spirochetal infection.

The patient had no history of a recent tick-bite but displayed a positive serology for an advanced stage of Lyme borreliosis, which stood {{in contrast to the}} clinical manifestation of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> as a symptom of early Lyme disease. Three skin swabs and soil samples, collected in the area where the patient possibly acquired the infection, were examined by bacterial and fungal culture methods. Microorganisms were identified by using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics. The patient and soil isolates were compared by employing RAPD analysis. The serum samples of the patient were examined by immunoblotting. Arthrobacter mysorens, a soil bacterium, was isolated from the collected skin and soil samples.
