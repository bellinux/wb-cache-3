My tuo brigads lay in a village within halfe a mile of Applebie; my own quarter was in a gentleman's house, ho was a Ritmaster, and at that time with Sir Marmaduke; his wife keepd her chamber readie to be brought to bed. The castle being over, and Lambert farre enough, I resolved to goe to bed everie night, haveing had fatigue enough before. 'The first night I sleepd well enough; and riseing nixt morning, I misd one linnen stockine, one halfe silke one, and one boothose, the accoustrement under a boote for one leg; neither could they be found for any search. Being provided of more of the same kind, I made myselfe reddie, and rode to the head-quarters. At my returne, I could heare no news of my stockins. That night I went to bed, and nixt morning found myselfe just so used; missing the three stockins for one leg onlie, the other three being left intire as they were the day before. A narrower search then the first was made, bot without successe. I had yet in reserve one paire of whole stockings, and a paire of boothose, greater then the former. These I put on my legs. The third morning I found the same usage, the stockins for one leg onlie left me. It was time for me then, and my servants too, to imagine it must be rats that had shard my stockins so inequallie with me; and this the mistress of the house knew well enough, but would not tell it me. The roome, which was a low parlour, being well searched with candles, the top of my great boothose was found at a hole, in which they had drawne all the rest. I went abroad and ordered the boards to be raised, to see how the rats had disposed of my moveables. The mistress sent a servant of her oune to be present at this action, which she knew concerned her. One board being bot a litle <b>opend,</b> a litle boy of mine thrust in his hand, and fetchd with him foure and tuentie old peeces of gold, and one angell. The servant of the house affirmed it appertained to his mistres. The boy bringing the gold to me, I went immediatlie to the gentlewomans chamber, and told her, it was probable Lambert haveing quarterd in that house, as indeed he had, some of his servants might have hid that gold; and if so, it was lawfullie mine; bot if she could make it appeare it belongd to her, I should immediatlie give it her. The poore gentlewoman told me with many teares, that her husband being none of the frugallest men (and indeed he was a spendthrift), she had hid that gold without his, knowledge, to make use of it as she had occasion, especiallie when she lay in; and conjured me, as I lovd the King (for whom her husband and she had suffered much), not to detaine her gold. She said, if there was either more or lesse then foure and tuentie whole peeces, and two halfe ones, it sould be none of hers; and that they were put by her in a red velvet purse. After I had given her assureance of her gold, a new search is made, the other angell is found, the velvet purse all gnawd in bits, as my stockins were, and the gold instantlie restord to the gentlewoman. I have often heard that the eating or gnawing of cloths by rats is ominous, and portends some mischance to fall on those to whom the cloths belong. I thank God I was never addicted to such divinations, or heeded them. It is true, that more misfortunes then one fell on me shortlie after; bot I am sure I could have better forseene them myselfe then rats or any such vermine, and yet did it not. I have heard indeed many fine stories told of rats, how they abandon houses and ships, when the first are to be burnt and the second dround. Naturalists say they are very sagacious creatures, and I beleeve they are so; bot I shall never be of the opinion they can forsee future contingencies, which I suppose the divell himselfe can neither forknow nor fortell; these being things which the Almightie hath keepd hidden in the bosome of his divine prescience. And whither the great God hath preordained or predestinated these things, which to us are contingent, to fall out by ane uncontrollable and unavoidable necessitie, is a question not yet decided."

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} have a {{substantial}} impact on overdose prevention, the expansion and scalingup of overdose prevention with naloxone distribution (<b>OPEND)</b> programs are needed. However, limited literature exists on the best method to train the large number of trainers needed to implement such initiatives. Methods: As part of a national overdose prevention strategy, widespread <b>OPEND</b> was implemented throughout multiple low-threshold facilities in Norway. Following a two-hour ‘train-the trainer course’ staff were able to distribute naloxone in their facility. The course was open to all staff, regardless of educational background. To measure the effectiveness of the course, a questionnaire was given to participants immediately before and after the session, assessing knowledge on overdoses and naloxone, as well as attitudes towards the training session and distributing naloxone. Results: In total, 511 staff were trained during 41 trainer sessions. During a two-month survey period, 54 staff participated in a questionnaire study. Knowledge scores significantly improved in all areas following the training (p < 0. 001). Attitude scores improved, and the majority of staff found the training useful and intended to distribute naloxone to their clients. Conclusion: Large-scale naloxone distribution programs are likely to continue growing, and will require competent trainers to carry out training sessions.

40|$|International audienceEndocan is a {{recently}} identified soluble chondroitin/dermatan sulphate (CS/DS) proteoglycan. Synthesized by endothelial cells, {{it has been}} found to be over-expressed in the vasculature surrounding a number of tumours, and by promoting growth factor mitogenic activities, HGF/SF in particular, it supports cellular proliferation. In this work we characterized the GAG chain of Endocan, purified either from the naturally-producing human umbilical vein endothelial cells, or from a recombinant over-expression system in Human Embryonic Kidney cells. Compositional analysis using different chondroitinases as well as NMR studies revealed that the GAG chains from both sources share many characteristics, with the exception of size length (15 and 40 kDa, respectively, for HUVEC or HEK- 293 cells). The DS-specific, IdoA-containing disaccharides contribute 30 % of the chain (15 % of which are 2 -O-sulphated) and are mostly clustered in tetra (35 %) -, hexa (12 %) - and octa (5 %) - saccharide domains. Highly sulphated big up tri, <b>openD,</b> big up tri, openE and big up tri, openB disaccharide units (big up tri, openHexA 2 S-GalNAc 6 S, big up tri, openHexA-GalNAc 4 S 6 S and big up tri, openHexA 2 S-GalNAc 4 S) were also detected in significant amounts in both chains and may account for the HGF/SF-binding activity of the CS/DS. This work establishes that HEK- 293 cells can be engineered to provide a valuable source of Endocan with authentic CS/DS chains, enabling the purification of sufficient amounts for structural and/or binding analysis, and providing a possible model of Endocan CS/DS chain organisation...|$|E
