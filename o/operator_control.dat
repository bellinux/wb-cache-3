5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional <b>operator</b> <b>control</b> functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E
25|$|Others In addition, machine {{operators}} {{often use}} user interface devices, typically touchscreen units, which {{serve as the}} <b>operator</b> <b>control</b> panel. The operator can switch from program to program, make adjustments within a program and also operate a host of peripheral devices that may be integrated within the same robotic system. These include end effectors, feeders that supply components to the robot, conveyor belts, emergency stop controls, machine vision systems, safety interlock systems, bar code printers and an almost infinite array of other industrial devices which are accessed and controlled via the <b>operator</b> <b>control</b> panel.|$|E

The interactive device comprises a display area which depicts images and apparatus for receiving at least one input from the <b>operator</b> <b>controlled</b> input device to thus permit the <b>operator</b> to <b>control</b> and interact with {{at least some of the}} depicted images. One effect modification comprises measurement of the physiological activity of a person different from the operator, while modifying the ability of the <b>operator</b> to <b>control</b> and interact with at least some of the depicted images by modifying the input from the <b>operator</b> <b>controlled</b> input device in response to changes in the measured physiological signal...|$|R

30|$|In an experiment, <b>operators</b> <b>controlled</b> {{a mobile}} robot by {{steering}} to trace reference lines. However, in our construction machine, <b>operators</b> <b>control</b> {{on the basis}} of a work plan without a detailed reference trajectory. Operators have common actions, e.g., excavation and manipulation of a hoist arm. Operators change these actions according to the work target, habitual actions, and work progress. In particular, in teleoperation, it is difficult for <b>operators</b> to <b>control</b> the tip of a construction machine in three-dimensional space without perspective.|$|R
2500|$|In 1851, Thomas de Colmar {{simplified}} his arithmometer {{by removing}} the one digit multiplier/divider. This made it a simple adding machine, but thanks to its moving carriage used as an indexed accumulator, it still allowed for easy multiplication and division under <b>operator</b> <b>control.</b> The arithmometer was now adapted to the manufacturing capabilities of the time; Thomas could therefore manufacture consistently a sturdy and reliable machine. [...] Manuals were printed and each machine was given a serial number. Its commercialization launched the mechanical calculator industry. [...] Banks, insurance companies, government offices started to use the arithmometer in their day-to-day operations, slowly bringing mechanical desktop calculators into the office.|$|E
2500|$|The Operator Function Model (OFM) is {{proposed}} {{as an alternative}} to traditional task analysis techniques used by human factors engineers. An operator function model attempts to represent in mathematical form how an operator might decompose a complex system into simpler parts and coordinate control actions and system configurations so that acceptable overall system performance is achieved. The model represents basic issues of knowledge representation, information flow, and decision making in complex systems. Miller (1985) suggests that the network structure {{can be thought of as}} a possible representation of an operator's internal model of the system plus a control structure which specifies how the model is used to solve the decision problems that comprise <b>operator</b> <b>control</b> functions.> ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{removable}} <b>operator</b> <b>control</b> {{station is}} installed during the testing period [...] "for safety and backup" [...] until {{it can be}} determined to reliably operate on its own. [...] Operationally, computers will drive and control the ship, with a human always observing and taking charge if necessary in a concept called Sparse Supervisory Control, meaning a person is in control, but not [...] "joy sticking" [...] the vessel around. It can patrol without human guidance, using optical guidance and radar to avoid hitting obstacles or other watercraft. The ship has a host of non-standard features because of its lack of crew, including an internal layout that offers enough room for maintenance to be performed but not for any people to be permanently present.|$|E
