40|$|The {{incidence}} of increased life span {{as well as}} a lack of care for <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> gave rise to the South African Older persons Act (Act No 13 of 2006), which guides society in how our <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> should be treated. This Act also provides a clear indication of the expectations of caring for <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> within communities and families. Many <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> people rely on the relationships they have with their children in their golden years, to be fulfilling and loving. This study therefore aimed to explore the experiences of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> and their adult children on maintaining positive relationships in order for the relationship to be most beneficial for both <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> and their adult children. The quality of relationships between adult children and <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> according to Newby (2010) can ease participation of adult children in the lives of <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> This study was conducted from a qualitative research perspective that is exploratory, descriptive and contextual in nature. The exploratory-descriptive design allowed the researcher to understand the topic by using a narrative strategy of inquiry. A non-probability purposive sampling method was applied to identify five <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> as well as the adult children of these <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> who are retirees of an automotive company in South Africa. Individual, semi-structured face to face interviews were conducted with <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> as well as with at least one of their adult children who did not reside with them. Thematic data analysis technique was used to analyse the data collected. The study is viewed as significant in enhancing the understanding of satisfying and caring relationships between <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> and their adult children in order to add to the body of existing knowledge in social gerontology and to improve direct social work practice with <b>older</b> <b>persons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Apathy is a {{behavioral}} syndrome that often co-occurs with depression. Nonetheless, {{the etiology of}} apathy and depression may be different. We hypothesized that apathy occurs more often in depressed compared to non-depressed older persons; and that independent correlates for apathy will be different in depressed and non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Methods: In this cross-sectional study of Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO), a total of 350 depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> according to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and 126 non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> aged at least 60 years were recruited in several Medical Centres and general practices. In both depressed and non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> those with and without apathy as assessed with the Apathy Scale (score ≥ 14) were compared with regard to socio-demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics. Results: Apathy was present in 75 % of the depressed and 25 % of the non- depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Independent correlates of apathy in both depressed and non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> were male gender and less education. Furthermore, in depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> {{higher scores on the}} Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and, in non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level correlated independently with apathy. Conclusions: Apathy occurred frequently among both depressed and non-depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Among depressed <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> apathy appeared to be a symptom of more serious depression, whereas among non-depressed persons apathy was associated with increased CRP being a marker for immune activation, suggesting a different aetiology for apathy in its own right...|$|R
40|$|As <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> are {{steadily}} increasing {{in number and}} there are no specialized comprehensive healthcare services for <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in Indonesia, including East Kalimantan, the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the extent of the problems facing healthcare staff and officials in Tarakan City, East Kalimantan, in providing comprehensive healthcare services attuned to the needs of <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> This study was a qualitative interview-based survey with focus group discussions, involving heads and healthcare officials of seven puskesmas in Tarakan City, East Kalimantan district, with the addition of a number of district health planning officials. The results revealed a difference between daily hospital referral rate of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> by puskesmas staff and actual daily hospital admission rate for the referrals. None of the consulted healthcare staff had any speciality education in geriatrics or <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> health. The <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> most frequently presented to the hospital with hypertension, diabetes, and myocardial insufficiency. On the other hand, at the health centers the presenting conditions were hypertension, gastroenteritis, rheumatism, sleep disorders, and upper respiratory tract infections. Improved access to healthcare for <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> should be achieved by improving knowledge and skills of human resources, including communication skills, and of supporting healthcare service infrastructure at puskesmas, specifically oriented towards the needs of and designed for use by <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> such as ramps for wheelchairs, and handrails in corridors.

25|$|The field {{first began}} {{to emerge in the}} 1930s during the first studies on {{behavioral}} and social gerontology, and were associated with deterministic explanations of the relationship between aging and environment from genetic parameters and biological.

Powell Lawton (1923–2001) (ecological adaptation model), based on the influence of the interactions between the <b>older</b> <b>person</b> and their environment (adaptation – ambient pressure), confirm the importance of the physical and social environment (objective and subjective) in the understanding of the aging population and the possibility of improving the quality of life in old age.|$|E
25|$|One {{recommended}} diagnostic {{approach is}} as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss, new seizures, new weakness, new confusion, further workup with imaging {{and possibly a}} lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography test {{to look for a}} brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the CSF, as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. If there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an <b>older</b> <b>person,</b> a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started.|$|E
40|$|Aims. The goal of {{this brief}} review is to address studies {{examining}} the relationship between physical inactivity and pain in aging and dementia. Background. A decrease {{in the level of}} physical activity is characteristic of <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> both with and without dementia. Passive behaviour is often considered {{to be part of the}} apathy frequently observed in patients with dementia, although it could also be a sign of pain. Design. Literature review. Method. Searches were performed in PubMed and Embase. A total of 15 studies concerning the relationship between physical inactivity and pain in <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with and without dementia were identified (<b>older</b> <b>persons</b> without dementia: 12; with dementia: 3). Results. In <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> without dementia, a positive relationship between physical inactivity and pain has been demonstrated. In <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with dementia, pain may cause physical inactivity and physical inactivity may cause pain. Conclusions. In <b>older</b> <b>persons,</b> a positive relationship between physical inactivity and pain was demonstrated. More specifically, pain may cause physical inactivity. In <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with dementia pain may cause physical inactivity and vice versa. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses' awareness of physical inactivity as an indication of pain in <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> with and without dementia may reduce the risk of underdiagnosis and subsequent undertreatment of pain. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Aging is a {{significant}} social issue today. In many Asian countries, the increase of the population percentage of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> has put great pressure on governments, related departments and organisations, private companies, and non-government organisations serving <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Despite their efforts, <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> still face {{a certain degree of}} exclusion and continue to receive limited concern and assistance in their daily lives. Since 2003, the Public Design Lab of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University has conducted a series of applied research projects relating to the needs and preferences of <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> The key aim of the projects is to bring a better quality of public life to <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> In many Asian cities, public buses are the most popular form of transportation for <b>older</b> <b>persons.</b> Taking an applied research project on buses in Hong Kong as a case study, this paper identifies the difficulties of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in accessing buses.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> in the Netherlands feel healthy and happy for a long time. A smaller group of mostly very elderly persons have become dependent on care and support. It is in the transition between these two groups that vulnerable <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> are found. At first sight, these persons appear to be healthy and they also still feel well, which means that help is generally sought or offered too late when health problems arise. In some cases, it transpires after the event that admission to a care or nursing home could perhaps have been avoided if their vulnerability had been identified earlier and minor interventions could have helped them maintain their quality of life. How many vulnerable <b>older</b> <b>persons</b> are there in the Netherlands? Will their number increase markedly in the years ahead?

Also, despite its manifest strengths, the procedure is based on just 20 minutes of behaviour. It can be scarcely expected to tap all the relevant qualities of a child's attachment relationships. Q-sort procedures based on much longer naturalistic observations in the home, and interviews with the mothers have developed in order to extend the data base (see Vaughn & Waters, 1990). A further constraint is that the coding procedure results in discrete categories rather than continuously distributed dimensions. Not only is this likely to provide boundary problems, but also {{it is not at all}} obvious that discrete categories best represent the concepts that are inherent in attachment security.
