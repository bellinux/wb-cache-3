5|$|From 1210 <b>on,</b> <b>Michael</b> I Komnenos Doukas {{was engaged}} in a {{campaign}} of expansion, chiefly {{at the expense of}} the Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica to his east; after initial reverses, much of Thessaly was conquered. By 1214, Dyrrhachium and Corfu had been recovered from the Latins as well. The traditional view of historians is that these events marked Michael I's repudiation of the allegiance he had sworn to the Latin Empire, but historian Philip Van Tricht argues that both Michael and later Theodore remained, at least in theory, vassals of the Latin Empire until 1217. Michael was assassinated by a servant in late 1214 or in 1215. As Michael II was illegitimate and too young, Theodore had no trouble in sidelining the boy. According to the hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, the boy and his mother spent the duration of his reign exiled in the Peloponnese.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the {{divisions}} in the state party proved ruinous for Randall's chances at the Speaker's chair. Instead, the Democrats decided <b>on</b> <b>Michael</b> C. Kerr of Indiana, who was elected. Randall was instead named chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In that post, he focused on reducing the government's spending, and cut the budget by $30,000,000, despite opposition from the Republican Senate. Kerr's health was fragile, and he was often absent from sessions, but Randall refused {{to take his place}} as speaker on a temporary basis, preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work.

5|$|Cerny and Flanagan first {{collaborated on}} a video game based <b>on</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson's Thriller. The project was {{canceled}} and the two began working on an idea of Cerny's that eventually became Marble Madness. Development lasted 10months. Following the North American video game crash of 1983, video game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience {{through the use of}} a unique control system and by emphasizing a simultaneous two-player mode. Cerny designed Marble Madness in accordance with these company goals. He was first inspired by miniature golf and captivated by the idea that a play field's contours influenced the ball's path. Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari's digital art system. After deciding to use an isometric grid, Cerny began developing the game's concept. His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to miniature golf, but Atari was unenthusiastic. Cerny next thought of racing games and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent. Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in-game physics necessary for the idea, and Cerny switched the game's objective to a race against time.|$|E
