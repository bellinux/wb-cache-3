5|$|In 1980, Marburger left USC {{to become}} the third {{president}} of the State University <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> Stony Brook on Long Island, New York.

5|$|Jorge F. Guillemín {{cleared the}} ruins in 1956, mapped the {{surviving}} structures, {{as well as}} mapping the central K'iche' region and Q'umarkaj's satellite sites.

Two blocks north of campus, at New Paltz Middle School, it turns west at a traffic signal to join NY299 as the village's Main Street.|$|E

The same year his son attended Berkeley. The Berkeley department of psychology officially split from the department of philosophy, with Stratton as its first chair, on July 1, 1922. His second daughter, Florence, {{graduated from}} Berkeley with a B.A. in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{graduated}} from Pine Bush High School in Pine Bush, New York in 1992, {{where he played}} basketball and baseball and ran track. Only Division III colleges showed minimal interest in him, {{and he ended up}} at Stony Brook University largely because his high school assistant coach Jeff Masionet and Stony Brook baseball coach Matt Senk knew each other as former teammates in the State University <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> Cortland baseball program.|$|E
5|$|New York was {{key to the}} election; a Lincoln loss {{there would}} {{deadlock}} the Electoral College. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> Weed's urging he went to New York City and gave a patriotic speech before a large crowd on November 3, only {{three days before the}} election. On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South, Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouri—the only state Seward campaigned in that Lincoln did not win. Lincoln was elected.|$|E

5|$|Past {{the end of}} the reservoir, NY10 {{continues}} northeast in {{the vicinity}} of the Delaware River to Walton, a village located directly on the banks of the river. Within the village limits, NY10 overlaps NY206 along Delaware Street before separating from the route and proceeding east out of the village. NY10 remains alongside the Delaware as it continues northeast to Delhi, the home of the State University <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> Delhi. After passing along the eastern edge of the campus, NY10 intersects and briefly overlaps NY28 through the village center before quietly leaving the area.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing her}} job, Boisselier moved with her middle child, a son, to Quebec, where her eldest {{daughter}} was a student. Boisselier began {{to travel to}} discuss Clonaid, eventually becoming a high-profile speaker. Around that time, she reached the rank of Bishop within Raëlism. She {{was one of the}} 25 members closest to Raël and joined the group's Order of Angels, which promoted free love and femininity. She moved to the United States and began teaching at State University <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> Plattsburgh for a short time before moving to Hamilton College in 2000 to teach chemistry. Her association with Clonaid was publicized in the U.S. in February 2001, and she resigned her academic position that May, although she had a three-year contract. She claimed she was initially popular at Hamilton College, but felt that she was disrespected after her association with Clonaid was publicized.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, Hill was {{interview}}ed by Ultrasport. They offered her a free flight to New York for the interview {{and as part of}} the trip she was taken to the Shawangunks, a famous nearby climbing area. Finding she liked the climbing environment and yearning for some new challenges, she decided to stay and moved to New Paltz, New York. At the same time, Long was preparing for a journey to Borneo and embarking on a career as a writer. The couple went their separate ways but remained friends. After moving to New York, Hill attended the State University <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> New Paltz and graduated with a degree in biology in 1985.|$|E
5|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), detects some {{similarities}} to The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (1903). Both tales have touches of the pourquoi story in their explanations of why squirrels collect nuts, and both incorporate rhymes and riddles in their narratives. However, there is a crucial difference that diminishes the artistry of Timmy Tiptoes: the rhymes and riddles in Squirrel Nutkin shed light on Nutkin's character and create a guessing game for the reader while those in Timmy Tiptoes are bland devices that simply move the characters to reunions with their wives and the tale to its conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Jefferson, NY10 {{continues}} onward through rural Schoharie County, {{passing through}} only small roadside hamlets {{before entering the}} village of Richmondville, a community situated on NY7 and the Cobleskill Creek. NY10 bypasses the village to the southeast, however, and intersects both NY7 and I-88, the limited-access highway that parallels much of NY7, east of the village center. NY10 turns east, overlapping NY7 through the State University <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> Cobleskill campus and into Cobleskill, where NY7 and NY10 intersect NY145 at Grand Street. Here, NY10, as well as NY145 (which is concurrent with NY7 east of this point), leave NY7 and continue north for two blocks before NY10 leaves NY145 and heads west out of the village on Elm Street.|$|E

5|$|Past NY281, NY222 crosses a {{commercial}} section of Cortlandville, passing several strip malls prior to entering {{the city of}} Cortland. Now named Groton Avenue, the route slowly curves eastward while traversing a residential part of the city. It passes north of the State University <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> Cortland, and the campus marks {{the western edge of}} downtown Cortland. NY222 becomes {{a commercial}}ized street again, serving a pair of city blocks before intersecting with US 11 and NY41 (Main Street). US 11 and NY 41 join NY222, and the concurrency between the three routes heads east through downtown as Clinton Avenue. The overlap lasts for just one block, however, as NY222 ends upon intersecting NY13 at the next junction. NY13 northbound continues east along Clinton Avenue while NY13 southbound heads south along Church Street on an overlap with US11 and NY41.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{publication}} of Preface to Plato, Havelock accepted {{a position as}} chair of the Classics Department at Yale University. He remained in New Haven for eight years, and then taught briefly as Raymond Distinguished Professor of Classics at the State University <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> Buffalo. He retired in 1973 and moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, where his wife Christine Mitchell, whom he had married in 1962, taught at Vassar College. He was a productive scholar after his retirement, writing three books as well as numerous essays and talks expanding the arguments of Preface to Plato to a generalised argument about the effect of literacy on Greek thought, literature, culture, society, and law.|$|E
