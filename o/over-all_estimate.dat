40|$|PRESENT-DAY {{achievement}} tests are usually constructed to meas-ure several areas of achievement and, consequently, present a bat-tery of subtests, {{each of which}} purports to measure one particular aspect of achievement. Test buyers are constantly concerned with problems of selecting a valid and reliable test, with considerations for the information available from the test, and with cost factors. Test users {{on the other hand}} must consider the meaning of test scores (e. g., Cronbach, 1960, pp. 69 - 87), the diagnostic and prog-nostic value of the test scores, and a reasonable summary of an in-dividual’s achievement record. The latter problem is often resolved by means of a profile pattern indicating an individual’s standing on each subtest (viz., achievement area) in relation to population norms. An over-all achievement level, however, is not obviously available from an individual’s profile, and so the user is left with no <b>over-all</b> <b>estimate</b> of a student’s achievement. Moreover, several other problems are encountered in the summary and interpretation of achievement test results. First, there are differences in absolute achievement levels indicated by different achievement batteries, an...|$|E
40|$|In {{robotic vision}} using laser-radar measurements, noisy data on convex sets with corners are derived {{in terms of}} the set's support function. The corners {{represent}} abutting edges of manufactured items, and convey important information about the items' shape. However, simple methods for set estimation, for example based on fitting random polygons or smooth sets, either add additional corners as an artifact of the algorithm, or approximate corners by smooth curves. It might be argued, however, that corners have special significance in the interpretation of a set, and should not be introduced as an artifact of the estimation procedure. In this paper we suggest a corner-diagnostic approach, {{in the form of a}} three-step algorithm which (a) identifies the number and positions of corners, (b) fits smooth curves between corners, and (c) splices together the smooth curves and the corners, to produce an <b>over-all</b> <b>estimate</b> of the convex set. The corner-finding step is parametric in character, and although it is based on detecting change points in high-order derivatives of the support function, it produces root-n consistent estimators of the locations of corners. On the other hand, the smooth-curve fitting step is entirely nonparametric. The splicing step marries these two disparate approaches into a single, practical methodP. Hall and B. A. Turlac...|$|E
40|$|The inhospitable ambient surface {{conditions}} of Venus, with a 450 C temperature and 92 bar pressure, may likely require any extended-duration surface exploratory mission to incorporate {{some type of}} cooling for probe electronics and sensor devices. A multiple-region Venus mission study was completed at NASA GRC in December of 2003 {{that resulted in the}} preliminary design of a kinematically-driven, helium charged, Stirling cooling cycle with an <b>estimated</b> <b>over-all</b> COP of 0. 376 to lift 100 watts of heat from a 200 C cold sink temperature and reject it at a hot sink temperature of 500 C. This paper briefly describes the design process and also describes and summarizes key features of the kinematic, Stirling cooler preliminary design concept...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of turbine-engine combustors usually {{is given in}} terms of operating limits and combustion efficiency. The latter property is determined most often by measuring the increase in enthalpy across the combustor {{through the use of}} thermocouples. This investigation was conducted to determine the ability of gas-analytical techniques to provide additional information about combustor performance. Gas samples were taken at the outlet and two upstream stations and their compositions determined. In addition to <b>over-all</b> combustion efficiency, <b>estimates</b> of local fuel-air ratios, local combustion efficiencies, and heat-release rates can be made. Conclusions can be drawn concerning the causes of combustion inefficiency and may permit corrective design changes to be made more intelligently. The purpose of this investigation was not to present data for a given combustor but rather to show the types and value of additional information that can be gained from gas-analytical data...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of left ventricular ejection time (LVET) measured {{directly from the}} central aortic pressure tracing (CAPT) and a densitogram recording {{was carried out in}} 39 patients during diagnostic cardiac catheterization. The correlation coefficient between the LVET derived from the CAPT and densitogram of 32 patients while at rest was 0. 974 with a standard deviation from regression (SDR) of 6. 2 msec. Sequential LVETs were analyzed in two patients during atrial pacing, three patients during exercise and three patients with atrial fibrillation. Correlation coefficients were 0. 981, 0. 951 and 0. 974 with SDRS of 5. 3, 6. 2 and 6. 7 msec respectively. Assuming LVET from the CAPT to be error free, the <b>over-all</b> error of <b>estimating</b> LVET by den-sitogram was less than 5 % for over 95 % of the measurements. The largest mean difference between CAPT and densitogram derived LVETs was present during atrial pacing and corresponds to an error of less than 2 % of the average LVET for the group. We conclude that densitometry is a practical and reliable nonin-vasive method for LVET measurements in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions.

40|$|High-dose {{melphalan}} with stem-cell trans-plantation {{is believed}} to be the most effective treatment for systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, but many pa-tients are ineligible because of the extent of their disease, and treatment-related mortality (TRM) remains substantial. We report the use of a risk-adapted oral regi-men of cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (CTD) or attenuated CTD (CTDa) in 75 patients with advanced AL amyloidosis, including 44 patients with clonal relapse after prior therapy. Fifty-one (68 %) patients received CTD and 24 (32 %) received CTDa. A hematologic re-sponse occurred in 48 (74 %) of 65 evalu-able patients, including complete re-sponses in 14 (21 %) and partial responses in 34 (53 %) cases. Median <b>estimated</b> <b>over-all</b> survival (OS) from commencement of treatment was 41 months, and from diag-nosis median was not reached with a median follow-up of 22 months. Three-year estimated OS was 100 % and 82 % among complete and partial hematologic responders, respectively. Toxicity neces-sitating cessation of therapy occurred in 8 % and was at least grade 2 in 52 % of patients. TRM was 4 %. The clonal re-sponse rates to CTD reported here are higher than any previously reported non-transplantation regimen in AL amyloid-osis, and risk adaptation allows its use in poorer risk patients. CTD merits prospec-tive randomized study. (Blood. 2007; 109...|$|R
