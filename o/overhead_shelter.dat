5000|$|The {{auditorium}} (literally [...] "place for hearing" [...] in Latin) was {{the area}} in which people gathered, and was sometimes constructed on a small hill or slope in which stacked seating could be easily made {{in the tradition of the}} Greek Theatres.

This was of course not always the case as Romans tended to build their theatres regardless of the availability of hillsides. All theatres built within the city of Rome were completely man-made without the use of earthworks. The auditorium was not roofed; rather, awnings (vela) could be pulled <b>overhead</b> to provide <b>shelter</b> from rain or sunlight.|$|R
40|$|Many {{scholars}} have identified enclosure {{as important in}} both interior and exterior space configuration. Enclosures are even more important in public open space design within a context of urbanization and densely developed cities. However, {{only a limited number}} of spatial identifies have been specified and studied, and studies on the topic have rarely been pragmatic. Under such circumstances, spatial identities and their relationship with enclosure should be elaborated. An integral and objective way to measure and estimate enclosure of a certain space based on these identities is needed. In addition, the effects of enclosure on users have not received sufficient attention and need systematically exploration. Health outcomes are on the specific focus in the current study. Based on previous studies, 18 measurable spatial indicators related to enclosure are selected for further study. Using factor analysis on a sample size of 116 open spaces within or near public housing estates in Hong Kong, 11 of these 18 indicators are identified as being crucial for spatial enclosure. Four principal factors (i. e., scale, H/D relationship, gap, and shape) cover 80. 94 % of the information on the 11 indicators. Based on Cronbach’s alpha, these factors are proven reliable. The enclosures are further estimated based on the 11 indicators and coefficients using factor analysis. With a subset of 26 spaces, the estimated enclosure is proven as valid and reliable after examination of Cronbach’s alpha by 200 untrained (without architecture-related professional training) and 63 trained (with architecture-related professional training) subjects. Major spatial indicators of enclosure are further studied for detecting potential health-related influence on subjects. Methods of questionnaire survey, quasi-experimental questionnaire survey, and observation are employed. The examined three aspects of health outcomes are physical, psychological and social. Based on 178 untrained and 63 trained valid samples in questionnaire survey, statistic correlation between spatial enclosure and health outcomes are identified, although still general and insufficient in explaining the exact relationship between them. Specifically, brighter, larger, more coherent, mysterious or legible space may be more inspiring for feeling or behavior that leads to positive health outcomes, whereas complexity does not seem to be correlated with the three categories of health feedback. With a sample of 109 college students, a quasi-experimental questionnaire survey confirms that perceived spatial enclosure and feelings can be influenced by spatial identities of scale of space, height, width and density of enclosing materials. Such results further confirm and elaborate the influence of enclosure on mental health. According to observations in 7 out of the 26 spaces, certain enclosure characteristics, such as foliage and <b>overhead</b> <b>shelters,</b> scale of immediate space and its visual extension, together with relationship between target space and its surrounding environment, are likely related with the emotions and behaviors of users. Thus, the effects of enclosure on the physical and social health of users are likely to be true. Although this study and its generalization have many limitations, it achieves two major goals and proposes several design implications for landscape practice. Generally, realizing health-beneficial urban open space is possible through enclosure design. published_or_final_versionArchitectureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Cormorants, Phalacocorax spp., {{have great}} {{potential}} to affect recreational fisheries and have increased substantially in abundance {{over the last}} decades in UK inland waters. Fabricated refuges provide a potential means of reducing fish losses, yet the benefits of such structures may be marginal if natural shelters are abundant and favoured, or if strong density-dependence limits refuge use. This study examined the efficacy of artificial shelters in mesocosm enclosures that allowed standardised and replicated observations of roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.), distribution. When given a choice between occupying open water, simulated reedbeds and artificial brushwood shelters, roach used brushwood shelters extensively {{across a range of}} fish densities. When fish had a choice of occupying open water or reedbeds offering no overhead cover, they actively avoided reedbeds and used open water almost exclusively. Occupation of reedbeds was positively related to the amount of overhead cover they provided. When artificial brushwood shelters and reedbeds offered complete <b>overhead</b> cover, brushwood <b>shelters</b> were occupied twice as much as reedbeds. Artificial shelters may therefore have wide application in stillwaters with abundant reedbeds unless the reedbeds are coupled with extensive overhead cover...|$|R

50|$|These {{buildings}} were semi-circular and possessed certain inherent architectural structures, with minor differences {{depending on the}} region {{in which they were}} constructed. The scaenae frons was a high back wall of the stage floor, supported by columns. The proscaenium was a wall that supported the front edge of the stage with ornately decorated niches off to the sides. The Hellenistic influence is seen through the use of the proscaenium. The Roman theatre also had a podium, which sometimes supported the columns of the scaenae frons. The theatre itself was divided into the stage (orchestra) and the seating section (auditorium). Vomitoria or entrances and exits were made available to the audience.The auditorium, the area in which people gathered, was sometimes constructed on a small hill or slope in which stacked seating could be easily made {{in the tradition of the}} Greek Theatres. The center of the auditorium was hollowed out of a hill or slope, while the outer radian seats required structural support and solid retaining walls.

2500|$|Costs were {{controlled}} during construction {{and operation of}} the system by going with the lowest bidder and using relatively cheap, commercially available technology without regard for [...] "buy Canadian" [...] policies. This has worked out well for a pioneer system because the German technology chosen has since become {{a more or less}} standard design for most North American LRT systems, and compatible new-generation equipment with new features is available off-the-shelf. [...] A grade-separated system was passed over in preference for a system with few elevated or buried segments, and the trains and stations selected were of the tried and tested, utilitarian variety (for example, vehicles were not air conditioned, storage yards were not automated, and stations were usually modest concrete platforms with a <b>shelter</b> <b>overhead).</b> [...] This allowed greater amounts of track to be laid within available budgets. The CTrain reduced fare collection costs by using an honour system of payment. Transit police check passenger tickets at random, and fines are set at a level high enough that those who are caught pay the costs for those who evade detection. Staffing costs were kept low by employing a minimum number of workers, and because the system is all-electric (wind powered) it can run all night with only 1 driver per train and 2 people in the control room. It now runs 22 hours per day without significantly increased overhead. (The other 2 hours are reserved for track maintenance).|$|R
6000|$|Of {{course it}} is {{altogether}} too late, now, to look {{for any of the}} early spring flowers, but I can recall the exquisite effect of the tender blue hepatica fringing the centre rail of the grip-cars, all up and down Broadway, and apparently springing from the hollow beneath, where the cable ran with such a brooklike gurgle that any damp-living plant must find itself at home there. The water-pimpernel may now be seen, by any sympathetic eye, blowing delicately along the track, in the breeze of the passing cabs, and elastically lifting itself from the rush of the cars. The reader can easily verify it by the picture in Mrs. Creevey's book. He knows it by its other name of brook weed; and he will have my delight, I am sure, in the cardinal-flower which will be with us in August. It is a shy flower, loving the more sequestered nooks, and may be sought along the shady stretches of Third Avenue, where the Elevated Road <b>overhead</b> forms a <b>shelter</b> as of interlacing boughs. The arrow-head likes such swampy expanses as the converging surface roads form at Dead Man's Curve and the corners of Twenty third Street. This is in flower now, and will be till September; and St.-John's-wort, which some call the false golden- rod, is already here. You may find it in any moist, low ground, but the gutters of Wall Street, or even the banks of the Stock Exchange, are not too dry for it. The real golden-rod is not much in evidence with us, for it comes only when summer is on the wane. The other night, however, on the promenade of the Madison Square Roof Garden, I was delighted to see it growing all over the oblong dome of the auditorium, in response to the cry of a homesick cricket which found itself in exile there {{at the base of a}} potted ever green. This lonely insect had no sooner sounded its winter-boding note than the fond flower began sympathetically to wave and droop along those tarry slopes, as I have seen it on how many hill-side pastures! But this may have been only a transitory response to the cricket, and I cannot promise the visitor to the Roof Garden that he will find golden-rod there every night. I believe there is always Golden Seal, but it is the kind that comes in bottles, and not in the gloom of [...] "deep, cool, moist woods," [...] where Mrs. Creevey describes it as growing, along with other wildings of such sweet names or quaint as Celandine, and Dwarf Larkspur, and Squirrel-corn, and Dutchman's breeches, and Pearlwort, and Wood-sorrel, and Bishop's--cap, and Wintergreen, and Indian-pipe, and Snowberry, and Adder's-tongue, and Wakerobin, and Dragon-root, and Adam-and-Eve, and twenty more, which must have got their names from some fairy of genius. I should say it was a female fairy of genius who called them so, and that she had her own sex among mortals in mind when she invented their nomenclature, and was thinking of little girls, and slim, pretty maids, and happy young wives. The author tells how they all look, with a fine sense of their charm in her words, but one would know how they looked from their names; and when you call them over they at once transplant themselves to the depths of the dells between our sky-scrapers, and find a brief sojourn in the cavernous excavations whence other sky-scrapers are to rise.|$|R
