25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
500|$|Morten then {{stated that}} they did not feel that Keč was doing things the right way. If he chose to fly to a new airport, {{negotiations}} would have to start again, perhaps in a different language. Morten urged Keč to calm down and that they wanted to solve the situation just as much as him. Keč responded by pleading for help for Bosnia. At 20:50, Keč stated [...] "I wish to release everyone and myself. Both Bosnians and Norwegians will understand this". After confirming his surrender would occur at 21:00, Keč stated that he was [...] "cold and calm" [...] and that he intended to surrender without any trouble. Directed by the negotiation, Keč went to the door, <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> was arrested.|$|E

500|$|The feud between The Undertaker and Randy Orton and [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton {{began at}} SummerSlam. At the event, Randy faced off against Undertaker. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob (disguised as a fan) {{came into the}} ring and {{interrupted}} the match. Following this, Randy pinned Undertaker after he jumped and pulled Undertaker's head down over his shoulders, a move dubbed the RKO, to win. After the match, Randy peeled off the latex mask of the fan and revealed him to be his father, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob. On the September 16 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker defeated Randy. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob drove a U-Haul truck down to the ring and unloaded a casket. As Undertaker went to put Randy inside the casket, he <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> found a mannequin of himself inside.

The following week, druids wheeled out a casket. Undertaker appeared on the TitonTron and urged The Ortons to look inside. The Ortons opened the casket and found mannequins of themselves inside. Undertaker then proclaimed {{that this would be}} their fate at No Mercy.|$|E

2500|$|One {{afternoon}} of November, 1868, in the Park at Hawarden, I {{was standing by}} Mr. Gladstone holding his coat on my arm while he, in his shirt sleeves, was wielding an axe to cut down a tree. Up came a telegraph messenger. He took the telegram, <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> read it, then handed it to me, speaking only two words, namely, 'Very significant', and at once resumed his work. The message merely stated that General Grey would arrive that evening from Windsor. [...] This, of course, implied that a mandate {{was coming from the}} Queen charging Mr. Gladstone with the formation of his first Government. [...] I said nothing, but waited while the well-directed blows resounded in regular cadence. [...] After a few minutes the blows ceased and Mr. Gladstone, resting on the handle of his axe, looked up, and with deep earnestness in his voice, and great intensity in his face, exclaimed: My mission is to pacify Ireland. He then resumed his task, and never said another word till the tree was down.|$|E

60|$|She {{was aware}} now,--as always,--how much {{depended}} on her personal bearing; {{but this was}} a moment of moments! She would fain have kept the letter, <b>and</b> have <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> in the retirement of her own room. She knew its terrible importance, and was afraid of her own countenance when she should read it. All the hopes of her life were contained in that letter. But were she to put it in her pocket she would betray her anxiety by doing so. She found herself bound to <b>open</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> read <b>it</b> at once,--and she did <b>open</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> read <b>it.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A late ballad {{contains}} {{the circumstances under}} which Niers was discovered, leading to his arrest and execution. He arrived at Neumarkt, and lodged in an inn called [...] "The Bells". A couple of days later, he felt a desire to wash himself, and went to a public bath house, leaving behind his precious bag with magical materials to be kept safe by the inn-keeper. At this time, Peter Niers had achieved notoriety, and his physical appearance had circulated in warrants and pamphlets. One of those at the bath house, a cooper, recognized him, and gradually a mumbling and whispering spread among the bath house guests that the stranger might, indeed, be the wanted arch-killer. Peter Niers himself was oblivious to the changing mood, and two citizens slipped out of the bath house and went to the inn. There, on request, the inn keeper gave them Niers's bag, they <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> it contained several cut off hands and hearts from murdered fetuses. The townspeople reacted quickly, and a force of eight men was gathered that apprehended Peter Niers. When he understood they had found out what he carried in his sack, he admitted to his identity, and that he was guilty, and confessed to his many murders.|$|E
