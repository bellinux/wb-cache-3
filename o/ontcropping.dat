40|$|Clay mineral {{studies have}} been {{undertaken}} on Pleistocene-Recent and Cretaceous (Maestrichtian) sedi-ments from the outcrop area of seismic reflector Horizon A in the North American Basin. In Quaternary sediments, chlorite is more abundant than kaolinite; in Cretaceous sediments, chlorite is diminished. Develop-ment of zeolltes, clinoptilolite and phillipsite, along with increase in abundance of montmorillonite indicate that devitrifieation of ash has been an active diagenetic 19 rocess in Cretaceous ediments. Changes in kaolinite and chlorite abundances across the diseonformable contact between Cretaceous and Quaternary sediments {{may be due to}} climatic differences or to a change in sediment source. I NTRODUCTION Mineralogical investigations by X-ray diffrac-tion analysis have been undertaken on several cores (fig. I; table 1) from the outcrop area of the seismic reflector Horizon A (Ewing and others, 1966; Saito and others, 1966), an area of <b>ontcropping</b> of the oldest known dee...|$|E
