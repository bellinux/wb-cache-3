5|$|The newest {{bridge across}} the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron <b>overshot</b> <b>wheel,</b> was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill {{has been the subject}} of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington.|$|E

There are remains of buildings including a smithy, office, two-storey accommodation block, dry store & miners' changing house and explosives store.|$|E
25|$|The present plain three-storey brick {{building}} dates from 1837 replacing an earlier one. The machinery {{was driven by}} a 13ft diameter <b>overshot</b> <b>wheel.</b> The mill was operated by an Attlee family (who also ran Parsonage Mill) from 1882 until milling ceased in 1910. The machinery was removed in 1937 {{for use in a}} Sussex mill. During World War II Moss Bros. used the building as a warehouse. It is now a private house, but the water channels remain.|$|E

50|$|<b>Overshot</b> <b>wheels</b> {{require a}} large head {{compared}} to other types of wheel which usually means significant investment in constructing the head race. Sometimes the final approach of the water to the wheel is along a flume or penstock, which can be lengthy.|$|R
5000|$|While the mill's turbine {{is not as}} {{photogenic}} as the <b>overshot</b> <b>wheels</b> {{that power}} mills such as the Cable Mill at Cades Cove, it was more efficient and required less water power to operate. The turbine generated approximately [...] turning at 400 rpm.|$|R
5|$|The {{grinding}} equipment {{is powered by}} a pair of <b>overshot</b> <b>wheels,</b> which transfer power to the crown wheel via a series of belts. This then drives the grinding stones and sack lift. There is a doorway on the first floor to allow material to be hoisted up the building.|$|R
2500|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries {{there were many}} flax mills around Te Uku. The longest lived started about 1868, when Wallis Brothers used a water-wheel to drive a mill at Okete Falls. The <b>overshot</b> <b>wheel</b> was {{replaced}} by a pelton wheel in 1902. In 1925, due to shortage of flax, [...] the pelton wheel was attached to a generator and the flax mill closed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{surviving}} corn mill building, {{now just}} [...] "Oxted Mill", [...] {{has been converted}} into offices. It dates from 1892-5, although on a site in use from much earlier.

50|$|Shepherd's Mill is a {{gristmill}} in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, {{located on}} Town Run {{just as it}} descends to the Potomac River. The mill was built some time prior to 1739 by Thomas Shepherd, Sr. (1705-1776) — founder and namesake of the town — as a two-story structure. The original millwheel was probably a wood <b>overshot</b> <b>wheel.</b> The present 40 ft Fitz Water Wheel Company steel <b>overshot</b> <b>wheel</b> was built in 1894; {{with the addition of}} a third story in the late 19th century, the mill is more representative of that era.|$|E

50|$|In 1770 {{the first}} {{attempts}} took place {{to erect a}} hammer works on this site. The iron hammer forge was built using an available weir which was being used to irrigate the sheep pastures of Liebsdorf. In order to make better use of the water power, the building was dug into the earch, rather like a cellar. This enabled a drop of 2.70 metres for the two <b>overshot</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} millrace was 4 ft by 4 ft in {{dimension and}} poured onto an <b>overshot</b> <b>wheel.</b> It was expanded to a 8 ft by 8 ft flume that ran 300 ft and powered a turbine.|$|E
50|$|Drewetts Mill was {{in working}} order as {{recently}} as 1990. The mill originally operated an <b>overshot</b> <b>wheel</b> driving three grindstones. In recent times, power to operate two stones and a saw has been through a vertical turbine.|$|E
50|$|The mill {{produced}} thin {{steel plate}} suitable for sawplate {{and for other}} items fashioned from strip steel, and wire used mainly in the cutlery industry. Wiremill Dam was once {{the site of the}} largest diameter water-wheel in Sheffield. Two <b>overshot</b> <b>wheels</b> were recorded in 1829, each 34.5 ft in diameter and 4.25 ft wide. They rotated at 6 rpm and were fed by a head of water of about 10 ft.|$|R

5000|$|Antipater is {{also known}} for being the first to mention use of the {{waterwheel}} in a poem. He tells of an advanced <b>overshot</b> <b>wheel</b> watermill around 20 BC/10 AD. He praised for its use in grinding grain and the reduction of human labour: ...|$|E
50|$|This wheel was an <b>overshot</b> <b>wheel,</b> 9 ft {{diameter}} and 9 ft wide, constructed of cast iron, carried on an 8 in diameter cast iron axle which was unusually long, {{as it had}} to pass over the tail race of the other waterwheel.|$|E
50|$|Hearn and Rawlins Mill, {{also known}} as the Cannon and Ross Mill and Hearn Mill, is a {{historic}} grist mill complex located near Seaford, Sussex County, Delaware. It was built about 1880, on the site of a previous mill built in 1820. It is a water powered mill with two <b>overshot</b> <b>wheels</b> installed in 1912. The mill and two associated warehouses are frame buildings, sheathed in metal, on brick footings. They are located on an earthen dam, rebuilt in 1912.|$|R
5000|$|The name of {{the walk}} {{is derived from the}} {{artificial}} water channel or Kunstgraben that was laid here between 1844 and 1847 to supply water for the mining industry, Graben being German for [...] "ditch". The channel was used to make water available for <b>overshot</b> <b>wheels</b> (Kunsträder) and reversible wheels (Kehrräder) at the 4th Shaft (IV. Lichtloch) and the two Schwamkrug turbines at the 5th Shaft (V. Lichtloch), which were used to transport the rock extracted from the Rothschönberger Stolln mine and for water management.|$|R
5000|$|Roman aqueducts {{were built}} to remarkably fine tolerances, {{and to a}} {{technological}} standard that {{was not to be}} equalled until modern times. Powered entirely by gravity, they transported very large amounts of water very efficiently. Sometimes, where depressions deeper than 50 metres had to be crossed, inverted siphons were used to force water uphill. An aqueduct also supplied water for the <b>overshot</b> <b>wheels</b> at Barbegal in Roman Gaul, a complex of water mills hailed as [...] "the greatest known concentration of mechanical power in the ancient world".|$|R
