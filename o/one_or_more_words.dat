2500|$|In {{syntactic}} analysis, {{a constituent}} {{is a word}} {{or a group of}} words that function(s) as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. [...] The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with phrase structure grammars, although dependency grammars also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using constituency tests. These tests manipulate some portion of a sentence and based on the result, clues are delivered about the immediate constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are phrases. A phrase is a sequence of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>words</b> (in some theories two or more) built around a head lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits {{one or more of the}} behaviors discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{uses the}} S.A.G.A. game engine created by game {{developer}} The Dreamers Guild. Players participate in each adventure through a screen that {{is divided into}} five sections. The action window is the largest part of the screen and is where the player directs the main characters through their adventures. It shows the full-figure of the main character being played {{as well as that}} character's immediate environment. To locate objects of interest, the player moves the crosshairs through the action window. The name of any object that the player can interact with appears in the sentence line. The sentence line is directly beneath the action window. The player uses this line to construct sentences telling the characters what to do. To direct a character to act, the player constructs a sentence by selecting one of the eight commands from the command buttons and then clicking on one or two objects from either the action window or the inventory. Examples of sentences the player might construct would be [...] "Walk to the dark hallway," [...] "Talk to Harry," [...] or [...] "Use the skeleton key on the door." [...] Commands and objects may consist of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>words</b> (for example, [...] "the dark hallway"), and the sentence line will automatically add connecting words like [...] "on" [...] and [...] "to." ...|$|E

50|$|Word {{line core}} memory was {{often used to}} provide {{register}} memory. Other names for this type are linear select and 2-D. This form of core memory typically wove three wires through each core on the plane, word read, word write, and bit sense/write. To read or clear words, the full current is applied to <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>word</b> read lines; this clears the selected cores and any that flip induce voltage pulses in their bit sense/write lines. For read, normally only one word read line would be selected; but for clear, multiple word read lines could be selected while the bit sense/write lines ignored. To write words, the half current is applied to <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>word</b> write lines, and half current is applied to each bit sense/write line for a bit to be set. In some designs, the word read and word write lines were combined into a single wire, resulting in a memory array with just two wires per bit. For write, multiple word write lines could be selected. This offered a performance advantage over X/Y line coincident-current in that multiple words could be cleared or written with the same value in a single cycle. A typical machine's register set usually used only one small plane of this form of core memory. Some very large memories were built with this technology, for example the Extended Core Storage (ECS) auxiliary memory in the CDC 6600, which was up to 2 million 60-bit words.|$|R

40|$|In the EuroWordNet-project we will {{construct}} wordnets {{from existing}} resources for Spanish, Dutch and Italian, {{similar to the}} Princeton WordNet 1. 5.

In this way we hope to combine information from independently created resources, making the ultimate database more consistent and reliable, while keeping the richness and diversity of the vocabularies of the different languages. Two problems are discussed here: how to achieve overlap in the concepts that are represented in each wordnet and to interpret difference in the lexical semantic relations or configurations across the wordnets. 1. Introduction WordNet is a database developed at Princeton University (Miller et al. 1990) with semantic relations between English words organized around the notion of synsets.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a strategy {{followed by the}} dialogue manager of a database inquiry system to assess the reliability of input utterances. For this purpose, binary classification trees are used, {{in such a way}} that the assessment capability can be automatically learnt from samples. As a starting point, training of such trees for classification of ATIS- 3 sentences in terms of A, D, and X classes was done; experimental results show that this assessment technique can be effectively exploited and integrated into the dialogue manager under development. 1. INTRODUCTION In this paper, the problem of data retrieval through a speech-based interface is considered. Usually, this task is performed by a pipeline: the speech recognizer outputs <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>word</b> sequence hypotheses, <b>or</b> a word lattice, which are then processed by an understanding module. The goal of the latter module is to obtain all the information necessary to formulate a query to the database. Often, in real applications, a sin [...] ...|$|R

50|$|In linguistics, periphrasis (IPA British English /pᵻˈrɪfrəsɪs/, U.S. English /pəˈrɪfrəsɪs/) is {{a device}} by which {{grammatical}} meaning is expressed by <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> free morphemes (typically <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> function <b>words</b> accompanying a content word), instead of by inflectional affixes or derivation.

The verb catenae of English are highly periphrastic.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{researchers}} conducted several studies {{to evaluate the}} machine translation quality based {{on the relationship between}} word alignments and phrase table. However, existing methods usually employ ad-hoc heuristics without theoretical support. So far, there is no discussion from the aspect of providing a formula to describe the relationship among word alignments, phrase table, and machine translation performance. In this paper, on one hand, we focus on formulating such a relationship for estimating the size of extracted phrase pairs given <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>word</b> alignment points. On the other hand, a corpus-motivated pruning technique is proposed to prune the default large phrase table. Experiment proves that the deduced formula is feasible, which not only can be used to predict the size of the phrase table, but also can be a valuable reference for investigating the relationship between the translation performance and phrase tables based on different links of word alignment. The corpus-motivated pruning results show that nearly 98 % of phrases can be reduced without any significant loss in translation quality...|$|R
