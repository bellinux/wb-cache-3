Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E

40|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} a major lifestyle-related risk factor for {{periodontal}} diseases. However, the pathophysiological role <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking in periodontal disease {{has yet to be}} fully elucidated. Here we report that the systemic administration <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoke condensate or nicotine, which is the major ingredient <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoke, augmented alveolar bone loss. Concomitantly, the number of osteoclasts in periodontal tissues increased and the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand was upregulated at the ligated side in mice with periodontitis. Nicotine also attenuated alveolar bone repair after ligature removal. These observations highlight the destruction of periodontal tissue by smoking and the unfavorable clinical course of periodontal disease in patients with a cigarette smoking habit. The present study demonstrates that periodontal disease models are useful for elucidating the pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking-related periodontal diseases...|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} North Korean tobacco companies, making some 30 {{different}} types <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> {{with the biggest}} tobacco company being the North Korea General Tobacco Corporation. Some companies export tobacco to the Middle East and elsewhere, sometimes in partnership with foreign firms. For example, the Taedong River Tobacco Company and the Rason Shinhung Tobacco Company, both operating in the Rason Special Economic Zone, are partnered with the Chinese Jilin Tobacco. British American Tobacco also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons. During the Cold War, North Korea paid for goods it imported from the Soviet Union with poor quality tobacco. Later, {{during the years of}} the Sunshine Policy, high-end Pyongyang brand cigarettes were exported to South Korea where they were popular among South Koreans who wanted to express a pro-reunification stance. There are some privately owned tobacco factories, some of which are known to produce counterfeit brand cigarettes for export as part of North Korea's illicit activities to earn hard currency.|$|E

5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Estimates <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{consumption}} per {{adult male}} and female available from surveys in eight countries are examined and the figures of national consumption per adult implied by the surveys are compared with national averages obtained from government data and other sources. The errors {{likely to be found}} in the surveys are considered and corrected figures are calculated. Estimates are also made <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> consumption per woman of childbearing age. For a number of purposes it is useful to have estimates <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> consumption per adult male and adult female. The trends in cigarette consump-tion per adult of the two sexes can be quite different, as figures for the United Kingdom (Todd, 1975) and Canada (Todd, 1978) have shown. It has also been suggested that estimates <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> consumption by women of childbearing age could be useful in view of the effects on the fetus attributed to smoking during pregnancy and of the possible contributions <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking to diseases which may arise as side-effects of contraceptive pills. In order to calculate cigarette consumption per adult {{male and female}}, it is necessary to have, for each sex, estimates of the percentages who are current <b>cigarette</b> smokers and <b>of</b> the average number smoked daily. Similar figures are required by age groups of women if the level <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking by those of childbearing age is to be estimated. All these figures can be obtained only by questioning members of the public about their smoking habits. Estimates of the percentages <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smokers <b>of</b> each sex are available for a number of countries (for example, World Health Organisation, 1976) but there are few countries for which estimates <b>of</b> consumption per <b>cigarette</b> smoker by sex are available, and still fewer countries for which both sets of figures are available for a number of recent years.
