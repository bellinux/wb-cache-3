5000|$|Dance {{positions}} include: an {{open position}} with the lead's right hand on the follower's left shoulder, a closed position with no space between the partners, and a closed <b>overhand</b> <b>position</b> in which the lead wraps their left forearm over the follower's right forearm and clasps their hand with the palm {{against the back of}} the follower's hand. A [...] "side by side", [...] "shoulder hold", [...] "cape", or varsouviana position is also used.|$|E
50|$|The main {{offensive}} weapon used was a 2.4 - 4.5 m long and 2.5 cm in diameter spear called a doru, or dory. It was held {{with the right}} hand, with the left hand holding the hoplite's shield. Soldiers usually held their spears in an underhand position when approaching but once they came into close contact with their opponents, they were held in an <b>overhand</b> <b>position</b> ready to strike. The spearhead was usually a curved leaf shape, while {{the rear of the}} spear had a spike called a sauroter ("lizard-killer") which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence the name). It was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped, or for the rear ranks to finish off fallen opponents as the phalanx advanced over them. In addition to being used as a secondary weapon, the sauroter also doubled to balance the spear, but not for throwing purposes. It is a matter of contention, among historians, whether the hoplite used the spear overarm or underarm. Held underarm, the thrusts would have been less powerful but under more control, and vice versa. It seems likely that both motions were used, depending on the situation. If attack was called for, an overarm motion was more likely to break through an opponent's defence. The upward thrust is more easily deflected by armour due to its lesser leverage. However, when defending, an underarm carry absorbed more shock and could be 'couched' under the shoulder for maximum stability. It should also be said that an overarm motion would allow more effective combination of the aspis and doru if the shield wall had broken down, while the underarm motion would be more effective when the shield had to be interlocked with those of one's neighbours in the battle-line. Hoplites in the rows behind the lead would almost certainly have made overarm thrusts. The rear ranks held their spears underarm, and raised their shields upwards at increasing angles. This was an effective defence against missiles, deflecting their force.|$|E
50|$|The muscle-up {{begins with}} the arms {{extended}} above the head, gripping a hold in the <b>overhand</b> pull-up <b>position.</b> The hold is usually on a chin-up bar or gymnastic rings.|$|R
