Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called <b>ocean</b> <b>dumping.</b> Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood, are also present.|$|E

The London Convention also applies to sea-faring vessels such as ships, planes, and offshore drilling platforms. If these types of vessels want to dump carbon dioxide into the ocean, they must get permission from their respective national authority.|$|E

Spectrometric measurements indicate that upon combining with sea water the acid waste develops a strong reflectance peak in the band 0. 55 to 0. 60 micron region, resulting in a stronger contrast in the MSS band 4 than the other bands. Predominant direction of movement of the waste plumes was to the southeast. Average drift velocity for surface drogues and the waste plumes was about 0. 5 knots.

40|$|A {{remote sensing}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the industrial acid waste <b>ocean</b> <b>dump</b> site located approximately 38 n mi SE of Cape Henlopen, Delaware, {{to see if there}} was a relationship between aircraft remotely sensed spectral signatures and the iron concentration measured in the plume. Results are presented which show that aircraft remotely sensed spectral data can be used to quantify and map an acid waste dump in terms of its particulate iron concentration. A single variable equation using the ratio of band 2 (440 - 490 nm) radiance to band 4 (540 - 580 nm) radiance was used to quantify the acid plume and the surrounding water. The acid waste varied in age from freshly dumped to 3 1 / 2 hours old. Particulate iron concentrations in the acid waste were estimated to range up to 1. 1 mg/liter at the 0. 46 meter depth. A classification technique was developed to remove sunglitter-affected pixels from the data set...|$|R

5000|$|For much of history, {{the ocean}} was used {{generally}} as a dumping ground for {{many types of}} waste such as garbage, acid rain and toxins, including chemical weapons. In 1968, the US National Academy of Sciences estimated the annual release to the marine environment, from both dumping and disposal (through a pipe), of 100 million tons of petroleum products, two to four million tons of acid chemical wastes from pulp mills, {{more than one million}} tons of heavy metals in industrial wastes, and more than 100,000 tons of organic chemical wastes. US EPA records indicate that between 1946 and 1970, more than 89,000 containers of radioactive wastes were dumped at Atlantic and Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>dump</b> sites. One area off the coast of New Jersey was used until 1987 as a disposal area for millions of tons per year [...] of sewage sludge. This area is now known as the [...] "12-Mile Dumping Ground," [...] and has a large amount of toxic metals. Divers are still advised to avoid the area due to the high level of refuse materials and toxins. Because ocean contaminants know no boundaries, there have been international and regional parameters established since the 1970s. These regulations consist of regional treaties and conventions related to local marine pollution problems and international conventions that provide a standardized control of worldwide marine pollution. In the early 1970s the United States endorsed the MSRPA to regulate any waste disposal in marine waters that are within U.S. jurisdiction.|$|R

After coming to a stop, the aircraft slowly tilted aft, coming to rest on its tail in a nose-high attitude. The forward evacuation slides were therefore in a nearly vertical position. Evacuation using these slides caused all of the additional injuries, some severe. There were no fatalities among the 218 passengers and crew members aboard.
