30|$|Previous reports (Gu 2000; Ding et al. 2001) have {{proposed}} that the Tahe Oilfield has experienced multistage <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> events, from the Carboniferous–Permian to Mesozoic–Neogene periods, based on the saturation/bubble point pressure of crude oil pools, homogenization temperatures (T h) of fluid inclusions and reservoir bitumen reflectance. Chen et al. (2003) proposed that five <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> events, ranging from the Middle Carboniferous to Neogene, may {{have occurred in the}} Tahe Oilfield {{on the basis of the}} fluorescent colors of fluid inclusions. Based on the T h of fluid inclusions and reconstructed burial and geothermal histories, Wang et al. (2008) proposed that the Tahe Ordovician oil reservoir has been charged twice. The early <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> phase arose from the Middle to Late Silurian (429 – 415  Ma) and the later one from the Miocene to Pliocene (8 – 2  Ma). Shi et al. (2012) reported that the Ordovician reservoirs in the Tuoputai region have been charged twice, and the early oil charge occurred from 420 to 405  Ma and the second from 8 to 2  Ma based on the integrated analyses of microthermometry, petrography, laser Raman spectrum and confocal laser scanning microscopy of fluid inclusions. Ni et al. (2016) and Xiao et al. (2016) reported that there were two phases of <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> in the Halahatang Depression, west of the Tuoputai region, the first phase was from the Middle to Late Silurian (422 – 410  Ma), and the second occurred during the middle Miocene (20 – 6  Ma).|$|E
30|$|In {{exploration}} for tight oil, {{the content}} and saturation of hydrocarbon in the tight reservoir is a key factor for evaluating the reserve. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study the geological history of hydrocarbon accumulation and the tight <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> process. However, kinetic models used for petroleum development are not applicable for petroleum exploration. In this study, a static resistance model is proposed after analyzing resistances in ultra-slow flow in porous media. Using this model, the discontinuous pattern of <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> is reproduced through incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the phase field method and the finite element method. This study also explains macroscopic percolation behavior with microscopic flow mechanisms and discusses some issues in ultra-slow flow in a micro/nano pore-throat network. The resistance analysis reveals that capillary resistance and dissipation resistance are dominant factors in the mechanism of oil accumulation in tight reservoirs. Numerical simulations show that pressure thresholds exist and result in discontinuous <b>oil</b> <b>charging.</b> Generally, it is proven that the static model is more applicable than kinetic models in describing oil accumulation in tight reservoirs.|$|E

The results may have practical use for oil exploration and development in this region and can also provide an example {{for the study of}} reservoir geochemistry in other blocks.|$|E
40|$|The Middle Jurassic Toutunhe Formation at {{depths of}} {{approximately}} 4000 – 6000 [*]m has increasingly come into focus as a current deep reservoir {{target in the}} central Junggar Basin (NW China). Based on petrography, SEM, stable isotopes, and fluid inclusion analyses, the goals {{of this study were}} to investigate the effect of depositional lithofacies on sandstone diagenetic heterogeneity and {{to examine the relationship between}} diagenetic evolution and <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> within a heterogeneous reservoir. Grain size controls the overall abundance of cement and porosity and reservoir properties through its effect on ductile lithic sand grains and hence on mechanical compaction. Early diagenetic calcite cement is an exception to this trend. Ductile lithic-rich, very fine-grained sandstones featured compaction of easily deformed, clay-rich grains, resulting in a very rapid loss of porosity during burial. In contrast, dissolution and cementation occurred as well as ductile compaction in the fine-grained sandstones. Two episodes of <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> occurred in the relatively coarser-grained sandstone lithofacies. Diagenesis progressed alternately with oil emplacement, and some diagenetic alterations and <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> occurred simultaneously. Ductile lithic-rich, highly compacted sandstones and tightly calcite-cemented sandstones can create permeability barriers embedded in permeable reservoir sandstones, probably resulting in heterogeneous flow...|$|R

30|$|The <b>oils</b> <b>charged</b> in {{the latter}} episode {{occurring}} in the Miocene to Pliocene were dominated by light oils with relatively higher maturity (Li et al. 2018). The reservoirs usually have thick seal rocks and good preservation conditions.

30|$|Geochemical {{analysis}} of 64 oils sampled from an Ordovician carbonate reservoir in the Tuoputai region was undertaken {{to study the}} composition of molecular markers. All the oils have similar geochemical characteristics and belong to a single oil family. They are presumed to derive from the same source kitchen and have similar <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> history. A histogram of homogenization temperatures (T h) of aqueous inclusions in reservoir rocks shows a bimodal distribution pattern, indicating that the Ordovician reservoir has been charged twice. Coupling the measured T h (°C) with the burial and geothermal histories reconstructed using 1 D basin modeling, we relate the homogenization temperature to the relevant geological ages: i.e., 425 – 412 and 9 – 4  Ma, corresponding to the Middle to Late Silurian and the Miocene to Pliocene, respectively. The oil filling orientation and pathways are traced using molecular indicators related to alkyldibenzothiophenes and benzo[b]naphthothiophenes. The <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> orientation is from south to north generally. It can be predicted that the Ordovician reservoirs were sourced from a kitchen located {{to the south of}} the Tuoputai region, most probably between the Awati and Manjiaer Depressions. Traps located in the southern side of the Tuoputai region, along the <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> pathways, should therefore be preferred oil exploration targets.|$|E
30|$|Figure  7 {{shows that}} the Ordovician {{reservoir}} in Well TP 37 has been charged twice from 425 to 412 and 9 to 4  Ma, respectively. The history and timing of <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> in the Tuoputai Ordovician reservoir are generally {{consistent with those of}} the wells in the major part of the Tahe Oilfield (Wang et al. 2008).|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} oil family {{classification}} indicated {{that most of}} the oils in the Paleozoic reservoirs in the Halahatang region are genetically identical and should be grouped as one single oil family (Zhang et al. 2000; Zhang and Huang 2005; Chang et al. 2013 a; Xiao et al. 2016; Li et al. 2018). The oil migration orientation and filling pathway traced by various molecular geochemical indicators show that oils mainly migrated from south to north and the predicted source kitchen is located in the Manxi Low Uplift (Chang et al. 2013 b; Xiao et al. 2016; Li et al. 2018). Combining with the homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions and reconstructed burial and geothermal histories, previous studies show that the Ordovician carbonate reservoirs have experienced two major <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> events. These two phases of <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> and entrapment timing are the Middle to Late Silurian and the Miocene to Pliocene, respectively (Chang et al. 2013 b; Xiao et al. 2016; Li et al. 2018).|$|E
50|$|Continuous-type accumulations include {{fractured}} shale and fractured chalk oil and gas, basin-centered gas, coal bed gas, {{and tight}} reservoir gas. They typically cover large areas, have source rocks in close association with these unconventional reservoir rocks, and are mostly gas (and {{in some cases}} <b>oil)</b> <b>charged</b> throughout their extent. Continuous accumulations commonly have transition zones that grade into more conventional accumulations.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{indicate that}} hydrocarbon migration and entrapment in stacked fault-bounded reservoirs are mainly {{affected by the}} following factors: charge time, faults, pressure and geological structures. The charge time for commercial hydrocarbon accumulation is much longer in oil-water systems than in oil-gas-water systems. Faults are classified into charging faults and 'back doors' faults other than charging faults in stacked fault-bounded reservoirs. The lower the displacement pressure of a fault, the higher its updip oil transportation ability. The downdip oil transportation ability of a fault is usually low and cannot cause commercial downdip oil accumulation. Back doors affect both hydrocarbon percent charge and hydrocarbon migration pathways. Updip back doors improve updip <b>oil</b> <b>charge.</b> The lower the displacement pressure of an updip back door, the more efficient the updip <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> before 3, 000 years. Back doors whose displacement pressure is equal to or higher than 28. 76 psi are effective in sealing faults in oil-water systems. On the contrary, only sealing faults result in commercial gas accumulations in stacked fault-compartmentalized reservoirs. Otherwise gas is found over oil. Downdip back doors generally have few effects on downdip hydrocarbon charge. Geopressure enhances the updip oil transportation of a fault and improves {{the positive effects of}} updip back doors during updip <b>oil</b> <b>charge.</b> Geopressure and updip back doors result in more efficient updip <b>oil</b> <b>charge.</b> A physical barrier is not necessarily a barrier to oil migration with the aid of geopressure and updip back doors. The chance for hydrocarbon charge into reservoirs along growth faults is not equal. Any one of the above controlling factors can change the patterns of hydrocarbon charge and distribution in such complex geological structures. Generally, lower reservoirs and updip reservoirs are favored. Reservoirs along low-permeability charging faults may be bypassed. Gas can only charge the updip reservoirs. Both updip and downdip back doors can facilitate oil penetrating a barrier fault to charge reservoirs offset by the barrier fault. Interreservoir migration among stacked fault-compartmentalized reservoirs is an important mechanism for hydrocarbon accumulation and trap identification. The interreservoir migration is a very slow process, even though the displacement pressures of bounding faults may be very low...|$|R

40|$|When quartz-rich sands {{are buried}} and heated, pore space is {{gradually}} filled by precipitation of quartz cement from aqueous formation fluids. Here we examine whether {{the presence of}} oil in the pore space can retard or halt this loss of porosity by slowing or stopping quartz cementation. The effect of oil fill on quartz cementation is examined by using the distribution of quartz cement in the Brae Formation deep-water sandstone reservoir of the Miller oil field (North Sea). Petrographic data demonstrate that sandstones from the oil zone have much less quartz cement, and more porosity, than sandstones from the water zone. Sandstones in both oil and water zones are compositionally and texturally identical and have been affected by a similar burial history. Kinetic modeling of the cementation process suggests that progressive <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> has slowed quartz-cement growth rates by at least two orders of magnitude, halting it completely in the most extreme cases. Our data demonstrate that early <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> in the crestal part of an anticline can preserve porosity in deeply buried sandstones. This knowledge is especially relevant to porosity prediction for petroleum exploration in deeply buried sandstones...|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{more and}} more {{work has been done}} on the oil filling history and <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> {{pathways}} of the Ordovician carbonate reservoirs in the Tabei Uplift. Using tricyclic terpanes/ 17 α(H)-hopanes ratios of 18 oil samples from the Tahe Oilfield, Huang (2003) traced oil migration orientations. The results showed that the general orientation of <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> is from east to west and from south to north, suggesting that the source kitchen may be located in the Manjiaer Depression (Huang 2003). By combining multiple molecular indicators, such as the total content of pyrrolic nitrogen compounds and 4 -/ 1 -MDBT, Wang et al. (2004 a, 2008) determined that oils charge from south to north generally in the Tahe Oilfield. Much work has also been done, using various geochemical parameters, on the oil filling history and migration orientation of Ordovician reservoirs in other oilfields in the Tabei Uplift, including the Lunnan Oilfield (Wang et al. 2004 b; Zhang and Huang 2005; Gong et al. 2007; Lu et al. 2008; Zhu et al. 2013), the Yakela Oilfield (Li et al. 2013 a, b) and the Halahatang Oilfield (e.g., Chang et al. 2013 b; Fang et al. 2016; Xiao et al. 2016).

40|$|Catalytic {{hydropyrolysis}} (hypy), {{which refers}} to pyrolysis assisted by high hydrogen gas pressures (15 MPa) {{in the presence of}} a dispersed sulphided Mo catalyst, has been developed as a method for liberating covalently bound biomarkers from macromolecules in coals, source rocks and crude oils. It possesses the unique ability to produce very high yields of aliphatic biomarkers compared to mild catalytic hydrogenation or traditional pyrolysis methods, whilst minimising alteration to their isomeric distributions (Love et al., 1995). The Clair Field, located 75 km to the west of Shetland is one of the largest oil accumulations on the UKCS. The co-occurrence of 25 -norphopanes and undegraded n-alkanes within oils from this field, together with their relatively low API gravity indicates that the field is a mixture of at least two <b>oil</b> <b>charges</b> separated by a major biodegradation event.

40|$|A {{petrographic}} {{and fluid}} inclusion microthermometric study {{was performed on}} sandstones from the Devonian-Carboniferous reservoir rocks of the Clair Field, west of Shetland. Fluid inclusion petrographic and microthermometric observations were collected from quartz, K-feldspar and calcite cements and veins. Vein and cement minerals host both aqueous and hydrocarbon two-phase (liquid and vapor-filled) fluid inclusions indicating that cementation occurred during <b>oil</b> <b>charging.</b> The location of hydrocarbon fluid inclusions in the paragenetic sequence of the reservoir rocks indicates that hydrocarbon migration during early-stage diagenesis occurred via intergranular pores as well as fractures, whereas towards the later stages of diagenesis, as porosities were occluded, hydrocarbon migration was predominantly fracture controlled. The microthermometric characteristics of primary and secondary aqueous fluid inclusions in association with hydrocarbon fluid inclusions indicates that cementation and veining during <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> occurred at temperatures up to 180 °C. Salinity values are variable (0 – 10. 9 wt% NaCl eq.) indicating that fluid mixing occurred during veining and cementation.

30|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of in situ reservoir oils are primarily controlled by the nature/type, depositional environment/organic facies and the thermal maturation levels of organic matter in source rocks (Hunt 1979; Tissot and Welte 1984; Peters et al. 2005). In addition, the oil migration process, charging history and secondary alteration in reservoir and post-accumulation are also important factors modifying the nature and compositions of oils in the reservoirs (Connan 1984; Volkman et al. 1984; England et al. 1987; Peters and Moldowan 1993; Cubitt and England 1995).

30|$|The {{reservoirs}} of {{this type}} have their porosity reduced mainly prior to hydrocarbon charging. Yang and Pang (2012) argued that the Xu- 2 and Xu- 4 reservoirs of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the western Sichuan Depression had become tight primarily during the Middle–Late Jurassic (with a porosity of 12 %), while the major oil/gas-charging process occurred at two stages: (1) Early–Late Jurassic <b>oil</b> <b>charging,</b> slightly earlier than the reservoir becoming tight; and (2) Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous gas charging. Considering that natural gas in this region is dominantly generated from coals of the Triassic Xujiahe Formation, and {{only a very small}} quantity of oil was generated from such source rocks (Yang and Pang 2012), we believe that gas charging in this region took place primarily after the reservoir had become tight. A study by Luo et al. (2012) on the diagenetic history of the Xu- 2 reservoirs in the Dayi region of the western Sichuan Depression has obtained similar results. In this region, the porosity reduction of Xu- 2 reservoir occurred during the Middle–Late Jurassic, with a final porosity of approximately 7 %– 8 %, while the timing of oil generation and emplacement predated that period, and extensive gas generation and expulsion occurred after the tight transformation of the reservoir.|$|E
40|$|Diagenetic {{minerals}} in a water-filled borehole {{from the}} Jurassic Fulmar Formation, United Kingdom central North Sea, record two phases of hydrocarbon filling and emptying. Initial <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> {{was during the}} Late Cretaceous, at shallow burial depths of about 1. 5 km (0. 9 mi). As we consider that hydrocarbon has preserved porosity during burial, this has implications for {{the understanding of the}} porosity evolution of the Fulmar Formation, which, in other locations, is an important hydrocarbon reservoir. The early <b>oil</b> <b>charge,</b> as recorded by illite K-Ar ages, progressively filled the structure from 84 to 59 Ma, and possibly precipitated bitumen because of biodegradation. The first oil predated many of the burial diagenetic reactions within the sandstone. After leak-off at ca. 60 Ma, diagenetic reactions continued in an open geochemical system, with possible import of CO 2. Products of these reactions include ankerite and quartz overgrowth cements. Hydrocarbon staining postdates these phases and provides evidence of a hydrocarbon charge, probably gas condensate. The second hydrocarbon charge also leaked off, and the sandstone is now water bearing. Previous work on the Fulmar Formation has incorrectly placed all the diagenetic reactions as predating the first arrival of hydrocarbon. The present-day pore fluids are high-salinity, high-{delta} 18 O fluids derived from the underlying Permian Zechstein evaporates.

30|$|The Lukeqin {{structural}} belt is {{the main}} heavy oil accumulation zone in the Turpan-Hami Basin. The recent discovery of light oil in the Triassic indicates {{that there may be}} multiple source kitchens contributing to the oil accumulation. According to oil geochemical analysis and oil-source correlation, the oil in deep and shallow reservoirs of the Lukeqin Oilfield presents different physical and saturated hydrocarbon mass spectrum characteristics. The Triassic heavy oil is from the northern Upper Permian lacustrine source rocks, and the light oil represented by the Yudong- 9 Well is from the northwestern Lower Jurassic coal-measure source rocks. The timing of <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> was determined by K/Ar isotope dating, reservoir fluid inclusion analysis and the evolution history of different source rocks. In summary, the accumulation process consists of two stages. From the end of Triassic to early Jurassic, the northern Permian source kitchen generated a considerable amount of oil, which was finally degraded to heavy oil, migrated to the south and then accumulated. The northwestern Jurassic coal-measure source kitchen began to generate oil at the end of Cretaceous, while the northern source kitchen could only generate a little hydrocarbon. The heavy oil and the light oil have different source rock locations, migration directions and accumulation times. The migration of hydrocarbon source kitchens affects the distribution of heavy oil and light oil reservoirs at the present time.|$|E

The three Carboniferous oil layers {{are characterized by}} “oil in {{the upper and lower}} layers and gas in the middle” in profile and “oil in the west and gas in the east” in plane view. In order to discuss the complex reservoir accumulation mechanisms, based on the petroleum geology and reservoir distribution, we studied the generation history of source rocks, the fault evolution and sealing, the accumulation periods and gas washing, and reconstructed the accumulation process of the TZ 1 –TZ 4 well block. It is concluded that the hydrocarbon enrichment differences of oil layers CIII, CII and CI were caused by multiple sources and multi-period hydrocarbon charging and adjustment. The CII was closely related to CIII, but CI was formed by reservoir adjustment during the Yanshan period and was not affected by gas washing after it was formed. During the Himalayan period, different degrees of gas washing in the east and west led to hydrocarbon enrichment differences on the plane. The Carboniferous accumulation process of two-stage charging and one-stage adjustment is summarized: <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> during the late Hercynian period is the first accumulation period of CIII and CII; oil reservoirs were adjusted into CI in the Yanshan period; finally gas washing in the Himalayan period is the second accumulation period of CIII and CII, but CI was not affected by gas washing.

The accumulation process is interpreted as follows: when the Kazhdumi of Ab-e Teymur became mature at 5 - 1  Ma (Bordenave and Hegre 2005), the <b>oil</b> <b>charged</b> the Zagros trend traps near the generation center such as the Ab-e Teymur and Mansuri fields. After that, the <b>oil</b> <b>charged</b> the Arabian trend traps in the westwards basin margin like Azadegan by lateral migration. However, another two doubts need to be considered. Firstly, according {{to the findings of}} Bordenave and Burwood (1990, 1995) and Bordenave and Hegre (2005), most oil from Kazhdumi will first charge the nearby Zagros trend traps in Dezful Embayment. Assuming that the long-range lateral migration charging the Arabian trend traps will occur later, and according to the principal that the higher the source rock maturity is, the lower the crude oil gravity is, so the higher API° of crude oil should be present in Arabian trend oil fields. Nevertheless, the data show that the crude oil gravity in both the Azadegan and the other Arabian trend traps are lower than that in the Zagros trend traps (Fig.  10), contrary to that assumption. Moreover, the filling of the Sarvak reservoir in the Jufeyr field of the eastern of Azadegan is only partial. Thus, it is hard to explain how the oil crosses the Jufeyr during the migration and directly infills the Azadegan (Fig.  11).|$|R
