40|$|To improve {{understanding}} of possible connections between airborne tungsten and public health, size and geography <b>of</b> airborne <b>tungsten</b> particles collected in Fallon, Nevada, and Sweet Home, Oregon, were compared. Both towns have industrial tungsten facilities, but only Fallon {{has experienced a}} cluster of childhood leukemia. Fallon and Sweet Home are similar to one another by their particles <b>of</b> airborne <b>tungsten</b> being generally small in size. Meteorologically, much, if not most, of residential Fallon is downwind of its hard metal facility {{for at least some}} fraction of time at the annual scale, whereas little of residential Sweet Home is downwind <b>of</b> its <b>tungsten</b> facility. Geographically, most Fallon residents potentially spend time daily within an environment containing elevated levels <b>of</b> airborne <b>tungsten.</b> In contrast, few Sweet Home residents potentially spend time daily within an airborne environment with elevated levels <b>of</b> airborne <b>tungsten.</b> Although it cannot be concluded from environmental data alone that elevated airborne tungsten causes childhood leukemia, the lack of excessive cancer in Sweet Home cannot logically be used to dismiss the possibility <b>of</b> airborne <b>tungsten</b> as a factor in the cluster of childhood leukemia in Fallon.

All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3hours, {{and most of these}} have half-lives below 8minutes. Tungsten also has 4meta states, the most stable being 179mW (t1/2 6.4minutes).|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation <b>of</b> <b>tungsten</b> is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength <b>of</b> <b>tungsten</b> electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E

5|$|In {{military}} ordnance, tungsten or uranium {{is used in}} {{armour plating}} and armour piercing projectiles, {{as well as in}} nuclear weapons to increase efficiency (by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials). In the 1970s, tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, tungsten, and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions. Doubts have been raised about the safety (or green credentials) <b>of</b> <b>tungsten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} {{has the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>tungsten</b> originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with large amounts <b>of</b> <b>tungsten</b> and cobalt or other {{elements}} to maximize solution hardening. This also allows {{the use of}} precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E

5|$|While the {{question}} of whether Fermi's experiment had produced element 93 was stalemated, two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared, although unlike Fermi, they both claimed to have observed it in nature. The first of these claims was by Czech engineer Odolen Koblic in 1934 when he extracted a small amount of material from the wash water of heated pitchblende. He proposed the name bohemium for the element, but after being analyzed {{it turned out that the}} sample was a mixture <b>of</b> <b>tungsten</b> and vanadium. The other claim, in 1938 by Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French chemist Yvette Cauchois, claimed to have discovered the new element via spectroscopy in minerals. They named their element sequanium, but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all, element 93 would not exist naturally. However, as neptunium does in fact occur in nature in trace amounts, as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in 1952, it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact observe neptunium.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities <b>of</b> <b>tungsten</b> and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E
5|$|Prospectors George Grimes and Moses Splawn {{were the}} first to {{discover}} gold in the forest at the eponymous Grimes Creek on August 2, 1862. Subsequent gold discoveries at Rocky Bar in 1863 and Atlanta in 1864 increased the rush of people to Idaho, and in 1863 Idaho City, with a population of 6,267, surpassed Portland, Oregon as the largest city in the Pacific Northwest. The Idaho gold rush was largely over by 1870, and the population of the Boise Basin fell from 16,000 to 3,500. In 1898 the forest's first gold dredge was built in Placerville and followed by several others. By 1951, when the last dredges shut down, at least 2.3 million ounces (65.2 million grams) of gold had been produced from the Boise Basin area. Silver was mined along the Crooked River from 1882 until 1921, but a silver mine at Silver Mountain proved unsuccessful. Following a shortage of mercury during World War II, mines in the Stibnite area became the country's largest producer <b>of</b> <b>tungsten</b> and second largest source of mercury. The most important known placer deposit of niobium and tantalum in the United States is located in Bear Valley. From 1953 until 1959, dredges there produced $12.5 million ($ today) in niobium, tantalum, and uranium. Other minerals mined in the forest include antimony and molybdenum.|$|E

40|$|WC/Ni-based plasma {{transfer}} arc welded (PTAW) overlays {{are frequently}} {{used in the}} oil sands industry for applications requiring extremely high wear resistance. These overlays usually consist of a dense distribution <b>of</b> either <b>tungsten</b> monocarbide (WC) or cast tungsten carbides (WC/W 2 C) in a NiBSi or NiCrBSi matrix. A previous erosion-corrosion (E-C) study <b>of</b> cast <b>tungsten</b> carbide/NiBSi-based PTAW overlays not only highlighted the expected preferential E-C attack of the non Cr-bearing matrix but also the significantly greater effect that carbide dissolution <b>of</b> the cast <b>tungsten</b> carbides had on the overall E-C performance of the overlay. It is recognised that cast tungsten carbide particles {{are more susceptible to}} dissolution during deposition than WC. As a result, a new process that modifies the outer periphery <b>of</b> cast <b>tungsten</b> carbides by producing a tungsten monocarbide shell has been developed. Overlays consisting of these carbides in a NiBSi binder were subsequently produced with the aim of reducing the extent of dissolution during deposition. The aims of this study were (i) to assess the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>tungsten</b> monocarbide outer shell <b>of</b> cast <b>tungsten</b> carbides to resist dissolution during the PTAW deposition process; and (ii) to highlight any improvements in the E-C properties using a novel slurry pot erosion corrosion (SPEC) tester, which incorporates a three-electrode cell to enable the separate components of erosion, corrosion and synergy, to be established. Results were compared with a commercially available NiBSi PTAW overlay containing unmodified cast tungsten carbides. 9 2011. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
