5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
25|$|There exist both continuous-wave and pulsed OPOs. The {{latter are}} easier to build, since the high {{intensity}} lasts only for {{a tiny fraction of}} a second, which damages the nonlinear <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> and the mirrors less than a continuous high intensity.|$|E

25|$|A {{mixture of}} silicon dioxide and {{germanium}} dioxide ("silica-germania") {{is used as}} an <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> for optical fibers and optical waveguides. Controlling {{the ratio of the}} elements allows precise control of refractive index. Silica-germania glasses have lower viscosity and higher refractive index than pure silica. Germania replaced titania as the silica dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the need for subsequent heat treatment, which made the fibers brittle.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to achromatic doublets {{is the use}} of diffractive optical elements. Diffractive optical elements are able to generate arbitrary complex wave fronts from a sample of <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> which is essentially flat. Diffractive optical elements have negative dispersion characteristics, complementary to the positive Abbe numbers of optical glasses and plastics. Specifically, in the visible part of the spectrum diffractives have a negative Abbe number of −3.5. Diffractive optical elements can be fabricated using diamond turning techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{refractive}} index (1.7) and optical dispersion properties of germanium dioxide makes it useful as an <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> for wide-angle lenses, in optical microscope objective lenses, {{and for the}} core of fiber-optic lines. See Optical fiber for specifics on the manufacturing process. Both Germanium and its glass oxide, GeO2 are transparent to the infrared spectrum. The glass can be manufactured into IR windows and lenses, used for night-vision technology in the military, luxury vehicles, and Thermographic cameras. GeO2 is preferred over other IR transparent glasses because it is mechanically strong and therefore preferred for rugged military usage.|$|E

25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as reflection coefficient) of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no {{as if there were}} no birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous <b>optical</b> <b>material.</b> Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However it is in fact an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly around that {{of the ordinary}} ray, which remains fixed.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is used as}} an {{infrared}} <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> with a remarkably wide transmission wavelength range (0.45µm to 21.5µm). The refractive index is about 2.67 at 550nm (green), and about 2.40 at 10.6µm (LWIR). Similar to zinc sulfide, ZnSe is produced as microcrystalline sheets by synthesis from hydrogen selenide gas and zinc vapour. Another method of producing is a growth from melt under excessive pressure of inert gas (Ar usually). When free of absorption and inclusions it is ideally suited for CO2 laser optics at 10.6µm wavelength. It is thus a very important IR material. In daily life, {{it can be found}} as the entrance optic in the new range of [...] "in-ear" [...] clinical thermometers, seen as a small yellow window. Zinc selenide can slowly react with atmospheric moisture if poorly polished, but this is not generally a serious problem. Except where optics are used in spectroscopy or at the Brewster angle, antireflection or beamsplitting optical coatings are generally employed.|$|E

In {{order to}} improve the {{transmission}} and durability of infrared <b>optical</b> <b>materials,</b> the antireflection characteristics of two dimensional sub-wavelength structures on infrared <b>optical</b> <b>materials</b> were investigated. The results of numerical modeling showed two dimensional sub-wavelength structures can improve the transmission of infrared <b>optical</b> <b>materials</b> over a broad band, especially pyramid structures. Then two dimensional sub-wavelength structures on Zinc sulfide were fabricated with contacting ultraviolet lithography and reactive ion etching, A substantial antireflection effect was obtained over the wavelength band 8 ~ 12 µm.
