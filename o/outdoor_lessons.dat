40|$|In this thesis, {{we studied}} <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> in second {{form for the}} subject {{environmental}} education (EE). The purpose of the thesis was to carry out nine teaching units in the outdoors. The lessons took place once a week outside the classroom {{in the vicinity of}} the school regardless of the weather conditions and the content of the lesson. The objectives of our research are to present the experiences and recommendations of experienced teachers to work in the open air, to present opportunities and ideas for teaching environmental education outdoors in second form irrespective of the content of teaching, and to find out how weather affects lesson planning and implementation. The research was conducted with the action approach, where we used a descriptive and causal non-experimental method. The sample included 21 pupils attending second form in a primary school in the Notranjska region, 10 boys and 11 girls. In the theoretical part, we provided details of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons,</b> the positive effects on pupils and the organization and implementation problems faced by teachers. In the practical part, we described and analysed individual teaching units and survey questionnaires answered by pupils and teachers on <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons.</b> At the end of the ninth teaching unit, pupils did a written examination, which was used to determine whether the classes in the open air achieved our educational goals. We looked at the math tests after <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> and on days without <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> to determine whether <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> are reflected in the concentration of pupils in the lessons that follow. The results showed that weather affects lesson planning and execution, and that <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> have a positive effect on the concentration of pupils in the lessons that follow. <b>Outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> help to achieve the set teaching objectives. ...|$|E
40|$|Pupils in Slovenia {{nowadays}} {{spend a lot}} of time {{in classrooms}} and other enclosed areas. In this master’s thesis, we examined lessons in outdoor settings that enable direct contact with nature and exercises in fresh air. These lessons have many positive effects as they provide real-world experience to pupils, increase their motivation, enthusiasm and confidence and consequently diminish problems with distractions, enable social development etc. (Skribe-Dimec, 2014). The purpose of this master’s thesis was to perform five outdoor school lessons, namely one lesson per week outside the classroom in the immediate vicinity of school regardless of the weather conditions and learning content. Our sample included pupils of a fourth grade in a nine-year primary school. We studied how the weather affected the conduct of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> and if all learning objectives were achieved. Theoretically, <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> comprise all sense organs, pupils become more active and the results of teaching practices in outdoor settings are better than in classrooms (Štemberger, 2012). We prepared a written test for pupils in order to determine the differences in knowledge of contents learned in classrooms and outside. Before (in February) and after (in April) the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons,</b> we carried out a sociometric test and searched for potential differences in pupils’ connectedness during the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons.</b> The results of the research show that weather affects the conduct of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons.</b> Although the majority of pupils were disturbed by the rainy weather, some of them preferred the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> to those in classrooms. We discovered that <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> can take place in bad weather if we prepare well. If the weather prevents us from having the entire lesson outside the classroom, we can conduct at least a part of it there (the introductory, main or conclusive part). Moreover, we established that <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> can take place regardless of the learning content and learning objectives can be achieved. We observed a difference in knowledge of contents learned in classrooms and outside. Pupils obtained better results at the written test of subjects learned outside. Furthermore, we noticed a difference in the results of the sociogram performed before and after the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons.</b> Contrary to our expectations, pupils were more connected with each other before the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> (in February) than after (in April). ...|$|E
40|$|Outdoor {{education}} {{constitutes an}} alternative teaching {{approach that is}} characterized by authentic experiences and activities in outdoor natural and cultural landscapes. As a relatively new and progressive teaching method, it tries to find and consolidate its place within the existing educational system. The current thesis explores Greek academic teachers’ perceptions and experiences {{in the field of}} outdoor education. More specifically, eight academic teachers from a Greek university express their views about outdoor education and report their experiences in <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons.</b> Through a qualitative approach, this research includes analysis of data extracted from semi-structured interviews with the academics. From the thematic analysis of the data four themes emerged that illustrate teachers’ opinions. The results of the research revealed academic teachers’ basic knowledge on the field of outdoor education, as they presented some well-aimed examples of main characteristics of the approach. Moreover, they reported limited previous outdoor experiences with their students and perceive <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> as any action outside the typical classroom, attributing higher importance to outdoor activities performed in cultural rather than natural landscapes. Also, academics acknowledged several benefits that outdoor education provides to their students such as the stimulation of all their senses, the connection of theory with practice and the promotion of social relations. In addition, they attributed significant importance to both the experiential approach to learning and to the connection with nature that <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> provide. Nevertheless, academic teachers highlighted many barriers that inhibit their efforts to apply <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> such as lack of time and appropriate places, inadequate infrastructure, human resources as well as insufficient pedagogical training and preparation. Concluding, what seems to trouble academics most is the prevailing educational culture inside schools and universities as well as teachers’ and academic teachers’ attitudes. The above findings contribute to the current limited scientific knowledge concerning the practice of outdoor education in the higher level of education. Last but not least, further qualitative research is a prerequisite in order to study the origin of the perceptions and attitudes of Greek academics and comprehend the socio-cultural and educational context in which these have been formed...|$|E

40|$|Teachers {{wishing to}} offer lessons in nature may hold back {{for fear of}} leaving {{students}} keyed up and unable to concentrate in subsequent, indoor lessons. This study tested the hypothesis that lessons in nature have positive—not negative—aftereffects on subsequent classroom engagement. Using carefully matched pairs of lessons (one in a relatively natural outdoor setting and one indoors), we observed subsequent classroom engagement during an indoor instructional period, replicating these comparisons over 10 different topics and weeks in the school year, in each of two third grade classrooms. Pairs were roughly balanced in how often the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lesson</b> preceded or followed the classroom lesson. Classroom engagement was significantly better after lessons in nature than after their matched counterparts for {{four of the five}} measures developed for this study: teacher ratings; third-party tallies of “redirects” (the number of times the teacher stopped instruction to direct student attention back onto the task at hand); independent, photo-based ratings made blind to condition; and a composite index each showed a nature advantage; student ratings did not. This nature advantage held across different teachers and held equally over the initial and final 5 weeks of lessons. And the magnitude of the advantage was large. In 48 out of 100 paired comparisons, the nature lesson was a full standard deviation better than its classroom counterpart; in 20 of the 48, the nature lesson was over two standard deviations better. The rate of “redirects” was cut almost in half after a lesson in nature, allowing teachers to teach for longer periods uninterrupted. Because the pairs of lessons were matched on teacher, class (students and classroom), topic, teaching style, week of the semester, and time of day, the advantage of the nature-based lessons could not be attributed to any of these factors. It appears that, far from leaving students too keyed up to concentrate afterward, lessons in nature may actually leave students more able to engage in the next lesson, even as students are also learning the material at hand. Such “refueling in flight” argues for including more lessons in nature in formal education...|$|R

40|$|Inclusion {{recognises}} {{the diversity}} of people and aims to use these differences as advantages. Since the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2009 there have been changes to the educational system in Germany; {{children with special needs}} are now attending general schools. This change has developed complex debate in societies discourse and the media. It has highlighted the need for changes within the education sector that support inclusion and allow all students to participate on their level. Within the field of Outdoor Education, learning contains practical and theoretical approaches, all senses should be used and emphasis is placed on students learning from experiences. Those learning methods are particularly well adapting for children with special needs as special education works with direct learning approaches. The place of learning is a key element within Outdoor Education and learning can take place outside the classroom in urban or rural environments. In order to determine if Outdoor Education has the potential to increase inclusion of children with special needs, a study in a German primary school was conducted. The study focused on a single class whilst they participated in mathematics lessons. Interactions were observed between students and teachers during indoor and outdoor lessons; follow-up interviews with students and teachers were made. The findings presented participation of all children while learning outside the classroom. In particular children with special needs showed an increased sense of achievement and a higher level of motivation and concentration in the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> {{due to the fact that}} they were able to contribute to the exercises.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 187 - 196) This qualitative case study explores the influence of outdoor learning on high school student's engagement in core academic content courses. Students placed at risk of school failure benefit from instructional supports that help them stay engaged in learning. This study examined the learning experiences of 14 at-risk students within four grade 9 and 10 core classes, including English 1 - 2, Biology 1 - 2, Algebra Explorations 1 - 2, and Geometry 1 - 2. Each student participant was observed across three separate <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons.</b> Students took photographs of their experiences in the outdoors and participated in photo-mediated individual and/or focus group interviews. Three teacher research participants provided lesson plans for review and participated in interviews before and after class observations. Study findings support {{a growing body of}} research that connects high quality learning environments with student engagement: academic, behavioral, psychological, and social. Teacher assessments, student reports, and student class grades reflected increased conceptual understanding of core concepts through hands-on learning activities supported by group work in a number of flexible, open spaces on campus. The students appreciated the fresh air, green environment, open spaces, views, ease of movement, and close relationship to nature. They also valued having a choice of how and with whom they worked, as well as freedom from the direct supervision of their teachers. Students also voiced appreciation for their teachers' demonstrated respect and trust in them. Study findings advance understanding how teachers leverage certain facility and school site conditions and design features to increase student engagement in learning.

40|$|Peripatetic group {{learning}} {{has a long}} history that dates back to the walking sessions that Plato and Aristotle led in the Lyceum of Athens. Other teachers in ancient Greece also frequently used play and physical training didactically. Pokémon Go has a relatively short history (starting in the summer of 2016), but this location-based game had a faster global spread than anyone could have imagined. In the first week after its release, the game became the most downloaded app in history. In Pokémon Go, the players use real-world maps on which buildings, roads and water are correctly indicated. The game is played on mobile devices; the Pokémon figures pop up on maps and can be captured with virtual balls. To catch the Pokémon figures, players must physically move to the place where the figure is located; thus, unlike most other digital games, Pokémon Go involves outdoor activities such as long walks. With its high degree of physical activity, Pokémon Go has attracted researchers’ attention for use as an exergame. Several researchers are also looking at Pokémon Go’s use as an augmented-reality game. In this study, the focus is on Pokémon Go’s use as a mobile-learning game and on the potential for outdoor activities in formal education. In this study, two primary school classes used the game for learning sessions in mathematics and social science. The aim {{of this study is to}} discuss students’ expressions regarding how a location-based game such as Pokémon Go could be used as a tool for outdoor activities in formal education. Each primary school class was divided into groups of three to four students each for planned lessons that included walks. Each group had one or two smartphones to stimulate collaboration between students. The walks included PokéStops where teachers conducted planned sessions; later, the teachers followed up on the <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> within a traditional classroom setting. Data were gathered from group interviews with the students who participated in the outdoor sessions involving Pokémon Go. The collected data were then analysed and categorised via a thematic analysis. The findings show that Pokémon Go can be seen as a learning-stimulating game that could augment traditional teaching sessions in formal education. Students reported that they enjoyed catching the Pokémon figures the most, but some students also mentioned that they appreciated the math assignments and liked learning about the statues that they passed during the walkings. The most positive findings were that there were concrete learning outcomes and that this mobile, game-based educational setting seemed to encourage students to engage in collaborative learning. However, Pokémon Go is not an all-encompassing solution for the ongoing digitalisation of primary school. The conclusion is rather that location-based games have the potential to vitalise formal education, provided that they are carefully integrated into the curriculum...|$|E

In FTMSK, there is lack of studies to investigate the readiness of the students towards the implementation of mobile learning in C++ programming language. The research on educational potential of mobile devices also is lacking in FTMSK. Therefore, this paper primarily aims to determine the readiness of FTMSK students towards the implementation of mobile learning in learning C++ programming language, {{as well as to}} identify {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} mobile devices for educational purposes. The methodology that has been used to achieve the objectives of the project are through survey questionnaires and from the literature reviews. Data that has been collected and analysed showed that most of the respondents are ready to implement mobile learning in learning C++ programming language since majority of them like to learn using technology (85 %), interested to know more about mobile learning (75 %) and agree if mobile learning is implemented in learning C++ programming language (90 %). 80 % of the respondents agree with the following advantages and disadvantages of mobile devices for educational purposes. The advantages are; learners can interact with each other and with the practitioner instead of hiding behind large monitors, It is much easier to accommodate several mobile devices in a classroom than several desktop computers, PDAs or tablets holding notes and e-books are lighter and less bulky than bags full of files, paper and textbook, or even laptops, handwriting with the stylus pen is more intuitive than using keyboard and mouse, it is possible to share assignments and work collaboratively, mobile devices can be used anywhere, anytime including at home, on the train and in hotels, can take notes directly into the device during <b>outdoor</b> <b>lessons</b> or on field trips, can draw diagrams, maps, sketches directly onto a tablet using standard software, stylus pens are much more natural for web browsing, and lastly can increases motivation and personal commitment to learn if a student can “own” a device to encourages responsibility.

40|$|Informed by {{alternative}} learning {{theories that}} apply a constructivist approach to education, this research study explores {{one form of}} experiential, hands on education; inquiry-based learning. Grounded in the new sociology of childhood, which values the voices of young children, this study examines how inquiry-based learning is experienced by kindergarten students in an outdoor classroom in Fonthill, Ontario. This research expands on current relevant literature to understand kindergarteners’ experiences in an outdoor inquiry-based classroom through their first hand reports, accompanied by observations made by their teachers. Based on a constructivist framework, this study employs a phenomographic methodology consisting of semi-structured, participant guided interviews, and inductive data analysis involving a cross-comparison of the transcripts across kindergartener and teacher participants. Three major themes emerged from the data in this study: (a) student-led experiences in the <b>outdoor</b> classroom; (b) <b>lessons</b> experienced in the outdoor classroom; and (c) boundaries to learning in the outdoor classroom. Responses from {{participants in this study}} raise questions for future research regarding the use of informal learning in the public education system specifically in regards to the roles of teachers, the structures of learning spaces, and the experiences of diverse populations.

The analysis of these data was from a socio-cultural theoretical perspective. The research data suggested that success {{was in a state}} of flux for all in the PRU. For pupils there were personal transformations in their attitudes, behaviours and values. Pupilsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 social and emotional capital was increased by the â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 deep relationshipsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 that developed between pupils and staff. The innovative approach to the curriculum allowed pupils to engage positively with education and featured lessons that were routinely based upon experiential learning. This included weekly <b>outdoor</b> learning <b>lessons</b> which provided a rich context for informal learning to take place alongside the formal objectives. Leadership and management appeared to be the keystone of the PRU success.
