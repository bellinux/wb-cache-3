5|$|Frequency {{estimates}} vary enormously. In 2015 it {{was estimated}} that 37.2 million people globally are affected. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1; combining the geometric mean ratio of 5:1 with a conservative prevalence estimate for autism of 1.3 per 1,000 suggests indirectly that the prevalence of AS might be around 0.26 per 1,000. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> estimates arises from differences in diagnostic criteria. For example, a relatively small 2007 study of 5,484 eight-year-old children in Finland found 2.9 children per 1,000 met the ICD-10 criteria for an AS diagnosis, 2.7 per 1,000 for Gillberg and Gillberg criteria, 2.5 for DSM-IV, 1.6 for Szatmari et al., and 4.3 per 1,000 for the union of the four criteria. Boys seem to be more likely to have AS than girls; estimates of the sex ratio range from 1.6:1 to 4:1, using the Gillberg and Gillberg criteria. Females with autism spectrum disorders may be underdiagnosed.|$|E

Specifically, neuroticism predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A meta-analysis found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.|$|E

A large independent validity study on the SAT's ability to predict college freshman GPA was performed by the University of California.

2500|$|An example {{this method}} is in the {{prediction}} of college grade point average (GPA) where high school GPA and admissions test scores (e.g., SAT, ACT) usually account for {{a large proportion of}} variance in college GPA. The use of admissions tests is supported by incremental validity evidence. For example, the pre-2000 SAT correlated [...]34 with freshman GPA while high school GPA correlated [...]36 with freshman GPA. It might seem that both measures are strong predictors of freshman GPA, but in fact high school GPA and SAT scores are also strongly correlated, so we need to test for how much predictive power we get from the SAT when we account for high school GPA. The incremental validity is indicated by the change in R-square when high school GPA included in the model. In this case, high school GPA accounts for 13% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> freshman GPA and the combination of high school GPA plus SAT accounts for 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> freshman GPA. Therefore, the SAT adds 7 percentage points to our predictive power. If this is significant and deemed an important improvement, then we can say that the SAT has incremental validity over using high school GPA alone to predict freshman GPA. Any new admissions criterion or test must add additional predictive power (incremental validity) in order to be useful in predicting college GPA when high school GPA and test scores are already known.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} SWB {{is a central}} concern of {{positive}} psychology. Positive psychology was founded by Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000) who identified that psychology {{is not just the}} study of pathology, weakness, and damage; but it is also the study of strength and virtue. Researchers in positive psychology have pointed out that in almost every culture studied the pursuit of happiness is {{regarded as one of the}} most valued goals in life. Understanding individual differences in SWB is of key interest in positive psychology, particularly the issue of why some people are happier than others. Some people continue to be happy in the face of adversity whereas others are chronically unhappy at the best of times. Additionally, positive psychology has investigated how people might improve their level of SWB and maintain these improvements over the longer term, rather than returning to baseline. Lyubomirsky (2001) argued that SWB is influenced by a combination of personality/genetics (studies have found that genetic influences usually account for 35-50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> happiness measures), external circumstances, and activities that affect SWB. [...] She argued that changing one's external circumstances tends to have only a temporary effect on SWB, whereas engaging in activities (mental and/or physical) that enhance SWB can lead to more lasting improvements in SWB.|$|E
2500|$|A {{report from}} the New York Times stated that family income can explain about 95% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> SAT scores. In response, Lisa Wade, {{contributor}} at the website The Society Pages, commented that those with higher family income, “tend to have better teachers, more resource-rich educational environments, more educated parents who can help them with school and, sometimes, expensive SAT tutoring.” However, University of California system research found that after controlling for family income and parental education, the already low ability of the SAT to measure aptitude and college readiness fell sharply while the more substantial aptitude and college readiness measuring abilities of high school GPA and the SAT II each remained undiminished (and even slightly increased). The University of California system required both the SAT and the SAT II from applicants to the UC system during the four years included in the study. [...] They further found that, after controlling for family income and parental education, the so-called achievement tests known as the SAT II measure aptitude and college readiness 10 {{times higher than the}} SAT. As with racial bias, correlation with income could also be due to the social class of the makers of the test, although according to the authors of The Bell Cuve, empirical research suggests that poorer students actually perform worse on questions the authors believed to be [...] "neutral" [...] compared to the ones they termed as [...] "privileged." ...|$|E
