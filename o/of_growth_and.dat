5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade of the twentieth century, there was a change of {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> regional <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> development, not only in economically developed countries but also countries in development. The previous, conventional (Keynesian and neoclassical) interpretations <b>of</b> regional <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> development began to give way to new explications, explanations based on the strengthening of enogenic potentials of the region. There is an agreement in theory that the phenomenon of globalization is a key factor in those changes. The new approach to the factors <b>of</b> economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> development focuses on improving competitiveness. The intensity <b>of</b> economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> the quality <b>of</b> economic development of a region is the result of internal forces, and the competence of the local development policy, and less the result of forces that act outside of it. This new interpretation <b>of</b> regional <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> development emphasizes the importance of networks and forces that drive innovation, and the process of creation and dissemination of knowledge. It changes the key assumptions of the Keynesian and neoclassical postulates <b>of</b> economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> development in regions and contribute to a better understanding of the regional reality in the era of globalization, as a kind of compression of time and space over the past twenty years...|$|R

5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|Each volcano type {{produced}} by the Anahim hotspot has its own unique life cycle <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> erosion. Volcanic cones have their origins from tephra accumulating around vents during Strombolian eruptions. They are composed of trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt, phonolite, basanite {{and to a lesser}} extent phonotephrite. In contrast, lava domes are formed mainly by viscous trachytic magma that erupted effusively onto the surface and then piled up thick around vents. Most of these features were formed by a single volcanic eruption and are therefore monogenetic. However, in some cases several eruptions occurred at a single locus to create larger, polygenetic centres (e.g. Satah Mountain, Baldface Mountain, Nazko Cone). Once activity has declined, erosion reduces them into volcanic remnants such as lava plugs.|$|E

Female progeny go to a test station in Moussour in Corrèze, where they are inseminated with the same bulls and calve at two years in confinement before being put out to pasture with their calves. The test station evaluates weight, growth, morphology, fertility, calving ability and milking ability in order to assess their maternal qualities. The best bulls following the tests on their daughters are identified as Maternal Qualities (in French Qualités Maternelles, abbreviated to QM).|$|E
5|$|Odwalla was {{incorporated}} in September 1985 {{after five years}} <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> expanded to sell products in San Francisco in 1988. Hambrecht & Quist Inc., a venture capital firm in San Francisco, was one of Odwalla's main investors at the time, investing several million dollars in the company. By 1992, the company employed 80 people at its company headquarters in Davenport, California, and sold around 20 different flavors of juice for between $1.50 and $2.00 a pint. Odwalla went public in December 1993 (NASDAQ:ODWA); the company had 35 delivery trucks, almost 200 employees, and made about $13million a year. Soon afterwards, Odwalla expanded into new markets when it bought two companies in the Pacific Northwest and Colorado.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{chapter on}} the {{distribution}} and growth of coral reefs examines {{the conditions in which}} they flourish, their rate <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> the depths at which the reef building polyps can live, showing that they can only flourish at a very limited depth. In the fifth chapter he sets out his theory as a unified explanation for the findings of the previous chapters, overcoming the difficulties of treating the various kinds of reef as separate and the problem of reliance on the improbable assumption that underwater mountains just happened to be at the exact depth below sea level, by showing how barrier reefs and then atolls form as the land subsides, and fringing reefs are found along with evidence that the land is being elevated. This chapter ends with a summary of his theory illustrated with two woodcuts each showing two different stages of reef formation in relation to sea level.|$|E
5|$|The hardy plants Robinson {{endorsed}} {{were not}} all natives by any means: two chapters {{are devoted to}} the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to naturalising schemes. The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula. Meadowflowers included goldenrod and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens. Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants' habit <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> their cultural preferences dictated the free design, in which human intervention was to be kept undetectable.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E
