5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my <b>own</b> <b>beliefs,</b> to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
5|$|Second, Asch {{emphasized}} that independent thought and disagreement among group members is {{a cornerstone of}} group functioning. He believed that only by settling our differences with other group members can we actually understand the shortcomings of our <b>own</b> <b>beliefs</b> (Levine, 1999). This notion has been embraced by social scientists like Moscovici, who has pursued this rationale {{as the basis for}} his theory of minority influence in group situations, and has also been incorporated into sociocognitive conflict theory.|$|E
5|$|When Philip of Hesse {{formed the}} Schmalkaldic League {{at the end}} of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined {{on the basis of a}} Lutheran {{interpretation}} of that confession. Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Zurich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his <b>own</b> <b>beliefs</b> and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed. The Burgrecht cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that adults can monitor other people’s beliefs in an efficient way. However, the nature and the limits of efficient belief tracking are still being debated. The present study addressed these issues by testing (a) whether adults spontaneously process other people’s beliefs when overt task instructions assign priority to participants’ <b>own</b> <b>belief,</b> (b) whether this processing relies on low-level associative processes and (c) whether the propensity to track other people’s beliefs is linked to empathic disposition. Adult participants were asked to alternately judge an agent’s <b>belief</b> and their <b>own</b> <b>belief.</b> These beliefs were either consistent or inconsistent with each other. Furthermore, visual association between the agent and the object at which he was looking was either possible or impeded. Results showed interference from the agent’s belief when participants judged their <b>own</b> <b>belief,</b> even when low-level associations were impeded. This indicates that adults still process other people’s beliefs when priority is given to their <b>own</b> <b>belief</b> at the time of computation, and that this processing does not depend on low-level associative processes. Finally, performance on the belief task was associated with the Empathy Quotient and the Perspective Taking scale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, indicating that efficient belief processing is linked to a dispositional dimension of social functioning...|$|R
5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his <b>own</b> <b>beliefs</b> {{about religion}} as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E

25|$|Most of Kierkegaard's later {{philosophical}} and religious writings from 1846 to 1855 were written and authored by himself, and he assigned no pseudonyms to these works.

25|$|Boston's Second Church invited Emerson {{to serve}} as its junior pastor, and he was ordained on January 11, 1829.

25|$|Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) is {{a liberal}} {{religious}} association of Unitarian Universalist congregations. It was formed in 1961 by the consolidation of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America. Both of these predecessor organizations began as Christian denominations of the Unitarian and Universalist varieties respectively. However, modern Unitarian Universalists see themselves as a separate religion with its <b>own</b> <b>beliefs</b> and affinities. They define themselves as non-creedal, and draw wisdom from various religions and philosophies, including humanism, pantheism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, Islam, and Earth-centered spirituality. Thus, the UUA is a syncretistic religious group with liberal leanings.|$|E

25|$|Culture is {{definitely}} beyond ethnicity and race. Healthcare professionals {{need to learn}} about the tolerance of other's beliefs and remember that the professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with our personal beliefs. Discovering our <b>own</b> <b>beliefs</b> and why we have them (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and actions at time when others are cared firwith different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.|$|E
25|$|FitzGibbon {{opposed the}} Irish Catholic Relief Act of 1793 personally, but {{apparently}} recommended its acceptance in the House of Lords, being {{forced out of}} necessity when that Act had been recommended to the Irish Executive by the British Cabinet led by William Pitt the Younger. Pitt expected Ireland to follow the British Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 and allow Catholics to vote again and hold public offices. At the same time, FitzGibbon apparently denounced the policy this Act embodied, so it is probably {{safe to say that}} FitzGibbon's <b>own</b> <b>beliefs</b> and principles conflicted with his obligations {{as a member of the}} Irish executive of the time.|$|E
25|$|Because the pseudonymous authors write from {{perspectives}} {{which are}} not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy {{mentioned in this article}} may or may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's <b>own</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, Johannes Climacus is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. Anti-Climacus, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.|$|E

25|$|Nikolai, {{initially}} {{delighted to}} have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy, and a certain awkwardness in his regard, as it emerges that Arkady's views, much influenced by Bazarov, are radical and make his <b>own</b> <b>beliefs</b> feel dated. Nikolai has always tried to stay as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they are, but this in Nikolai's eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house {{to live with him}} and has already had a son by her. Arkady however is not troubled by the relationship: to the contrary, he openly celebrates the addition of a younger brother.|$|E
25|$|In Queensland on 10 January 1916 Canon David John Garland was {{appointed}} the honorary {{secretary of the}} Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland (ADCCQ) at a public meeting which endorsed 25 April as be the date promoted as “Anzac Day” in 1916 and ever after. Devoted {{to the cause of}} a non-denominational commemoration that could be attended by the whole of Australian society, Garland worked amicably across all denominational divides, creating the framework for Anzac Day commemorative services. Garland is specifically credited with initiating the Anzac Day march, the wreath-laying ceremonies at memorials and the special church services, the two minutes silence, and the luncheon for returned soldiers. Garland intended the silence was used in lieu of a prayer to allow the Anzac Day service to be universally attended, allowing attendees to make a silent prayer or remembrance in accordance with their <b>own</b> <b>beliefs.</b> He particularly feared that the universality of the ceremony would fall victim to religious sectarian disputes.|$|E
25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their <b>own</b> <b>beliefs,</b> standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E
