30|$|In recent years, {{the study}} of cancer {{suppressor}} gene APC is paid more and more attention to in-depth study of tumor. APC, a multifunctional cancer suppressor gene, is involved in not only Wnt signal pathway to regulate β-catenin degradation (Patel et al. 2015), but also regulating cytoskeleton movement, controlling cell cycle and influencing cell migration <b>and</b> <b>division</b> (Eom et al. 2014). APC gene mutations would cause regulatory function disorder, which is closely associated with <b>occurrence</b> <b>and</b> development of tumor.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a study of}} the principal animal health problems in central and southern parts of Turkana South District, with particular emphasis on their relative importance, factors that promote their <b>occurrence</b> <b>and</b> persistence, and the perceived impact of intervention measures applied previously by the Turkana Livestock Development Program (TLDP). The study was conceived and supported by VSF Belgium, a non-governmental organization (NGO) which is implementing the TLDP. The first phase of the program was implemented between 2000 and 2005, and the second phase was initiated in 2006. The overall objective of the first phase, which occurred largely in Turkana Central (Turkwell, Loima <b>and</b> Kerio <b>Divisions),</b> was to improve the livelihoods of vulnerable pastoral communities through enhanced livestock production, increased access to water, improved marketing opportunities and peace building initiatives. The second phase of the program builds on the achievements of the TLDP I and seeks to expand the target area to include Turkana South (Kainuk, Katilu, Lokichar <b>and</b> Lokori <b>Divisions).</b> The study utilized participatory epidemiological techniques to capture and prioritize animal health problems observed in the target area. Topics of discussion include livestock species and benefits received from them; livestock diseases and interventions; effect of nomadic pastoralism on disease persistence and transmission; impacts of conflicts on livestock husbandry <b>and</b> disease <b>occurrence</b> <b>and</b> persistence; livestock species and disease priorities; disease control; access and utilization of veterinary inputs; community animal health workers; pastoralism and transboundary disease; and conflict and animal health care...|$|R

After forest disturbance, the <b>occurrence</b> <b>and</b> abundance of ants belonging to the functional groups of forest ground forager and soil and litter dweller are predicted to decrease, while the <b>occurrence</b> <b>and</b> abundance of ants belonging to the open land forager and forest vegetation forager functional groups are predicted to increase. In terms of the effects of climate change, if the optimum temperature of the ants is lower than the annual average temperature in the survey area, the <b>occurrence</b> <b>and</b> abundance of the ants are predicted to decrease and vice versa. Ant surveys were carried out using pitfall traps. Changes in the dominant species, <b>occurrence,</b> <b>and</b> abundance mostly corresponded to the predictions for forest disturbance, but did not match the prediction for an increase in temperature...|$|R
