5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} {{to hold the line}} only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh.|$|E

5|$|The National Trust for Scotland {{purchased}} {{the island in}} 2000 from a local crofters' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company who had owned the island since 1955. The NTS were able to acquire it through a bequest by Miss J. M. Fawcitt “to provide an area of natural beauty in memory of her parents and the courage of her late brother, Bernard.” In 2009 the NTS removed all the sheep from the island, citing the difficulties <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> flock in such a remote location.|$|E
5|$|The five {{versions}} of the Lost World Pyramid were each larger than the previous version. They were not built directly centred upon the preceding version due to the necessity <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> E-Group plaza area between the pyramid and the East Platform. This led {{to the destruction of}} the previous version's east face each time a new version was superimposed over the older version.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight was}} {{operated}} {{for the purpose}} <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> currency of the instrument rating {{of two of the}} airline's pilots.

5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was {{not up to the}} task <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.|$|E
5|$|The {{road that}} {{currently}} carries the SR-202 designation has existed since 1937, when it connected US-40 and US-50 along the Garfield Cut-Off Road. The Utah State Legislature designated the road SR-202 in 1969, thus taking responsibility <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> {{road from the}} county. No changes or alterations {{have been made to}} SR-202, except for the legal definition of the road, which has changed twice since it was formed.|$|E
5|$|A {{golf course}} was {{constructed}} alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy shipowner, in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional {{course at the}} castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> property became {{too much for him}} and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship of the state in 1930, with the Commissioners of Works taking control of the property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of the clearance work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried out under Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter de Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.|$|E

5|$|After Henry's death {{there was}} a pause in the {{conflict}} with France, during which many of the new fortifications were alllowed to deteriorate. There was little money available for repairs and the garrisons were reduced in size. East Cowes was abandoned around 1547 and fell into ruin, while the bulwarks along the Downs were defaced and their guns removed; they were formally removed from service in 1550. In 1552 the Essex fortifications were decommissioned, and several were subsequently pulled down. The expense <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> fortifications in Hull led the Crown to agree a deal with the town authorities to take over management of them. Milton and Higham were demolished between 1557 and 1558. Mersea Fort was temporarily decommissioned, before being brought back into active service.|$|E
5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been undermined by the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The high costs <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended {{to turn it into a}} railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry price of one penny.|$|E
5|$|Concerned at {{the expense}} <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> Falkland Islands {{in an era of}} budget cuts, the UK again {{considered}} transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early Thatcher government. Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981, and the dispute escalated with passing time. In April 1982, the disagreement became an armed conflict when Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic, briefly occupying them until a UK expeditionary force retook the territories in June. After the war, the United Kingdom expanded its military presence, building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the size of its garrison. The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types, including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines. Due to the large number of deminer casualties, initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Dean Dull {{initiated}} a {{group known as}} the Ramblin' Wreck Committee of the Student Council to aid in his search for a mascot. When the Wreck was found in 1961, the Ramblin' Wreck Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree. Rountree would drive the Wreck for school functions and Student Council fundraisers. He {{was also the first}} person to drive the Ramblin' Wreck onto Grant Field. Don Gentry, the president of Reck Club in 1961, was the first student to drive the Wreck as he aided in retrieving the Model A from Ted Johnson's home. The Wreck was always maintained by Reck Club but the complete transition of control occurred between 1964–1967. During this period, Reck Club was relieved of its RAT rules enforcement duties and given more wholesome jobs <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> Wreck, upholding traditions, and generating school spirit.|$|E
5|$|From medieval times, English {{companies}} {{thrived in}} Calais. Calais {{was a particularly}} important centre in the production and trade of wool and cloth, which outweighed the costs <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> town as part of England. In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs, the majority of which were English. There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees. The town exports in the early 20th century were lace, chemicals, paper, wines, especially champagne, spirits, hay, straw, wool, potatoes, woven goods, fruit, glass-ware, lace and metal-ware. Principal imports in the early 20th century included cotton and silk goods, coal, iron and steel, petroleum, timber, raw wool, cotton yarn and cork. During the five years 1901–1905 the average annual value of exports was £8,388,000 (£6,363,000 in the years 1896–1900), of imports £4,145,000 (£3,759,000 in 1896–1900).|$|E
5|$|His 1555 {{election}} for Marlborough was similar, but {{more dependent on}} influential connections. Pleydell's father had once leased the lands of Thomas Seymour in the nearby parish of Eastrop (and possibly Preshute), establishing a relationship of trust between the families. After Seymour's brother Edward was executed in 1552, his widow Anne inherited the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> vast estates. The Duchess appointed Pleydell as chief ranger of Savernake Forest (then under her ownership) before 1554 and as her receiver general that year. His position as ranger probably led to the acquisition of property in Chippenham and Preshute, and {{his status as a}} Preshute landholder assisted him in becoming Member for Marlborough. Pleydell, serving with Sir Andrew Baynton, replaced Peter Taylor alias Perce and John Broke of the 1554 session; they were succeeded by William Daniell and William Fleetwood in 1558 after a parliamentary hiatus following the death of Queen Mary.|$|E

5|$|Hogg's mother Prudentia died in 1839. As a {{condition}} of his father's will, upon {{the death of his}} mother, Thomas Jefferson Hogg could purchase his brother's share of Norton House. He decided not to, because of the potential cost <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> house and the hostility Jane could face there. Instead, he allowed his brother to buy his interest in the house, a decision that led to conflict between the two brothers regarding the price and timing of the sale. They eventually worked out the details, and their relationship became friendlier once the sale was completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice, a timber {{lock on the}} lower river. He built a dovetailed sheet pile wall below the foundations, and the Commissioners offered him the job <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> levels in 1725, for which he would be paid £65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, {{so that all the}} runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as he was too busy with other engineering projects.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 {{the college}} hired noted {{landscape}} architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. with bigger buildings like Olds and Agriculture Halls being built Olmsted faced the challenge <b>of</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> informal character of campus while minimizing walking distance. In 1915, the Olmsted Brothers firm {{issued a report}} its solution was a dramatic redesign of campus around quadrangles However, the plan was unpopular with students and alumni who wished to maintain the informal parklike feel of campus. After eight years of consulting and little in way of changes the school ended its relationship with Olmsted in 1922.|$|E
