25|$|Back in Sydney for {{the autumn}} of 2000, Sunline powered through the rain-affected {{going to win the}} Apollo Stakes (1,400 metres) first-up. Remarkably, in her entire career, she was never beaten over the distance. She then carried the maximum topweight (60 {{kilograms}}) to win the first of two Coolmore Classics - at the time, Australia's only Group One race for fillies and mares (three years and <b>over).</b> <b>At</b> <b>her</b> next start, she carried 57.5 kilograms (9 st. 1lb.) in the Doncaster Handicap and was narrowly defeated by the lightly weighted three-year-old Over. Meeting again a week later, in the All-Aged Stakes, Sunline relished the return to weight for age conditions - easily accounting for Georgie Boy, with Over in third place, to make it three wins from four starts this campaign.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{spent one}} {{pleasant}} week with her lover at Hereford, {{and then was}} summoned into Carmarthenshire. Mr Apjohn came <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> father's invitation, and insisted on taking her back to Llanfeare.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why have we tongues, then?" [...] asked Jessy pertly; while Rose {{only looked}} at her mother with an {{expression}} that seemed to say she should take that maxim in and think it <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> leisure. After two minutes' grave deliberation, she asked, [...] "And why especially girls, mother?" ...|$|E
60|$|But Nell {{retained}} her grasp {{upon the}} old man's arm, and {{long after he}} was slumbering soundly, watched him with untiring eyes. Fatigue stole <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> last; <b>her</b> grasp relaxed, tightened, relaxed again, and they slept side by side.|$|R

60|$|He {{had hoped}} to please her and to calm her, but in an instant she was <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> treasure-cupboard hurling double handfuls of {{precious}} stones down at his feet. They clinked and rattled, the little pellets of red and yellow and green, rolling, glinting over the floor and rapping up against the oak panels {{at the base of}} the walls.|$|E
60|$|Not {{much more}} than a week afterwards--for this was far on in the time of our being so together--I was bending <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> bedside with my ear down to her lips, by turns {{listening}} for her breath and looking for a sign of life in her face. At last it came in a solemn way--not in a flash but like a kind of pale faint light brought very slow to the face.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{the same}} story. Great power reduced to impotence, great glory to misery, by the hand of Fate,--Necessity, as the Greeks called her; the goddess {{that will not be}} shunned! At the mill with slaves! People, when they read it, do not {{appreciate}} the horror of the picture. Go on, my dear. It may be a question whether Polyphemus had mind enough to suffer; but, from the description of his power, I should think that he had. 'At the mill with slaves!' Can any picture be more dreadful than that? Go on, my dear. Of course you remember Milton's Samson Agonistes. Agonistes indeed!" [...] His wife was sitting stitching at {{the other side of the}} room; but she heard his words,--heard and understood them; and before Jane could again get herself into the swing of the Greek verse, she was <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband's side, with her arms round his neck. [...] "My love!" [...] she said. [...] "My love!" ...|$|E
60|$|In the drawing-room, {{she was so}} {{overwhelmed}} with congratulations, that at last, feeling {{that she could not}} face a fresh edition from the male portion of the gathering, she ordered her carriage, and quietly slipped away home, to think <b>over</b> matters <b>at</b> <b>her</b> leisure.|$|R

6000|$|Clementina's {{heart was}} throbbing, and joyous lights were dancing in her eyes. [...] "I don't care if I do," [...] she said, and she stooped to unlace her shoe, {{but one of}} the big girls threw herself on her knees at her feet to prevent her. Clementina remembered too late that there was a hole in her {{stocking}} and that her little toe came through it, but she now folded the toe artfully down, and the big girl discovered the hole in time to abet her attempt at concealment. She caught the slipper from the shoeman and harried it on; she tied the ribbons across the instep, and then put on the other. [...] "Now put out youa foot, Clem! Fast dancin' position!" [...] She leaned back upon her own heels, and Clementina daintily lifted the edge of her skirt a little, and peered <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> feet. The slippers might or might not have been of an imperfect taste, in their imitation of the prevalent fashion, but on Clementina's feet they had distinction.|$|E
60|$|Have we not {{all such}} closets, my jolly friend, {{as well as}} the noble Marquis of Carabas? At night, when all the house is asleep but you, don't you get up and peep into yours? When you in your turn are slumbering, up gets Mrs. Brown from your side, steals downstairs like Amina to her ghoul, clicks open the secret door, and looks into her dark depository. Did she tell you of that little affair with Smith long before she knew you? Psha! who knows any one save himself alone? Who, in showing his house to the closest and dearest, doesn't keep back the key of a closet or two? I think of a lovely reader laying down the page and looking <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{unconscious}} husband, asleep, perhaps, after dinner. Yes, madam, a closet he hath: and you, who pry into everything, shall never have the key of it. I think of some honest Othello pausing over this very sentence in a railroad carriage, and stealthily gazing at Desdemona opposite to him, innocently administering sandwiches to their little boy--I am trying to turn off the sentence with a joke, you see--I feel it is growing too dreadful, too serious.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the death}} of an aunt, and at his father's demise, the heir of Mr. George Warrington became {{entitled}} to a sum of six thousand pounds, of which their mother was one of the trustees. She never could be made to understand that she was not the proprietor, and not merely the trustee of this money; and was furious with the London lawyer, the other trustee, who refused to send it <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> order. [...] "Is not all I have my sons'?" [...] she cried, [...] "and would I not cut myself into little pieces to serve them? With the six thousand pounds I would have bought Mr. Boulter's estate and negroes, which would have given us a good thousand pounds a year, and made a handsome provision for my Harry." [...] Her young friend and neighbour, Mr. Washington of Mount Vernon, could not convince her that the London agent was right, and must not give up his trust except to those for whom he held it. Madam Esmond gave the London lawyer a piece of her mind, and, I am sorry to say, informed Mr. Draper that he was an insolent pettifogger, and deserved to be punished for doubting the honour of a mother and an Esmond. It must be owned that the Virginian Princess had a temper of her own.|$|E

60|$|She {{would take}} her station here, at dusk, and watch the people as they passed {{up and down the}} street, or {{appeared}} at the windows of the opposite houses; wondering whether those rooms were as lonesome as that in which she sat, and whether those people felt it company to see her sitting there, as she did only to see them look out and draw in their heads again. There was a crooked stack of chimneys on one of the roofs, in which, by often looking at them, she had fancied ugly faces that were frowning <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and trying to peer into the room; and she felt glad when it grew too dark to make them out, though she was sorry too, when the man came to light the lamps in the street--for it made it late, and very dull inside. Then, she would draw in her head to look round the room and see that everything was in its place and hadn't moved; and looking out into the street again, would perhaps see a man passing with a coffin on his back, and two or three others silently following him to a house where somebody lay dead; which made her shudder and think of such things until they suggested afresh the old man's altered face and manner, and a new train of fears and speculations. If he were to die--if sudden illness had happened to him, and he were never to come home again, alive--if, one night, he should come home, and kiss and bless her as usual, and after she had gone to bed and had fallen asleep and was perhaps dreaming pleasantly, and smiling in her sleep, he should kill himself and his blood come creeping, creeping, on the ground to her own bed-room door! These thoughts were too terrible to dwell upon, and again she would have recourse to the street, now trodden by fewer feet, and darker and more silent than before. The shops were closing fast, and lights began to shine from the upper windows, as the neighbours went to bed. By degrees, these dwindled away and disappeared or were replaced, here and there, by a feeble rush-candle which was to burn all night. Still, there was one late shop at no great distance which sent forth a ruddy glare upon the pavement even yet, and looked bright and companionable. But, in a little time, this closed, the light was extinguished, and all was gloomy and quiet, except when some stray footsteps sounded on the pavement, or a neighbour, out later than his wont, knocked lustily at his house-door to rouse the sleeping inmates.|$|E
6000|$|He {{made her}} {{more and more}} wonder; she almost {{felt as if he}} were showing her visions while he spoke; and strangely enough, though it was visions that had drawn her on, she hadn't seen them in connection--that is in such {{preliminary}} and necessary connection--with such a face as Lord Mark's, such eyes and such a voice, such a tone and such a manner. He had for an instant the effect of making her ask herself if she were after all going to be afraid; so distinct was it for fifty seconds that a fear passed over her. There they were again--yes, certainly: Susie's overture to Mrs. Lowder had been their joke, but they had pressed in that gaiety an electric bell that continued to sound. Positively, while she sat there, she had the loud rattle in her ears, and she wondered, during these moments, why the others didn't hear it. They didn't stare, they didn't smile, and the fear in her that I speak of was but her own desire to stop it. That dropped, however, as if the alarm itself had ceased; she seemed to have seen in a quick, though tempered glare that there were two courses for her, one to leave London again the first thing in the morning, the other to do nothing at all. Well, she would do nothing at all; she was already doing it; more than that, she had already done it, and her chance was gone. She gave herself up--she had the strangest sense, on the spot, of so deciding; for she had turned a corner before she went on again with Lord Mark. Inexpressive, but intensely significant, he met as no one else could have done the very question she had suddenly put to Mrs. Stringham on the Brünig. Should she have it, whatever she did have, that question had been, for long? [...] "Ah, so possibly not," [...] her neighbour appeared to reply; [...] "therefore, don't you see? I'm the way." [...] It was vivid that he might be, in spite of his absence of flourish; the way being doubtless just in that absence. The handsome girl, whom she didn't lose sight of and who, she felt, kept her also in view--Mrs. Lowder's striking niece would, perhaps, be the way as well, for in her too was the absence of flourish, though she had little else, so far as one could tell, in common with Lord Mark. Yet how indeed could one tell, what did one understand, and of what was one, for that matter, provisionally conscious but of their being somehow together in what they represented? Kate Croy, fine but friendly, looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as really with a guess at Lord Mark's effect on her. If she could guess this effect what then did she know about it and in what degree had she felt it herself? Did that represent, as between them, anything particular, and should she have to count with them as duplicating, as intensifying by a mutual intelligence, the relation into which she was sinking? Nothing was so odd as that she should have to recognise so quickly in each of these glimpses of an instant the various signs of a relation; and this anomaly itself, had she had more time to give to it, might well, might almost terribly have suggested to her that her doom was to live fast. It was queerly a question of the short run and the consciousness proportionately crowded.|$|E
