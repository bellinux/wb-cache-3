5|$|A few of {{the people}} who spent time in Kowloon Walled City have written {{accounts}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>experiences.</b> Evangelist Jackie Pullinger wrote a 1989 memoir, Crack in the Wall, about her involvement in treating drug addicts within the Walled City. In his 2004 autobiography Gweilo, Martin Booth describes his exploration of the Walled City as a child in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> are unclear. Some of those {{who claimed to have}} witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that their beliefs were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|As Soviet troops {{approached}} Auschwitz in January 1945, most of {{its population}} was sent west on a death march. The prisoners remaining at the camp were liberated on 27 January 1945, a day now commemorated as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the following decades, survivors, such as Primo Levi, Viktor Frankl, and Elie Wiesel, wrote memoirs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> in Auschwitz, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947, Poland founded the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum {{on the site of}} Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979, it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.|$|E

Martin and Hewlett have since spoken negatively <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> creating the film. Talalay blamed some of the film's negative reception on studio edits over which she had no control. Despite the negative critical reception and box office failure of the film, it has been cited {{as an example of a}} comic book film with a cult following, and it is noted for its feminist themes.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{introduces}} {{the survivors of}} Oceanic Flight 815, who experience a plane crash and end up on a mysterious island. Three of the characters, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), are featured before the crash in flashbacks <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> on the plane as it breaks apart in mid-air; this narrative technique would be reused in almost every subsequent episode of the series. The Lost pilot {{is one of the}} most critically acclaimed television pilots of all time. Both parts earned high ratings, with Part 1 breaking the record for a pilot episode with 18.6 million viewers, and the episode would later win many awards and accolades.|$|E

25|$|There are 20 known {{contemporary}} {{accounts of}} the First Fleet made by people sailing in the Fleet, including journals (both manuscript and published) and letters. The eleven ships of the Fleet, carrying over 1,000 convicts, soldiers and seamen, left England on 13 May 1787 and arrived in Botany Bay between 18 and 20 January 1788 before relocating to Port Jackson to establish the first European settlement in Australia, a penal colony which became Sydney. At least 12 people on the Fleet kept a journal <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>experiences,</b> {{some of which were}} later published, while others wrote letters home during the voyage or soon after their arrival in Australia. These personal {{accounts of the}} voyage were made by people including surgeons, officers, soldiers, ordinary seamen, and Captain Arthur Phillip, who commanded the expedition. Only one known account, that of James Martin, was by a transported convict. Their journals document the day to day experiences of those in the Fleet, and record significant events including the first contact between the European settlers and the Aboriginal people of the area. In 2009, the manuscript journals were included in The Australian Memory of the World Register, a regional register associated with the UNESCO international Memory of the World programme.|$|E
