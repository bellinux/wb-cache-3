5|$|Just one sound can be {{complete}} in itself, for its complexity {{lies in the}} formulation of ma, an unquantifiable metaphysical space (duration) of dynamically tensed absence <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> For example, in the performance of nō, the ma <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> and silence does not have an organic relation for the purpose of artistic expression. Rather, these two elements contrast sharply with one another in an immaterial balance.|$|E
5|$|The speed <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in helium {{is nearly}} three times the speed <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity {{is proportional to the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{current study}} {{is part of}} a larger project aiming at {{offering}} intuitive mappings for the control of synthesis models by semantic descriptions <b>of</b> <b>sounds,</b> i. e. simple verbal labels related to various feelings, emotions, gestures or motions. Hence, this work is directly related to the general problem <b>of</b> semiotics <b>of</b> <b>sounds.</b> We here put a special interest in sounds evoking different perceived motions. To focus on intrinsic invariants <b>of</b> <b>sounds,</b> we have adopted the "acousmatic" listening approach by constituting a set <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> composed <b>of</b> recorded <b>sounds</b> for which the sound producing sources are as unrecognizable as possible. We also included synthesized sounds to examine specific assumptions related to the physics <b>of</b> moving <b>sound</b> sources. We then studied the perceptual categorization <b>of</b> these <b>sounds</b> using categorization tasks. In this paper, the experimental design of the listening tests is described and the results obtained from behavioral data are discussed. We finally present some perspectives directly linked to synthesis applications...|$|R

Instead of the hundreds <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> and complex oscillator controls available on a high-end, professional synthesizer, they often have a small number <b>of</b> <b>sounds,</b> typically a variety of acoustic piano, electric piano, and Hammond organ <b>sounds.</b> Also, instead <b>of</b> scrolling through the on-screen menus used on synthesizers, stage pianos are usually controlled with simple knobs and buttons.|$|R

5|$|In his youth, Dugan {{was fascinated}} by the {{technical}} aspects of theatre. He worked as a lighting designer then transitioned to sound design in 1967. Dugan became interested in achieving the automatic adjustment <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> controls after a frustrating experience staging the musical Hair. His first automixer design was not fully practical but his second design was successful; it used a reference derived from a total of all of its microphone signals. Dugan devised a third improvement which helped prevent audio feedback in the presence <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> reinforcement loudspeakers. Dugan next produced an automixer design that could be inserted into an existing mixing console. This proved popular for broadcast and live sound applications. Each of Dugan's subsequent automixer models has been of the insertable type.|$|E

5|$|Late in the year, AT/Western Electric {{created a}} {{licensing}} division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle {{rights to the}} company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense {{for the use of}} the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> reproduction. The new year would finally see the emergence <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> cinema as a significant commercial medium.|$|E
