5000|$|Indirect {{dampening}} systems (or integrated dampening systems) {{feed the}} water directly {{into one of}} the ink form rollers (ink rollers that touch the <b>offset</b> <b>plate)</b> via a water form roller in contact with it. These systems are known as [...] "indirect" [...] since the water travels to the <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> passing through the inking system and not directly to the <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> as direct systems do. Some indirect systems will have the ability to feed the water into the inking system {{as well as to the}} <b>offset</b> <b>plate.</b> A fine emulsion of ink and water is then developed on the ink form roller. This is one reason printers need to know about [...] "water pickup" [...] or what percentage of water can be taken up by the ink. These systems are also known as [...] "integrated" [...] dampening systems as they are integrated into the inking system. One of the benefits of these systems, is that they do not use covers thus they react more quickly when dampening changes are made. One generally finds this type of dampening systems on newer and faster press equipment today.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} in lenticular printing is colour synchronisation. The causes are varied, they may come from a malleable material, incorrect printing conditions and adjustments, or again a dimensional differential of the engraving of the <b>offset</b> <b>plates</b> in each colour.|$|R
50|$|Direct {{dampening}} systems {{employ a}} water fountain roller which {{picks up the}} water from the water fountain. The water is then passed to a water distribution roller. From here the water is transferred to the <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> via one or two water form rollers.|$|R

40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, bush, pin and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are press fitted with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an <b>offset</b> <b>plate,</b> the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an <b>offset</b> <b>plate.</b> The holes in the <b>offset</b> <b>plate</b> are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape chain plate. A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the chain plate as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations. In this context the transmission photoelastic technique has made it possible to identify the stress distribution, its concentration and also to quantify the stress and strain [2 - 3] at any point in the chain plate. This paper explains how transmission photoelastic technique is used to estimate the stress distribution and its concentration zones in a complex chain plate when it isloaded. An epoxy chain plate model was made through the casting method using a Perspex mould [2 - 3]. A loading fixture was used to load the model during stress freezing in the furnace. The integrated fringe pattern of the <b>offset</b> chain <b>plate</b> is shown in Figure 2. Slices are cut in the offset zone to understand the nature of the stress distribution. A Simple photoelastic analysis of this has revealed a wealth of information to take suitable decision on the design of such plates taking into account the constraints in manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the grouping of book covers on <b>offset</b> <b>plates</b> in order to minimize the total production cost. The mathematical formulation of the problem involves both binary and continuous variables. As exact methods are unable to provide solutions in reasonable time, a heuristic algorithm of the simulated annealing type is proposed. At each iteration, the values of the current solution binary variables are altered in order to yield a neighboring solution. To compute the corresponding values of the continuous variables and the value of the objective function, a linear programming routine is called at each iteration. This constitutes the main originality of the present approach and is in principle applicable in mixed integer programming problems. The procedure is tested on several examples...|$|R
