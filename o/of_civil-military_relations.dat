Studies <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> often rest on a normative assumption that civilian control of the military is preferable to military control of the state. The principal problem they examine, however, is empirical: to explain how civilian control over the military is established and maintained.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem throughout most of American history was to keep its standing army small, relying on augmentation from militias (the predecessor of modern-day Reserve forces, to include the National Guard) and volunteers. While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels. However, {{with the advent of the}} Cold War in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force engendered new concerns of militarism and about how such a large force would affect civil-military relations in the United States. For the first time in American history, the problem <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> would have to be managed during peacetime.|$|E
25|$|The March 1994 Washington Agreement, {{ended the}} Croat–Bosniak War and created {{conditions}} for provision of US {{military aid to}} Croatia. Croatia requested US military advisors from the Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI) to provide training <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations,</b> programme and budget services of the HV the same month, and the MPRI training was licensed by the US Department of State upon endorsement from Richard Holbrooke in August. The MPRI was hired because the UN arms embargo was still in place, ostensibly to prepare the HV for NATO Partnership for Peace programme participation. They trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It was also speculated that the MPRI also provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite information to Croatia. MPRI and Croatian officials dismissed such speculation. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as 30% of arms and ammunition shipped through Croatia was kept as a trans-shipment fee. The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by Bill Clinton since February 1993.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the heart}} <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> {{is the problem}} of how a {{civilian}} government can control and remain safe from the military institution it created for its own protection.

2500|$|Charles Moskos {{developed}} the institutional/occupational hypothesis {{as a means}} to promote comparative historical studies of military organization and military change. This hypothesis evolved into the Postmodern Military Model, which helped predict the course <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> {{after the end of the}} Cold War. The I/O hypothesis argued that the military was moving away from an institutional model towards one that was more occupational in nature. An institutional model presents the military as an organization highly divergent from civilian society while an occupational model presents the military more convergent with civilian structures. While Moskos did not propose that the military was ever [...] "entirely separate or entirely coterminous with civilian society", the use of a scale helped better to highlight the changing interface between the armed forces and society.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to this apparent [...] "puzzle," [...] Peter D.

Taking a rationalist approach, he used a principal-agent framework, drawn from microeconomics, to explore how actors in a superior position influence those in a subordinate role. He used the concepts of [...] "working" [...] and [...] "shirking" [...] to explain {{the actions of the}} subordinate. In his construct, the principal is the civilian leadership that has the responsibility of establishing policy. The agent is the military that will work – carry out the designated task – or shirk – evading the principal's wishes and carrying out actions that further the military's own interests. Shirking at its worst may be disobedience, but Feaver includes such things as [...] "foot-dragging" [...] and leaks to the press.|$|E

In practice, these {{have more to do with}} issues of state capacity-building and bureaucratic modernization with the traditional concerns <b>of</b> the <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> literature. In most cases, the problem is not the establishment of civilian control over the armed forces or the separation of the military from politics, but rather that of the effective execution of democratic governance of the defense and security sector-particularly in relation to defense policy-making, legislative oversight and the effective engagement of civil-society in a framework of democratic legitimacy and accountability...|$|R

40|$|Current {{understanding}} of the post- 9 / 11 US civil-military power relationship is clouded by the existence of various competing propositions as to whether civilian policymakers, military leaders {{or a combination of}} both have had the greatest influence in determining military strategy in Iraq. Motivated by the empirical and theoretical deficiencies of the post- 9 / 11 US <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> literature, this thesis traces the evolution of the shifting power relationship between civilian policymakers and military leaders in the formulation and implementation of US military strategy during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and explores the circumstances within which different balances <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> power occur. Using the policymaking process as an analytical framework, OIF is deconstructed into a series of decision points from 2001 to 2008 and the relative balance <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> power is identified at each according to one of five variations: Civilian Dominance; Shared Dominance Civilian; Shared Dominance; Shared Dominance Military; or Military Dominance. Using both qualitative and quantitative research methods, the thesis tests and explores the importance of six independent variables in explaining variations in the relative balance <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> power: civil-military preference divergence; civilian assertiveness; military assertiveness; civilian unity; military unity; and information advantage. In presenting a comprehensive analysis <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> power <b>relations</b> throughout OIF, the thesis offers a more nuanced response to the question of who controls US military strategy and demonstrates which independent variables hold the greatest potential for explaining variations in the relative balance <b>of</b> <b>civil-military</b> power. Analysis <b>of</b> the relationships between the dependent and independent variables reveals associations of varying strengths, thereby both confirming and challenging a number of the assumptions contained within the existing literature. By rooting contemporary research in the broader study <b>of</b> US <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations,</b> the thesis provides empirical clarity to the post- 9 / 11 period as well as offering theoretical insight into the civil-military relationship beyond the limits of OIF...|$|R

40|$|Indonesia’s {{military}} reform resulted cultural, structural, doctrinal {{and organizational}} changes. But those changes are not fundamental enough to build democratic <b>civil–military</b> <b>relation</b> {{that relies on}} civilian supremacy. The process of military reform in Indonesia showed us that the success <b>of</b> democratization <b>of</b> <b>civil–military</b> <b>relation</b> depends on institutional setup of the military related to civilian institutions’ persistency, guidance, and initiative. This study used Peter D. Feaver’s theory of “principal-agent” {{to show that the}} lack of civilian institutions’ coherence and resoluteness caused persisting problems to the Indonesia’s military reform under democratic system. Civilian supremacy in Indonesia appears to be relied on “voluntary subordination” of the military rather than effective civilian control over the military. Hence, instructive policies and legal basis become very important to yield a complete subordination of the military to the civil within democratic system. This argument confronts the existing studies, especially those with political perspective, that tended to accept the idea that military supremacy in politics is needed to build a strong nation state and to uphold the constitution. This study uses qualitative method with data collected by interviewing some key figures in military and civilian institutions...|$|R
