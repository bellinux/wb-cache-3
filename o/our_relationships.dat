500|$|An {{interesting}} area {{of research}} in this context concerns the similarities between <b>our</b> <b>relationships</b> and those of animals, whether animals in human society (pets, working animals, even animals grown for food) or in the wild. One idea is that as people or animals perceive a social relationship as important to preserve, their conscience begins to respect that former [...] "other", and urge actions that protect it. Similarly, in complex territorial and cooperative breeding bird communities (such as the Australian magpie) that have {{a high degree of}} etiquettes, rules, hierarchies, play, songs and negotiations, rule-breaking seems tolerated on occasions not obviously related to survival of the individual or group; behaviour often appearing to exhibit a touching gentleness and tenderness.|$|E
500|$|In February 1531, {{the evangelical}} princes and {{cities of the}} empire set up the Protestant Schmalkaldic League to defend the {{reformed}} religion. [...] Strasbourg's Jakob Sturm negotiated the city's inclusion {{on the basis of}} the Tetrapolitan Confession. [...] By this time, Bucer's relationship with Zwingli was deteriorating. [...] Strasbourg's political ties with the Elector of Saxony, and Bucer's partial theological support of Luther, became too much for Zwingli, and on 21 February 1531, he wrote to Bucer ending their friendship. When representatives of the southern German cities convened in Ulm on 23–24 March 1532 to discuss their alliance with the Schmalkaldic League, Bucer advised them to sign the Augsburg Confession, if they were being pressured to do so. For Bucer to recommend the rival confession over his own version surprised the Swiss cities. [...] Luther continued his polemical attacks on Bucer, but Bucer was unperturbed: [...] "In any case, we must seek unity and love in <b>our</b> <b>relationships</b> with everyone," [...] he wrote, [...] "regardless of how they behave toward us." [...] In April and May 1533, he again toured the southern German cities and Swiss cities. The latter remained unconvinced and did not join the Protestant alliance.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{process of}} {{evaluating}} <b>our</b> <b>relationships</b> with computers, Turkle interviews children, college students, engineers, AI scientists, hackers and personal computer owners {{in order to}} further understand <b>our</b> <b>relationships</b> with computers and how we interact with them on a personal level. [...] The interviews showed that computers are both a part of our selves as well as part of the external world. [...] In this book, Turkle tries to figure out why we think of computers in such psychological terms, how this happens and what this means for all of us.|$|E

2500|$|In The Second Self, Turkle {{defines the}} {{computer}} {{as more than}} just a tool, but part of our everyday personal and psychological lives. [...] She looks at how the computer affects the way we look at ourselves and <b>our</b> <b>relationships</b> with others, claiming that technology defines the way we think and act. [...] Turkle's book allows us to view and reevaluate our own relationships with technology.|$|E
2500|$|Margaret Atwood has {{repeatedly}} made observations about <b>our</b> <b>relationships</b> to animals in her works. In Surfacing, one character remarks about eating animals: [...] "The animals die {{that we may}} live, they are substitute people...And we eat them, out of cans or otherwise; we are eaters of death, dead Christ-flesh resurrecting inside us, granting us life." [...] Some characters in her books link sexual oppression to meat-eating and consequently give up meat-eating. In The Edible Woman, Atwood's character Marian identifies with hunted animals and cries after hearing her fiancé's experience of hunting and eviscerating a rabbit. Marian stops eating meat but then later returns to it.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} written to examine Greek Tragedy in its entirety, {{specifically}} through the playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. We {{focused on the}} inward turn of consciousness, or the movement from the great gods of Olympus authorizing actions through supra-human forces informing character, to conflicting psychic drives that condition human lives and motivate actions. We looked at the backgrounds of all three playwrights, analyzed each play, and ultimately concluded that Greek Tragedy is still important today. Greek Tragedy remains profoundly relevant today because it tries to explain ourselves, <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> to others, <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> to the world, and <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> to the divine.

2500|$|The band {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} variety in the lyrics on their self-titled debut album, a fact expanded upon by James: [...] "Some songs {{are inspired by}} dreams, fantasizing, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. This Language is an anti-war song, Exit is just an explosion and Bluetrace is trippy, with the second half like a primal scream. We {{just wanted to make}} a lot of noise!" [...] In regards to their second album, the band aimed for an increased sense of maturity and self-awareness, and wanted to focus less on [...] "break-ups and such things" [...] and more on [...] "longing, searching, loving, life, death, magic, lust and forgiveness," [...] according to James. [...] "We've also developed <b>our</b> <b>relationships</b> off the stage as well. This album was so much fun because it was like five best mates playing around in a studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Importantly, the ready-to-hand only {{emerges from}} the prior {{attitude}} in which we care {{about what is going}} on and we see the hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there [...] "in order to" [...] do something. In this sense the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and [...] "close" [...] to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our [...] "average-everyday" [...] understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of <b>our</b> <b>relationships</b> to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.|$|E
