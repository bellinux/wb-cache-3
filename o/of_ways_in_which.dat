In addition, the number <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the batsman can be given out is reduced to three. In shorter competition cricket, a batsman receives a 'free hit' on the ball after any kind of No ball (see below). This means the batsman can freely hit one ball with no danger of being out in most ways.|$|E
25|$|Current {{estimates}} {{state that}} 2 million hospital patients {{are affected by}} adverse drug reactions every year and adverse drug events are the fourth leading cause of death. These adverse drug reactions result in an estimated economic cost of $136 billion per year. Polymorphisms (genetic variations) in individuals effect drug metabolism and therefore an individual's response to a medication. Examples <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> genetics may affect an individual’s response to drugs include: drug transporters, metabolism and drug interactions. Pharmacogenetics {{may be used in}} the near future by public health practitioners to determine the best candidates for certain drugs, thereby reducing much of the guesswork in prescribing drugs. Such actions have the potential to improve the effectiveness of treatments and reduce adverse drug events.|$|E

500|$|Lynn Hankinson Nelson {{notes that}} feminist empiricists find {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through {{the examination of the}} experiences of women, and to [...] "uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them" [...] to account for a range of human experience. Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions. Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.|$|E
