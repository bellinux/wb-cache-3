2500|$|Ray Lamphere {{was arrested}} on May 22, 1908, and tried for murder and arson. He denied the charges. His defense hinged on the {{assertion}} that the body was not Gunness'. Lamphere's lawyer, Wirt Worden, developed evidence that contradicted Norton's identification of the teeth and bridgework. A local jeweler testified that, though the gold in the bridgework had emerged from the fire almost undamaged, the fierce heat of the conflagration had melted the gold plating on several watches and items of gold jewelry. Local doctors replicated {{the conditions of the}} fire by attaching a similar piece of dental bridgework to a human jawbone and placing it in a blacksmith’s forge. The real teeth crumbled and disintegrated; the porcelain teeth came out pocked and pitted, with the gold parts rather melted (both the artificial elements were damaged to a greater degree than those in the bridgework offered as evidence of Gunness' identity). The hired hand Joe Maxson and another man also testified that they’d seen [...] "Klondike" [...] Schultz take the bridgework <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> plant it just before it was [...] "discovered." [...] Lamphere was found guilty of arson, but acquitted of murder. On November 26, 1908, he was sentenced to 20 years in the State Prison (in Michigan City). He died of tuberculosis on December 30, 1909.|$|E
