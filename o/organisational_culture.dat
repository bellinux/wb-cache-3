In 2004, The Health Foundation selected four hospitals from across the UK to work on a £4.3 million patient safety improvement programme.

40|$|This paper explores {{whether the}} {{relationship}} between formal control and interorganisational trust within public administration (administrational trust) differs across <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures.</b> It develops a set of hypotheses based on the proposition that <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures</b> moderate {{the relationship between}} formal control and administrational trust because of the divergent focus of different cultures on the institutions of inter-organisational interactions. Our hypotheses are empirically tested using 2012 Korean Civil Service Survey data. The results indicate that formal control does relate differently to administrational trust in different <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures.</b> While it might obstruct trust under an egalitarian culture, we cannot exclude {{that it might be}} a basis for trust under more hierarchical <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures.</b> While this conclusion suggests an valuable orientation for research, further development of measures, methods and data is required to test these hypotheses more adequatelystatus: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Driven by {{the growing}} {{presence}} of market forces within higher education worldwide, universities are changing the way they engage with students. This article explores how a university's internal culture relates to engagement with students and their views. It builds on wider research into student engagement and <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures.</b> The <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures</b> of two universities are mapped against a typology developed by McNay, which was extended by the author to include aspects of institutional engagement with students. It appears that corporate and bureaucratic institutional cultures that may respond well to external pressures on institutions (regulation, performance indicators, audits and policy pressure) are not conducive to engagement with student opinion. The stronger preference of students remains a collegial, partnership-based approach for enhancement of the student experience. This study will {{be of interest to}} institutional managers, student (union) leaders, academics and practitioners who seek to improve the student experience through effective engagement with student views...|$|R

This study was based on two specialist higher education (HE) colleges seeking to expand through merger {{in order to meet}} the revised criteria for university status in England. It sought a better understanding of the similarities and differences between the management styles and <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures</b> of the two colleges and an assessment of the significance of these for the proposed merger. The main conclusion of the study was that management styles and initiatives needed to be mindful of the existing cultures and subcultures of the two colleges, otherwise there was a risk that the status and efficiency of the new HEI might be improved at the expense of its academic and scholarly development...|$|R

40|$|The Health Promoting Schools concept helps {{schools to}} promote health in a {{sustainable}} and long-term fashion. However, developing {{the capacity to}} promote health in this way can be challenging when a busy teaching curriculum must be fulfilled. This study aimed to identify factors which affect the acceptability of health promotion programmes to the everyday school environment. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were audio-taped with primary school teachers in one Irish county and transcribed verbatim. The resulting transcripts were analysed using content analysis. Thirty-one teachers were interviewed. The factors which may adversely affect the acceptability of health promotion programmes include the: attitude of teachers towards an additional extra-curricular workload; lack of confidence amongst teachers to lead health promotion; and different <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures</b> between schools. When health promotion programmes under the Health Promoting Schools concept are being implemented, it’s important to consider: the readiness for change amongst teachers; the resources available to increase staff capacity to promote health; {{and the ability of}} a programme to adapt to the different <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures</b> between schools...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{cultural influences}} on the implementation of water safety plans (WSPs) using case studies from WSP pilots in India, Uganda and Jamaica. A comprehensive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews (n= 150 utility customers, n= 32 WSP ‘implementers’ and n= 9 WSP ‘promoters’), field observations and related documents revealed 12 cultural themes, offered as ‘enabling’, ‘limiting’, or ‘neutral’, that influence WSP implementation in urban water utilities to varying extents. Aspects such as a ‘deliver first, safety later’ mind set; supply system knowledge management and storage practices; and non-compliance are deemed influential. Emergent themes of cultural influence (ET 1 to ET 12) are discussed by reference to the risk management, development studies and institutional culture literatures; by reference to their positive, negative or neutral influence on WSP implementation. The results have implications for the utility endorsement of WSPs, {{for the impact of}} <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures</b> on WSP implementation; for the scale-up of pilot studies; and they support repeated calls from practitioner communities for cultural attentiveness during WSP design. Findings on <b>organisational</b> <b>cultures</b> mirror those from utilities in higher income nations implementing WSPs – leadership, advocacy among promoters and customers (not just implementers) and purposeful knowledge management are critical to WSP success...|$|R
