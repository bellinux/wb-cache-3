5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope.</b> This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to drift, Cofresí and {{his crew}} were {{captured}} after his ship reached Santo Domingo. Sentenced to six years in prison, they were sent to a keep named Torre del Homenaje. Cofresí and his men escaped, were recaptured and again imprisoned. The group escaped again, breaking the locks on their cell doors and climbing down the prison walls on a stormy night <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> made from their clothing. With Cofresí were two other inmates: a man known as Portalatín and Manuel Reyes Paz, former boatswain of El Scipión. After reaching the province of San Pedro de Macorís, the pirates bought a ship. They sailed from Hispaniola in late September to Naguabo, where Portalatín disembarked. From there {{they went to the}} island of Vieques, where they set up another hideout and regrouped.|$|E
5|$|After a mine cart chase {{to escape}} the temple, the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Using a sword, Indy cuts the rope bridge in half, leaving {{everyone}} to hang on for their lives. Indy utters an incantation which causes the stones to glow red hot. Two of the stones fall into the river, while the last falls into Mola Ram's hand, burning his hand. Indy catches the now-cool stone, while Mola Ram falls into the river below and gets devoured by hungry crocodiles. The Thuggees then attempt to shoot Indy with arrows, until a company of British Indian Army riflemen, summoned by the Maharajah, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to the village with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the evening}} Jess becomes {{frustrated}} when he finds that May Belle has drawn in his notebook, but his strict yet caring father (Robert Patrick) sides with her. He later watches them gardening together, disappointed that his father does not spend time with him. Moreover, his mother cherishes her daughter more than him. The next day at school, Leslie compliments Jess' drawing ability, and they soon become friends. After school, they venture {{into the woods and}} swing across a creek <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope.</b> Jess and Leslie find an abandoned tree house on the other side, and invent a new world, which they call Terabithia. The fantasy world, which is a reflection on their lives, comes to life through their eyes as they explore the surroundings. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house getting to know each other.|$|E
5|$|The Duke pursues {{the group}} onto the bridge, setting off mines {{as he tries}} to catch up. With Brain {{navigating}} through the minefield, Snake manages to avoid most of the explosives, but the cab hits a mine and is blown in half, killing Cabbie. As the group flees on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, and {{stands in the middle of}} the road, shooting at the Duke's car until he runs her down, killing her. Snake and the President reach the perimeter wall and the guards raise the President <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope.</b> The Duke opens fire on the wall, killing the guards and forcing Snake to dive for cover, but the President shoots the Duke dead. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives in his neck are neutralized.|$|E

25|$|The B-36 had {{a crew of}} 15. As in the B-29 and B-50, the {{pressurized}} {{flight deck}} and crew compartment were linked to the rear compartment by a pressurized tunnel through the bomb bay. In the B-36, movement through the tunnel was on a wheeled trolley, pulling <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope.</b> The rear compartment featured six bunks and a dining galley, {{and led to the}} tail turret.|$|E

In 1928 there was a railway accident causing 3 fatalities when a train leaving the station slipped to a standstill and rolled back into another train. Modern diesel trains have no difficulty with the climb.|$|E

25|$|Having {{long been}} the poorest part of Spain, Extremadura is a largely rural region known for the Portuguese {{influence}} on its music. As in the northern regions of Spain, there is a rich repertoire for tabor pipe music. The zambomba friction-drum (similar to Portuguese sarronca or Brazilian cuica) is played by pulling <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> which is inside the drum. It is found throughout Spain. The jota is common, here played with triangles, castanets, guitars, tambourines, accordions and zambombas.|$|E

During it, Guybrush also visits Phatt Island, Booty Island, and Dinky Island, voyaging on two different pirate ships.|$|E
25|$|Canopies {{for each}} cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves—a sign of equal dignity. After the new Pope accepts his election, {{he would give}} his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> {{attached}} to their seats to lower their canopies. Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, {{the population of the}} College of Cardinals had increased so much {{to the point that they}} would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row.|$|E

25|$|The {{transport}} then {{approaches a}} dark area and stops. Indiana Jones suddenly appears above the vehicle hanging <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> in {{a shaft of}} light. He welcomes the adventurers' rescue and bids them {{to turn on the}} headlights and prepare for him to board. As the lights flicker on, they illuminate a massive boulder rolling toward the transport. The transport seems to back up as the boulder threatens to crush Jones and the tourists. At the last possible second, the transport accelerates and suddenly the floor seems to give way, sending the transport into the chamber below. An impact resonates through the chamber, as if the boulder has crashed down, nearly striking the transport.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{research}} on the social loafing effect began in 1913 with Max Ringelmann's study. He found that when he asked {{a group of men}} to pull <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope,</b> that they did not pull as hard collectively as they did when each was pulling alone. This research did not distinguish whether this {{was the result of the}} individuals in a group putting in less effort or of poor coordination within the group. In 1974, Alan Ingham, James Graves, and colleagues replicated Ringelmann's experiment using two types of group: 1) Groups with real participants in groups of various sizes (consistent with Ringelmann's setup) or 2) Pseudo-groups with only one real participant. In the pseudo-groups, the researchers' assistants only pretended to pull on the rope.|$|E
25|$|Technically, bells rung in the Russian {{tradition}} are sounded {{exclusively by}} chiming (i.e., moving only the clapper {{so that it}} strikes {{the side of a}} stationary bell) and never by swinging the bell. For the Russian tradition a special complex system of ropes is used, designed individually for each belltower. All the ropes are gathered at approximately one point, where the bell-ringer (zvonar) stands. Some ropes (the smaller ones) are played by hand, the bigger ropes are played by foot. The major part of the ropes (usually - all ropes) are not actually pulled, but rather pressed. Since one end of every rope is fixed, and the ropes are kept in tension, a press or even a punch <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> makes a clapper strike the side of its bell.|$|E
