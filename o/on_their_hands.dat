5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} chalk <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> {{to absorb}} sweat. It {{is stored in}} a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more {{members of the new}} race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, {{but this time the}} winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E
25|$|Players {{are allowed}} only 30 seconds to act <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> At {{the start of}} the tournament, each player is given three {{extensions}} of 30 seconds each for use during the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Skins may be shaved {{prior to}} {{mounting}} or afterwards, {{or may be}} de-haired by liming. Liming weakens skins; some djembefolas also claim that limed skins are harder <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and do not sound as good as untreated skins.|$|E

25|$|The League {{offered little}} respite, with a fight against relegation <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> With only three games remaining, Blackpool's fate {{appeared}} sealed, but a 6–1 victory at Manchester City, with Bill Perry scoring a hat-trick, went {{a long way}} to sparing them, and First Division football was ensured for another campaign.|$|E
25|$|Mitsuha {{wakes up}} in Taki's body at the shrine. Although they sense each other's presence, they are {{separated}} by three years. However, when twilight falls, they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write each other's names <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{emphasis}} was put on toys that had an educational purpose to them, such as puzzles, books, cards and board games. Religiously themed toys were also popular, including a model Noah's Ark with miniature animals and objects from other Bible scenes. With growing prosperity among the middle class, children had more leisure time <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> {{which led to the}} application of industrial methods to the manufacture of toys.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Coast Air terminated their flights, but {{stated that}} they still had an agreement with Vildanden. Skien Lufttransport <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> stated that Vildanden was now a sleeping company, and that the contract therefore was terminated. Both companies considered the incident a legal matter. In December, the two companies settled outside court.|$|R
5000|$|For All (2012) - SS+K {{developed}} a second campaign in 2012 called [...] "For All" [...] that included video, social media and print ads.

60|$|They had no {{difficulty}} in arranging with the landlord for a horse, {{which was to}} be left in a stable he named in town.

25|$|On {{the first}} day of the committal proceedings, Terence testified that they were usually given three slices of bread and butter each per day, and that and tea was their only sustenance. They stole {{whatever}} they could from the pantry to supplement this. Dennis would suck milk from the teats of the farm cows. Every night both boys were given a severe thrashing <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and/or legs, sometimes up to 100 blows each.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} cricket {{in the mid}} and late 19th century was {{assisted}} {{by the development of}} the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had time <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> and encouraged the locals so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.|$|E
25|$|One of Sultan Ali Yusuf's commanders, Omar Samatar, {{attacked}} and captured El Buur on 9 November 1925. The local populace sided with Omar, and soon enough the Italians had a full-scale revolution <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> after Omar followed up his previous {{success with the}} capture of El-Dhere. The Corpo Zaptié {{tried and failed to}} recapture El-Bur from Omar. By 15 November the Italians had fled to Bud Bud, ambushed by partisans the whole way and rather diminished in forces and resolve.|$|E

25|$|Catcher's Mitt: Catchers use mitts {{with extra}} padding {{to lower the}} impact of the ball <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand.</b> The catcher is the only player on the field who is allowed to use this type of mitt. (The first baseman also wears a mitt instead of a glove, but it is longer and not as heavily padded as a catcher's mitt.) See Catcher's mitt.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{reason for}} the use of hand-for-hand play is to prevent players from stalling, or {{deliberately}} taking as long as possible to act <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> in the hope of moving up in the prize structure when players at other tables bust out. By ensuring that each table plays the same number of hands, the incentive to stall is removed.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the First World War, in {{this war}} the Canadian Army mobilized its territorially {{recruited}} militia units as a body rather than soliciting individuals to serve in conglomerated units. Men of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (colloquially known as the Rileys) {{and the rest of}} the 2nd Canadian Division were mobilized early, but sat <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> in Britain for two years. The Hamilton area was also active in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF): the city proper sponsored 424 “Tiger” Squadron by buying bombers to equip it.|$|E
25|$|Boxing gloves are {{cushioned}} gloves that fighters wear <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> during boxing {{matches and}} practices. Unlike the ancient cestus which were {{designed as a}} weapon, modern boxing gloves are {{designed to protect the}} fighter's hand during a bout, though competitions, sparring and other forms of training have their own specialized gloves. Modern boxing gloves reduce superficial facial injuries; however, as modern boxing gloves give their user the ability to throw stronger punches to head without damaging the hands, they also increase the risk of brain damage for participants.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds {{of slaves}} {{stood on the}} shore and, when the small boats put out to get them, they all wanted to get in at once. After the boats were filled to {{capacity}} and beyond, the throng of escaping slaves still ashore {{held on to the}} boats to prevent them from leaving, putting the boats in danger of capsizing. Oarsmen tried beating them <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> but the slaves would not let go. The small boats made several trips back and forth to load those who wanted to leave.|$|E
5000|$|... in Hindu religion, mauli {{has a very}} {{important}} role. It is the most sacred element in the auspicious occasions in India. It is the main thing in the poja thali. mauli or Kalava is normally used in pujan samagri. Mauli offered to the gods is later given along with prasadam (consecrated temple food) to be worn by people <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} tactile discrimination performance under various active and passive conditions and {{explore the influence of}} visual information. Participants had to discriminate the direction of lateral pin strokes <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fingertip under three conditions. In one condition (static) only tactile stimulation was provided. In a second condition (active) the shear force device was mounted on a kinesthetic feedback device so that tactile stimulation was accompanied by active arm movements. In a third condition (passive) the arm was moved passively using the kinesthetic device while subjects performed the discrimination task. In this first experiment vision was not controlled. Therefore, {{to investigate}} the influence of vision on tactile discrimination performance participants had to perform the tactile discrimination task in the active condition with either direct gaze <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand,</b> gaze <b>on</b> a live image of <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> or without sight of <b>their</b> <b>hand.</b> Results show that tactile discriminatio n performance was higher in the static compared to the active condition. Moreover, participants performed better when they were gazing <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> compared to the no-sight condition. We conclude that active movement impairs tactile discrimination performance. However visual spatial attention can compensate to some degree for this loss of tactile sensibility...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the release}} of the group's fourth mini-album back in South Korea, a Korean version of the single was used as the title track for the album. The music video {{is the same as the}} Japanese version but {{contains}} slightly altered scenes including individual scenes where the group members are seen sitting in a black and white bedroom with a cell-phone <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{films from}} the Shemp era {{contrast}} sharply {{with those from}} the Curly era, largely owing to the individual directing styles of Bernds and White. From 1947 to 1952, Bernds hit a string of successes, including Fright Night (1947), The Hot Scots, Mummy's Dummies, Crime <b>on</b> <b>Their</b> <b>Hands</b> (all 1948), A Snitch in Time (1950), Three Arabian Nuts (1951) and Gents in a Jam (1952). Two of the team's finest efforts were directed by Bernds: Brideless Groom (1947) and Who Done It? (1949). White also contributed a few fair entries, such as Hold That Lion! (1947), Hokus Pokus (1949), Scrambled Brains (1951), A Missed Fortune and Corny Casanovas (both 1952).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, henna is an {{important}} part of Somali culture. It is worn by Somali women <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> arms, feet and neck during wedding ceremonies, Eid, Ramadan and other festive occasions. Somali henna designs are similar to those in the Arabian peninsula, often featuring flower motifs and triangular shapes. The palm is also frequently decorated with a dot of henna and the fingertips are dipped in the dye. Henna parties are usually held before the wedding takes place. Somali women have likewise traditionally applied kohl (kuul) to their eyes. Usage of the eye cosmetic in the Horn region is believed to date to the ancient Land of Punt.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} blast, the {{soldiers}} {{said they were}} targeted by sniper fire, coming from woods {{on the other side}} of the border. The soldiers began firing back across the water. An uninvolved civilian Englishman, William Hudson, was killed by the soldiers' gunfire and his cousin Barry Hudson wounded. They had been birdwatching on an island opposite the castle. According to Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) researchers, the soldiers may have mistaken the sound of ammunition going off for enemy gunfire. However, two IRA members arrested by the Gardaí and suspected of being behind the ambush, Brendan Burns and Joe Brennan, had traces of gunsmoke residue <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and the motorbike they were riding on.|$|E
