50|$|Salt was {{discovered}} in Reno County by Benjamin Blanchard on September 26, 1887. This {{gave rise to the}} first salt-processing plants west of the Mississippi River. Salt was originally extracted using the evaporation method by pumping water into brine wells. In 1923, the Carey Salt Company opened the <b>only</b> <b>salt</b> <b>mine</b> in Hutchinson, which then produced rock <b>salt.</b> That <b>mine</b> is still in use today and is now operated by Hutchinson Salt Company. Cargill and Morton Salt also have evaporative salt plants in Hutchinson.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{industrial}} mining and new drilling techniques made the discovery of more and deeper deposits possible, increasing <b>mine</b> <b>salt's</b> share of the market. Although <b>mining</b> <b>salt</b> was generally more expensive than extracting it from brine via solar evaporation of seawater, the introduction of this new source reduced the price of salt due to a reduction of monopolization. Extraction of salt from brine is still heavily used, for example, vacuum salt produced by British Salt in Middlewich has 57% of the UK market for salt used in cooking.|$|R
