5|$|Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Holroyd was {{assigned}} the number nine shirt following {{the departure of}} fellow striker Scott Rendell. He started the club's first match of the season, playing the whole game in a 2–0 home defeat to Barrow. Three days later, he scored twice in Cambridge's 3–1 win against Ebbsfleet United, scoring both goals. Holroyd scored his first professional hat-trick four days later, scoring against his former employers, Chester City, as Cambridge came from two goals down to win the match 4–2. One of his goals included an audacious <b>over</b> <b>head</b> kick, 15 yards from goal. Holroyd scored four goals in two games shortly after, netting against Gateshead and Forest Green Rovers respectively. He scored a further two goals in Cambridge's 4–3 home loss to Luton Town in September 2009, taking his goal tally to eleven for the season. His twelfth goal of the season came against Cambridge's local rivals, Histon, Holroyd netting with just nine minutes remaining in a 1–1 draw. A week later, he scored from the penalty spot in Cambridge's 4–0 win against Ebbsfleet United. His fine goalscoring form continued into November 2009, scoring in victories against Kidderminster Harriers and Ilkeston Town respectively. After his goal against Ilkeston Town, Holroyd did not find the net {{until the end of}} December 2009, scoring just before half-time for Cambridge as they lost 2–1 at Mansfield Town. A week later, Cambridge United assistant manager, Paul Carden, said that he expected Holroyd to leave the club in the January transfer window. He subsequently played his last game for the club in Cambridge's 1–0 home defeat to Eastbourne Borough. During {{the first half of the}} 2009–10 season, Holroyd scored 15 goals in 25 games for Cambridge.|$|E

25|$|If the bowler bowls a {{ball that}} bounces and passes the batsman above head height. In some {{competitions}} the Laws of Cricket are modified by a playing regulation that any ball <b>over</b> <b>head</b> height is a Wide ball, but a second fast ball above shoulder height in an over is a No ball, e.g. in International T20 Cricket and IPLT20. But in International One-Day Cricket and in Test Cricket, TWO fast pitched short balls per over may pass over shoulder height before No ball is called, and again any ball <b>over</b> <b>head</b> height is a Wide. Thus competition rules may both {{tone down the}} definition of 'dangerous and unfair' (a Wide is a lesser sanction than a No ball, and cannot be applied if the batsman hits, or is hit by, the delivery) and put definite limits on repetition, intended not only to protect the batsman but also to maintain a fair contest between bat and ball, preventing such bowling being used to limit the batsman's ability to score. There is presently some difference of opinion between the authorities that {{is evident in the}} differences between Law and regulation.|$|E

The overhead system is further separated into 100 sections, this is done for two reasons, one is to maintain voltage and current across the network, and two is to isolate disruptions when issues relating to the electrical transmission system occur. The most common disturbances to the supply system are over height vehicles, falling tree limbs, damaged poles, and fires nearby to overhead wires.|$|E

Flies such as the Musca, Stomoxys and Haematobia species have larval habitats amongst livestock dung and soiled bedding found around livestock farms. There is scope for reducing fly infestation by clearing these wastes to composting containers or areas.

Stark is annoyed {{that they are}} losing, when Lord Azlok storms in and tries to get the truth of where the Doctor is. The Doctor and Seruba have escaped the vault and drive a Jeep to the base, where they see that it's under heavy attack. The Doctor is worried about getting in until Jimmy and Cassie show up with the TARDIS. The TARDIS materialises in the room in Area 51 where Rivesh is dying. In the nick of time, Seruba revives Rivesh. The Doctor asks for the device to be {{activated}} and Rivesh relishes the thought of killing the Viperox. However, the Doctor warns him not to detonate it, or it will completely wipe the Viperox out. Rivesh remains adamant on revenge, but the Doctor reinstates his beliefs and tells him that no-one should {{have the power to}} exterminate an entire species. Rivesh returns the favour of his revival and trusts the Doctor with the device. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on it and then he rushes into the TARDIS and grabs a cable. At that moment, Azlok holds Jimmy hostage {{at the entrance to the}} TARDIS, threatening to kill him if the Doctor detonates it. The Doctor says he isn't going to set it off and explains that one day the Viperox will become a peace-loving race. Azlok dismisses this as madness and advances, but the Doctor connects a cable from the TARDIS console to the device and unleashes a deafening soundwave that affects all the Viperox in the area: the Doctor then orders the Viperox to leave Earth and never return. A furious Azlok vows that the Doctor's time will come, though the Doctor dismisses the warning of his impending death, before Azlok and the rest of the Viperox retreat and flee from Earth. After the attack, Stark thanks the Doctor and Seruba and Rivesh leave in their ship. The Doctor leaves the weapon with Stark in case the Viperox ever return, and Stark warns them to keep quiet about the events. The Doctor suggests that Cassie and Jimmy clear up the Viperox mess.

Early drafts of the tracks [...] "Obvious Bicycle" [...] and [...] "Worship You" [...] were produced at OK Go frontman, Damian Kulash's old house in Chicago, before being taken to an official studio to work on. Batmanglij and Ariel Rechtshaid, the album's co-producer, used a pair of mirrored solid state MacBooks with UAD-2 Satellite Firewire Cards so they could take their recordings anywhere and work on them from separate locations with maximum ease. The band credits Vox Studios with the defining special quality of the recordings, especially {{the use of their}} vintage analog tape machines, with Batmanglij remarking, [...] "Much of the overall sound and approach to the album was being able to record the drums to tape on an old Ampex machine." [...] The group wanted a unique drum sound, and so they recorded in a room with high ceilings and had engineer David Schiffman use a [...] "pretty non-conventional drum miking setup" [...] in which a pair of Neumann U 47s were used as <b>over</b> <b>head</b> mics with RCA 77dx ribbon mics between the Neumanns and the drum kit for added texture.
