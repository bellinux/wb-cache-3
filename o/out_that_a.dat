5|$|Though Clark {{converted}} Du Tertre's tail measurement to 18 in (45.7cm), Lenoble pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> 17th-century French foot {{unit was}} {{slightly larger than}} the English equivalent, and the measurement should rather be converted to 19.3 in (49cm), indicating a smaller size difference between the Lesser Antillean macaw and the scarlet macaw.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaur teeth could crush bone, and {{therefore}} could extract as much food (bone marrow) {{as possible from}} carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. Karen Chin and colleagues have found bone fragments in coprolites (fossilized feces) that they attribute to tyrannosaurs, but point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> tyrannosaur's teeth were not well adapted to systematically chewing bone like hyenas do to extract marrow.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} {{electron configuration}} for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, {{when it was}} pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the Fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration 5f1.|$|E

5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah {{was seen as the}} driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{reality was}} very different. Lody's body {{was buried in}} an unmarked common grave in the East London Cemetery in Plaistow along with {{seventeen}} other men– ten executed spies and seven prisoners who died of ill-health or accidents. It was not until 1924 that the grave received a marker, at the instigation of the German Embassy. Lody's relatives were visiting it once a year and enquired whether his body could be exhumed and buried in a private grave. The War Office agreed, providing that the body could be identified, but the Foreign Office was more reluctant and pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> licence for exhumation {{would have to be}} authorised by the Home Office. The Lody family placed a white headstone and kerb on the grave some time around 1934.|$|E
5|$|Warren and her {{daughter}} Amelia Tyagi wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. Warren and Tyagi point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is that even with two income earners, families are {{no longer able to}} save and have incurred greater and greater debt.|$|E

5|$|Written by Lewis Greifer, {{this story}} was {{commissioned}} in July 1974. The story would involve museum keepers being chased out of the British Museum by a mummy. It would turn <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> group was scaring people away {{in order to gain}} access to a sarcophagus which would contain wild rice from thousands of years ago. The group wanted to use the rice to seed Mars and make a fortune. It was replaced by Robert Holmes' Pyramids of Mars when Griefer fell ill and the scripts came in late and were not what the production team wanted.|$|E
5|$|A while later, Bluepaw {{receives}} her warrior name, Bluefur, and Bluepaw receives hers, Bluefur. Bluefur finds <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Clanmate, Thrushpelt, is in {{love with}} her, but she dismisses it, deciding that she is too young to have a mate. However, Snowfur wants a Clanmate named Thistlepaw as a mate. A few moons later, Pinestar announces that he wants no more of the warrior life and goes off to live his last life as a housecat. Sunfall becomes Sunstar and Tawnyspots becomes the new deputy. On a patrol to RiverClan, Bluefur is pulled aside by Oakheart, who tells her to meet him that night at Fourtrees. She does, and the two warriors spend the night together, having fallen in love. About a month later, Tawnyspots falls ill with an incurable illness, so he is unable to be deputy for much longer. Thistlepaw, now Thistleclaw, wishes to become deputy in his place. Bluefur discovers that she is pregnant with Oakheart's kits. ThunderClan believes her kits are with Thrushpelt and are overjoyed. After Goosefeather convinces her that she must become deputy, and not Thistleclaw due to his violence and ambition, Bluefur reluctantly brings her three kits (Mosskit, Mistykit, and Stonekit), to RiverClan to live as RiverClan cats. Mosskit dies along the way. Bluefur then convinces ThunderClan that a fox or other creature took her kits. Once Featherwhisker deems Tawnyspots incurable and unfit for deputyship, Sunstar appoints Bluefur as the new deputy. After Sunstar dies, Bluefur becomes Bluestar and receives nine lives. Thistleclaw is outraged by this and continues to be bitter towards Bluestar until he was killed later on.|$|E
5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E

5|$|During {{his stay}} in Devagiri, Shiva comes {{to know of}} the treacherous wars that the Chandravanshis are {{carrying}} on the Meluhans. He also meets Brahaspati, the Chief Inventor of the Meluhans. Brahaspati invites Shiva and the royal family on an expedition to Mount Mandar, where the legendary Somras is manufactured using {{the waters of the}} Saraswati river. Shiva learns that the potion which made his throat turn blue was actually undiluted Somras, which can be lethal when taken in its pure form. However, Shiva was unaffected, which was the first sign that he was the Neelkanth. He also learns that Somras was the reason why the Meluhans lived for so many years. Brahaspati and Shiva develop a close friendship and the royal family returns to Devagiri. One morning, the whole of Meluha wakes up to loud noises coming from Mount Mandar. Shiva and his troops reach the hill to find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> large part of Mandar has been blasted off and many of the inventors killed. There is no sign of Brahaspati, but Shiva finds the insignia of the Nagas, confirming their involvement in the treacherous wars of the Chandravanshis.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E

5|$|Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has {{suggested}} that Tyrannosaurus may have been pack animals. Currie compared Tyrannosaurus rex favorably to related species Tarbosaurus bataar and Albertosaurus sarcophagus, fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used {{to suggest that they}} lived in packs. Currie pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> find in South Dakota preserved three Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons in close proximity to each other. After using CT scanning, Currie stated that Tyrannosaurus would have been capable of such complex behavior, because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size. Currie elaborated that Tyrannosaurus had a larger brain-to-body-size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops of the same size. Currie believed Tyrannosaurus to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for Tyrannosaurus to hunt in groups. Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together, with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill, by analogy to modern-day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill.|$|E
