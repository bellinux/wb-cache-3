Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing.

40|$|Lightning {{interferences}} in the Distribution {{lines is}} a major problem in CEB network. A significant number of substation failures are reported due to lightning. These failures occurred due to <b>over</b> <b>voltages</b> in the distribution line and it is impossible to prevent. These <b>over</b> <b>voltages</b> lead to a failure in the insulation of the transformer. Selecting transformers having high insulating level will increase the costs and volume of it. Therefore to decrease insulation levels and its cost, it is necessary to control <b>over</b> <b>voltages</b> and let them to earth by means of arresters. Performance of the arrester depends on the impulse resistance of the earth electrode, lead wire length and the substation installation. It is not necessary for earthing resistance of earth electrode to be of same value for all locations. It depends on the lightning level of each location. The Ground Flash Density in the area is an important parameter to decide the maximum lightning current experienced during the life time of the equipment and the required failure rate. This dissertation discusses the <b>over</b> <b>voltages</b> due to lightning and its danger to Distribution Substation. The effect of arrester earthing resistance, Lead wire length, Substation configuration and medium voltage line arrangements at the substation in the CEB distribution Network are also studied for this investigation. Digital simulation has a very important role on predicting the lightning performance of the distribution substation and distribution lines. PSCAD software is used for transient modeling of a three phase distribution line, substation and arrester for analyzing their performance during lightning.

50|$|Arcing horns {{are not to}} be {{confused}} with grading rings, which are ring shaped conductors surrounding the high potential end of an insulator string on some high voltage transmission lines, attached to the line. The purpose of grading rings is not to provide a spark gap but to even out the potential gradient across the string. The electric field across a string of insulators is not distributed evenly along the string but is concentrated at the ends, so with an <b>over</b> <b>voltage</b> the end insulator units will break down first. By distributing the electric field more evenly, grading rings increase the breakdown voltage of the string. However, sometimes grading rings have a secondary usage as arcing terminals, combined with arcing horns on the ground side of the insulator.|$|E
50|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the {{vacuum circuit breaker}} can force the current in the circuit to zero, before the natural zero and reversal of current in the alternating current circuit. Additionally, if the timing of interrupter operation is unfavorable {{with respect to the}} ac voltage waveform, when the arc has extinguished but the contacts are still moving and ionization has not yet dissipated in the interrupter, the applied voltage may exceed the withstand voltage of the gap. This can cause reignition of the arc and abrupt transient currents. In either of these cases, oscillations are introduced in the system, and may result in significant overvoltage. Manufacturers of vacuum interrupters address these concerns by selection of contact materials and contact designs selected to minimize current chopping.
