5|$|Garrison {{applied for}} an {{emergency}} security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted during the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing,</b> which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing,</b> Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.|$|E
5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to {{his opposition to the}} hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed the character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing,</b> by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser.|$|E

5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hearing</b> Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E
5|$|The {{hearing was}} held at a {{temporary}} building near the Washington Monument housing offices of the AEC. It began on April 12, 1954, and lasted four weeks. The AEC was represented by Roger Robb, an experienced prosecutor in Washington, and Arthur Rolander, while Oppenheimer's legal team was headed by Lloyd K. Garrison, a prominent New York attorney. The chairman of the Personnel Security Board was Gordon Gray, president of the University of North Carolina. The other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> panel were Thomas Alfred Morgan, a retired industrialist, and Ward V. Evans, chairman of the chemistry department at Northwestern University.|$|E

5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case.

This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the fairness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} part of their trial she {{remained}} calm, complaining through her lawyers alleged disrespect for the flag while it was being produced as evidence. She loudly protested when the defense suggested that the group might have suffered from mental instability while committing the deed. On June 16, 1954, the jury found all four defendants guilty. On the morning of July 8, 1954, Lebrón learned of her son's death minutes before the sentence was to be announced. She was quiet at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing,</b> but at one point, unable to contain herself, she became hysterical. Rover demanded the death penalty, but Holtzoff chose to sentence them to the longest terms of imprisonment possible. In Lebrón's case this was between sixteen and fifty years, depending on her behavior.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, a {{moderate}} Republican, Daniel Henry Chamberlain, was elected South Carolina's governor, attracting even some Democratic votes. When Chamberlain sought re-election in 1876, Gary recruited Wade HamptonIII, a Confederate war hero {{who had moved}} out of state, to return and run for governor as a Democrat. That election campaign of 1876 was marked by violence, of which the most notorious occurrence was {{what became known as}} the Hamburg massacre. It occurred in Hamburg, South Carolina, a mostly black town across the river from Augusta, in Aiken County, bordering Edgefield County. The incident grew out of a confrontation on July 4 when a black militia marched in Hamburg and two white farmers in a buggy tried to ride through its ranks. Both sides filed criminal charges against the other, and dozens of armed out-of-uniform Red Shirts, led by Butler, traveled to Hamburg on the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing,</b> July 8. Tillman was present, and the subsequent events were among his proudest memories.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, on 18 July 2008, Evra was charged with four {{separate}} counts of improper conduct by the FA. The charges were related to an incident that occurred during the 2007–08 season when Evra had an altercation with a Chelsea groundsman during a warm-down following a match on 26 April. The defender denied the charges and was supported by several members of the club's staff, who commented that the player was racially abused by the groundsman prior to the confrontation. Evra remained free to play for United up to the date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> despite the charges being made in July 2008. He began the campaign in similar fashion to last season as Manchester United won the Community Shield following the team's 3–0 victory over Portsmouth on penalties. Evra was ever-present in Manchester United's first 22 competitive matches of the season, starting 19 of them. At the hearing on 5 December, Evra was found guilty of improper conduct, and handed a four-match ban – due to start on 22 December 2008 – and a £15,000 fine.|$|E

40|$|Irony is {{understood}} by utilizing contextual information, but {{the relation between}} <b>the</b> different kinds <b>of</b> contextual information and their effects has not been examined thoroughly. This study proposed a model from the Relevance Theory view that <b>the</b> utilization <b>of</b> contextual information promotes <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> irony. Three kinds of contextual information, that is, positive norm, the explicit preceding utterance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearer,</b> and controllability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearer,</b> were studied to examine their effects on the appropriateness and attitudes implicit in <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> irony. Thirty-one college women {{were asked to respond}} to a questionnaire which included <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story. The results showed that the contextual information types <b>of</b> explicit preceding <b>the</b> utterance and controllability specifically promoted <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> negative attitudes. These are types of contextual information which are concerned with <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> Thus <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> becomes <b>the</b> victim <b>of</b> irony, and negative attitudes are emphasized. These effects were salient in positive irony, which implicates negative attitudes. In order to clarify the way contextual information is used in <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> irony, it is necessary to investigate the different kinds and features of contextual information...|$|R

40|$|The Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) arose as a {{recommendation}} {{from the final}} Burgess report ‘Beyond the Honours Degree Classification’ and was first implemented in 2012 - 2013, with wide spread roll out continuing across the UK HEI sector. <b>The</b> <b>HEAR</b> includes a range of University validated activities - with an underpinning focus on employability, therefore the main risk to the Department/ HEI if <b>the</b> <b>HEAR</b> is not effectively implemented is an impact on <b>the</b> employability <b>of</b> their students.
