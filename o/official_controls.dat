40|$|The {{expectations}} of <b>official</b> <b>control</b> are high, and resources are limited. What {{is most important}} in conducting such control? How can we prioritise between risks which are not directly comparable? Which approach provides most safety, relative to resource allocation? Risk categorisation is a tool to make such assessments more explicit, fact-based and transparent. The quality of risk management can never {{be better than the}} available knowledge of the risks. Prioritisation of <b>official</b> <b>control</b> must be based on knowledge available at any given time, and {{not on the basis of}} knowledge that is being worked towards obtaining in the future. The report presents a new model that incorporates the following knowledge types into a system, with a view to improving resource use in <b>official</b> <b>control.</b> - Knowledge of the life-cycles of products, processes and services, - Knowledge of the products, processes and services of different industries, - Knowledge of the individual traders. The model has been developed for prioritising control of the various risks in the food chain, but could also be suitable, and used for, prioritising of control of other risk types...|$|R

50|$|A game lasts thirty-six minutes, and {{is split}} up into three twelve-minute periods.

A separate timekeeping <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> the official game clock, which is stopped for stoppages in play, and typically counts down to zero, as in North American sports such as basketball and ice hockey. Every beach soccer match is won by one team, with the game going into three minutes of extra time, followed by a penalty shootout if the score is still on level terms after normal time. Unlike football, penalty kicks are decided by sudden death rules.|$|E

Assessment on procedures on GMP, GHP and HACCP were followed by a specific valuation of food handlers training based on a questionnaire.
