50|$|Ports are {{openings}} in the manifold or distribution system where the inlet and outlet connections are produced. Each opening is either an inlet (supply) port or an <b>outlet</b> <b>port.</b> The number of each corresponds {{to the requirements of}} the application.The quantity of supply ports specifies the number of independent fluid supplies that could be interfaced with the manifold or manifold system.|$|E
50|$|The {{pin index}} safety system uses a face seal between the {{cylinder}} valve {{and the associated}} yoke clamp. There are two holes in specific positions on the cylinder valve body below the <b>outlet</b> <b>port</b> , in positions associated with the gas mixture, which prevent connection of the cylinder to a yoke or pressure regulator with a mis-matched set of pins. The holes accept pins 4 mm diameter by 6 mm long which are correctly aligned with the holes.|$|E
30|$|To {{understand}} {{the generation of}} noise from different sources in the axial piston pump, it is desirable to identify the factors contributing to the generation of flow ripples in the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>ports</b> and the fluctuation of the swash plate moment.|$|R

Valve ball contains central channel through which fluid could flow. Made of highly magnetically permeable steel. When appropriate coil(s) energized by brief pulse (or pulses) of electrical current at appropriate polarity, ball rotates clockwise until permanent magnets {{come to rest}} against hard stops in housing, and inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>ports</b> aligned with central channel so fluid flows through valve. Magnets adhere to stops by magnetic attraction, latching valve in open position.

50|$|A Thorpe tube {{flowmeter}} is {{an instrument}} used to directly measure the flow rate {{of a gas}} in medical instruments. It consists of a connection to a gas source, a needle valve opened and closed by turning an attached dial for control of flow rate, a float resting in a clear tapered tube, and an <b>outlet</b> <b>port.</b> It is primarily used in health care institutions during delivery of medical gases, often {{in conjunction with other}} devices such as pressure gauges or pressure reducing valves.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of LEGO Pneumatics ran from 1984 through 1988. This generation is characterised by single port pneumatic cylinders and the more complex plumbing including a three port distribution block with a pressure and vacuum <b>outlet</b> <b>port.</b> These pressure and vacuum lines ran to a switch to provide pressure for extension or vacuum for retraction of the pneumatic cylinders. These are often falsely compared to single acting hydraulic cylinders that require gravity to retract. The difference is that these units retract on the application of vacuum.|$|E
50|$|A typical parallel-plate flow chamber {{consists}} of a polycarbonate distributor, a silicon gasket, and a glass coverslip. The distributor, forming {{one side of the}} parallel-plate flow chamber, includes inlet port, <b>outlet</b> <b>port,</b> and a vacuum slot. The thickness of the gasket determines the height of the flow path. The glass coverslip forms another side of the parallel-plate flow chamber and can be coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, vascular cells, or biomaterials of interest. A vacuum forms a seal to hold these three parts and ensures a uniform channel height.|$|E
50|$|A {{solenoid valve}} is an electromechanically {{operated}} valve. The valve {{is controlled by}} an electric current through a solenoid: {{in the case of}} a two-port valve the flow is switched on or off; {{in the case of a}} three-port valve, the outflow is switched between the two <b>outlet</b> <b>ports.</b> Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a manifold.|$|R
50|$|Generation I {{covers the}} commercially {{available}} mechanical systems {{associated with the}} fluid handling components. Generation I has adopted the ANSI/ISA SP76.00.2002 miniature, modular mechanical standard. This standard precisely defines inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>ports</b> and overall dimensions which allow Lego-like interchangeability of components, between different manufacturers. The ANSI/ISA standard is referenced by the International Electrotechnical Commission in publication IEC 62339-1:2006.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the storage}} tank model (type 340) cannot have a lance with one port or {{have an open}} loop with 2 lances, (as the mass flow in a lance should be {{constant}} as inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>ports)</b> there is a modification in the space load, gas boiler and DHW lances which are used for the Sailer’s Hybrid Quattro and in the simulation.|$|R
50|$|Gear meters {{differ from}} oval gear meters {{in that the}} {{measurement}} chambers {{are made up of}} the gaps between the teeth of the gears. These openings divide up the fluid stream and as the gears rotate away from the inlet port, the meter's inner wall closes off the chamber to hold the fixed amount of fluid. The <b>outlet</b> <b>port</b> is located in the area where the gears are coming back together. The fluid is forced out of the meter as the gear teeth mesh and reduce the available pockets to nearly zero volume.|$|E
50|$|All {{mass flow}} {{controllers}} have an inlet port, an <b>outlet</b> <b>port,</b> a {{mass flow sensor}} and a proportional control valve. The MFC is fitted with a closed loop control system which is given an input signal by the operator (or an external circuit/computer) that it compares to the value from the mass flow sensor and adjusts the proportional valve accordingly to achieve the required flow. The flow rate is specified {{as a percentage of}} its calibrated full scale flow and is supplied to the MFC as a voltage signal.|$|E
50|$|Postcosecha silos are {{galvanized}} steel silos. Bulk {{products such as}} maize, beans, sorghum, rice, wheat, barley, as well as seeds {{can be stored in}} silos. Products must be dried to or below 14% moisture content before being placed in silos to prevent fungi growth. These silos are usually built locally with simple tools, making them easy to assemble, and are sold from local craftsman to the locals called artisans. The silo's have a small <b>outlet</b> <b>port</b> {{at the base of the}} silo so small amounts of grain can be taken out at a time.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{a volume}} of fluid (VOF) model was {{employed}} for microfluidic switch design. The VOF model validity in predicting the interface between fluid streams with different viscosities co-flowing in a microchannel was first verified by experimental observation. It was then extended to microfluidic flow switch design. Two specific flow switches, one with a guided fluid to one of five desired <b>outlet</b> <b>ports,</b> and another with a guided fluid flows into one, two, or three <b>outlet</b> <b>ports</b> equally distributed along the outlet channel of a Y-shaped channel. The flow switching was achieved by controlling the flow rate ratios between tested and buffer fluids. The numerical {{results showed that the}} VOF model could successfully predict the flow switching phenomena in these flow switches. The numerical results also showed that the flow rate ratio required for flow switching depends on the viscosity ratio between the tested and buffer fluids. The numerical simulation was verified by experimental study and the agreement was good...|$|R
5000|$|If {{bleeding}} brakes {{because of}} master cylinder replacement the master cylinder is usually [...] "bench bled" [...] before installation.

50|$|The female <b>outlet</b> <b>port</b> for the Ohio system {{consists}} of a disk with slots placed at positions unique to each specific gas. After insertion, male strikers may be disengaged by twisting the inlet so as to activate a spring-release mechanism. The flat outlet ports ensure no injury if a patient or health-care worker should fall into the wall; a consideration when dealing with the mentally ill or those with neuro- or musculodegenerative disorders. However, the twisting of the disengage mechanism may result in the tangling of wires or other equipment in crowded areas.|$|E
5000|$|Compressed air {{enters the}} inlet port and passes over a needle valve orifice {{attached}} to a pick-up tube. This tube - often equipped with a sintered bronze filter - is submerged into a reservoir bowl filled with light machine oil. Oil is pulled up by the venturi effect, and emitted as an aerosol at the <b>outlet</b> <b>port.</b> The needle valve is typically situated within a clear polycarbonate or nylon housing to aid in oil flow rate adjustment.Some compressor oils and external chemicals can cause polycarbonate and/or nylon sight glass to be degraded and create a safety hazard ...|$|E
50|$|Station Outlets {{consist of}} an <b>outlet</b> <b>port</b> with colour-coded {{faceplate}} {{attached to a}} medical gas supply line, and primary and secondary check valves which open and close automatically upon use and disengagement from the system. Station Outlets are typically equipped with safety systems that prevent cross-connection errors, such as connecting a Medical air flowmeter to an Oxygen port. Hospitals mainly use DISS connections, though {{a wide variety of}} quick-connect adapters, based on male strikers and female outlet ports, are still in use today. These latter types are easier to connect, but are more prone to leaks and failure.|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic {{cylinder}} actuators {{are used}} extensively in industrial, construction and agricultural works. The small sized <b>outlet</b> <b>ports</b> of the cylinders resist {{the flow of}} discharged oil; {{and as a result}} the piston motion is slowed down. This causes a lot of heat generation and energy loss within the actuators. The study investigates and analyzes the possibilities of reducing the hydraulic resistance and increasing efficiency of the hydraulic actuator. Conventional hydraulic cylinders are simulated in FLUENT. Results show that the small <b>outlet</b> <b>ports</b> are the sources of energy loss in hydraulic cylinders. A new hydraulic system was proposed as a solution to relieve the hydraulic resistance in the actuators. The proposed system is a four ports hydraulic cylinder fitted with a novel flow control valve. The proposed four ports cylinder was simulated and parameters such as ports sizes, loads and pressures are varied during the simulation. The hydraulic resisting forces, piston speed and mass flow rates are computed. Results show that the hydraulic resistance is significantly reduced in the proposed four ports actuators; and the proposed cylinders run faster than the conventional cylinders and a considerable amount of energyis saved as well...|$|R
50|$|The {{carburetor}} typically {{contains a}} float bowl {{into which the}} expelled fuel is pumped. When the fuel level in the float bowl exceeds a certain level, the inlet valve to the carburetor will close, preventing the fuel pump from pumping more fuel into the carburetor. At this point, any remaining fuel inside the pump chamber is trapped, unable to exit through the inlet port or <b>outlet</b> <b>port.</b> The diaphragm will continue to allow pressure to the diaphragm, and during the subsequent rotation, the eccentric will pull the diaphragm back to bottom dead center, where it will remain until the inlet valve to the carburetor reopens.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of Padang in 1920 was 28,754, {{the second largest}} city in Sumatra behind Palembang. At the time of independence in the 1940s the city had around 50,000 inhabitants. Coffee was still important, but copra was also a major item produced by farmers in its hinterland. The population growth since then has been partly a result {{of growth in the}} area of the city, but largely is a result of the migration to major cities seen in so many developing nations. From 1950 the Ombilin coal field developed with Padang as its <b>outlet</b> <b>port.</b> This was seen by some observers as reflecting the economic and political colonisation of Indonesia.|$|E
