This analysis characterizes the Frame bursting traffic behavior and performance measurement, shows {{its implications for}} future research issues. GbE {{is one of the}} world’s largest Enterprise LANs solutions {{in terms of the number}} of concurrent users. FB Mechanism improves the performance of GbE CSMA/CD networks when transmitting short frames by reducing the Extension Field (EF) overhead, and tries to accord the controversy over the cross-layer (Layer 2 /Layer 3) scheme. But FB get some negative effect like Jumbo Frame, long burst will affect the equal opportunity of other transmission. We simulate about 1 Tera-packets by random generation, let the packet pass through form non-FB domain to FB domain, observe that FB behavior like the burst per 100 packets (BPHP), packet per burst(PPB) and it’s distribution, the burst length in different Input Rate, Input Channel, and Packet Length Distribution Input, The analysis of the burst performance reveals that the geometrical proportion between burst size and burst length, and the inverse proportion between the percentage of Burst and the <b>output</b> <b>utilization</b> after bursting.

H 577 P LSGI 2016 Xiaoxv, 182 pages :color illustrationsThe {{geospatial}} {{science is}} one of data-intensive domains, where research and development typically produce and analyze large volumes of distributed heterogeneous geospatial data sets. The recent advancements of sensor network and computing technologies have resulted in an explosion of geospatial data. In addition, scientific workflows and Web Services have been widely employed in geospatial data infrastructures. These technologies allow distributed data and model resources to be accessed and chained together to achieve complex scientific problems. The emergence of cloud computing provides a new way for processing big geoscience data by dynamically scheduling computing and storage resources over the Internet. Although the geospatial community tends to deploy the Earth Observation and geospatial model resources onto the cloud, {{there are still some}} challenges on effectively applying cloud computing paradigm to manage and analyze big geoscience data. First, the service-orientated cloud computing paradigm is transforming traditional geoscientific workflow management system from a close and centralized control system into a worldwide dynamic business process, which always consists of complex interactions among a large set of geographically distributed processing resources deployed and maintained by various organizations. Out of the necessity, these complex applications need to make use of large volumes of heterogeneous data and be executed in distributed computing environments. Furthermore, Current web-based GIS or RS applications generally rely on centralized structure, which has inherent drawbacks such as single points of failure, network congestion, and data inconsistency. The inherent disadvantages of traditional GISs need to be solved for new applications on Internet or Web. To address these challenges, this research presents the Hypercube Geospatial Service Framework (HyperCGSF), an agent-based framework comprising a scalable architecture and a set of distributed algorithms for decentralized enactment of construction and execution of geospatial processing workflows in the cloud computing environment. Using the Integrated Dust storm Detection Model (IDDM) as a case study, this research investigates how geospatial cloud computing and Earth Observation Sensor Web technologies can be utilized to realize standard-compliant geospatial web services, service composition, model input integration, and <b>output</b> <b>utilization.</b> Additionally, this research will explore how to apply a scalable hypercube Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) topology to organize an arbitrary number of geospatial service agents, which can then collaborate in the decentralized execution and monitoring of geospatial workflows. Contrary to traditional centralized approaches (e. g. BPEL), each service agent does not fully take charge of executing the whole workflow and all of the processes in a workflow are evenly distributed among the participating nodes in a fine-grained manner. An experimental evolution of HyperCGSF and a comparison with traditional centralized BPEL engine architecture demonstrate that the proposed HyperCGSF can dramatically decrease the execution times of complex workflow and increase the stability of the whole systems.

40|$|Problem. - The {{basic problem}} is the attempt of less {{developed}} countries to render their economy less dependent on primary products by diversifying their pattern of productions to favor manufactured products. Since primary products’ price {{is thought to be}} more unstable than the price of manufactured products, this price instability will distort income distribution, change the pattern of production and lower economic welfare. Purpose. - The writer attempts to investigate whether price instability in the Philippines’ economy is transmitted from world price instability and domestic policies, and also to investigate whether this price instability can affect the level of <b>output</b> and input <b>utilization.</b> Result. - The result obtained from this study is that the price instability in the Philippines’ economy is transmitted partially from the world price instability and partially from the domestic policies. The domestic policies cause the price instability of primary products to be greater than the price instability of manufactured products. In the primary sector, price instability will not induce a reduction in <b>output</b> or input <b>utilization,</b> but in the manufacturing sector, price instability will lead producers to reduce their output. Methodology. - This study used the percentage deviation of error terms from exponential trend to calculate the price instability index.

Moreover, we show that a static allocation of network re-sources (bandwidth and/or buffer space) based on large deviation theory can be highly inefficient when the real statistical behavior of traffic is taken into account. As an alternative, we propose a dynamic resource management scheme based on prediction tech-niques. As a specific example, we apply this scheme to a Differen-tiated Service (DiffServ) Internet environment, in which the goal, besides policing the incoming traffic, is to optimize the use of net-work resources, thus minimizing the probability of occurrence of violations of contract guarantees.
