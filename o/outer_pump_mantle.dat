50|$|Another {{simple method}} {{employed}} is a syringe or piston type. In essence, the water gun {{is made up}} primarily (sometimes exclusively) of the pumping mechanism that comprises an <b>outer</b> <b>pump</b> shaft with an inner pump-rod and water-tight seal. This allows water {{to be drawn into}} the pump as the pump is extended, then forcibly ejected out as the pump is compressed. Stream performance is dependent on the user's strength. Some models, like the Super Soaker Power Soaker Jr. and Stream Machines draw in and expel water from their nozzles. This design requires a bucket-type filling source. Other models, like the Super Soaker Power Soaker Mighty Cannon and Water Warriors Steady Stream, have check valves and a reservoir for portability.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a novel {{microfluidic}} impedance biosensor chip for trapping both a single and multiple cancer cells and monitoring their response to the anti-cancer drug treatment. By designing different sizes of working microelectrodes together with the V-shaped cell capture structures, a single or multiple cells are trapped on the microelectrodes surfaces. In addition, by utilizing the passive pumping method, cells can be trapped and positioned inside the microchannels without the need of using the <b>outer</b> micro <b>pump</b> or syringe. The impedance change induced by the response of cells to the anticancer drug Cisplatin treatment was successfully recorded. The proposed biosensor chip has a great potential for applications in cancer cell research, drug screening, and quantification of cancer cells from various tumor stages.

50|$|A spiral pump , {{sometimes}} called a Wirtz pump, {{is a low}} lift pump which is composed of a long piece of metal plating, which is wound into a coil and sealed {{at the top and}} back extremities so as to resemble a cylinder. The outer cavity serves as the inlet, while the inner (partial) tube serves as the outlet. A coiled plastic tube will suffice for this arrangement. The outlet pipe is fixed to a water wheel, engine or animal which is capable of rotating the pump quickly.

40|$|In most {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the Earth’s core the dynamo resides outside the tangent cylinder {{and may be}} crudely classified as being of the α 2 type. In this region the flow comprises a sea of thin columnar vortices aligned with the rotation axis, taking the form of alternating cyclones and anticyclones. The dynamo {{is thought to be}} driven by these columnar vortices within which the flow is observed to be highly helical, helicity being a crucial ingredient of planetary dynamos. As noted in Davidson, one of the mysteries of this dynamo cartoon is the origin of the helicity, which is observed to be positive in the south and negative in the north. While Ekman <b>pumping</b> at the <b>mantle</b> can induce helicity in some of the overly viscous numerical simulations, it is extremely unlikely to be a significant source within planets. In this paper we return to the suggestion of Davidson that the helicity observed in the less viscous simulations owes its existence to helical wave packets, launched in and around the equatorial plane where the buoyancy flux is observed to be strong. Here we show that such wave packets act as a potent source of planetary helicity, constituting a simple, robust mechanism that yields the correct sign for h north and south of the equator. Since such a mechanism does not rely on the presence of a mantle, it can operate within both the Earth and the gas giants. Moreover, ou...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method for making microbottle-shaped lasers {{by using a}} CO$_ 2 $ laser to melt Er:Yb glass onto silica microcapillaries or fibres. This is realised {{by the fact that}} the two glasses have different melting points. The CO$_ 2 $ laser power is controlled to flow the doped glass around the silica cylinder. In the case of a capillary, the resulting geometry is a hollow, microbottle-shaped resonator. This is a simple method for fabricating a number of glass WGM lasers with a wide range of sizes on a single, micron-scale structure. The Er:Yb doped glass <b>outer</b> layer is <b>pumped</b> at 980 nm via a tapered optical fibre and whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing is recorded around 1535 nm. This structure facilitates a new way to thermo-optically tune the microlaser modes by passing gas through the capillary. The cooling effect of the gas flow shifts the WGMs towards shorter wavelengths, thus thermal tuning of the lasing modes over 70 GHz is achieved. Results are fitted using the theory of hot wire anemometry, allowing the flow rate to be calibrated with a flow sensitivity as high as 100 GHz/sccm. Strain tuning of the microlaser modes by up to 50 GHz is also demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{influential}} and troublesome human pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) has emerged with many multidrug-resistant strains. After collecting 33 complete A. baumannii genomes and 84 representative antibiotic resistance determinants, we used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology approach to predict classical type vaccine candidates against A. baumannii infections and new type vaccine candidates against antibiotic resistance. Our genome analysis identified 35 outer membrane or extracellular adhesins that are conserved among all 33 genomes, have no human protein homology, and have less than 2 transmembrane helices. These 35 antigens include 11 TonB dependent receptors, 8 porins, 7 efflux pump proteins, and 2 fimbrial proteins (FilF and CAM 87009. 1). CAM 86003. 1 was predicted to be an adhesin outer membrane protein absent from 3 antibiotic-sensitive strains and conserved in 21 antibiotic-resistant strains. Feasible anti-resistance vaccine candidates also include one extracellular protein (QnrA), 3 RND type <b>outer</b> membrane efflux <b>pump</b> proteins, and 3 CTX-M type β-lactamases. Among 39 β-lactamases, A. baumannii CTX-M- 2, - 5, and - 43 enzymes are predicted as adhesins and better vaccine candidates than other β-lactamases to induce preventive immunity and enhance antibiotic treatments.

40|$|One of {{the central}} goals of {{neuroscience}} research is to determine how networks of neurons control and modify behavior. One {{of the most influential}} model systems for this kind of analysis is the siphon and gill withdrawal reflex of the marine mollusc A. californica. In response to tactile stimulation, the siphon displays 3 different responses: (1) a posterior pointing and leveling (flaring) of the siphon in response to tail stimulation (the siphon T response), (2) constriction and anterior pointing to head stimulation (the siphon H response) and (3) constriction and withdrawal between the animal 2 ̆ 7 s parapodia (the siphon S response). The siphon S response is pseudoconditioned by a noxious tail stimulus to resemble the siphon T response. Behavioral and combined behavioral/intracellular studies were conducted to determine the motor neuronal control of these behaviors and to search for mechanisms of siphon response transformation following pseudoconditioning. The present studies have found that the flaring component of pseudoconditioned siphon S responses occurs during <b>mantle</b> <b>pumping</b> (MP) triggered by noxious tail stimulation. Siphon stimulation also triggers MP, as recorded in neurons of the Interneuron II pattern generator which commands MP. The 4 LFSB siphon motor neurons (SMNs) were found necessary and sufficient for the siphon T response, while SMNs RD S and LDS 1 were found necessary and sufficient for the siphon H response. Following pseudoconditioning, there is {{an increase in the number}} of evoked spikes to the test stimulus for the LFSB cells and a decreased number for RD S. Siphon flaring occurring during the pseudoconditioned response correlates with increased LFSB activity during triggered MP cycles. This suggests that psuedoconditioning is in part due to reconfiguration of the motor outputs of the Interneuron II network. These results suggest that these defensive responses are controlled and patterned by a well-defined, finite set of motor neurons and interneurons (Interneuron II) that are dedicated to specific behavioral functions, but also have parallel distributed properties. ...|$|R
40|$|Savannah River Site (SRS), an {{approximately}} 800 -km 2 former {{nuclear weapons}} production facility located near Aiken, SC remains co-contaminated by heavy metals and radionuclides. To {{gain a better}} understanding on microbially-mediated bioremediation mechanisms, several bacterial strains resistant to high concentrations of Uranium (U) and Nickel (Ni) were isolated from the Steeds Pond soils located within the SRS site. One of the isolated strains, designated as strain SRS-W- 2 - 2016, grew robustly on both U and Ni. To fully understand the arsenal of metabolic functions possessed by this strain, a draft whole genome sequence (WGS) was obtained, assembled, annotated and analyzed. Genome-centric evaluation revealed the isolate to belong to the Burkholderia genus with close affiliation to B. xenovorans LB 400, an aggressive polychlorinated biphenyl-degrader. At a coverage of 90 ×, the genome of strain SRS-W- 2 - 2016 consisted of 8, 035, 584 bases with a total number of 7071 putative genes assembling into 191 contigs with an N 50 contig length of 134, 675 bases. Several gene homologues coding for resistance to heavy metals/radionuclides were identified in strain SRS-W- 2 - 2016, such as a suite of <b>outer</b> membrane efflux <b>pump</b> proteins similar to nickel/cobalt transporter regulators, peptide/nickel transport substrate and ATP-binding proteins, permease proteins, and a high-affinity nickel-transport protein. Also noteworthy were two separate gene fragments in strain SRS-W- 2 - 2016 homologous to the spoT gene; recently correlated with bacterial tolerance to U. Additionally, a plethora of oxygenase genes were also identified in the isolate, potentially involved in the breakdown of organic compounds facilitating the strain's successful colonization and survival in the SRS co-contaminated soils.

50|$|Water is <b>pumped</b> {{into the}} <b>mantle</b> cavity of the octopus {{where it comes}} {{into contact with the}} {{internal}} gills. The water has a high concentration of oxygen compared to the blood returning from the veins, therefore oxygen diffuses into the blood. The tissues and muscles of the octopus use oxygen and release carbon dioxide when breaking down glucose in the Krebs cycle. The carbon dioxide then dissolves into the blood or combines with water to form carbonic acid which decreases blood pH. The Bohr Effect explains why oxygen concentrations are lower in venous blood than arterial blood and why oxygen diffuses into the blood stream. The rate of diffusion is affected by the distance the oxygen has to travel from the water to the blood stream as indicated by Fick’s laws of diffusion. Fick’s laws explain why the gills of the octopus contain many small folds that are highly vascularised. They increase surface area and thus also increase the rate of diffusion. The capillaries that line the folds of the gill epithelium have a very thin tissue barrier (10 µm) which allows for fast, easy diffusion of the oxygen into the blood. In situations where the partial pressure of oxygen in the water is low, diffusion of oxygen into the blood is reduced, Henry’s Law can explain this phenomenon. The law states that at equilibrium the partial pressure of oxygen in water will be equal to that in air; however the concentrations will differ due to the differing solubility. This law explains why Octopus vulgaris has to alter the amount of water cycled through its mantle cavity as the oxygen concentration in water changes. The gills are in direct contact with water - carrying more oxygen than the blood - that has been brought into the mantle cavity of the octopus. Gill capillaries are quite small and abundant which creates an increased surface area that water can come into contact with, thus resulting in enhanced diffusion of oxygen into the blood. There is evidence that lamellae and vessels within the lamellae on the gills contract to aid in propelling blood through the capillaries.|$|R
40|$|Puff and pump' {{radiating}} divertor scenarios [1, 2] {{were applied}} to upper SN and DN H-mode plasmas. Under similar operating conditions, argon (Ar) accumulated in the main plasma of single-null (SN) plasmas more rapidly and reached a higher steady-state concentration when the B x {del}B ion drift direction was toward the divertor than when the B x {del}B ion drift direction {{was out of the}} divertor. The initial rate that Ar accumulated inside double-null (DN) plasmas was more than twice that of comparably-prepared SNs with the same B x {del}B direction. One way to reduce power loading at the divertor targets is to 'seed' the divertor plasma with impurities that radiatively reduce the conducted power. Studies have shown that the concentration of impurities in the divertor are increased by raising the flow of deuterium ions (D{sup +}) into the divertor by a combination of upstream deuterium gas puffing and active particle exhaust at the divertor targets, i. e., puff-and-pump. An enhanced D{sup +} particle flow toward the divertor targets exerts a frictional drag on impurities, and inhibits their escape from the divertor. A puff-and-pump approach using Ar as the impurity was successfully applied in recent DIII-D experiments to SN plasmas [3] while maintaining good H-mode performance. Studies on DIII-D and other tokamaks have shown that both the direction of the toroidal magnetic field B{sub T} and the degree of magnetic balance between divertors [i. e., {{the degree to which the}} plasma shape is considered SN or DN] are important factors in determining recycling and particle pumping [4, 5]. It is unclear whether the favorable results of Ref. [3] can be extended to cases with different magnetic balance and/or B{sub T} direction. We show in this paper that reversing the direction of B{sub T} or altering the divertor magnetic balance does have an impact on how plasmas behave under puff-and-pump conditions. Our study takes advantage of DIII-D's capabilities to actively pump SN and DN shapes with high-triangularity. In-vessel pumping of deuterium and Ar, shown schematically in Fig. 1, was done by cryopumps located inside the upper outer ('plus'), upper inner ('minus'), and lower <b>outer</b> (dotted) divertor <b>pumping</b> plenums. To increase the ion D{sup +} flow toward these pumps, deuterium gas was introduced at an outboard location, as shown.

Department of Energy (DOE) managed ecosystem left historically contaminated from decades of nuclear weapons production activities. Predominant contaminants within the impacted SRS environment include U and Nickel (Ni), both of which can be transformed microbially into less toxic forms via metal complexation mechanisms. Strain SRS-W- 1 - 2016 {{was isolated}} from the uraniferous SRS soils on high concentrations of U (4200 μM) and Ni (8500 μM), but rapid growth was observed at much lower concentrations of 500 μM U and 1000 μM Ni, respectively. Microcosm studies established with strain SRS-W- 1 - 2016 revealed a rapid decline in the concentration of spiked U such that it was almost undetectable in the supernatant by 72 h of incubation. Conversely, Ni concentrations remained unchanged, suggesting that the strain removed U but not Ni under the tested conditions. To obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} metabolic potential, a draft genome sequence of strain SRS-W- 1 - 2016 was obtained at a coverage of 90 ×, assembling into 93 contigs with an N 50 contig length of 92, 788 bases.

An in-depth, genome-wide comparison between strain SRS-W- 1 - 2016 and its four closest taxonomic relatives revealed 1159 distinct genes, representing 26. 7 % of its total genome; many associating with metal resistance proteins (e. g., for cadmium, cobalt, and zinc), transporter proteins, stress proteins, cytochromes, and drug resistance functions.

40|$|SECTION 1 Iron is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} element on the earth crust {{as well as an}} essential nutrient for all living organisms. The cycling of iron between the environment and biological systems and the microbial-mediated transformation between Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + has {{a significant impact on the}} biogeochemistry of the environment. The recently discovered microbially-mediated anaerobic nitrate-dependent oxidation of Fe 2 + has been shown to play an important role in global iron biogeochemical cycling. Furthermore, the formation of iron oxide from anaerobic nitrate-dependent Fe 2 + oxidation results in the adsorption and precipitation of soluble toxic heavy metals and radionuclides from surrounding environment. Therefore, this metabolism has been attracting more and more attention because this process could serve as a cost-effective way to co-remediate nitrate, heavy metals and radionuclides at contaminated sites. Little is known about the molecular genetics of the anaerobic nitrate-dependent Fe 2 + oxidation pathway so far. Previous studies in our lab using a microarray approach on Dechloromonas aromatica RCB uncovered the likely involvement of lipoproteins, transmembrane proteins in major operons, cytochromes and signal transduction enzymes in this metabolism. In an effort to further elucidate the metabolic process, a recently isolated bacterium strain Acidovorax ebreus strain TPSY capable of anaerobic nitrate-dependent Fe 2 + oxidation was selected as a model organism in this study. By utilizing a 2 -dimensional electrophoresis method, a list of candidate proteins which exhibited elevated levels of expression were identified by the comparison of whole cell protein profile between Fe 2 +-oxidizing strain TPSY cells and control cells. Conserved domain analysis of the protein candidates along with the locus analysis of their corresponding genes revealed two operons (Dtpsy_ 1460 - 1463 and Dtpsy_ 3433 - 3438) that could encode key components in the anaerobic nitrate-dependent Fe 2 + oxidation pathway. An <b>outer</b> membrane efflux <b>pump</b> protein complex encoded by the Dtpsy_ 1460 - 1463 operon could play a role in the exportation of periplasmic-accumulated Fe 3 + as a detoxification procedure. In addition, a putative ferric reductase protein Dtpsy_ 3433 and cytochrome reductase-like protein Dtpsy_ 3436 are likely critical electron transport chain components in this metabolism. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR provided further evidence for the involvement of this operon by demonstrating the transcriptional level up-regulation of the genes in the Dtpsy_ 3433 - 3438 operon. This study serves as the first attempt to identify the proteins and genes responsible for anaerobic nitrate-dependent iron oxidation in Acidovorax ebreus strain TPSY. This work has led to the successful identification of a few key proteins and genes responsible for anaerobic nitrate-dependent Fe 2 + oxidation, thus providing information important for the elucidation of other components in this electron transport pathway. SECTION 2 Perchlorate is a wide-spread contaminant detected in drinking water and ground water systems in the United States. The current development of a highly sensitive enzymatic bioassay for in situ perchlorate concentration quantification created a need for high-quality and low-cost perchlorate reductase. Perchlorate reductase, originally isolated from DPRB (dissimilatory perchlorate reducing bacteria), is encoded by an operon containing four genes, pcrABCD. Enzymatically active perchlorate reductase purified by traditional methods is composed of two structural subunits, PcrA and PcrB, encoded by the pcrA and pcrB genes, respectively. The lengthy traditional protein purification process and the slow growth rate of DPRB hinder the industrial mass production of this enzyme. In this study, we report an attempt to use E. coli host to overexpress perchlorate reductase and use a polyhistidine tag to enable ease of the subsequent purification. The pcrAB genes encoding the structural subunits of perchlorate reductase were cloned into an expression vector in E. coli. The purification of the recombinant perchlorate reductase was performed under strict anaerobic and denaturing conditions and a highly purified form of the enzyme was obtained. Possible solutions to avoid the formation of inclusion bodies while still maintaining the enzyme activity were discussed. This work proved the feasibility of recombinant perchlorate reductase expression using an E. coli host and the usefulness of the histidine tag in the purification process. In addition, this work provided insights into factors that need to be taken into future consideration in order to obtain the recombinant enzyme with full enzymatic activity. As a final goal, this study will contribute to the development of enzyme-based bioassay for the detection of perchlorate in the environment by lowering the production and purification cost of its key component, the perchlorate reductase...|$|R
