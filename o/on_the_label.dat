5|$|Key Sounds Label is a Japanese {{independent}} {{record label}} formed in 2001 as {{a brand of}} the publishing company VisualArt's. Key Sounds Label was formed to catalog and release music related to visual novels produced by the brand Key, also under VisualArt's, known for developing such titles as Kanon and Air. Excluding two albums and one single that were released by Key and VisualArt's before the label's formation, the majority of releases <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label</b> all have a basis from one of Key's titles. There are other albums and singles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label</b> {{not directly related to}} the visual novels, such as two singles by Lia and one album by Riya. Unlike typical record labels, Key Sounds Label does not license any of the artists featured on albums and singles released <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{releases}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label</b> contain music {{directly related}} to Key's visual novels, whether they be original soundtracks, remix albums, or image song singles and albums. There are other music singles and albums produced by members of Key not related to Key's titles. For example, the first album released <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label,</b> Humanity..., is the only album released by Work-S, a band produced by Shinji Orito. Two maxi singles containing songs sung by Lia were released <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label</b> in December 2002 and August 2003. An album entitled Love Song was released in August 2005 containing songs sung by Riya of Eufonius. In December 2006, Key Sounds Label produced the first drama CD <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label,</b> and two more followed in July 2007. In December 2006, the first anime music single to commemorate the second anime television series adaptation of Kanon was produced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label,</b> and an anime single for the Clannad anime television series followed in October 2007. A third anime music single, this time for the Clannad After Story anime television series, was released in November 2008. A short remix album for Clannad After Story was released in December 2008. Music singles and albums for the anime Angel Beats! were released between April and December 2010. A single for the Little Busters! anime television series was released in October 2012. Two singles for the Little Busters! Refrain anime television series were released: the first in October 2013 and the second in November 2013.|$|E

Thirty three percent of females considered they could find sometime information regarding <b>the</b> animal welfare <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels,</b> while males considered that this information could be found very rarely. Up to 55 years of age, 50 % of the consumers consider that <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> do not contain the information about animal welfare, while after this age most of consumers consider they found this information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> Over 50 % of Orthodox and Roman Catholic responders considered that <b>the</b> information <b>on</b> animal welfare <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> was found some of the time or very rarely. Respondents, irrespective of their living area or monthly income, considered that there is scarce information regarding animal welfare <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> Internet access significantly influenced the consumers regarding the availability of <b>the</b> information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>labels...</b>|$|R

5|$|Following several {{membership}} {{changes and}} unsuccessful releases, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988. The band released {{a number of}} successful EPs, including You Made Me Realise (1988), Glider (1990) and Tremolo (1991), and two studio albums, Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label.</b> Loveless, which {{has been described as}} the band's magnum opus {{and one of the best}} albums of the 1990s, was a major critical success. However, the band were dropped by Creation Records after its release due to the album's extensive production costs. In 1992, My Bloody Valentine signed to Island Records and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive. Following the departure of Googe and Ó Cíosóig in 1995, My Bloody Valentine later disbanded in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Key Sounds Label has {{its origins}} in 1999, {{two years before the}} first album <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label</b> was released. When the visual novel company Key, under the {{publisher}} VisualArt's, was about to release their debut title Kanon, Key produced the arrange album Anemoscope and bundled it with the first-print release of Kanon released in June 1999. The second music release, a single, occurred in November 1999. The third release, another arrange album, followed in September 2000 bundled with the first-print release of Key's second title Air, and was the first music release by Key to bear a catalog number, KYCD-0303. Each of these three were released in limited editions, and thus were not widely sold.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Extra Mile, a band from Kentucky {{threatened}} to sue Shenandoah {{over the use of}} the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Kentucky band, two other bands filed lawsuits over Shenandoah's name. The lawsuits depleted the money earned by the band on the road, which led to the band asking the label and their production company to all pay one-third of their legal costs. The production company refused, and Shenandoah was forced to filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after paying more than 2 million dollars on court settlements and legal fees. Although the lawsuits allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the bankruptcy filing terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The production company's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with them. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label.</b>|$|E

5|$|Surcharges {{imposed by}} the Irish post office on mail bearing {{insufficient}} pre-paid postage had the postage due collected {{by the use of}} these labels. Since 1925 there have been six series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The Irish word pingin, for penny, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label</b> does not indicate whether the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a watermark and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification will be easier. For example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word Éire in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.|$|E
5|$|Unlike typical record labels, Key Sounds Label {{does not}} license {{any of the}} artists {{featured}} on albums and singles released <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label.</b> When Key Sounds Label formed, Jun Maeda, Shinji Orito, and Magome Togoshi were Key's signature composers and have continued to produce {{the majority of the}} music on Key Sounds Label. In October 2006, however, Togoshi left Key and is no longer affiliated with either Key or VisualArt's. One of the founding members of Key, OdiakeS, left Key before Key Sounds Label formed, but did contribute on the Kanon Original Soundtrack and the remixing of a song on Clannads remix album -Memento-. Key Sounds Label's roster features Japanese bands and singers, several of which originated from the I've Sound techno/trance music production group under VisualArt's, such as Ayana, Kotoko, Lia, Mell, Mami Kawada and Eiko Shimamiya. Other artists including Annabel, Chata, Karuta, Ayaka Kitazawa, LiSA, Marina, Runa Mizutani, Psychic Lover, Rita, Riya, Harumi Sakurai, Haruka Shimotsuki, Keiko Suzuki, Miyako Suzuta, Suzuyu, Aoi Tada, Tomoe Tamiyasu, and Nagi Yanagi have also been released on records through the label. The musical units Work-S, Eufonius, OTSU, PMMK, and MintJam have also produced music on Key Sounds Label. Musicians from I've Sound have been working with Key Sounds Label on the arrangement of songs, as have many others.|$|E
