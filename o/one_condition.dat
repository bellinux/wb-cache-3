5|$|In 1935, {{the palace}} {{including}} the entire estate {{was purchased by}} the City of Braunschweig. <b>One</b> <b>condition</b> for the purchase was that no structural changes ever be made and the park not be built on. The palace, which was rebuilt after the Second World War and reconstructed in 1987 to the historic original design, is now used for public events. The nearly four-hectare park has been {{open to the public}} since 1964.|$|E

Steph promptly sent the animal away to a donkey sanctuary. She later was seen pretending to be Elliot Bevan's (Garnon Davies) girlfriend to please his mother and was subsequently exposed as not.|$|E
5|$|In Paris, Bizet {{discovered}} the difficulties faced by young and relatively unknown composers {{trying to get}} their operas performed. Of the capital's two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the , the former offered a static repertoire in which works by foreign composers, particularly Rossini and Meyerbeer, were dominant. Even established French composers such as Gounod had difficulty getting works performed there. At the Opéra-Comique, innovation was equally rare; although more French works were performed, the style and character of most productions had hardly changed since the 1830s. However, <b>one</b> <b>condition</b> of the Opéra-Comique's state funding was that from time to time it should produce one-act works by former Prix de Rome laureates. Under this provision, Bizet wrote La guzla de l'Emir, with a libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, and this went into rehearsal early in 1862.|$|E

5|$|While at Paramount, in 1955, he {{produced}} the highly commercially successful Strategic Air Command, starring James Stewart. After {{the success of}} Strategic Air Command, Paramount obtained the rights to The Sons of Katie Elder, and assigned the project to Briskin to produce, with Alan Ladd starring. However, when Ladd brought out {{the remainder of his}} contract with Paramount, the film was put on hold, and would not be produced until 1965, by a different producer, Hal B. Wallis. In May 1956, Briskin asked to be released from the final two years of his agreement with Paramount, to which the studio agreed. The <b>one</b> <b>condition</b> was that Briskin finish work on his remaining film commitment to the studio, The Joker is Wild, starring Frank Sinatra, which was being produced by an independent film company, A.M.B.L. Productions, under an agreement with Paramount.|$|E

25|$|In a block design, {{two or more}} {{conditions}} are alternated in blocks.

This is known as the subtraction paradigm.|$|E
25|$|Correct {{diagnosis}} {{is important for}} mental health disorders, otherwise the condition could worsen, resulting in {{a negative impact on}} both the patient and the healthcare system. Another problem with mis{{diagnosis is}} that a treatment for <b>one</b> <b>condition</b> might exacerbate other conditions.

25|$|The <b>one</b> <b>condition</b> on the {{automorphism}} for folding to {{be possible}} is that distinct nodes of the graph in the same orbit (under the automorphism) must not be connected by an edge; {{at the level of}} root systems, roots in the same orbit must be orthogonal. At the level of diagrams, this is necessary as otherwise the quotient diagram will have a loop, due to identifying two nodes but having an edge between them, and loops are not allowed in Dynkin diagrams.|$|E

25|$|A (simply-laced) Dynkin diagram (finite or affine) {{that has}} a {{symmetry}} (satisfying <b>one</b> <b>condition,</b> below) can be quotiented by the symmetry, yielding a new, generally multiply laced diagram, with the process called folding (due to most symmetries being 2-fold). At the level of Lie algebras, this corresponds to taking the invariant subalgebra under the outer automorphism group, and the process can be defined purely with reference to root systems, without using diagrams. Further, every multiply laced diagram (finite or infinite) {{can be obtained by}} folding a simply-laced diagram.|$|E

The platform is completely instrumented. We developed a simulation model that is confronted to experimental measurements.

It was also announced that clubs that merged would receive a large sum of money, as well as a guaranteed position in the 2000 NRL Competition. The St. George Dragons and the Illawarra Steelers were the first clubs to take up the offer, forming the joint-venture St. George Illawarra Dragons at the end of the 1998 season.|$|E
25|$|Janus {{frequently}} symbolized {{change and}} transitions {{such as the}} progress of past to future, from <b>one</b> <b>condition</b> to another, from one vision to another, and young people's growth to adulthood. He represented time, because he could see into the past with one face and into the future with the other. Hence, Janus was worshipped at {{the beginnings of the}} harvest and planting times, as well as at marriages, deaths and other beginnings. He represented the middle ground between barbarism and civilization, rural and urban space, youth and adulthood. Having jurisdiction over beginnings Janus had an intrinsic association with omens and auspices.|$|E

25|$|Latané and Darley {{performed}} three {{experiments to}} test bystander behavior in non-emergency situations Their {{results indicated that}} {{the way in which the}} subjects were asked for help mattered.

In another condition, the students asked bystanders for a dime. When the student gave an explanation, such as saying that their wallet had been stolen, the percentage of people giving assistance was higher (72%) than when the student just asked for a dime (34%). Additional research by Faul, Mark, et al., using data collected by EMS officials when responding to an emergency, indicated that the response of bystanders was correlated with the health severity of the situation.|$|E
25|$|The United States had {{maintained}} numerous military bases and a substantial garrison throughout the Canal Zone {{to protect the}} American-owned Panama Canal and to maintain American control of this strategically important area. On 7 September 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and the de facto leader of Panama, General Omar Torrijos, signed Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which set in motion the process of handing over the Panama Canal to Panamanian control by the year 2000. Although the canal was destined for Panamanian administration, the military bases remained and <b>one</b> <b>condition</b> of the transfer was that the canal would remain open for American shipping.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>condition</b> of the Hearst Corporation's {{donation}} {{of the estate}} was that the Hearst family {{would be allowed to}} use it when they wished. Patty Hearst, a granddaughter of William Randolph, related that as a child, she hid behind statues in the Neptune Pool while tours passed by. Although the main estate is now a museum, the Hearst family continues to use an older Victorian house on the property as a retreat – the original house built by George Hearst in the late 19th century. The house is screened from tourist routes by a dense grove of eucalyptus to provide maximum privacy for the guests. In 2001, Patty Hearst hosted a Travel Channel show on the estate, and Amanda Hearst modeled for a fashion photo shoot at the estate for a Hearst Corporation magazine, Town and Country, in 2006.|$|E
