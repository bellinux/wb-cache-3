Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B", and {{wrote that he}} enjoyed the way the {{important}} elements of the episode go [...] "unspoken: Jim composes an apology email but doesn’t send it; the way the spectators are blocked during the main event at the dojo, there’s practically an entire office standing between Krasinski and Jenna Fischer." [...] Adams also enjoyed the way the episode wrote Pam's reaction, noting [...] "is she generally uncomfortable, is she afraid of what Meredith might assume, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> afraid of her own feelings?" ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{began to}} film the music video for [...] "Diamonds" [...] on October 21, 2012, at the Mojave Desert in Lancaster, California. It was {{directed}} by her regular collaborator Anthony Mandler, who previously directed her videos for [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] (2009) and [...] "Man Down" [...] (2011). Photographs of the production leaked to the press the same day and showed Rihanna in a white and black dress {{in front of a}} fire. Ethan Sacks of the New York Daily News remarked that she [...] "looked like a gem on the set of her video shoot." [...] Rihanna said that she wanted the video's abstract scenes to capture the appropriate emotion for the audience. Mandler sought to create a [...] "wider landscape" [...] by suggesting and transfiguring ideas for viewers through the video: [...] "hey needed to feel like dream vignettes, like, when you wake up from a dream, you realize what you were dreaming about is not really what it was about, it was about something else." [...] He also tried to relate the video's concept to Rihanna's personal life: [...] "What's truth or fiction? You know 'Is she drowning, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> in complete ecstasy? Are those hands coming apart, or are they finding each other?' ... we tried to bring up these deeper questions that relate to song and her life and finding beauty in chaos and finding beauty in pain and finding pain in beauty." [...] On November 7, a behind-the-scenes video was posted on MTV's official website. It featured Rihanna in a [...] "leopard-print" [...] robe as she emerged from a trailer and headed to the shooting set. The scenes were intercut with police officers who chase armed fighters. Rihanna stands in a deserted landscape in the video's other scenes. The music video for [...] "Diamonds" [...] premiered November 8 on MTV. The video was also made available for streaming at Rihanna.MTV.com. It was digitally released on November 14 via the iTunes Store.|$|E
2500|$|New York {{magazine}} contributor Amanda Dobbins {{noted the}} music video [...] "predictably [...] garnered some attention" [...] from the public. Rya Backer of MTV questioned Del Rey's originality, saying, [...] "it's {{hard to know}} what to make of Lana Del Rey at first glance. Is she as Jools Holland once dubbed her an 'Internet phenomenon' worth no more than a few salacious blog posts? <b>Or</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> a legitimate chanteuse wrapped in the hyper feminine, yet innately American (and admittedly well-curated) image she's projected in videos for such tracks as 'Video Games' and 'Blue Jeans'?" [...] Pitchforks Ian Cohen commented that the music video [...] "fits between surrendering to romance and depression, moving with the elegant wastefulness of the kind of day drunk that's a true privilege of the beautiful, idle class." ...|$|E
