500|$|In {{the midst}} of our short {{conversation}} of yesterday, & still more pleasant than short, you expressed a wish to receive a sketch in prose of the thing we desired. I am sure your kindness renders it a duty incumbent on me in return, to afford you every facility in my power. I therefore inclose two scribbles with which I would not otherwise have troubled you. That in small writing is the production <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> in her eleventh year, & is strictly modelled, as ar as [...] her infant talents would allow, on Dibdin's song. This may answer {{the purpose of a}} prose sketch. The other is written by a young man of twenty. It is rather unintelligible: but the two first two stanzas may afford you a hint respecting the first two designs.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics are}} about the birth of Madonna's {{daughter}} Lourdes, and the realization of motherhood. In {{an interview with the}} Wesleyan University Press, the singer stated: [...] "There's a song on the album called 'Nothing Really Matters', and it is very much inspired by my daughter. it's just realizing {{that at the end of}} the day, the most important thing is loving people and sharing love. The birth <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> has been a huge influence. It's different to look at life through the eyes of a child, and suddenly you have a whole new respect for life and you kind of get your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'." [...] Based on the lyrical content, Bryan Lark from The Michigan Daily reviewed the parent album, and concluded that as the single [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was about confronting the past, [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] conversely is about [...] "moving onward." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2013, Schoolboy Q {{called the}} album his [...] "best work yet." [...] He also {{called it a}} classic, but hoped his fans will have the final say: [...] "It's a classic album I would like to say, but I would like the people to say it's a classic. But in my eyes it's a crazy album…I'm really proud of myself for this record." [...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like I really was like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work. I {{know a lot of}} rappers say that when they dropping they albums, but I'm one of those dudes it ain't like I drop mixtapes. It ain't like I do that type of stuff. Drop songs every month to let you know I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. When I was in the studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I just did it anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E
