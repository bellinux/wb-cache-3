40|$|In our {{previous}} study, the evaluation {{system for the}} finger–jointed laminae was constructed. This system was composed of three parts. The first part is the motive power part for the hydraulic pomp and cylinder. The second part is the AE measurement part. The third part is the data collection part which controls some devices and collects sampling data. In this study, the optimum condition needed in the evaluating test with this evaluation system was examined. In addition, {{the effects of the}} temperature and the <b>open</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> in finger jointing on the strength properties of the finger–jointed laminae with this evaluate system were examined. The main results are summarized as follows: The peak in the waveform of AE signals obtained by the evaluation system was recognized in the laminae with starved joint. The peak and the starved joint part were corresponded. In evaluation test of the finger–jointed laminae with this system, the necessary conditions set in this test were the deflection and the feed speed, and these optimum conditions were 3 mm and high speed (480 mm/s), respectively. The strength properties of the finger–jointed laminae with the <b>open</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> showed the tendency to decrease with higher the temperature in jointing. Therefore, {{it became clear that the}} high temperature in jointing was the condition that the starved joint part was caused. The MOE and MOR of the finger–jointed laminae showed the tendency to decrease with increasing the maximum value of the AE accumulated signal. Thus, it was clear that there was a high correlation between the maximum value and the strength properties. Therefore, this evaluation system was promising for the detection of the difference of the bonding performance caused by the influence of bonding conditions such as the temperature and the <b>open</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> in jointing...|$|E
40|$|Key words: adhesives; steel; butt-joint; impact toughness; shock {{temperature}}; {{testing method}} Abstract: The {{effect of the}} shock temperature and time on the impact toughness of the adhesively bonded steel butt joint under Charpy or Izod impact test is studied using the experimental method. The results obtained show that the impact toughness decreases when the shock temperature increased. When the curing time, temperature {{as well as the}} <b>open</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> was set as constant, the higher the shock temperature is, the lower the impact toughness of the joint. Comparing to the Charpy impact test, the Izod impact test is more sensitive to the shock temperature. When the shock temperature is set at a value not less than 300 C, the impact toughness measured is nearly the same as zero due to decomposition, carbonization and volatilization of the adhesive...|$|E
40|$|No presente trabalho, pretendo mostrar o estatuto do dizer e do escrito no ensino do psicanalista Jacques Lacan. Lacan realizou, ao longo de 26 anos ininterruptos, atividades de ensino em regime de seminário; ele mesmo realizou a recopilação de seus textos fundamentais, lançados em 1966 sob o título: Escritos. Sabe-se também que um componente {{fundamental}} da sua doutrina é sua teoria sobre o estatuto do escrito na transmissão em psicanálise. Ao longo de seu ensino, também se preocupou por definir o estatuto do dizer. O dizer e o escrito aparecem enlaçados no ensino de Lacan em uma relação de temporalidade subjetiva, na qual a função essencial do dizer é a subjetivação do escrito, e isso se produz num tempo de espera no qual o corpo se vê comprometido pela própria inscrição da teoria no corpo (castração). In {{the present}} work, I intend {{to show the}} saying and the writing statute {{in the teaching of}} psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Lacan carried throughout 26 years uninterrupted activities of teaching into the seminary regimen; he himself made the compilation of his basic texts, launched in 1966 under the heading: Writings. We also know that a basic component of his teaching is its theory on the writing statute in the psychoanalysis transmission. Throughout his teaching, he was also worried about defining the saying statute. Saying and the writing appear enlaced in the teaching of Lacan in a relation of subjective temporality, in which the essential function of saying (theory) is the subjectivation of the theoretical writing, and it is produced in an <b>open</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> in which the body itself is engaged for the proper inscription of the theory in the body (castration) ...|$|E
40|$|In end–jointing of laminae for the glulam timber, finger–joint is {{generally}} used. However, the strength {{properties of the}} glulam timber greatly decrease by slippage–off and destruction in starved joints of finger–jointed part when the laminae with starved joints in the finger–joint are located on the external layer of the glulam timber. Therefore, for the glulam timber with good strength properties, the evaluation of finger–joint properties after finger–jointing is important, and the method is hoped to be simple and non–destructive. In this study, to examine the optimum adhesive condition in finger–joint part which influences strength properties of the large–scale sugi finger–jointed laminae, the block shear tests with sugi block specimens which assumed finger–joint part and glued under various adhesive conditions was performed. The main results are summarized as follows: In {{the case of the}} specimen of W–O (With curing agent, One side spreading) under 40 – 20 (<b>open</b> <b>assembly</b> temperature and <b>time</b> set to 40 ℃ and 20 min) with resorcinol phenol resin type adhesive, the tendency to decrease of the shear strength was shown. From the fracture morphology, the reason was considered that the adhesive did not transfer on none–spreading side because the surface of the adhesive has stiffened by setting the <b>open</b> <b>assembly</b> temperature and <b>time.</b> In other conditions, an enough glued performance was considered because the shear strength showed a comparatively large value. Moreover, in the case of None–specimen (Without curing agent), the shear strength shows a small value and the tendency to decrease was shown by setting the <b>open</b> <b>assembly</b> temperature and <b>time.</b> In three conditions of W–O, None–B (Without curing agent, Both sides spreading), and None–O (Without curing agent, One side spreading) under 40 – 20 with aqueous polymer solution–isocyanate adhesive, the shear strength had decreased remarkably. In other conditions, the difference was not admitted and the tendency to decrease of the shear strength was shown by setting the <b>open</b> <b>assembly</b> temperature and <b>time...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 In plywood manufacture, the {{interaction}} of wood with resin during hot pressing {{is responsible for the}} development of glue bond strength and hence panel quality. In this study, temperature and vapor pressure distributions and compaction of laminates were measured during pressing. Analysis of these factors emphasized boards formed under conventional (standard) conditions. However, some laminates were also studied with modified veneer moisture contents and platen pressures. By analysing data generated from laminates during pressing in the laboratory, the nature of interdepencence between heat transfer, vapor pressure accumulation and board compaction and how they are affected by veneer moisture content and platen pressure were considered. Complementary to the above work, the rate of strength development of phenol-formaldehyde resin forming a bond between wood wafers was determined. Bonds were formed under a range of steady-state temperatures and immediately tested in shear mode. Curves of bond strength versus pressing time were derived for each of the eight temperatures used. The relationship between rate of bond strength development, temperature and pressing time was quantified. At elevated temperatures very rapid resin curing was observed compared to that at lower temperatures. <b>Open</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>time,</b> resin pot life and wood wafer characteristics did not have a significant effects on the rate of curing of the resin under the range of conditions used in this project. The data generated from both experiments were combined to derive a model for predicting glue bond strength development at various locations in the laminate during hot pressing. The principle for the construction of the model is described as well as factors which should be accounted for in future refinements. Quantitive analysis of {{the interaction}} of these variables will aid in optimising the manufacture of plywood. The use of high MC veneers and selection of appropriate pressing variables depends upon such analysis. The development of new materials and evaluation of new adhesive systems are longer term goals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the impact of timer-based burst {{assembly}} algorithms for TCP traffic. We present an analysis for short, medium and long <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> and investigate segment and flow distribution over the assembled bursts. Further, we also analyze their impact on the congestion window evolution and on the effective throughput achieved. It has been found out that short <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> are ideally suitable for sources with small congestion windows, allowing for a speed up, while large <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> yield a lower throughput variation among the individual assembled flows. For long <b>assembly</b> <b>times,</b> the transfer of more segments from the same source is trading off the increase of the burstification delay but no throughput gain is obtained. However, large <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> smooth out individual flow performance and provide a significant lower variation of throughput. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new adaptive burst assembly algorithm that dynamically assigns flows to different burstifiers based on their instant window size...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the research and}} development of two <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> estimation techniques for the automotive industry. Both of these techniques are capable of being implemented early in the product life-cycle of a vehicle and require information available in this phase.
