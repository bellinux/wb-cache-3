25|$|In theater, {{there are}} quite a few plays and musicals that have lesbian {{characters}} or focus on lesbian themes. One particular musical that has received a lot of recognition in the past few years is Fun Home. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Fun Home is a personal account of Alison Bechdel's self-discovery as a lesbian. The show also features themes of the decision to come out, having sex for the first time, and coming to terms with one's sexuality. Many of the songs in the show focus on these themes, such as the moment of recognition one knows they are gay, when they find gay role models, and the awkwardness and authenticity that comes with first time sex. This show stands <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> normalizes the lesbian experience and speaks of lesbian sex without the fetishation found in much other media platforms.|$|E
25|$|Drake's well is {{probably}} singled <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was drilled, not dug; because it used a steam engine; {{because there was}} a company associated with it; and because it touched off a major boom. However, there was considerable activity before Drake {{in various parts of the}} world in the mid-19th century. A group directed by Major Alexeyev of the Bakinskii Corps of Mining Engineers hand-drilled a well in the Baku region in 1848. There were engine-drilled wells in West Virginia in the same year as Drake's well. An early commercial well was hand dug in Poland in 1853, and another in nearby Romania in 1857. At around the same time the world's first, small, oil refinery was opened at Jasło in Poland, with a larger one opened at Ploiești in Romania shortly after. Romania is the first country in the world to have had its annual crude oil output officially recorded in international statistics: 275 tonnes for 1857.|$|E

[...] Asked by the crew {{if he wanted to}} keep it, he answered, [...] "Uh, yeah. Okay."

500|$|When {{deciding}} the band's next single, Ray Davies pushed for [...] "Come Dancing" [...] {{to be released}} rather than [...] "Don't Forget to Dance," [...] which had been suggested by the record company as the first single from State of Confusion. The UK branch of Arista Records approved this decision, releasing 7-inch and 12-inch versions of the new single on 19 November 1982 with [...] "Noise" [...] as the B-side. However, Clive Davis initially had reservations; Davies recalls that Davis [...] "didn't {{want to put it}} <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was too much of an English subject matter". Davis also thought it was just a [...] "ditty" [...] and did not have enough substance to be a single.|$|E

500|$|... "Kill the Alligator and Run" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jen Kamerman {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). When the animation department finished its work on the episode, it had ended up being about four minutes too long and the staff of the show was forced to make some difficult cuts. One scene that was cut saw Captain Jack lying in state at the capitol in Florida, with Kid Rock being one of the people present to pay their respects to the alligator. The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully has expressed regret for cutting this scene <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> [...] "hurts the logic" [...] later in the episode when Captain Jack crawls out of the capitol and reveals himself to everyone, without any explanation to how he got there.|$|E
500|$|Orci noted {{while the}} time travel story {{allowed them to}} alter some backstory {{elements}} such as Kirk's first encounter with the Romulans, they could not {{use it as a}} crutch to change everything and they tried to approach the film as a prequel as much as possible. Kirk's service on Farragut, a major backstory point to the original episode [...] "", was left <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was deemed irrelevant to the story of Kirk meeting Spock, although Orci felt nothing in his script precluded it from the new film's backstory. There was a scene involving Kirk meeting Carol Marcus (who is revealed as the mother of his son in [...] ) as a child, but it was dropped because the film needed more time to introduce the core characters. Figuring out ways to get the crew together required some contrivances, which Orci and Kurtzman wanted to explain from old Spock as a way of the timeline mending itself, highlighting the theme of destiny. The line was difficult to write and was ultimately cut out.|$|E
500|$|Before each segment, {{there are}} {{trailers}} advertising fake films, {{as well as}} vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for Grindhouse. [...] "I didn't even know about it until I {{read it in the}} trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'" [...] Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, [...] "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made Machete. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: Werewolf Women of the SS.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'" [...] Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down. Some Canadian screening releases included the South by Southwest-winning trailer Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E

I think those guys—Bill, Kevin and Mike—are really talented, obviously. I think anything’s possible, but I thought it might get confusing to try to merge them together or do crossover projects. I would never rule <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> all kind of the same universe. But RiffTrax, the idea of riffing on topical movies, is a different thing. And I like that the movie-riffing universe got bigger {{when they decided to}} do that, but we just do weird movies you've never seen before." ...|$|R

2500|$|There {{was a lot}} {{of debate}} within the Chevrolet {{organization}} over just what to call this new car, and the decision to go with [...] "Chevy II" [...] was a very late one.

Ultimately the Nova badge would replace Chevy II, but that wouldn't happen until 1969. In almost every way, the creators of the Chevy II used Falcon as a benchmark. The 1962 model range included sedans and wagons, as well as a two-door hardtop and a convertible, just like Falcon. [...] The only body styles it didn't offer which the Falcon did were a sedan delivery and coupe utility (the Ford Falcon Ranchero), most likely to avoid competing with Chevrolet's own El Camino.|$|E

A week after they were arrested, more than 50 law enforcement officials from Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio met to plan their strategy for prosecuting Coleman and Brown, as the two had committed crimes within each state. Desiring {{the death penalty for}} Coleman and Brown, Michigan was quickly ruled <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> did not employ capital punishment.
