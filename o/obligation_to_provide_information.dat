The rule prescribed by the judicial system for administering system of cares and access to medical treatment, therefore, is based on the “consent” of those concerned: regardless of age, to intervene legitimately on the body, the physician must always obtain the prior consent of the patient or other qualified entities, unless the medical activity does not fall within the mandatory treatment. Over time, the regulatory system has accompanied the parameter of ‘consensus’ of a peculiar qualification: the adequacy of the information. Consent to medical procedure, therefore, became “ informed”: current sources state, it is no longer enough just a simple consensus, but it must be given by the person concerned knowingly, after appropriate medical information. Consensus is defined as informed only if the doctor provides the patient with all information related to treatment, so that the manifestation of the will to be conscious and aware. If the information provided by health care personnel are not adequate, the consent may not be congruent, neither aware nor lawful and give rise to liability.

This development has been in part a response to the realization that certain information acts as the lubricant needed to keep the collective bargaining machinery running smoothly.

The employer 2 ̆ 7 s <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>information</b> to the employees 2 ̆ 7 bargaining representative has evolved from contributions by both the National Labor Relations Board and the judiciary.

As the law in this area developed, the Board demonstrated a growing propensity to accord the presumption of relevance to data other than employee wages. More recently, a 2 ̆ 2 substantiation doctrine 2 ̆ 2 has been utilized to require the employer to furnish data, and the type of data requested has become less significant.

Athletes’ trust in the system was remarkably low when it came to questions concerning how it operated in other countries and its ability to catch doped athletes.

40|$|This thesis {{highlights}} the importance and privileges of corporations with the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>information</b> to society about their activities. The primary reporting vehicle is seen to be the annual report with accounting regulation viewed as a significant quality control device. It is postulated that New Zealand accounting self-regulation has failed in delivering the latter protection. By way of providing a background to the discussion the Anglo-American accounting regulatory systems are critiqued and found inadequate. Special concerns are noted with the accounting standard setting due process procedures and enforcement mechanisms. Linkage of the New Zealand accounting system to the Anglo-American cluster is shown through various international classification studies. Financial accounting paradigms are analysed {{with a view to}} determining the end-purpose of corporate reporting. It is concluded that the accountability paradigm is most closely aligned with a broad societal view of accounting. A Public Accountability Model of Accounting Regulation is evolved. The Model is based on efficiency and equity criteria, and emphasises the responsibility of preparers to communicate adequate financial and non-financial information to stakeholders. The New Zealand accounting regulatory structures are empirically examined as a case study, with the New Zealand Society of Accountants, domestic and overseas systems compared. It is shown that the NZSA, overseas bodies (especially the British and International Accounting Standards Committee), and preparers exert the most influence, with non-accountant stakeholders shown to have the least impact. The regulatory mechanism under the Model incorporates the profession's expertise, stakeholder representation, and the coercive power of the state. New Zealand corporate reports are found to be: difficult to read, lacking sufficient disclosure data, and imparting very little non-financial information. It is shown that these inadequacies are due mainly to the absence of a capital market overseer, critical lack of stakeholder input, lack of explicit objectives and ineffective enforcement mechanisms. External crises such as the 1987 sharemarket crash, company failures and publicised lack of compliance/enforcement have generated abundant public pressure leading to several governmental reviews. These reviews are deemed incomplete and unlikely to meet societal expectations. The research provides insights into accounting regulation and its relationship with corporate reporting in New Zealand. It is recommended that more effective regulation be introduced to ensure greater disclosure, recognition of stakeholder needs, and a higher level of non-financial data. It is argued that the proposed Model would help increase stakeholder confidence in corporate reports as it is designed to address the issues of the under-production of accounting information and information asymmetry...|$|E
40|$|This doctrinal {{analysis}} {{considers the}} impact of the 2002 superannuation reforms upon the treatment of superannuation in family law property settlement proceedings. Pre-reform the courts had limited ability to evaluate and split superannuation in property settlement proceedings. The parameters of inconsistency, uncertainty, lack of clarity and unfairness to women were identified to be key characteristics of the pre-reform law. Superannuation was becoming more widespread and valuable and notwithstanding changes in the public sphere women’s superannuation entitlements remained significantly less than men’s thus reinforcing the need for change. The 2002 reforms introduced a technical regime of superannuation payment splitting and flagging underpinned by <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>information</b> and undertake valuations but did not mandate the splitting of superannuation payments. Nor did the legislation provide guidance about how the discretion to alter the interests of parties in superannuation should be exercised. This doctrinal thesis presents a study of the relevant background policy issues, a review of the notable literature and a critical analysis of the significant case law to evaluate the evolving legal principles post reform. The parameters of inconsistency, uncertainty, lack of clarity and unfairness to women are employed to evaluate the treatment of superannuation in property settlement proceedings. The success of the post-reform law is also measured against the standard of a substantive equality approach. This framework focusses the findings of the doctrinal analysis throughout the thesis. The findings of the empirical analysis of the reforms reported in the 2008 Evaluation are assessed and compared with those of the doctrinal analysis. As well the results of the doctrinal analysis are assessed against the elements of the policy objectives identified by the Revised Explanatory Memorandum as being necessary {{to the success of the}} reforms. The reforms have led to improvements in the treatment of superannuation on separation and divorce. Separating couples can obtain information about each other’s entitlements that will allow most types of superannuation to be valued in accordance with prescribed valuation methods. Superannuation payments can be split and flagged, and the consideration of superannuation is no longer restricted to its treatment as a financial resource. Nevertheless there are shortcomings. The expected benefits of clear law to guide separating couples, lawyers and courts have been impeded by the judicial response to legislative ambiguity that has led to the preferred approach of treating superannuation as a separate species of asset. Consequentially there is no consistent treatment of different types of superannuation as property together with all forms of family wealth. There is uncertainty and inconsistency about the valuation of different types of superannuation. There is no consistency about the assessment of different types of contributions to superannuation compared to other assets. There is no certainty about the approach to the assessment of the relative economic positions of separated couples in relation to superannuation compared to other assets. Unfairness continues both because of the lack of retrospectivity of the reforms and as a result of layered disadvantage resulting from the evolving legal principles. Areas of future review and reform are identified and recommendations proposed. The retention of the discretionary approach is preferred to a rule based approach to property settlement generally or to superannuation specifically. However amendment of pt VIIIB is recommended to remove the Coghlan legislative ambiguity and to clearly state the policy intention of pt VIIIB by way of guidance. Also amendment of the transitional provisions is recommended to achieve fairness of access to the reforms for women. A range of other ancillary options are considered and the limitations discussed. Finally an empirical analysis of identified issues is recommended that builds on the present findings and addresses the limitations of the doctrinal approach. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Then he must avoid the opposite fault of naive egocentrism by giving his 2 ̆ 2 sadly long strain about Self, 2 ̆ 2 in Alexander Kinglake 2 ̆ 7 s phrase, a literary structure. ^ A number of British writers between 1766 and 1937 wrote literary travel books. They often traveled to escape a constricting home society, although, as Paul Fussell writes, British culture and literary tradition remain the 2 ̆ 2 norm 2 ̆ 2 in their books. In writing they deliberately overturn documentary expectations in favor of strongly individual books, marked by an idiomatic style and personal interpretation of the journey theme. Travel thus provides the occasion for both autobiography {{and a kind of}} literary amateurism, an experimentation in a form less rigorous than fiction or poetry but, through its very openness, offering novel opportunities for self-expression. Often, writing a travel book also leads the author to contrast himself with the class of heroic travels, to mock them or himself, or to show heroism in a new form. ^ Three pair of travel books illustrate the features and evolution of the form. Tobias Smollett 2 ̆ 7 s Travels through France and Italy (1766) makes the Augustan grand tour account a vehicle of splenetic tirades; Laurence Sterne 2 ̆ 7 s A Sentimental Journey (1768) rejects irate argumentation for intimate and spontaneous discourse. In Eothen (1844), Alexander Kinglake wittily undercuts the Byronic Romanticism of his Middle Eastern tour; Charles Doughty, in Travels in Arabia Deserta (1888), elevates the quest to epic porportions. D. H. Lawrence 2 ̆ 7 s Sea and Sardinia (1921) dramatizes a flight from modern civilization to a remote island; W. H.

40|$|The legal <b>obligation</b> on {{employers}} <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>information</b> <b>to</b> employees {{has grown}} {{since the early}} 1970 s. At that time, the emphasis was on disclosure for collective bargaining. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, the emphasis shifted more to disclosure for joint consultation. In the context of new legislation, the possibility of further interventions from Europe, and a greater commitment to openness {{in other areas of}} company and public life, disclosure of information for collective bargaining and joint consultation at work is again on the agenda. This article focuses on disclosure for both of these processes. Disclosure for collective bargaining is the most developed and potentially significant area of the law from an industrial relations perspective. Disclosure for joint consultation, however, has been the most dynamic area in recent years. Voluntary information provision by firms has also been a significant part of developing human resource management practice. The paper therefore provides a broad examination of the law on disclosure. The UK provisions are conceptualised as constituting an agenda-driven disclosure model; i. e. the trigger for their use lies within the bargaining agenda. By contrast, the provisions stemming from European initiatives are event-driven; i. e. they are triggered by specific employer initiated events that affect employment contracts in other ways irrespective of the representative context. In the final sections, we attempt a broader evaluation of the intent and impact of the legislation and assess {{the pros and cons of}} the different approaches.

40|$|If {{epilepsy}} {{does not}} affect the power of judgment, the patient can exercise any of his/her rights, except for obtaining a driver’s license. If the sickness and the medications affect the patient’s power of judgment and require protection over him/her, the patient should be placed under guardianship. In this case, the patient uses his/her capacity to incur liability with the consent of his/her guardian. If the sickness completely eliminates the power of judgment, then the patient, as an incompetent, cannot exercise any rights and cannot operate any transaction. There are some specific characteristics of epilepsy regarding the employer’s liability to employees for equal treatment during recruitment, employment, and dismissal. Epilepsy gives the employer the right to terminate the contract in the following cases: the employee does not comply with his/her <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the correct <b>information</b> about his/her condition; epilepsy affects performance; epilepsy is incurable and causes endangerment. In the meantime, the employee has the right to give a notice of termination of the contract when it becomes impossible for him/her to perform his/her duties. Regarding the employees who have job security, if epilepsy disturbs the usual conduct at the workplace causing inadequate conditions, the employer can terminate the contract. Under the Turkish law system, epileptic patients cannot obtain a driver’s license. However, the practice around the world does not completely prohibit the right of epileptics to obtain a driver’s license and instead, provides alternatives. These alternatives ensure that the patient does not feel excluded from the society and thus, unnecessary adversities can be avoided. (Archives of Neuropsychiatry 2010; 47 : 286 - 91...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Due to the {{increase}} in healthcare costs, generic medicines have been adopted for used in both developed and developing countries. When a generic or ‘multisource interchangeable medicine’ is to be registered, studies that prove that the generic is equivalent to the Innovator Product (IP) are used. The generic medicine is required to prove that it will mirror the IP in terms of safety, quality and efficacy and, in South Africa, the Medicines Control Council (MCC) ensures that generic medicines meet these requirements. Generic medicines may be registered using bioequivalence data obtained from comparison with a domestic reference product (usually the local innovator product) or in certain cases, a foreign reference product (FRP). The bioequivalence data can either be from in vivo or in vitro studies. The MCC guidelines require that for modified release preparations, in vivo bioequivalence studies are done for approval of registration; the exception being if a proportionally higher dose has already been registered. No information is currently given to prescribers and dispensers or to the public about whether a generic product was registered against a foreign or domestic reference product. Aims and Objectives: 1.) To determine the number of generic medicines in a predetermined sample registered using a FRP as comparator and to document the transparency of pharmaceutical companies when approached to disclose information regarding the registration of these products. 2.) To describe and document the use of the Promotion of Access to Information Act (Act 2 of 2000) [PAIA] {{from the perspective of a}} ‘layperson’ in the context of medicines’ regulation, in both private and public bodies. Methods: 20 modified release and Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class IV products were selected from the ‘generics dictionary’ – a commercial publication – and letters were sent to the manufacturers of the products requesting information about the tests done to prove equivalence and whether they were performed against a domestic or foreign reference product. The same information was also requested from the MCC. The requests were all made using the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA). Results: Nine companies were represented by the 20 products chosen. Information was obtained about thirteen products. Ten of these products were registered using FRPs. Four products were registered based only on comparative dissolution studies. Four companies <b>provided</b> the requested <b>information,</b> two companies responded by refusing the requests and three did not respond at all. The MCC refused the request for information even after an internal appeal was lodged. Conclusions: The Promotion of Access to information Act was unsuccessful in obtaining information from the public body, and partly successful in obtaining it from the private bodies. While the title of the Act seems to indicate that the Act can be used to obtain information as such, it only <b>provides</b> for access <b>to</b> specified records. The MCC and the pharmaceutical companies involved in the study were under no <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the <b>information</b> as the request had not complied with PAIA requirements. The use of FRPs for registration is a reality in the pharmaceutical industry in South Africa. Neither the public nor healthcare professionals who prescribe medicines or who are involved in dispensing generic medicines as substitutes are aware of whether or not a FRP has been used to register a generic. Interchangeability cannot necessarily be guaranteed if the reference product was not proven equivalent to the local innovator product. It is debatable as to whether or not this information would be of any particular benefit to members of the public. Prescribers may choose to write ‘no substitution’ on their prescriptions if they were unconvinced that an FRP is acceptable. This could have consequences for healthcare costs. Dispensers are the most vulnerable in South Africa as they are obliged by law to substitute generic medicines when innovator medicines have been prescribed. Dispensers’ views on the acceptability of the use of FRPs can be seen as irrelevant. In the end, as this study demonstrates, the only option in the present situation is to rely entirely on the MCC’s rigour in assessing applications for registration of generic medicines. ...|$|R
