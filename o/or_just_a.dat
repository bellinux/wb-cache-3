5|$|All {{medical records}} and documents, {{including}} Poe's death certificate, have been lost, {{if they ever}} existed. The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers have addressed the issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh's conspiratorial murder plot theory. It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of laudanum, readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer. Though it is unclear {{if this was a}} true suicide attempt <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> miscalculation on Poe's part, it did not lead to Poe's death a year later.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (<b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E
5|$|Once in Nightopia, they {{discover}} and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin {{a journey to}} stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia {{and the world of}} Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> dream.|$|E

25|$|A hieroglyphic {{writing system}} used by pre-colonial Mi'kmaq, that was {{observed}} by missionaries from the 17th to 19th centuries, {{is thought to}} have developed independently.

25|$|Problematic point(s): {{people need}} to know if a phrase is officially the name of that place <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> designation, e.g. Erzsébet híd is a name (‘Elisabeth Bridge’) but Duna-híd merely refers to a bridge on the Danube, so a hyphen should be used.|$|E
25|$|As logographic writing systems use {{a single}} symbol {{for an entire}} word, a syllabary {{is a set of}} written symbols that {{represent}} (or approximate) syllables, which make up words.

25|$|Band: Most units {{larger than}} thirty people {{will try to}} support some sort of musical ensemble, whether drum and bugle, drum and bell (glockenspiel), a {{military}} band, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> drum line. A very few corps have a piper or two, while an even smaller group maintain pipe bands, rare due to both {{the lack of a}} Naval tradition of piping, and the comparative expense of the instruments.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions require two {{licensed}} pre-hospital {{providers to}} operate a licensed ambulance. Some jurisdictions separate the 'driver' and 'attendant' functions, employing ambulance driving staff with no medical qualification (<b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> first aid certificate), {{whose job is to}} drive ambulances. While this approach persists in some countries, such as India, it is generally becoming increasingly rare. Ambulance drivers may be trained in radio communications, ambulance operations and emergency response driving skills.|$|E

25|$|To {{discourage}} employers {{from breaking}} {{away from the}} bargaining group, unions developed the whipsaw strike. In a whipsaw strike, the union strikes one employer (<b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few employers) in the multi-employer bargaining group. The strike is usually of a short duration (a few days or a week at most). The union strikes employer after employer. Strikes may occur one after another and may overlap, or there may be long lulls between strikes. The same employer may be struck repeatedly, with sometimes as little as 24 hours between strikes.|$|E

25|$|XML {{has been}} used to {{describe}} structured data and to serialize objects. Various XML-based protocols exist to represent the same kind of data structures as JSON for the same kind of data interchange purposes. Data can be encoded in XML several ways. The most expansive form using tag pairs results in a much larger representation than JSON, but if data is stored in attributes and 'short tag' form where the closing tag is replaced with '/>', the representation is often about the same size as JSON <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little larger. If the data is compressed using an algorithm like gzip, there is little difference because compression is good at saving space when a pattern is repeated.|$|E
25|$|Between 1707 and 1731, {{the center}} of {{activity}} shifted from the Main Crater {{to other parts of}} Volcano Island. The eruptions of 1707 and 1715 occurred in Binitiang Malaki crater (the cinder cone visible from Tagaytay City). Minor eruptions also emanated from the Binintiang Munti crater on the westernmost tip of the island in 1709 and 1729. A more violent event happened on September 24, 1716, when the whole southeastern portion of the crater (Calauit), opposite Mount Macolod, was blown out. The 1731 eruption off Pira-Piraso or eastern tip of the island created an island. No studies had been done to determine whether Napayon or Bubuin Island was formed in the eruption, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> pumice raft.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} of all nobility belonged to an informal circle of high nobility, measured by wealth, High Councillorships {{held by the}} family, and impressive medieval ancestors. Lower nobility was a larger group, clearly lower in terms of wealth, position and respect from social, economic and political regard. Generally, their members made cavalry service on behalf of one farm, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few in maximum. There was {{only a fraction of}} tax-exempted noble land in Finland compared with its proportion in Sweden proper. The Swedish manors were much concentrated in hands of families of high nobility. In Finland, as the contrary case, the nobility was generally so-called soldier nobility, {{and the vast majority of}} Finnish noble families had only one or at most, a few of manors, and mostly were regarded as lower nobility.|$|E
