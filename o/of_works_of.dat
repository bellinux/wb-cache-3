5|$|Beckford's Tower in Lansdown {{overlooking}} {{the city of}} Bath, was completed in 1827 for wealthy local resident William Beckford, to a design by Bath architect Henry Goodridge. Beckford was an English novelist, an art collector and patron <b>of</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> decorative art, a critic, travel writer and sometime politician, reputed at one stage in his life to be the richest commoner in England. In 1822 he sold Fonthill Abbey, and {{a large part of}} his art collection, to John Farquhar for £330,000, and moved to Bath, where he bought No. 20 Lansdown Crescent and No. 1 Lansdown Place West, joining them with a one-storey arch thrown across a driveway.

5|$|In 1890 Busoni {{published}} his first edition <b>of</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> J.S. Bach (the two- and three-part Inventions). In {{the same year}} he won the prize for composition, with his Konzertstück ("Concert Piece") for piano and orchestra Op.31a (BV 236), at the first Anton Rubinstein Competition, initiated by Anton Rubinstein himself at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. As a consequence {{he was invited to}} visit and teach at the Moscow Conservatoire. Gerda joined him in Moscow where they promptly married. His first concert in Moscow, when he performed Beethoven's Emperor Concerto, was warmly received. But living in Moscow did not suit the Busonis for both financial and professional reasons; he felt excluded by his nationalistically-inclined Russian colleagues. So when he received an approach from William Steinway to teach at New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, he was happy to take the opportunity, particularly as the conductor at that time of the Boston Symphony Orchestra was Arthur Nikisch, whom he had known since 1876, when they performed together at a concert in Vienna.|$|E
