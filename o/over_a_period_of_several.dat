Beginning in 1968, Djajakusuma appeared on television as an advocate of lenong, which was then limited to rural villages and {{on the verge of}} dying out. He increased popular knowledge of the form while arguing for proper remuneration for performers. Through the 1970s lenong was performed at Ismail Marzuki Hall, drawing considerable audiences, and several lenong performers found mainstream acclaim in the film industry.|$|E
5|$|Nicole and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought great rainfall {{to much of}} Jamaica <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> days. A {{maximum of}} 37.42inches (940mm) was recorded in Belleisle, Westmoreland Parish, from September26 to 30; most other parishes received more than 12in (300mm) during the same period. With a return period of 30years, these quantities tripled the monthly rainfall average for September at several locations. Though the broad-scale wind regime over the island remained gentle, the storm's intense convective bands produced three microburstssmall downdrafts of intense winds. With dozens of river banks and waterways blocked, the worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities primarily in southern parishes.|$|E

5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements {{that at one time}} or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, it is not to be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E
5|$|The exact date {{in which}} Philip II {{initiated}} reforms to radically transform the Macedonian army's organization, equipment, and training is unknown, including {{the formation of}} the Macedonian phalanx armed with long pikes (i.e. the sarissa). The reforms took place <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> years and proved immediately successful against his Illyrian and Paeonian enemies. Confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much Philip II's royal predecessors may have contributed to these military reforms. It is perhaps more likely that his years of captivity in Thebes during the Theban hegemony influenced his ideas, especially after meeting with the renowned general Epaminondas.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E

5|$|Written <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> {{years and}} {{influenced}} by European literature, Siti Akbari differs from earlier syairs {{in its use}} of suspense and emphasis on prose rather than form. It also incorporates European realist views to expand upon the genre, although it maintains several {{of the hallmarks of}} traditional syairs. Critical views have emphasised various aspects of its story, finding in the work an increased empathy for women's thoughts and feelings, a call for a unifying language in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and a polemic regarding the relation between tradition and modernity.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal {{to focus on the}} case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
5|$|Baorangia bicolor, {{also known}} as the two-colored bolete or red and yellow bolete after its {{two-tone}} coloring scheme of red and yellow, is an edible fungus in the genus Baorangia. It inhabits most of eastern North America, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains and in season during the summer and fall months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the mushroom, is classed as medium or large in size, which helps distinguish it from the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo bruising of the pore surface and a less dramatic bruising coloration change in the stem <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> minutes are identifying characteristics that distinguish it from the similar poisonous species Boletus sensibilis. There are two variations of this species, variety borealis and variety subreticulatus, and several other similar species of fungi are not poisonous.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Mala was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2006 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. In mid-April, an area of disturbed weather formed over the southern Bay of Bengal and nearby Andaman Sea. <b>Over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> days, the system became increasingly organized and was classified as a depression on April24. Situated within a region of weak steering currents, the storm slowly intensified as it drifted in a general northward direction. It attained gale-force winds and was named Mala the next day. Conditions for strengthening improved markedly on April27 and Mala subsequently underwent rapid intensification which culminated in the cyclone attaining its peak. Early on April28, the cyclone had estimated winds of 185km/h (115mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered Mala to have been slightly stronger, classifying it as a Category4-equivalent cyclone. Steady weakening ensued thereafter and the storm made landfall in Myanmar's Rakhine State on April29. Rapid dissipation took place once onshore and Mala was last noted early the next morning.|$|E

The tour had many disruptions and cancellations due to Noel twice walking out of the group, and Liam pulling out of a US leg.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed {{at about the same}} time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E
