5000|$|The Irish Deaf Society {{says that}} ISL [...] "arose from within deaf communities", [...] "was {{developed}} by deaf people themselves" [...] and [...] "has {{been in existence}} for hundreds of years". According to Ethnologue, the language has influence from both LSF and BSL, {{as well as from}} signed French and signed English, BSL having been introduced in Dublin in 1816. The first school for deaf children in Ireland was established in 1816 by Dr. Charles Orpen. The Claremont Institute was a Protestant institution and given that Ireland {{was a part of the}} United Kingdom, it is no surprise that BSL (or some version of signed English based in BSL) was used for teaching and learning (Pollard 2006). McDonnell (1979) reports that the Irish institutions - Catholic and Protestant - did not teach the children to speak and it was not until 1887 that Claremont report changing from a manual to an <b>oral</b> <b>approach.</b> For the Catholic schools, the shift to oralism came later: St. Mary's School for Deaf Girls moved to an <b>oral</b> <b>approach</b> in 1946 and St. Joseph's School for Deaf Boys shifted to oralism in 1956, though this did not become formal state policy until 1972. Sign language use was seriously suppressed and religion was used to further stigmatise the language (e.g. children were encouraged to give up signing for Lent and sent to confession if caught signing). The fact that the Catholic schools are segregated on the basis of gender led to the development of a gendered-generational variant of Irish Sign Language that is still evident (albeit to a lesser degree) today.|$|E
50|$|Co-enrollment is an {{instructional}} approach that brings deaf or {{hard of hearing}} students and hearing students together in a classroom. It is distinguished from mainstream approaches in several ways and more closely follows bilingual and dual language education practice and goals. In the 1960s and 1970s, many schools for the deaf in Scandinavia moved from an <b>oral</b> <b>approach</b> to a bilingual model. During the 1980s, many schools for the deaf in the United States began implementing bilingual curriculum under Bi-Bi model. During the 1980s and 1990s, this model was widely adopted around the globe. Co-enrollment extends the bilingual educational approach to include hearing students as well, with varying emphasis on Deaf culture. Programs following this model provide all students with access to signed, spoken and written language.|$|E

The various <b>oral</b> <b>approaches</b> for colon targeted delivery of drugs may be categorized as pH dependent (delayed) release, Time dependent, bacterial enzyme dependent, covalent linkage of a drug with a carrier, redox release system, bioadhesive systems and Osmotic controlled drug delivery.

Following an introduction which suggests that a child may have man: meanings for parents, the first section of the paper presents the stages of development from birth to one year for normal and deaf children. The second section examines the discovery and diagnosis of deafness in a child, and the stages of mourning [...] impact, denial, grief, focusing outward, and closure [...] that parents of deaf children experience. Subsections also examine the impact a deaf child may have on the parents and their ability to communicate with one another, upon grandparents, who often continue to deny the problem, and upon siblings, whose time with and closeness to the parents may be impaired because of increased attention to the deaf child.
