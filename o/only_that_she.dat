5|$|On LGBT rights, she {{supported}} {{the right to}} same-sex marriage. Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage in 2013; in 2000, she had been against such unions altogether and in 2006, she said <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages. In 2000, {{she was the first}} First Lady to march in an LGBT pride parade. In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).|$|E
5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of the}} leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, Jean Peters {{filed for}} divorce. The two had not lived {{together}} for many years. Peters requested a lifetime alimony payment of $70,000 a year, adjusted for inflation, and waived all claims to Hughes' estate. Hughes {{offered her a}} settlement of over a million dollars, but she declined it. Hughes did not insist on a confidentiality agreement from Peters {{as a condition of}} the divorce. Aides reported that Hughes never spoke ill of her. She refused to discuss her life with Hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers. Peters would state <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had not seen Hughes for several years before their divorce and had only dealt with him by phone.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1915, Parnok and Tsvetaeva, both of their sisters, and Osip Mandelstam were guests at Maximilian Voloshin's dacha in Koktebel. Parnok did not care for Mandelstam though Tsvetaeva was openly {{friendly}} and would later have an affair with him. By July, the lovers left Koktebel, just before Tsvetaeva's husband's arrived, spending a month on holiday in Sviatye Gory. In January 1916, Tsvetaeva and Mandelstam met at a literary salon in Saint Petersburg, possibly by chance, and recognized each other's talents. The meeting caused a heated quarrel with Parnok. The following month, Mandelstam's attempt to continue the discussion with Tsvetaeva, which had begun in Saint Petersburg, {{proved to be the}} final straw in breaking up she and Parnok's relationship. Tsvetaeva came home from taking Mandelstam to see the sites of Moscow to find Parnok entertaining the actress Lyudmila Vladimirovna Erarskaya. It is unknown exactly when Parnok and Erarskaya met, but theirs would be the longest relationship of the poet's life, lasting for the next sixteen years. In a pique, Tsvetaeva asked Parnok to return her Podruga and her manuscripts. Parnok was outraged, not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted her gift returned, but that she was trying to conceal the origin of the poems in their affair.|$|E
500|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod was {{sketched out}} long before its 1912 publication, {{and is a}} forbidding tale with relief only in the {{landscape}} illustrations. Graham Greene thought Potter was suffering some sort of emotional disturbance when the tale was composed, but Potter denied the allegation and observed <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was suffering the after-effects of the 'flu. She deprecated Greene's [...] "Freudian school of criticism".|$|E

500|$|The warrior Hector {{is close}} to their sister Polyxena, and is {{described}} by Kassandra as a bully. He disapproves of Kassandra's {{desire to be a}} warrior, but he is much loved in the city. As an adult, Kassandra reflects, [...] "of all , Hector was closest to their hearts, and [...] the least loved. Was it <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had always been so different from the others?" [...] Kassandra is happiest when she travels with the Amazons, whose chief Penthesilea becomes a mother figure for Kassandra.|$|E
500|$|Bannon's last book, Beebo Brinker, {{which takes}} place before the others when Beebo is {{eighteen}} years old, focuses on her realization not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is gay, but that {{she is also a}} masculine woman. Nealon writes that Bannon's exploration of Beebo's masculinity is not to give excuses for her desires, but [...] "to get at the source of specialness, the sources of her claim to be treated with dignity". By connecting her characters' bodies with their desires, Bannon allows further understanding of self as normal, and that homosexuality is acceptable.|$|E
500|$|Munsey {{had won the}} enmity of many journalists {{with his}} buying, selling and {{consolidation}} of newspapers, and the Herald became part of Munsey's moves. [...] The publisher merged the morning Sun (which he had purchased in 1916) into the Herald and attempted to revive the newspaper through his financial resources, hoping to establish the Herald as the pre-eminent Republican newspaper within the city. [...] To achieve that end, he approached Elisabeth Mills Reid in early 1924 with a proposal to purchase the Tribune—the only other Republican newspaper in New York—and merge it with the Herald. [...] The elder Reid refused to sell, saying <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would buy the Herald. [...] The two sides negotiated through the winter and spring. [...] Munsey approached Ogden Reid with a proposal to swap the profitable evening Sun with the Tribune, which Reid refused. [...] The Reids countered with an offer of $5 million for the Herald and the Paris Herald, which Munsey agreed to on March 17, 1924.|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless, [...] "Rejoined" [...] {{was still}} {{considered}} controversial {{because of its}} subject matter, which depicts two women who engage in a same-sex romantic relationship, and included {{one of the first}} televised lesbian kisses. During the course of the episode, no characters register concern about Dax being involved with a woman, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was an ex-spouse. David Greven, literary critic and author of Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek, said that [...] "Rejoined" [...] was one of the better-received episodes of Star Trek that dealt with homosexuality as a theme, but that the franchise overall had typically avoided LGBT issues. Bryan Fuller, who also wrote for Deep Space Nine, said that the franchise had usually avoided those story lines because of the paranoia of the studio regarding homosexuality. Dale Palmer, in an essay on gender and sexual politics, suggested that the choice was made to have a female same-sex kiss on screen because a male one would have alienated the main viewer demographic for the series.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Diesendorf, not well, had a happy {{weekend with}} her children, grandchildren and friends, {{attending}} a Spring Festival in Bowral, where her poetry was read {{and she was}} the toast of the party. [...] On the Sunday she went to an exhibition of French Impressionist paintings at the National Gallery, and wrote her last poem on a page of a calendar showing Monet's Waterlilies. The following day, it was apparent that she had pneumonia. Diesendorf refused medication and hospitalisation, asking the doctor <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> take care of her cat, Bibby. She died in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory on 22 April 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, Makin's {{argument}} for educating women reveals ambiguity {{as to whether}} women deserve {{a place in the}} public sphere, for her proposal of an educational model for women argues for women to be better wives, mothers or daughters, not to prepare women for the public sphere. Makin, though, in writing such a tract, deliberately participates in the public domain of 17th-century intellectual debate. Her postscript, advertising a school [...] "where, by the blessing of God, gentlewomen may be instructed in the principles of religion; and in all manner of sober and virtuous education" [...] (Makin 1673), reveals not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was still teaching at the age of seventy-three, but that she was dedicated to the betterment of woman's position in society.|$|E

2500|$|... "Appellant {{appears to}} believe that Garrity applies to any {{statement}} made by a police officer during an interview conducted by fellow law enforcement officials," [...] Manella wrote with regard to Lazarus's interview. [...] "She is mistaken" [...] since it applies only to information coerced under the threat of termination in explicitly criminal investigations, as opposed to statements given where an officer [...] "had no objectively reasonable basis to believe she was compelled to answer the detectives' questions," [...] as Perry had found, since {{she had not been}} ordered to submit to the interview nor were Stearns and Jamarillo in her usual chain of command, or working for the LAPD's internal affairs unit. [...] "The fact that she remained in the room answering questions does not support that she felt compelled, but <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wished to allay suspicion by avoiding behaving in a manner that suggested guilt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hayden {{indicated}} {{to me he}} had not authorized Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman to say Plame had been a [...] "covert" [...] CIA employee, as he claimed Hayden did, but <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was [...] "undercover" ... I obtained Waxman's talking points for the hearing. The draft typed after the Hayden-Waxman conversation said, [...] "Ms. Wilson had a career as an undercover agent of the CIA." [...] This was crossed out, the hand-printed change saying she 'was a covert employee of the CIA' ... Hayden {{told me that the}} talking points were edited by a CIA lawyer after conferring with Waxman's staff. [...] "I am completely comfortable with that," [...] the general assured me. He added he now sees no difference between [...] "covert" [...] and [...] "undercover" ... Mark Mansfield, Hayden's public affairs officer, next e-mailed me: [...] "At CIA, you are either a covert or an overt employee. Ms. Wilson was a covert employee" ... On March 21, Hoekstra again requested that the CIA define Plame's status. A written reply April 5 from Christopher J. Walker, the CIA's director of congressional affairs, said only that 'it is taking longer than expected' to reply because of [...] "the considerable legal complexity required for this tasking." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tour notably {{promoted}} Justin Timberlake and Usher when Jackson selected both as {{its opening}} acts during their early careers, exposing {{them to a}} wider audience. Both artists credit Jackson as a major showmanship influence from both [...] "an entertainment and evolution perspective." [...] While Timberlake was part of 'N Sync, Jackson personally selected them to open for the tour, helping to introduce the relatively unknown group to the public. Timberlake said [...] "I had her poster on my wall so I'm psyched", later describing the experience as [...] "fulfilling." [...] Jackson performed with the group on several dates, including joining them for a live a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Overjoyed." [...] A biography stated it was a [...] "highlight" [...] moment for Timberlake which [...] "gave Justin {{a chance to show}} his family and friends how far he had come." [...] The tour was the largest audience the group performed for at the time; JC Chasez commenting [...] "That was great because we got to see how a real professional tours. And not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is really sweet. We really enjoyed it." [...] Chris Kirkpatrick added, [...] "She is very good at entertaining. We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, they can buy the CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats every night. I learned a lot about how to make an artist look like a star." [...] Nick Lachey and group 98 Degrees opened for several dates and experienced increased commercial success following the tour. Upon the release of Never Gone, AJ McLean of the Backstreet Boys described his hair as resembling [...] "Janet Jackson on the Velvet Rope Tour." ...|$|E
