5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed <b>on</b> <b>land.</b> Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed <b>on</b> <b>land.</b> Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E
5|$|Both {{in water}} and <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E

40|$|Although all astronauts {{experience}} {{symptoms of}} orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight, only approximately 20 % actually experience presyncope during upright posture <b>on</b> <b>landing</b> day. The presyncopal group {{is characterized by}} low vascular resistance before and after flight and low norepinephrine release during orthostatic stress <b>on</b> <b>landing</b> day. Our purpose {{was to determine the}} mechanisms of the differences between presyncopal and nonpresyncopal groups. We studied 23 astronauts 10 days before launch, <b>on</b> <b>landing</b> day, and 3 days after landing. We measured pressor responses to phenylephrine injections; norepinephrine release with tyramine injections; plasma volumes; resting plasma levels of chromogranin A (a marker of sympathetic nerve terminal release), endothelin, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG, an intracellular metabolite of norepinephrine); and lymphocyte beta(2) -adrenergic receptors. We then measured hemodynamic and neurohumoral responses to upright tilt. Astronauts were separated into two groups according to their ability to complete 10 min of upright tilt <b>on</b> <b>landing</b> day. Compared with astronauts who were not presyncopal <b>on</b> <b>landing</b> day, presyncopal astronauts had 1). significantly smaller pressor responses to phenylephrine both before and after flight; 2). significantly smaller baseline norepinephrine, but significantly greater DHPG levels, <b>on</b> <b>landing</b> day; 3). significantly greater norepinephrine release with tyramine <b>on</b> <b>landing</b> day; and 4). significantly smaller norepinephrine release, but significantly greater epinephrine and arginine vasopressin release, with upright tilt <b>on</b> <b>landing</b> day. These data suggest that the etiology of orthostatic hypotension and presyncope after spaceflight includes low alpha(1) -adrenergic receptor responsiveness before flight and a remodeling of the central nervous system during spaceflight such that sympathetic responses to baroreceptor input become impaired...|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear <b>on</b> <b>land.</b> Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. <b>On</b> <b>land,</b> dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E

5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey <b>on</b> <b>land.</b> Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} the {{abundance}} of invertebrates crawling around <b>on</b> <b>land</b> and near water, in moist soil and wet litter, offered a food supply. Some were even big enough to eat small tetrapods, but the land was free from dangers common in the water.|$|E

5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time <b>on</b> <b>land</b> and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active <b>on</b> <b>land</b> during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E
5|$|Because banded sea kraits {{spend much}} of their time <b>on</b> <b>land,</b> they are often {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water intake and exhaust pipes of boats.

5|$|Few {{official}} surface {{observations are}} available for {{the passage of the}} hurricane. Upon making landfall, Kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16foot (4.9m) storm surge in San Blas.

The hurricane dropped about 1.38inches (35mm) of precipitation while passing about 60mi (95km) east of the offshore archipelago, Islas Marías. There, sustained winds reached an estimated 106mph (170km/h). <b>On</b> <b>land,</b> Kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18.91inches (480mm) at San Ignacio, Sinaloa, and 12.89inches (327mm) near Manzanillo, Colima. The highest recorded sustained wind <b>on</b> <b>land</b> was about 100mph (161km/h) at Tepic, Nayarit, with wind gusts at Puerto Vallarta reaching 50mph (80km/h).
