5|$|Anachronism {{is a major}} {{component}} of The Battle of Alexander at Issus. By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men in Turkish battle dress, Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European–Ottoman conflict. In 1529 – the year of the painting's commissioning – the Ottoman forces under Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to the Austrian city <b>of</b> <b>Vienna.</b> Then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called 'the golden apple' by the Sultans. Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege <b>of</b> <b>Vienna,</b> given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission.|$|E

5|$|In 1815 the Congress <b>of</b> <b>Vienna</b> fully re-established Swiss {{independence}} and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality. Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta. The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. Switzerland's borders have not changed since, except for some minor adjustments.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won {{numerous}} victories {{early on}} and declared independence. However, the declaration contradicted {{the principles of the}} Congress <b>of</b> <b>Vienna</b> and of the Holy Alliance, which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the liberal Greek insurgents.|$|E

The Confederation was created as a replacement for the now-extinct Holy Roman Empire, with Francis I of Austria—the last Holy Roman Emperor—as its president. The confederation did not have a flag of its own, although the black-red-gold tricolour is sometimes mistakenly attributed to it.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Blenheim (German:Zweite Schlacht bei Höchstädt; French Bataille de Höchstädt), {{fought on}} 13 August 1704, {{was a major}} battle of the War of the Spanish Succession.

5|$|The battle {{began with}} the French army outnumbered.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Vienna.</b> Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
5|$|After the Congress <b>of</b> <b>Vienna</b> {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation between the various German states resulting {{in the setting of}} the German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500g and which could be split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E
5|$|After the Congress <b>of</b> <b>Vienna,</b> a small Kingdom of Poland, {{known as}} Congress Poland, was recreated, with its king being the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I. Alexander I, an enlightened autocrat, {{decided to use}} Congress Poland as an {{experiment}} to see if Russian autocratic rule could be mixed with an elective legislative system, and rule Poland as a constitutional monarchy. At that time many hoped that this experiment would be a success and pave way to a liberalization in Russia; {{in the end it}} proved to be a failure.|$|E

5|$|Areas annexed by France {{during the}} Napoleonic era {{were the first}} to inherit the metric system. In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as mesures usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined them in terms of metric units – for example, the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress <b>of</b> <b>Vienna</b> in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} mesures usuelles, but France kept her system of measurement intact.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval architecture, primarily Gothic style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading {{to the rise of}} Gothic Revival architecture. Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and architecture are the Votive Cathedral <b>of</b> <b>Vienna</b> and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic longing for the medieval past, spurred on by the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again turned from the Classical to the Gothic style of architecture.|$|E
5|$|As {{requested}} by Walpole, George revived the Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by offering them the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers {{of his own}} choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and Prussia of the Treaty of Hanover, {{which was designed to}} counterbalance the Austro-Spanish Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Vienna</b> and protect British trade.|$|E
