5000|$|Originally, AAP {{missions}} would alternate with Apollo lunar missions, {{starting in}} 1969. However, when NASA's 1969 budget was cut, focus was {{shifted to the}} Skylab space station proposal, which managed to accommodate the equipment already specified {{for some of the}} AAP missions. Specifically, Skylab included the Apollo Telescope Mission (renamed the Apollo Telescope Mount) attached to the docking station used by the CSMs. Since the first two stages of the Saturn V had enough payload capability by themselves to place a pre-fabricated S-IVB workshop into the appropriate orbit, this enabled the [...] "dry workshop" [...] concept. This allowed the interior space to be better fitted out, although many design concepts from the [...] "wet" [...] workshop, notably the <b>open</b> <b>flooring</b> that allowed fuel to flow through it, were kept in Skylab.|$|E

40|$|Within a fast {{evolving}} built environment, understanding {{fire behaviour}} and the thermal exposure upon structural elements and systems is key {{for the continued}} provision of fire safe designs and solutions. Concepts of fire behaviour derived from research in enclosure fires has traditionally {{had a significant impact}} in general building design. At present, <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plan enclosures are increasingly common – building design has drastically drifted away from traditional compartmentalisation. Nevertheless, the understanding of fire behaviour in <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plan enclosures has not developed concurrently. The compartment fire framework, first conceived for under-ventilated fires in cubic compartments, has remained as standard practice. Although energy conservation within the enclosure was the basis for the current compartment fire framework that defines under-ventilated enclosure fires, little effort has been carried towards understanding the distribution of energy in design frameworks conceived for <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plan enclosure fires. The work presented herein describes an analysis of the energy distribution established within an experimental full-scale <b>open</b> <b>floor</b> plan enclosure subjected to different fire modes and ventilation conditions. The results aim to enable the designer to estimate the fraction of the total energy released during a fire noteworthy to structural performance...|$|R
