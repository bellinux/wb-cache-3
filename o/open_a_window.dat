Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> and escape, though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E

500|$|In a later {{meeting with}} General Paul D. Harkins, {{head of the}} US {{military}} mission to Vietnam, Diệm joked: [...] "I shouldn't have {{put him in the}} air force, because I had put his father in jail years ago". Diệm went on to predict that [...] "sometime I'm going to get shot right {{in the back of the}} neck. Sometime they'll get me that way". (He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the November 1963 coup.) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press. Off the record, one official admitted that [...] "e don't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more... had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy". Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that [...] "here's always going to be an opposition. If we take these people in, there will be another opposition springing up, because they are controversial men." [...] Madame Nhu added, [...] "ou <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> to let in light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don't want to be exploited by it." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Lex's key {{characteristics}} is his curiosity for the unexplained. Lex's primary motive for his [...] "shady" [...] actions derives from his curiosity, specifically beginning {{from the moment}} he and Clark meet after Lex hits Clark with his Porsche. Clark always appearing when something strange happens in Smallville does nothing but fuel Lex's curiosity. Rosenbaum believes that Lex's only sees two options: [...] "For Lex, it's either take a nice ride to Metropolis and work with his dad, or find out what's going on with this strong, strange fellow, Clark Kent." [...] Another characteristic of Smallville 's Lex Luthor—one that is being developed {{over the course of the}} series—is his evilness. Rosenbaum believes that what the audience sees in Lex's dark side in the early seasons is merely a taste of what the character is truly capable of. In the season two premiere [...] "Vortex", Rosenbaum requested Greg Beeman to shoot a close-up of him after he shoots Nixon, in an effort to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> into Lex's darker side. Rosenbaum intended to leave the interpretation of whether Lex enjoyed killing Nixon open to the audience. As Beeman explains Rosenbaum's thoughts, [...] "...either Lex is horrified and appalled, or he liked it, and it felt good to him". According to Rosenbaum, when Lex reaches that point where he uses all of his mind, and [...] "really flips out", that is the point where the [...] "world needs to hide". Television reviewer Brian Byun felt that it was this struggle between good and evil inside Lex that not only made him an anti-hero, but also, given that the audience familiar with Lex's mythology and the knowledge that he will end up being Superman's greatest enemy, make Smallvilles Lex Luthor a [...] "tragic figure [...] almost Shakespearean grandeur".|$|E

[...] The saying is related to a period of the economic reform of China that became known as the [...] "socialist market economy". Superseding the political ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, the reform led China towards a market economy and opened up the market for foreign investors. Nonetheless the Communist Party of China has wished to protect its values and political ideas from [...] "swatting flies" [...] of other ideologies, with a particular emphasis on suppressing movements that could potentially threaten the power of the CPC and the stability of the Chinese state.|$|E
