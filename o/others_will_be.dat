After the Games, some of the new facilities will be reused in their games time form, while <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> resized. A total of 30 competition venues across 14 municipalities were used for competition. Ten of these venues were newly built, while fifteen were renovated to stage the games.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly {{moving in the}} {{direction}} of the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E

5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and focuses on air battles during the Battle of Britain campaign of the Second World War. The player commands squadrons of the Royal Air Force and the main objective {{of the game is}} to defend key cities and radar installations from the Luftwaffe. Unlike previous games in the series, Battle of Britain is the first to include cursor movement, a scrolling interface and elements of first-person shooter gameplay. At the start of the game, the player is given the option of how many RAF squadrons they wish to allocate for offensive and defensive purposes; a proportionate amount must be sent to attack Luftwaffe squadrons whilst the <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> left to defend key cities from air raids.|$|E
5|$|Williams set out {{the case}} against utilitarianism – a consequentialist {{position}} the simplest version {{of which is that}} actions are right only insofar as they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number– in Utilitarianism: For and Against (1973) with J. J. C. Smart. One of the book's thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.|$|E

25|$|Just as the Sun {{and planets}} were born, {{so they will}} {{eventually}} die. As the Sun begins to age, it will cool and bloat outward to many times its current diameter, becoming a red giant, before casting off its outer layers (forming what is misleadingly called a planetary nebula) and becoming a stellar corpse known as a white dwarf. The planets will follow the Sun's course; some will be destroyed, <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> ejected into interstellar space, but ultimately, given enough time, the Sun's retinue will disappear.|$|E

The best performers race on Sundays, with two-year-olds running 1,400 meters and older horses running 1,600 and 1,800 meters. The top individuals may be used for breeding at Tersk or return to the racetrack for another season. Many <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sold at the age of three.|$|E
25|$|The {{reported}} {{reasons for}} self-harm {{differ from the}} reasons for suicide attempts. Nearly 70% of people with BPD self-harm without trying to end their life. Reasons for self-harm include expressing anger, self-punishment, generating normal feelings (often in response to dissociation), and distracting oneself from emotional pain or difficult circumstances. In contrast, suicide attempts typically reflect a belief that <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better off following the suicide. Both suicide and self-harm are a response to feeling negative emotions. Sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with BPD tendencies.|$|E
25|$|So I think {{individual}} {{women will}} react differently; some will not cook that day, some will engage {{in dialog with}} their husband, some will be out at the rallies and demonstrations that will be taking place all over the country. <b>Others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> writing things {{that will help them}} to define where they want to go. Some will be pressuring their Senators and their Congressmen to pass legislations that affect women. I don't think {{you can come up with}} any one point, women will be doing their own thing in their own way.|$|E

25|$|Eclipsing {{binaries}} are variable stars, {{not because}} {{the light of the}} individual components vary but because of the eclipses. The light curve of an eclipsing binary is characterized by periods of practically constant light, with periodic drops in intensity.

25|$|Conversely, failure {{can develop}} in {{programs}} of innovations. The causes of failure {{have been widely}} researched and can vary considerably. Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control. <b>Others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> internal and ultimately within {{the control of the}} organization. Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself. Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types: Poor goal definition, Poor alignment of actions to goals, Poor participation in teams, Poor monitoring of results, Poor communication and access to information.|$|E
25|$|During {{the metal}} type era, all type {{was cut in}} metal and could only be printed at a {{specific}} size. It was a natural process to vary a design at different sizes, making it chunkier and clearer to read at smaller sizes. Many digital fonts are offered {{in a range of}} styles for different sizes, especially designs sold for professional printing use by companies such as Adobe. The art of designing fonts for a specific size is known as optical sizing. <b>Others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> offered in only one style, but optimised for a specific size. Designs intended to be printed small may feature larger lower-case letters, chunkier stroke weights and thicker serifs, while fonts intended for display may be more slender. Optical sizes are particularly common for serif fonts, since the fine detail of serif fonts can need to be bulked up for smaller sizes.|$|E
25|$|The West Somerset Steam Railway Trust (WSRT) {{was set up}} in 1972 {{to operate}} the summer steam trains {{alongside}} the West Somerset Railway plc's commuter service. It had little to do once the railway became a purely seasonal heritage line but, in 1984 to coincide with the GW150 celebrations, was revived for education and historical research into the Minehead branch, and now has a small museum at Blue Anchor. The Trust's restored GWR sleeping carriage is on display in the Gauge Museum at Bishops Lydeard, and the Trust is presently restoring a GWR 'Toplight' coach which will be the first in a set of historic coaches on the West Somerset Railway. The Trust is administered by five voluntary directors. In early 2007, the Trust embarked on a project to restore two rakes of GWR coaches for use on the West Somerset Railway. Some of these were already on the railway, but <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> brought from abroad. The first of these, No 6705, was acquired from Steamtown USA. It returned to England, and after initial works at Crewe, is now at Williton for completion.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{thought the}} {{expansion}} {{would be worth}} the player's investment if they enjoyed Fallout 4. Kirk McKeand (Eurogamer) said there are no real choices to make in Nuka-World, though it still may be worthy of your time. Kat Bailey (USgamer) liked the expansion, and {{thought there was a}} lot to do in it, but not all of it is interesting. She said the expansion [...] "could be worse, but it could also be a whole lot better", but if you enjoyed Fallout 4, then [...] "there's good reason to pick up Nuka-World." [...] Nic Rowen (Destructoid) noted fans of the genre will probably enjoy Nuka-World, but <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> left unsatisfied. [...] Tassi believed it was worth the $20. Andrew Webster finished his review by saying Nuka-World was only for dedicated players.|$|E
500|$|Okereke's lyrics {{attempt to}} {{juxtapose}} the monotonous events—nights out on club dancefloors {{and waiting for}} a train—with the seemingly epic experiences—terrorist attacks and racial angst—witnessed in a city environment. The direct narrative approach divided reviewers. BBC's Tom Young concluded, [...] "Some will appreciate Kele's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives... <b>others</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> too distracted by questionable content such as... lines about sudoku to take Okereke's grumbles into consideration." [...] Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in Silent Alarm; he used The Smiths as inspiration {{to try to make}} a personal album with [...] "a real centre". The lyricist has noted, [...] "I wanted it to be a snapshot, a frozen moment in time. Like in a city, with thousands of stories going on at once, layered on top of each other... Although I might be speaking through the voice of a character, I'm still expressing, perhaps, my sentiments." ...|$|E
