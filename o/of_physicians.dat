5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found that a majority <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should {{be available in the}} primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Socioeconomic {{differences}} in use <b>of</b> <b>physician</b> services in Nova Scotia, Canada were examined. METHODS: The study {{was based on}} survey data, containing information on socioeconomic status, linked to physician claims data.

RESULTS: Large socioeconomic differences were observed in the use <b>of</b> <b>physician</b> services, with use inversely related to both household income and education.

5|$|Farquharson was the {{director}} of medicine for Toronto veterans' hospitals from 1945 to 1947, {{and at the same time}} served as president of the Royal College <b>of</b> <b>Physicians</b> and Surgeons of Canada. In 1947 he was appointed to the Sir John and Lady Eaton Professor of Medicine chair at the University of Toronto. From 1947 until his retirement in 1960, he was the Physician-in-Chief of the Toronto General Hospital. His well-known patients included Canadian politician George A. Drew, who he advised to resign as head of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and Leader of the Opposition following a near-fatal attack of meningitis; Drew did so, and was succeeded as party leader by John Diefenbaker, who later became Prime Minister of Canada. Farquharson established clinical teaching programs at Women's College Hospital and Sunnybrook Hospital, and expanded those already in place at St. Michael's and Toronto Western. He also appointed the first full-time clinical investigators to the Toronto medical school faculty and increased total faculty numbers from 40 to over 100. He became a Fellow of the American College <b>of</b> <b>Physicians</b> in 1947 and of the Royal College <b>of</b> <b>Physicians</b> in 1950. He was appointed a member of the Bacteriological Warfare Review Committee, established in 1950 by the Defence Research Board (of which he was a member from 1949 to 1952) and chaired by Dr. Charles Best. For his service to the nation, he was awarded the Queen's Coronation Medal in 1953.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st Century India’s health care system is {{strained}} {{in terms of the number}} of healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses. The health care system is also highly concentrated in urban areas. This results in many individuals in rural areas seeking care from unqualified providers with varying results. It has also been found that many individuals who claim to be physicians actually lack formal training. Nearly 25 percent <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> classified as allopathic providers actually had no medical training; this phenomenon varies geographically.|$|E
5|$|Beginning January 17, 1848, {{the eight}} {{founders of the}} Misericorde Sisters, {{including}} Cadron-Jetté, commenced practical training in midwifery under Dr Eugène-Hercule Trudele, a young obstetrician. The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet the obligations of their fourth vow. The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before {{two members of the}} College <b>of</b> <b>Physicians</b> and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the result that on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery. It is most likely during this period or the years immediately following that Cadron-Jetté learned to read and write.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, the Army {{realized}} that there was a shortage <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> specializing in anesthesia, a low salary specialty required in the military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. The first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under contract was Dr. Dolores Piñero from San Juan. She was assigned to the San Juan base hospital where she worked as an anesthesiologist during the mornings and in the laboratory during the afternoons.|$|E

40|$|As {{national}} health systems pursue the common goals of containing expenditure growth and improving quality, many {{have sought to}} replace autonomous modes (systems) <b>of</b> <b>physician</b> control that rely on initial professional training and subsequent peer review. A common approach has involved extending bureaucratic modes <b>of</b> <b>physician</b> control that employ techniques such as hierarchical coordination and salaried positions. This paper applies concepts from studies of professional work to frame an empirical analysis of emergent bureaucratic modes <b>of</b> <b>physician</b> control in US hospital-based systems. Conceptually, we draw from recent studies to update Scott's (Health Services Res. 17 (3) (1982) 213) typology to specify three bureaucratic modes <b>of</b> <b>physician</b> control: heteronomous, conjoint, and custodial. Empirically, we use case study evidence from eight US hospital-based systems to illustrate the heterogeneity of bureaucratic modes <b>of</b> <b>physician</b> control that span each of the ideal types. The findings indicate that some influential analysts perpetuate a caricature of bureaucratic organization which underplays its capacity to provide multiple modes <b>of</b> <b>physician</b> control that maintain professional autonomy over the content of work, and present opportunities for aligning practice with social goals.
