5|$|Colleagues have testified that, {{far from}} feeling bound or stifled by the Whiteman orchestra, as Green {{and others have}} suggested, Bix <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> a sense of exhilaration. It was like {{attending}} a music school, learning and broadening: formal music, especially the synthesis of the American vernacular idiom with a more classical orientation, so much sought-after in the 1920s, were calling out to him.|$|E
5|$|During {{the papal}} interdict on England during King John's reign, John of Tynemouth {{remained}} in England. He {{also served as}} a papal judge-delegate on several occasions. He died in 1221, between 25 March and August. This date of death is only recorded in a medieval work, the Annals of Dunstable, <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> to be the work of another canonist, Richard de Mores.|$|E
5|$|Noether spoke quickly—reflecting {{the speed}} of her thoughts, many said—and demanded great {{concentration}} from her students. Students who disliked her style <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.|$|E
50|$|Entrelac {{fabric is}} <b>often</b> <b>felted</b> {{to create the}} {{illusion}} of an intarsia argyle pattern; the felting flattens the entrelac texture but leaves the different-colored squares, as if the object were knitted in different colors.|$|R

5000|$|A shyrdak (шырдак, [...] ) or syrmak (сырмақ, [...] ) is a stitched, and <b>often</b> {{colourful}} <b>felt</b> floor- or wall-covering, usually handmade in Central Asia. Kazakhs and Kyrgyz alike traditionally make shyrdaks, {{but especially}} in Kyrgyzstan, the tradition is still alive, {{and many of}} the products are sold to tourists.|$|R
5|$|Considering that he {{majored in}} {{political}} science and economics, Kanō's family thought that after graduating from university, he would pursue a career in some government ministry. Indeed, through influential friends of his father's, he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance. However, his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin. The students of Japan's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers. The students were allowed to ride in rickshaws (jinrikisha) right to {{the doors of the}} classes, whereas teachers were forbidden. The teachers <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> compelled to visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice. In effect, the teachers were treated as servants.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 Zappa met {{conductor}} Zubin Mehta. They {{arranged a}} May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, {{the music was}} mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie 200 Motels. Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one. His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> {{that the quality of}} performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{after he was}} called back for army service and he was {{stationed}} in the northern suburb of Broadmeadows. However, he had disciplinary problems and disliked taking orders from his officers, whom he <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> were inferior to him. He left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as stokers. When the navy would not take his friend, Miller tore up his paperwork in protest, left the recruiting office, and walked {{around the corner to}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office. He was acutely aware of the risks, as many of his playing colleagues had been killed, injured or captured. The threat of combat increased when the Pacific Theatre of World War II opened on 7 December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The 194142 cricket season was cancelled and many cricket and football grounds were converted into army bases.|$|E
50|$|Rangers manager Walter Smith signed Negri from Perugia for £3.5 {{million in}} 1997. He {{was rewarded with}} instant success, as Negri scored 23 goals in his first ten league games. His low-key {{celebrations}} were noteworthy - <b>often</b> he <b>felt</b> the need only to exchange a handshake with other players and showed little exuberance.|$|R
60|$|No {{need to say}} {{how often}} Lucilla {{would have liked to}} have {{recalled}} that note for addition or diminution, how many misgivings she suffered on her peculiar mode of catching Robins, how frequent were her disgusts with her cousin, and how <b>often</b> she <b>felt</b> like a captive--the captive of her own self-will.|$|R

Examples are Truck covers (PVC coated PES fabrics), car trunk coverings (<b>often</b> needle <b>felts),</b> lashing belts for cargo tie downs, seat covers (knitted materials), seat belts, non-wovens for cabin air filtration (also covered in indutech), airbags, parachutes, boats (inflatable), air balloons.|$|R

25|$|In Chile, Argentina and the Canary Islands, godo was {{an ethnic}} slur used against European Spaniards, {{who in the}} early colony period <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> {{superior}} to the people born locally (criollos). In Colombia {{the members of the}} Colombian Conservative Party were referred to as godos.|$|E
25|$|Wood has a {{long history}} of being used as fuel, which {{continues}} to this day, mostly in rural areas of the world. Hardwood is preferred over softwood because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> to add ambiance and warmth.|$|E

25|$|In 1969 a {{religious}} uprising at the Pul-e Khishti Mosque protested the Soviet Union's increasing influence over Afghan politics and religion. This protest {{ended in the}} arrest of many of its organizers, including Mawlana Faizani, a popular Islamic scholar. In the early 1970s Radio Kabul began to broadcast in other languages besides Pashto which helped to unify those minorities that <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> marginalized. However, this was put to a stop after Daoud Khan's revolution in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Referred pain, {{also called}} {{reflective}} pain, is pain perceived {{at a location}} other than {{the site of the}} painful stimulus. An example is the case of angina pectoris brought on by a myocardial infarction (heart attack), where pain is <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> in the neck, shoulders, and back rather than in the thorax (chest), the site of the injury. The International Association for the Study of Pain has not officially defined the term; hence several authors have defined the term differently.|$|E
25|$|Despite a high {{enlistment}} {{rate in the}} U.S. Army, African Americans {{were not}} treated equally. At parades, church services, in transportation and canteens the races were kept separate. The Women's Army Corps (WAC) changed its enlistment policies in January 1941, allowing for African American women to {{join the ranks of}} Army nurses to strengthen the war effort. Much like with male soldiers, Black women were given separate training, inferior living quarters, and rations. Black nurses were integrated into everyday life with their white colleagues and <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> the pain of discrimination and slander from the wounded soldiers they cared for and the leadership assigned to them.|$|E

According to one reference, continental European pets get the implant in the left side of the neck. The chip can <b>often</b> be <b>felt</b> under the skin. Thin layers of connective tissue form around the implant and hold it in place.|$|R

25|$|As president, McDonald {{emphasized}} enhancing fringe benefit. The {{election of}} Dwight D. Eisenhower {{as president and}} the advent of Republican majorities in the United States Congress (at least from 1952 to 1954) made expansion of social programs unlikely even if some later occurred. To compensate, McDonald focused negotiations on benefits such as unemployment compensation, health insurance, pensions, tuition reimbursement, and more. Throughout the 1950s, however, McDonald <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> an intense rivalry with the Auto Workers (UAW). The UAW often won better wage and benefit packages than the Steelworkers, and were able to obtain the closed shop. McDonald's negotiating stands often reflected the interunion jealousy.|$|E
25|$|Sevareid always {{considered}} himself a writer first and <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> uneasy behind a microphone, even less comfortable on television. Nonetheless, he worked extensively for CBS News {{on television in}} the years following the war and the decades after. During the mid to late 1950s, Sevareid found himself on television as the host and science reporter of CBS's Conquest. He also served {{as the head of the}} CBS Washington bureau from 1946 to 1954 and became one of the early critics of Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communism tactics. It was during the early 1950s that Sevareid caught the attention of the FBI in its attempts to identify and root out American communists.|$|E
25|$|Until {{their first}} act of sexual intercourse, {{adolescents}} generally see virginity {{in one of}} the following ways: as a gift, a stigma, or a normal step in development. Girls typically think of virginity as a gift, while boys think of virginity as a stigma. In interviews, girls said that they viewed giving someone their virginity as like giving them a very special gift. Because of this, they often expected something in return such as increased emotional intimacy with their partners or the virginity of their partner. However, they <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> disempowered because of this; they often did not feel like they actually received what they expected in return and this made them feel like they had less power in their relationship. They felt that they had given something up and did not feel like this action was recognized.|$|E
50|$|Trachoma {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} Chlamydia trachomatis, which spreads through contact with an infected person. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections make the eyelashes turn inward, scratching the cornea. This causes excruciating pain. Although children are the most susceptible to infection, the effects are <b>often</b> not <b>felt</b> until adulthood. Women, traditionally the caretakers of the home, are twice as likely as men to have the advanced stage of the disease, called trichiasis.|$|R

25|$|Economic {{development}} did {{not bring}} prosperity to all. During the 1960s many of the rural poor felt increasingly dissatisfied with their condition in society and disillusioned by their treatment by the central government in Bangkok. Efforts by the Thai government to develop poor rural regions often {{did not have the}} desired effect in that they contributed to the farmers' awareness of how bad off they really were. It {{is interesting to note that}} it was not always the poorest of the poor who joined the anti-government insurgency. Increased government presence in the rural villages did little to improve the situation. Villagers became subject to increased military and police harassment and bureaucratic corruption. Villagers <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> betrayed when government promises of development were frequently not fulfilled. By the early 1970s rural discontent had manifested itself into a peasant's activist movement.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} whether {{certain types of}} sexual sensations should be {{accurately}} classified as orgasms, including female orgasms caused by G-spot stimulation alone, and the demonstration of extended or continuous orgasms lasting several minutes or even an hour. The question centers around the clinical definition of orgasm, but this way of viewing orgasm is merely physiological, while there are also psychological, endocrinological, and neurological definitions of orgasm. In these and similar cases, the sensations experienced are subjective {{and do not necessarily}} involve the involuntary contractions characteristic of orgasm. However, the sensations in both sexes are extremely pleasurable and are <b>often</b> <b>felt</b> throughout the body, causing a mental state that is often described as transcendental, and with vasocongestion and associated pleasure comparable to that of a full-contractionary orgasm. For example, modern findings support distinction between ejaculation and male orgasm. For this reason, there are views on both sides as to whether these can be accurately defined as orgasms.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period <b>often</b> <b>felt,</b> understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E
50|$|Sonnet 141 also {{exhibits}} a switch in tone and content at line nine. The first eight lines are {{primarily concerned with}} the speaker's mistress's imperfections, whereas the last six lines focus on the speaker's love. This switch in content {{is known as a}} volta; it is typical of the Petrarchan sonnet tradition and its influence was <b>often</b> still <b>felt</b> during Shakespeare's time, even in the composition of sonnets which (like Shakespeare's) did not follow Petrarch's rhyme scheme.|$|R
