5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, the U.S. Treasury had mints {{operating}} in New Orleans, Denver, San Francisco, and the main center in Philadelphia, which more than met the demand for minted money. In 1904, the government ceased the minting of the silver dollar, which accounted {{for the bulk of}} the coinage the New Orleans branch had been producing since 1879. In 1909 Treasury <b>officials</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> appropriate funds for the mint's operation, effectively halting subsequent minting activity in New Orleans. In 1911, the New Orleans Mint was formally decommissioned and the machinery was transferred to the main U. S. Mint facility in Philadelphia,.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, a special mobile force was {{dispatched}} by officials to assist in relief operations. Red Cross distribution centers were set up on Mauritius and served food and clothing to more than 500 by January 25. Despite the severity of damage, government <b>officials</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> appeal for international aid. Although no requests for aid were made, the Government of Norway provided US$10,000 worth of funds to the nation. Owing to the effects of Cyclone Dina and several other meteorological factors, the economy of Mauritius suffered significantly in 2002 as a whole. Annual growth dropped to about 1.9 percent from approximately 5 percent in 2001. The sugarcane industry suffered greatly from the storm, experiencing a 19.3 percent decrease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the interim}} between the Import Duties Act and the Ottawa Conference, Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget, in April 1932. The gold standard {{had been abandoned}} {{in the early days}} of the National Government; the Bank of England sought its restoration. Chamberlain, on advice from his <b>officials,</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> restore the gold standard, realising that a devalued pound would improve the balance of trade. Otherwise, Chamberlain maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at the inception of the National Government: Chamberlain cut means-tested benefits and public sector wages, which proved to be an unpopular move. He also cut interest rates, which led to a house-building boom in the south of England and supported plans to clear slums. Interest on the war debt had been a major cost in each budget. Chamberlain was able to reduce the interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of interest on the war debt.|$|E

In 2015, the stand-up coaster Mantis {{was transformed into a}} floorless roller coaster called Rougarou, receiving new trains and a new green and orange paint scheme in the process. Also in 2015, Hotel Breakers received a $25-million renovation. A new roller coaster called Valravn debuted in 2016 as the tallest, fastest, and longest dive coaster in the world. The [...] ride replaced the 40-year-old Good Time Theater along with an antique car ride known as Turnpike Cars. Calypso was also moved in the process to the beach area near Wicked Twister, where it was renamed Tiki Twirl. Raptor and Top Thrill Dragster were repainted as well.

50|$|The Miranda warning {{is part of}} a {{preventive}} criminal procedure rule that law enforcement are required to administer to protect an individual who is in custody and subject to direct questioning or its functional equivalent from a violation of his or her Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. In Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the Supreme Court held that the admission of an elicited incriminating statement by a suspect not informed of these rights violates the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, through the incorporation of these rights into state law. Thus, if law enforcement <b>officials</b> <b>decline</b> <b>to</b> offer a Miranda warning to an individual in their custody, they may interrogate that person and act upon the knowledge gained, but may not use that persons statements as evidence against him or her in a criminal trial.|$|R

50|$|On February 16, 2005, four Blackwater guards escorting a U.S. State Department convoy in Iraq fired 70 rounds into a car. The guards {{stated that}} they felt {{threatened}} when the driver ignored orders to stop {{as he approached the}} convoy. The fate of the car's driver was unknown because the convoy did not stop after the shooting. An investigation by the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service concluded that the shooting was not justified and that the Blackwater employees provided false statements to investigators. The statements claimed that one of the Blackwater vehicles had been hit by insurgent gunfire, but the investigation concluded that one of the Blackwater guards had actually fired into his own vehicle by accident. John Frese, the U.S. embassy in Iraq's top security <b>official,</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> punish Blackwater or the security guards because he believed any disciplinary actions would lower the morale of the Blackwater contractors.|$|R
500|$|A paid {{training}} session took place 27 October – 7 November 2009 at the Centre for bobsleigh teams {{in preparation for}} the 2010 Games. On 9–15 November 2009, a second International Training Week for luge took place {{in preparation for the}} 2010 Games with the participation of 156 athletes from 27 nations. Venezuela's Werner Hoeger was knocked unconscious during a practice run on 13 November 2009 and was denied any further make-up runs. During training that week, Hoeger expressed concern about the safety of the track. These concerns called for the resignation of track director Ed Moffat, father of lugers Chris and Mike, to offer equal runs to all lugers in future events, to have Canada forfeit any extra training runs that were negotiated for the 2014 Winter Olympics, and for the Canadian Luge Association be reprimanded for unethical actions and not providing a safe sliding environment, especially after speeds were [...] higher than expected. Canadian Luge Association <b>officials</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> comment though they stated to the New York Times that the lugers received up to three times the amount of training runs offered {{in the run-up to the}} 2006 Winter Olympics at Cesana Pariol.|$|E
500|$|The new candle {{sustained}} {{some minor}} damage over its first few years. On November 20, 1970, heavy rain and inclement weather snapped a wire helping keep the structure in place, and firefighters had to install additional braces the next day. Also that year, about 75 lights {{were stolen from}} the decorative Christmas trees set up around the candle's base. In 1971, the building where the Peace Candle was stored was broken into and the fiberglass paneling was vandalized. Easton <b>officials</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> discuss {{the extent of the}} damage, but Henry Schultz dismissed the vandals as [...] "kids". In 1974, the Peace Candle was only lit a few hours a night, and not at all on some nights, due to an ongoing energy crisis, which prompted the Metropolitan Edison Company to ask its Easton area customers not to use Christmas lights that year. Since the Peace Candle was seldom lit, charitable donations dropped in 1974, resulting in an $800 defect for the Easton Area Christmas Committee. Additionally the committee [...] spent $1,700 in Peace Candle Christmas cards meant to bring in donations, but only 500 packs were sold at $1 each. The use of less electricity to light the Peace Candle did not help the committee because the city paid the lighting bill.|$|E
500|$|The Tulsa State Fair, {{operating}} in late September and early October, attracts {{over one million}} people during its 10-day run, and the city's Oktoberfest celebration was {{named one of the}} top 10 in the world by USA Today and one of the top German food festivals in the nation by Bon Appetit magazine.

On a smaller scale, the city hosts block parties during a citywide [...] "Block Party Day" [...] each year, with festivals varying in size throughout city neighborhoods. Tulsa has one major amusement park attraction, Safari Joe's H2O Water Park (formerly Big Splash Water Park), featuring multi-story water slides, large wave pools, and a reptile exhibit.

5000|$|In July 2006, whilst Deripaska was {{involved}} in a bid to buy the Daimler Chrysler Group, it was reported that the United States canceled his entry visa; the unnamed <b>official</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> give a reason for the revoking of the visa. The Wall Street Journal reported {{that it could have been}} because Deripaska has been accused of having links to organized crime in Russia and cited as their sources two unnamed U.S. law enforcement officials. Deripaska had received a multiple-entry visa in 2005; a U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman refused to comment. Lobbying on his behalf had been done by former Senate Republican leader and 1996 presidential candidate Bob Dole and his Alston & Bird law partners, Senate records show. Alston & Bird was paid about US$260,000 in 2005 for work on [...] "Department of State visa policies and procedures" [...] tied to Deripaska.|$|R

2500|$|On February 28, 1903, Congress passed {{legislation}} authorizing various railroads {{in the city}} to unite to build a new [...] "union" [...] passenger terminal to replace the four existing terminals scattered about downtown. [...] This legislation led to the construction of Union Station, completed in 1908. This gave added importance to the new Ivy City rail yard, because the tracks to the new station would begin at Ivy City. By this time, the former racetrack site at Ivy City had significantly declined. The track had subsided, and rains filled the old track—turning it into a deep pond. In June 1903, a local African American boy drowned in the pond. Initially, city <b>officials</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> order landowner Daniel McCarthy to fill in the pond, as McCarthy argued that construction on the rail yard would fill in the pond. But when another boy drowned there in July 1906, McCarthy was ordered to immediately fill in the depression. There were also numerous housing lots in Ivy City on which no construction had occurred. As excavation began on Union Station, these unoccupied lots were taken over by the B and used for a tent city to house workers. [...] More than 110 men lived at the tent city, where living conditions were very poor. Most of the workers were Italian, and one worker died from pneumonia in October 1903. This led to an extensive investigation into living conditions in the tent city.
