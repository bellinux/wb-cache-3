In the 2011 {{local elections}} the Conservatives held overall control, winning 45 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> 51 seats. The Council elects a mayor and deputy mayor annually. For 2014–15 the mayor was Chris Mayne.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> crops was {{cultivated}} with obsolete {{cultivation methods}} escalating the problem. In the later period of Spanish rule the trading system was also inefficient {{in comparison with}} previous periods because of high taxes on exports and monopolising corporations which had total control of prices.|$|E
5|$|The Defence Forces set strict {{requirements}} for the vehicles to be produced. There was {{not enough time to}} develop a new model. Although outdated, the best <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> options was the Sisu S-21. Yhteissisu and SAT agreed to transfer Sisu S-21 lorry production to Yhteissisu.

Here the invasive Eurasian tamarisk, {{also known as}} saltcedar, threatens native plants by crowding, using most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> water, and increasing soil salinity by exuding salt through its leaves.|$|E
5|$|All three {{leaders of}} North Korea—Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un—have been smokers {{and the country}} has {{struggled}} to balance their public image with its anti-smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and different classes of quality range from homegrown to sought-after foreign brands that are considered status symbols. As a percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> arable land compared to consumption, the tobacco crop is over-represented in North Korean agriculture.|$|E
5|$|At the 1956 Games, Austrian Toni Sailer {{became the}} first to win gold in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> events; the feat was later {{repeated}} by France's Jean-Claude Killy in 1968. Sailer, age 20 in 1956, remains the youngest male gold medalist and was the youngest male medalist until 2014, when Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway took bronze in the slalom at age 19.|$|E

5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Crisis Core is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game in which}} the player controls Zack Fair. The player moves Zack through and between open areas, allowing him to talk with non-player characters, interact with the environment, and engage monsters in battle. At save points, the player may opt to take one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> side missions, and if so, Zack is moved to a special area to complete the mission, which usually involves defeating one or more monsters. If the mission is successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.|$|E

5|$|During 18 August 1940, Luftwaffe units flew a {{total of}} 970 sorties over Britain: some 495 by medium bombers, 460 by fighters and 15 by {{reconnaissance}} units. Of this total, about 170 of the bomber sorties were flown {{on the night of}} 17/18 August; the remainder were flown during the daylight hours on 18 August. Less than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> (or serviceable) aircraft on the Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 order of battle were involved in the action that day, so {{it was clear that the}} Luftwaffe was not greatly extended in providing forces for the offensive.

5|$|Generally the whorls of {{the shell}} {{increase}} rather regularly in size, however, species which are probably closely related, such as A. sinistralis (Reeve) and A. heccarii Tapparone-Canefri, can have quite different degrees of whorl increment. No attempt {{has been made to}} express these differences meristically, since most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> material was inadequate for statistical treatment. Actual dimensions {{of the shell}} vary greatly both within and between species. The minimum adult size is about 21mm high, the observed maximum about 75mm. There is not much variation in adult size within species: only a few species, notably A. maculiferus, A. sinensis and A. entobaptus, have a variation in adult size that is greater than seven or eight millimeters in total.|$|E
5|$|Graphically {{bounding}} {{the production}} set for fixed input quantities, the PPF curve shows the {{maximum possible production}} level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology.

5|$|In January 1961, {{as part of}} {{the process}} of decolonisation, the island's British {{authorities}} drew up constituencies and held democratic elections. Both the ASP and the ZNP won 11 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> 22 seats in Zanzibar's Parliament, so further elections were held in June with the number of seats increased to 23. The ZNP entered into a coalition with the Zanzibar and Pemba People's Party (ZPPP) and this time took 13 seats, while the ASP, despite receiving the most votes, won just 10. Electoral fraud was suspected by the ASP and civil disorder broke out, resulting in 68 deaths. To maintain control, the coalition government banned the more radical opposition parties, filled the civil service with its own appointees, and politicised the police.|$|E
5|$|In October, the Japanese again {{tried to}} {{recapture}} Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more men—mainly from the Army's 2nd Infantry Division—to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering {{the troops and}} their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling {{the approach of the}} transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on 14 October that heavily damaged the airfield's runways, destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level over the next few weeks.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> {{einsteinium}} toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% einsteinium {{ends in the}} blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over the bone surfaces is uniform and {{is similar to that}} of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> {{information}} {{relating to}} the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote.

The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida abbandonata—were abandoned by Monteverdi before completion; how much of their music was actually written is unknown.|$|E
