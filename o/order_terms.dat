25|$|It is {{difficult}} to solve this many-body problem explicitly in either classical or quantum mechanics. In order to simplify the task, two important approximations are usually imposed. First, the sum is only performed over neighboring atoms. Although the electric forces in real solids extend to infinity, this approximation is still valid because the fields produced by distant atoms are effectively screened. Secondly, the potentials V are treated as harmonic potentials. This is permissible {{as long as the}} atoms remain close to their equilibrium positions. Formally, this is accomplished by Taylor expanding V about its equilibrium value to quadratic order, giving V proportional to the displacement x2 and the elastic force simply proportional to x. The error in ignoring higher <b>order</b> <b>terms</b> remains small if x remains close to the equilibrium position.|$|E

25|$|The {{incompressible}} Navier–Stokes equations {{with conservative}} external field {{is the fundamental}} equation of hydraulics. The domain for these equations is commonly a 3 or less Euclidean space, for which an orthogonal coordinate reference frame is usually set to explicit the system of scalar partial differential equations to be solved. In 3D orthogonal coordinate systems are 3: Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical. Expressing the Navier–Stokes vector equation in Cartesian coordinates is quite straightforward and not much influenced {{by the number of}} dimensions of the euclidean space employed, and this is the case also for the first-order terms (like the variation and convection ones) also in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems. But for the higher <b>order</b> <b>terms</b> (the two coming from the divergence of the deviatoric stress that distinguish Navier–Stokes equations from Euler equations) some tensor calculus is required for deducing an expression in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems.|$|E

In this representation bound variables of the object language are represented by bound variables of the metalanguage. This choice has various advantages but makes the notion of “recursive definition” on higher <b>order</b> <b>term</b> algebras more subtle than the corresponding notion on first <b>order</b> <b>term</b> algebras.
