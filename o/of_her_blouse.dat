60|$|Blazes Boylan {{looked into}} the cut <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse.</b> A young pullet. He took a red {{carnation}} from the tall stemglass.|$|E
60|$|Neale tore {{open the}} front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> and slipped his hand in upon her breast. It felt round, soft, warm under his touch, but quiet. He shook his head.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Pride of the Ghetto" by Nathaldi Siehel, depicting a young gypsy woman against a wall, [s. d. ]. The young girl stands at center, her hands clasped in front <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> holding up a bunch <b>of</b> slack from <b>her</b> skirt. The sleeves <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lightly-colored <b>blouse</b> billow down around her elbows. Her hair is dark and thick, her large, almond-shaped eyes peering out directly at the viewer from under the bangs. Hoop earrings can be seen dangling from her ears...|$|R
2500|$|Russell's {{measurements}} were 38D-24-36, {{and she stood}} 5ft 7 in (97-61-91cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> contemporaries. Her favorite co-star Bob Hope once introduced her as [...] "the two and only Jane Russell". He joked, [...] "Culture {{is the ability to}} describe Jane Russell without moving your hands." [...] Howard Hughes said, [...] "There are two good reasons why men go to see her. Those are enough." [...] A publicity still for the movie showed her lying on a pile <b>of</b> straw, <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> stretched tight across her voluptuous breasts. Her right hand was behind <b>her</b> head <b>of</b> black hair and her left hand held a revolver. The image was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during World War II. She did not appear in another movie until 1946, when she played Joan Kenwood in Young Widow for RKO.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most notorious}} scandal {{followed}} {{an incident in}} Rostov-on-Don on 20 May 2004. At a press conference he insulted (using Russian obscene language) Irina Aroyan, a female journalist who had asked {{why so many of}} his songs were covers of American and European hits. During the ensuing discussion, Kirkorov eventually told Aroyan that he was [...] "tired <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pink <b>blouse,</b> <b>her</b> tits, and her microphone" [...] and demanded that she leave the room immediately. When she eventually did, his bodyguards attacked her outside and destroyed her tape recorder. The incident led to a major response and discussions in the mass media. On 11 August 2004, Kirkorov was found guilty of insults (article 130 of the Russian penal code) and was fined 60,000 rubles (about 2000 US dollars at the time).|$|R
60|$|He {{stood in}} front of her, his eyes {{glittering}} as he expounded. He kept her eyes fixed with his. Then suddenly he took hold of her. She half-started back. He drew the stuff <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> tighter, smoothed it over her breast.|$|E
6000|$|He {{suddenly}} {{undid the}} first button <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> {{and kissed her}} neck harshly, while she watched him, in a maze. He abruptly fastened the button again, sprang up, {{stared out at the}} wraith-filled darkness over the river, while his voice droned on, {{as though it were a}} third person speaking: ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly with a nimble {{hand she}} had unbuttoned and {{rolled up the}} sleeve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse.</b> She stuck her pretty blue-veined arm before his eyes. [...] "Look here, sir, it was you, wasn't it? It was your {{powerful}} jaw inflicted this bite upon {{the arm of a}} defenceless young leopardess--" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{the rhythmic}} oars plopped and creaked, as she floated on an unreality of {{delicate}} gray {{over which the}} sunset was poured out thin, the irritation of Cy and Maud slipped away. Erik smiled at her proudly. She considered him--coatless, in white thin shirt. She was conscious of his male differentness, of his flat masculine sides, his thin thighs, his easy rowing. They talked of the library, of the movies. He hummed and she softly sang [...] "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot." [...] A breeze shivered across the agate lake. The wrinkled water was like armor damascened and polished. The breeze flowed round the boat in a chill current. Carol drew the collar <b>of</b> <b>her</b> middy <b>blouse</b> over <b>her</b> bare throat.|$|R
50|$|As {{the first}} round begins, Kevin is distracted by an {{attractive}} redhead named Serena (Jayne Heitmeyer) who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello (Carla Gugino), a mysterious woman with platinum blonde hair and a white satin suit. When Tyler is unexpectedly knocked out by Ruiz, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Julia, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Kevin kills the sniper and Rick orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Julia escapes into the casino, covers her wounds in pieces <b>of</b> cloth from <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> and, after stealing a black satin jacket, disguises herself as a hooker.|$|R
6000|$|... "In these rags," [...] she demanded, with {{a sudden}} flash of passion that thrilled him. [...] "Look at the holes." [...] She showed rips and {{worn-out}} places in the sleeves <b>of</b> <b>her</b> buckskin <b>blouse,</b> through which gleamed a round, brown arm. [...] "I sew when I have anythin' to sew with.... Look at my skirt--a dirty rag. An' I have only one other to my name.... Look!" [...] Again a color tinged her cheeks, most becoming, and giving the lie to her action. But shame could not check her violence now. A dammed-up resentment seemed to have broken out in flood. She lifted the ragged skirt almost to her knees. [...] "No stockings! No Shoes! ... How can a girl be nice when she has no clean, decent woman's clothes to wear?" ...|$|R
60|$|Colter's {{big hand}} darted between Ellen's arms and {{fastened}} {{in the front}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse.</b> He {{did not try to}} hold her or draw her close. The unleashed passion of the man required violence. In one savage pull he tore off her blouse, exposing her white, rounded shoulders and heaving bosom, where instantly a wave of red burned upward.|$|E
60|$|Like a panther {{he leaped}} at her, {{fastened}} a powerful {{hand at the}} neck <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse,</b> jerked her to her knees, and began to drag her. Joan fought his iron grasp. The twisting and tightening <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> choked her utterance. He did not look down upon her, but she could see him, the rigidity of his body set in violence, the awful shade upon his face, the upstanding hair on his head. He dragged {{her as if she}} had been an empty sack. Like a beast he was seeking a dark place--a hole to hide her. She was strangling; a distorted sight made objects dim; and now she struggled instinctively. Suddenly the clutch at her neck loosened; gaspingly came the intake of air to her lungs; the dark-red veil left her eyes. She was still upon her knees. Cleve stood before her, like a gray-faced demon, holding his gun level, ready to fire.|$|E
60|$|A {{sweep of}} his long arm, so swift Ellen {{had no time to}} move, brought his hand in {{clutching}} contact with her. And the force of it flung her half across the cabin room, leaving the sleeve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> in his grasp. Pantingly she put out that bared arm and her other to ward him off as he took long, slow strides toward her.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a curious}} {{change in the}} girl's tone, from almost glad welcome to a note of abrupt fear in that last {{pronouncement}} of his name. She stood looking at him, the victim, apparently, of so many emotions {{that there was nothing}} definite to be drawn either from her tone or expression. She was a young woman of medium height and slim, delicate figure, attractive, with large, discontented mouth, full, clear eyes and a wealth of dark brown hair. She was very simply dressed and yet in a manner which scarcely suggested the school-teacher. To the man who confronted her, his left hand gripping the mantelpiece, his eyes filled with a flaming jealousy, there was something entirely new in the hang <b>of</b> <b>her</b> well-cut skirt, the soft colouring <b>of</b> <b>her</b> low-necked <b>blouse,</b> the greater animation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> piquant face with its somewhat dazzling complexion. His hand flashed out towards her as he asked his question.|$|R
60|$|She {{ran down}} the gravelly embankment, smiled at {{children}} gathering flowers in a little basket, thrust {{a handful of the}} soft pasque flowers into the bosom <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white <b>blouse.</b> Fields <b>of</b> springing wheat drew her from the straight propriety of the railroad and she crawled through the rusty barbed-wire fence. She followed a furrow between low wheat blades and a field of rye which showed silver lights as it flowed before the wind. She found a pasture by the lake. So sprinkled was the pasture with rag-baby blossoms and the cottony herb of Indian tobacco that it spread out like a rare old Persian carpet of cream and rose and delicate green. Under her feet the rough grass made a pleasant crunching. Sweet winds blew from the sunny lake beside her, and small waves sputtered on the meadowy shore. She leaped a tiny creek bowered in pussy-willow buds. She was nearing a frivolous grove of birch and poplar and wild plum trees.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, Debra debuted {{and shortly}} {{thereafter}} {{was featured in}} a Raw Magazine spread. At the beginning <b>of</b> <b>her</b> WWF career, she played {{the part of a}} shrewd businesswoman, wearing business suits. and Jeff Jarrett's girlfriend. Debra, however, began utilizing a new strategy during Jarrett's matches, distracting his opponents by unbuttoning <b>her</b> <b>blouse.</b> She willingly took off <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> to show the crowd her [...] "puppies", a nickname originally bestowed upon her chest by wrestler Road Dogg and later utilized by commentator Jerry Lawler.|$|R
60|$|She {{hesitated a}} moment; but {{seeing that the}} man {{remained}} motionless, his eyes still covered, as if lost to all his surroundings, she softly crept forward and entered the room. She held the crutches under her arms, but dared not use them for fear of making a noise. Step by step she stole forward until the table was within reach. Then she stretched out her hand, seized the revolver, and hid it in the folds <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor old Dick!" [...] She {{had stepped}} back. The sun lit the {{clear-cut}} profile of her cheek, and poured its gold over the bosom <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse.</b> [...] "Poor old Dick! Awfully hard luck, is n't it?" [...] Burdened with mignonette, she came so close again that now {{she touched his}} shoulder, but Shelton did not look; breathless, with wildly beating heart, he went on sorting out the flowers. The seeds of mignonette rained on his neck, and as she let the blossoms fall, their perfume fanned his face. [...] "You need n't sort them out!" [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|The {{gray suit}} was well cut, well made, and {{completely}} undistinguished. It was a standard suit. White piping on the V of the vest added a flavor {{of law and}} learning. His shoes were black laced boots, good boots, honest boots, standard boots, extraordinarily uninteresting boots. The only frivolity was in his purple knitted scarf. With considerable comment on the matter to Mrs. Babbitt (who, acrobatically fastening the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> to her skirt with a safety-pin, did not hear a word he said), he chose between the purple scarf and a tapestry effect with stringless brown harps among blown palms, and into it he thrust a snake-head pin with opal eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Bessie had a proud new blouse {{with a deep}} V, {{the edges}} of which gaped a bit and {{suggested}} that by ingenuity one could see more than was evident at first. Troy Wilkins, while pretending to be absent-mindedly fussing about a correspondence-file that morning, had forgotten that he was much married and had peered at the V. Una knew it, and the sordidness of that curiosity so embarrassed her that she stopped typing to clutch at the throat <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own high-necked <b>blouse,</b> <b>her</b> heart throbbing. She wanted to run away. She had a vague desire to [...] "help" [...] Bessie, who purred at poor, good Mr. Wilkins and winked at Una and chewed gum enjoyably, who was brave and hardy and perfectly able to care for herself--an organism modified by the Ghetto to the life which still bewildered Una.|$|R
60|$|As the rector {{moves to}} shake hands with Franklyn, feeling that he is making a frightful mess of his departure, a {{vigorous}} sunburnt young lady with hazel hair cut to the level <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, like an Italian youth in a Gozzoli picture, comes in impetuously. She seems to have nothing on but her short skirt, <b>her</b> <b>blouse,</b> <b>her</b> stockings, and a pair of Norwegian shoes: in short, she is a Simple-Lifer.|$|R
60|$|Lenehan {{observed}} {{them for}} a few minutes. Then he walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely. As he approached Hume Street corner he found the air heavily scented and his eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman's appearance. She had her Sunday finery on. Her blue serge skirt {{was held at the}} waist by a belt of black leather. The great silver buckle <b>of</b> <b>her</b> belt seemed to depress the centre <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body, catching the light stuff <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white <b>blouse</b> like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. The ends <b>of</b> <b>her</b> tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosomm stems upwards. Lenehan's eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular body. Frank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her features were blunt. She had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented leer, and two projecting front teeth. As he passed Lenehan took off his cap and, after about ten seconds, Corley returned a salute to the air. This he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his hat.|$|R
6000|$|... "By all means--I do {{not intend}} to interrupt." [...] He took a seat to the front and a little to the left of her, and sat in silence for a few moments. Her brown hair, piled loosely on her head, brought out the {{exquisite}} fairness of her complexion, and the big, loose sleeve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> made her hand seem like a child's, but it was strong and steady. She was working with her whole mind, breathing quickly as she mixed her colors, holding her breath as she put her brush against the canvas. She used the apparently aimless yet secure movement of the born painter. With half-closed eyes and head a little to one side, with small hand lifted to measure and compare, she took on a new expression, a bewitching intentness, which quite transformed her.|$|E
6000|$|Crossing to the hearth-whose Persian-blue tiling {{had taken}} her so long to find--Cecilia stood beneath a {{reproduction}} of Botticelli's [...] "Primavera," [...] and looked doubtfully at Mrs. Hughs. The Persian kitten, sleepy and disturbed on the bosom <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse,</b> gazed up into her face. 'Consider me,' it seemed to say; 'I am worth consideration; I am {{of a piece with}} you, and everything round you. We are both elegant and rather slender; we both love warmth and kittens; we both dislike interference with our fur. You {{took a long time to}} buy me, so as to get me perfect. You see that woman over there! I sat on her lap this morning while she was sewing your curtains. She has no right in here; she's not what she seems; she can bite and scratch, I know; her lap is skinny; she drops water from her eyes. She made me wet all down my back. Be careful what you're doing, or she'll make you wet down yours!' ...|$|E
5000|$|Following her lumpectomy, she {{documented}} {{the appearance of}} her scarred breast, thereby challenging traditional representation of that subject. In one image she documents the struggle between her real appearance (revealing her scars), and the glamorous representation of women (signified by the Hollywood-style sunglasses, and the seductive pose and drape <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> off her shoulder.) ...|$|E
5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines <b>of</b> <b>her</b> wainscot and <b>blouse,</b> which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress. The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|R
60|$|Blazes Boylan {{looked in}} <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> with more favour, the stalk {{of the red}} flower between his smiling teeth.|$|R
60|$|Clara sat in {{the cool}} parlour reading. He saw the nape <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white neck, and the fine hair lifted from it. She rose, looking at him indifferently. To shake hands she lifted her arm straight, {{in a manner that}} seemed at once to keep him at a distance, and yet to fling {{something}} to him. He noticed how her breasts swelled inside <b>her</b> <b>blouse,</b> and how <b>her</b> shoulder curved handsomely under the thin muslin at the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{before the}} Marvel Family's adventures ceased {{publication}} in 1953, Mary Marvel’s costume and appearance were altered: the neckline <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> was lowered slightly, {{her hair was}} shortened, and she now wore yellow slippers instead of the customary Marvel Family yellow boots. After Fawcett canceled their superhero comics line because of a copyright infringement lawsuit with National Comics (later DC Comics), ...|$|E
50|$|She {{made the}} {{headlines}} {{after she was}} shown joking with colleagues and checking her appearance, without realising she was live on air {{on the morning of}} Monday 15 January 2007. The Daily Mail said that she could be seen brushing her hair and pouting in readiness for her live broadcast, before putting her hand up the front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> to adjust her microphone.|$|E
5000|$|Richie's second mishap just {{so happens}} to occur {{at the same time}} as last orders at the local pub, so Eddie invites the regulars around for a quick party. Eddie amuses the crowd by doing impersonations of Richie - with a mop end on his head and saying [...] "Oh! Oh! why won't anyone ever have it off with me? Maybe it's because I'm a big fat ugly bastard with a {{microscopic}} penis!" [...] Richie (now with both legs in casts) then enters the room, although he is oblivious to Eddie's mockery of him. After Eddie convinces him that all of his friends have turned up for his party after all, Richie cheers up and attempts to boss over the activities. After attempting to divest a female guest <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>blouse,</b> he is stopped by the woman's boyfriend who then proceeds to get everyone together to give Richie the bumps. As they all throw him into the air, Richie hits the ceiling and his casts shatter, ending the episode with a close-up of him screaming in pain.|$|E
6000|$|Clara's hat lay on {{the grass}} not far off. She was kneeling, bending forward still to smell the flowers. Her neck gave him a sharp pang, such a {{beautiful}} thing, yet not proud of itself just now. Her breasts swung slightly in <b>her</b> <b>blouse.</b> The arching curve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> back was beautiful and strong; she wore no stays. Suddenly, without knowing, he was scattering a handful <b>of</b> cowslips over <b>her</b> hair and neck, saying: ...|$|R
25|$|Doctor Anicua {{also noted}} that <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> was a bit stained, {{indicating}} that the material was not a new garment, made for the burial.|$|R
50|$|Viva's film {{career began}} in 1967, {{when she began}} filming Ciao! Manhattan, which was not {{completed}} until 1972. Viva approached Andy Warhol about being {{in one of his}} films, on the suggestion <b>of</b> <b>her</b> friend, actress Abigail Rosen McGrath. Warhol agreed, but only on the condition that Viva take off <b>her</b> <b>blouse</b> for the role. Viva responded by adhering bandaids to her breasts and visiting Andy at The Factory.|$|R
