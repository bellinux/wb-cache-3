5|$|Conscientious objectors {{who refused}} noncombatant service during World War I were imprisoned in {{military}} facilities such as Fort Lewis (Washington), Alcatraz Island (California) and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas). The government assumed that COs could {{be converted into}} soldiers once they were exposed to life in their assigned military camps. Simultaneously the Justice Department was preparing to indict 181 Mennonite leaders for violating the espionage act because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> they adopted against performing military service. The draftees' refusal {{to put on a}} uniform or cooperate in any way caused difficulties for both the government and the COs. The treatment received by nearly 2000 of these absolute COs included short rations, solitary confinement and physical abuse so severe as to cause the deaths of two Hutterite draftees.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's role in {{politics}} was diminishing when on 16 October 1551 Seymour {{was arrested on}} charges of treason. In December he was put on trial and although acquitted of treason, he was judged guilty of felony and put to death on 22 January 1552. This {{was the beginning of}} the breach between Cranmer and Dudley. It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency. However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of canon law, the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> of doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Statement that {{eventually}} became the Forty-Two Articles are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles. In 1551 Cranmer presented a version <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> to the bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort into developing the articles, most likely due {{to work on the}} canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade. By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and John Cheke, his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the Forty-Two Articles were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the articles were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king. This was not in fact the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the articles were developed {{during the time of the}} Convocation—hence evading a direct answer. The council gave Cranmer the unfortunate task of requiring subscription to the articles from the bishops, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title-page. It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render the subscriptions futile.|$|E

25|$|Irony {{is one of}} Austen's most {{characteristic}} {{and most}} discussed literary techniques. She contrasts the plain meaning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> with the comic, undermining {{the meaning of the}} original to create ironic disjunctions.

2500|$|Evidentiality {{is often}} {{considered}} to be <b>a</b> sub-type <b>of</b> epistemic modality (see, for example, Palmer 1986, Kiefer 1994).

25|$|As practiced, a {{proof is}} {{expressed}} in natural language and is a rigorous argument intended to convince the audience of the truth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement.</b> The standard of rigor is not absolute and has varied throughout history.

In order to gain acceptance, a proof has to meet communal statements of rigor; an argument considered vague or incomplete may be rejected.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} of Hungary by the Soviet Union in 1956 disgusted Abe, {{who attempted to}} split from the Communist Party. At the time, however, resignations from the party were not accepted. Four years later, in 1962, he was forcibly expelled from the party. His political activity {{came to an end}} in 1967 in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> published by himself, his wife, Yasunari Kawabata, and Kenzaburō Ōe protesting the treatment of writers, artists, and intellectuals in Communist China.|$|E
25|$|For instance, de Haan (1999, 2001, 2005) {{states that}} evidentiality asserts {{evidence}} while epistemic modality evaluates evidence and that evidentiality is {{more akin to}} a deictic category marking the relationship between speakers and events/actions (like the way demonstratives mark the relationship between speakers and objects, see also Joseph 2003). Aikhenvald (2003) finds that evidentials may indicate a speaker's attitude about the validity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> {{but this is not}} a required feature of evidentials. Additionally, she finds that evidential-marking may co-occur with epistemic-marking, but it may also co-occur with aspectual/tense or mirative marking.|$|E

25|$|To {{establish}} a mathematical statement as a theorem, a proof is required, that is, {{a line of}} reasoning from axioms in the system (and other, already established theorems) to the given statement must be demonstrated. However, the proof is usually considered as separate from the theorem statement. Although more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish the status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> as a theorem. The Pythagorean theorem and the law of quadratic reciprocity are contenders {{for the title of}} theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.|$|E
25|$|Irenaeus, in {{the late}} second-century, quotes from 1st and 2nd John, and states that he is quoting the Apostle John. Eusebius claimed that the author of 2nd and 3rd John was not John the Apostle but {{actually}} John the Elder, due to the introductions of the epistles. However, modern scholars have argued that Eusibius made this conclusion based on a misinterpretation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> from Papias {{and a desire to}} invent a second John to be the author of Revelation. Carson suggests that the vocabulary, structure, grammar of the Gospel of John is remarkably similar to 1st John, 2nd John and 3rd John.|$|E
25|$|The {{view has}} been taken {{that it may be}} rather {{burdensome}} for the Prosecution to have to prove the alleged contemnor was unaware of any rational basis for the criticism. Furthermore, although the Court did not mention this, since the effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> has to be judged from an average reasonable person's point of view, perhaps the rational basis for the criticism should be apparent to the person in some manner. For example, there could be a requirement that the statement expressly mention the basis, or {{that it is possible to}} imply the basis from the statement. The basis might also be discernible from external sources such as media reports, so long as this is clear to an average reasonable person.|$|E
