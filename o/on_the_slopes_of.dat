5|$|In September 1841, Hermano Pule {{traveled}} from Manila to Bay, Laguna {{to meet with}} the cofradía members that evaded capture. Anticipating an imminent attack, Pule and Purgatorio rallied 4,000 followers at Barrio Isabang <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Mount Banahaw. A group of pagan Aetas from Sierra Madre also allied themselves with the cofradía.|$|E
5|$|The long barrow gained {{its name}} from the Chestnuts, an area of {{woodland}} that crowns the hill <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> which the barrow is located. Prior to the adoption of this name, the site was known locally as Stony or Long Warren.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} rocks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> seamounts {{are heavily}} populated by suspension feeders, particularly corals, which {{capitalize on the}} strong currents around the seamount to supply them with food. This is in sharp contrast with the typical deep-sea habitat, where deposit-feeding animals rely on food they get off the ground. In tropical zones extensive coral growth results {{in the formation of}} coral atolls late in the seamount's life.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, Reshef {{focused on}} clearing the Tirtur Road. He left {{a battalion of}} around 30 tanks between the junction and {{the western part of}} the Chinese Farm, and prepared to attack with two armored battalions provided by Sharon. He concentrated on the section of the Tirtur Road defended by an Egyptian battalion forming the left flank of the 16th Infantry Brigade. One of Reshef's battalions attacked from the north-east, the other from the west. The Egyptian battalion managed to halt the advance, aided by fire from tanks and anti-tank weapons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Missouri, a hill north-west of the Chinese Farm, causing Reshef to break off his attack.|$|E

5|$|At one time, three churches {{stood on}} Hirta. Christ Church, in {{the site of}} the {{graveyard}} at the centre of the village, was in use in 1697 and was the largest, but this thatched-roof structure was too small to hold the entire population, and most of the congregation had to gather in the churchyard during services. St Brendan's Church lay over a kilometre away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Ruival, and St Columba's at the west end of the village street, but little is left of these buildings. A new kirk and manse were erected at the east end of the village in 1830 and a Factor's house in 1860.|$|E
5|$|Built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Mount Carmel, the {{settlement}} {{has a history}} spanning more than 3,000 years. The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was Tell Abu Hawam, a small port city established in the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE). In the 3rd century CE, Haifa {{was known as a}} dye-making center. Over the centuries, the city has changed hands: being conquered and ruled by the Phoenicians, Persians, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, British, and the Israelis. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the Haifa Municipality has governed the city.|$|E
5|$|Hardwood {{trees and}} hemlocks occur <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> {{the valley of}} Roaring Creek. Hemlocks also occur in the creek's gorge. The canopy {{coverage}} at four sites on the creek ranges from 0 percent to 75 percent. The algal biomass of the creek ranges from 0.01 to 1.21 in terms of chlorophyll a per square centimeter. The Roaring Creek Bluffs are listed on the Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory. Jeweled shooting-star, which is threatened in Pennsylvania, occurs at this site. Other plant species in this area include hydrangea, fragile fern, maidenhair spleenwort, golden saxifrage. However, several weedy plants also grow in the area.|$|E

When consulted, a priestess of the Great Goddess tells Hecuba and her husband, King Priam, that the dream indicates she will birth a son who will bring destruction to Troy. Priam declares that this boy must be exposed to death, but upon his birth three days later, Priam agrees to Hecuba's pleas and has him fostered by a shepherd <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Mount Ida. Priam names the boy Alexandros (later Paris), and names his twin sister Alexandra, whom Hecuba keeps and decides to call Kassandra.|$|E
5|$|In total, Kawaguchi's forces {{lost about}} 830 {{killed in the}} attack, {{including}} 350 in Tamura's battalion, 200 in Kokusho's battalion, 120 in Oka's force, 100 in the Kuma battalion, and 60 in Watanabe's battalion. An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the Matanikau. On and around the ridge, the Marines counted 500 Japanese dead, including 200 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Hill 123. The Marines suffered 80 killed between 12 and 14 September.|$|E

The grotto of Seokguram and the temple of Bulguksa were the first Korean sites to be included on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995. In addition, the ruins of the old Hwangnyongsa temple, said to have been Korean's largest, are preserved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Toham Mountain.

5|$|On 3 February the Allied army {{encountered}} the main Argentine force commanded by Rosas himself. On paper, {{the two sides}} were well-matched. The Allies included 20,000 Argentines, 2,000 Uruguayans, 4,000 Brazilian elite troops totalling 26,000 men and 45 cannon (16,000 cavalrymen, 9,000 infantrymen and 1,000 artillerymen). On the Argentine side, Rosas had 15,000 cavalrymen, 10,000 infantrymen and 1,000 artillerymen, totalling 26,000 men and 60 cannon. Rosas {{had been able to}} select the best positions for his army, choosing the high ground <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> a hill at Caseros, which lay {{on the other side of}} the Morón creek. His headquarters were in a mansion at the top of Caseros.|$|E
5|$|Suharto {{was posted}} to a PETA coastal defence {{battalion}} at Wates, south of Yogyakarta, {{until he was}} admitted for training for company commander (chudancho) in Bogor from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in Surakarta, Jakarta, and Madiun. The Japanese surrender and Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in August 1945 occurred while Suharto was posted to the remote Brebeg area (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Mount Wilis) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese {{in the aftermath of}} the failed PETA rebellion of February 1945 in Blitar, led by Supriyadi.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd {{battalion}} 116th RCT forced its {{way across}} the flats and up the bluff between WN-66 (which defended the D-3 draw at Les Moulins), and WN-65 (defending the E-1 draw). They advanced in small groups, supported by the heavy weapons of M/116, who were held {{at the base of the}} bluff. Progress was slowed by mines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> the bluff, but elements of all three rifle companies, as well as a stray section of G/116, had gained the top by 09:00, causing the defenders at WN-62 to mistakenly report that both WN-65 and WN-66 had been taken.|$|E

Napoleon {{could not see}} Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under d'Erlon with 16,000 {{infantry}} and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under Reille with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn La Belle Alliance were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the Imperial Guard, and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Howe Island {{stick insect}} {{disappeared}} from the main island soon after the introduction of rats in 1918. In 2001 a tiny population was discovered in a single Melaleuca howeana shrub <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Ball's Pyramid, has been successfully bred in captivity, and is nearing re-introduction to the main island. The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summer months. Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe Placostylus), has also {{been affected by the}} introduction of rats. Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive breeding program is under way to save the snail from extinction.|$|E
5|$|The alpine runs (Le piste alpine) {{were built}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Monte Tofana and Monte Faloria {{in the nearby}} Dolomite alps.

In previous years, lack of snow was never an issue, but in the winter of 1956 there was insufficient snowfall for skiers to safely navigate the runs. As a consequence, snow had to be transported {{from other parts of the}} mountains by the Italian army.|$|E
