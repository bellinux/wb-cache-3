5|$|After Shirley had {{returned}} home that afternoon, the mob, which had seized another naval officer and several petty officers, {{returned to his}} house. Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to fire at the mob, but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley's men from firing and to persuade the mob to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron. It was only after the Massachusetts Council adopted resolutions {{in support of the}} demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> that the situation became quieter in Boston. The mob eventually released its hostages and Knowles released the impressed seamen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} peace was {{completely}} restored in the city, {{the cost to}} the state for suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> was between $80,000 and $85,000. Later that year, the B agreed to a number of reforms: crewmen would not be called to work more than an hour before a train's departure, crews were to be paid a quarter of a day's pay if the train they were working was canceled, and passes were to be given for men working who had long layovers. In 1880, the B Employees Relief Association was established.|$|E

40|$|I {{examined}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspecific <b>mobbing</b> call <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) on nest defence against arial predator (kestrel). I used a playback {{experiment in}} <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a dummy of kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in two variants either with nature look or with adjusted key features (pigeon beak, claws and eyes), and pigeon (Columba palumbus) as a control. Shrikes were attracted by <b>the</b> <b>mobbing</b> call and arrived to their nests faster. Only the modified kestrel was attacked more likely in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playback, that suggests possible function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mobbing</b> call as a cue for social learning of predator recognition...|$|R
5|$|In 1190, 150 local Jews {{were killed}} in a pogrom in the castle keep, most of them {{committed}} suicide in order not to fall to the hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mob.</b> Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone {{in the middle of the}} 13th century, creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design, supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse. During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338, York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England, as well as an important military base of operations.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson County sheriff moved Dinning to Bowling Green and {{eventually}} to Louisville {{to prevent him from}} being lynched. Governor Bradley dispatched a squad of the state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded. Despite the fact that the case involved a black man killing a white man, most observers believed Dinning would be acquitted on grounds of self-defense. The jury, however, convicted Dinning of manslaughter and sentenced him to seven years of hard labor. Immediately, Bradley's office was flooded with requests for him to intervene on Dinning's behalf. The requests came from blacks and whites, some of them ex-Confederates. Dinning's attorney, Augustus E. Willson, formally requested a pardon, and Bradley issued it 10days after the conviction. Bradley opined that Dinning had acted reasonably under the circumstances and that it was a shame that no members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> were charged. After being freed, Dinning relocated to Indiana and hired ex-Confederate Bennett H. Young to file a federal lawsuit against some members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> that had identified themselves during his trial. The trial was held in Louisville, and Dinning was awarded $50,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
40|$|Neurogenesis in {{the adult}} brain occurs {{continuously}} throughout life. The main olfactory bulb (<b>MOB)</b> is <b>the</b> first central relay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> olfactory system.

Ten to 15 days after ischemia/reperfusion, no difference in numbers of DCX immunoreactive neuroblasts was found in <b>the</b> <b>MOB.</b> Thirty days after ischemia/reperfusion, significant increase of DCX immunoreactive cells was observed in all layers of ischemic MOB.

5|$|Jennings slowly {{began to}} chip away at Rutter's record, first by winning $714.29 in 2006 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mob</b> on NBC's 1 vs. 100. A year later, Jennings won the Grand Slam tournament on Game Show Network and the $100,000 top prize by {{defeating}} Ogi Ogas in the final round. Finally, on October 10, 2008, Jennings passed Rutter by winning $500,000 on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. He extended the record by winning $300,000 in The IBM Challenge, where he and Rutter took on IBM supercomputer Watson in a special 2011 Jeopardy! event. Rutter won $200,000 in the challenge, in which both he and Jennings pledged half of their winnings to charity. He then added $100,000 more later in 2011 when he appeared on Million Dollar Mind Game, raising his total to $3,555,102, second only to Jennings' $3,923,414.29.|$|E
5|$|The Abdullah {{case that}} had brought him to South Africa {{concluded}} in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi {{as he prepared to}} return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mob.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the rest}} of the family gets used to their new home, Marge becomes homesick. Homer sneaks her back into Springfield one night under the {{disguise}} of Mr. Burns and Smithers, and they spend the night getting drunk and subsequently having drunken sex in their old abandoned home. However, Chief Wiggum sees through their disguises, and rallies the people of Springfield to the Simpson home to capture Homer and Marge. Marge is initially angry at the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mob,</b> but she stuns them by saying that she does not want to live in Springfield or deal with them anymore, having found a place to live where she and her family can be accepted for who they are and love each other without worry of hate and judgment from others. Marge and Homer march through the visibly disillusioned crowd and return to The Outlands. Back in the Simpsons' new home, Bart discovers Lenny and Carl sneaking in. They tell the family they long to start a new life in The Outlands. Soon, Moe, Mayor Quimby, and many other Springfield residents show up, wishing to abandon their lives in Springfield and start over in The Outlands. Soon, all of Springfield moves there to start new lives with the Simpsons, and they begin rebuilding a new city which they name Springfield.|$|E

5|$|Richard I was crowned King in 1189 and {{announced}} {{his intention to}} join the Crusades; this inflamed anti-Jewish sentiment. Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked. In York, tensions broke out into violence the following year. Richard de Malbis, who owed money to the powerful Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln, exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York. Josce of York, {{the leader of the}} Jewish community, led the local Jewish families into the royal castle, where they took refuge in the wooden keep. The mob surrounded the castle, and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation, the Jews, fearing the entry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> or being handed over to the sheriff, refused to allow him back in. The constable appealed to the sheriff, who called out his own men and laid siege to the keep. The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews' position became untenable. Their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtob, proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by the mob, and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths. Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than give themselves up to the mob. A few Jews did surrender, promising to convert to Christianity, but they were killed by the angry crowd. Around 150 Jews died in total in the massacre. The keep was rebuilt, again in wood, on the motte, which was raised in height by 13 feet (4 metres) at a cost of £207.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of this paper lies on <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> <b>mobbing</b> behavior at <b>the</b> maquila industry.

This paper applied the Cisneros inventory. The authors tested the original 43 item version with data collected from a sample of 150 direct employees working at a maquila production center for Radars and GPS Instruments in Ensenada, Baja California. Even though results show low levels of mobbing since only 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surveyed employees experienced high degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harassment, 138 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surveyed employees have suffered at least one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mobbing</b> behaviors from coworkers in the last six months.
