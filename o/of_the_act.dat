5|$|The above {{procedures}} {{are not sufficient}} to cause an Act of Tynwald to come into full force of law.

Promulgation originally consisted of the reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> in English and Manx; but after 1865 the reading of the title <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> and a summary of each section was sufficient.

5|$|Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban {{all forms}} of outdoor relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law {{authorities}} except in a workhouse.

5000|$|Many {{surviving}} versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Paul and Thecla in Greek, {{and some}} in Coptic, as well as references to the work among Church fathers show that it was widely disseminated.
