25|$|The {{island was}} first used by the British as a staging post during the war, and while the East India Company {{intended}} to establish a permanent base {{on the island of}} Zhoushan, Elliot took it upon himself to claim the island on a permanent basis. The <b>ostensible</b> <b>authority</b> for the occupation was negotiated between Captain Eliot and the Viceroy of Liangguang, the Manchu official Qishan. The Convention of Chuenpi was concluded but had not been recognised by the Qing Dynasty court at Beijing. Subsequently, Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanking, when the territory became a Crown colony.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{intentional}} torts, such liability was extended following Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd, to cover any fraud which {{is closely related}} to an employee's employment. The first case of fraud to be decided under this authority was Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam, involving the fraud of a senior partner in a firm of solicitors. The House of Lords chose to extend the principal liability of employers, to cover fraudulent representations made by employees with no actual or <b>ostensible</b> <b>authority</b> to make them. Here, despite the employer having made no representations to the claimants, {{it was found that the}} close connection between the partner's fraud and his duties established liability.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{suppose that}} a {{container}} ship comes into port in Miami, Florida, United States. The ship, which is Liberian-registered, is wanted as security for various debts incurred by its Master while in Denmark. Made {{aware of the}} ship's presence, a local lawyer moves to impose a lien which involves a form of arrest by means of de novo proceedings in rem. The local Federal district sitting in Admiralty determines that the ship's Master had <b>ostensible</b> <b>authority</b> as an agent to pledge the credit of the ship's owners (who are English). It also determines that neither the ship nor its owners have violated American law in any way, and the local court {{is not in a}} good position to hear witnesses who are all resident in other states. Further, major liability in demurrage to the innocent charterers, forwarders, etc. will be incurred if the ship is detained without just cause, so it would not be unreasonable for the Federal Court to decline jurisdiction. Whether there is subsequent litigation in another state will depend on the tactics of the creditors. Without a lien over the ship or the ability to obtain some form of control over the assets of the debtor, making a claim for money owing may not be cost-effective. But if there have already been proceedings on the issue of liability before a court of competent jurisdiction in another state so that the action in Miami is purely by way of enforcement, the Miami jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal would be the forum conveniens because the ship is physically within the jurisdiction.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} principal-agent {{relationship}} between educational institutions and their recruitment agents or consultants. Within the traditional contractual framework, an agent can enter binding contracts {{on behalf of}} the principal. These hosts or principals are vicariously responsible for agents’ promises where <b>ostensible</b> or implied <b>authority</b> applies. This highlights the need for educational institutions to tighten their agency contracts, train agents regularly and monitors authority delegation process. To protect students’ interest, Australia government has been scrutinizing educational institutions and codified fundamental requirements. Managing agents is also a critical compliance and risk management tool in a more litigious international marketplace...|$|R
500|$|The British relegated the Malays {{to their}} [...] "traditional" [...] peasant {{lifestyle}} {{as far as}} possible, restricting movement, economic enterprises and education. This policy was maintained {{in the belief that}} education of Bengalis in India had led to discontent and rebellion. They involved only the Malay ruling class in government and administrative issues. Despite the exclusion of non-Malays from positions of <b>ostensible</b> <b>authority,</b> much of the civil service rank and file comprised non-Malays, many of them Indians who were specifically brought in for this purpose. A number of historians have described the pro-Malay policies as designed merely to preserve the position of the British, rather than to strengthen that of the Malays; many characterised the British approach as one of [...] "divide and rule", keeping [...] "the races at just the right distance from each other to have the disparate elements of Malaya work in remote harmony".|$|E

50|$|It {{is open to}} the {{principal}} to ratify an unauthorised agreement entered into by an agent. Ratification is the explicit or implicit action of {{the principal}} in agreeing, after the unauthorised act, to the act of the agent. Ratification by the principal causes such act to become binding on the third party. Note that without ratification by the principal, the third party is not bound to the unauthorized agreement created by an agent with no apparent authority, until the principal ratifies it. Whereas in the situation of an act done by an agent with <b>ostensible</b> (or apparent) <b>authority,</b> the principal and the third party are bound from the moment the agreement is consummated by the agent and third party.|$|R

As we shall see, prior to Lucas the Supreme Court and others following its lead have generally not regarded the Takings Clause as a warrant for reaching de novo determinations on land use problems and then substituting such judicial determinations, if different, for those of the legislature. Some notable exceptions in the Claims Court and Federal Circuit will then be considered along with the <b>ostensible</b> Supreme Court <b>authority,</b> a sentence in Agins v. City of Tiburon.

5000|$|In law, {{apparent}} authority {{refers to the}} authority of an agent as it appears to others, and it can operate both to enlarge actual authority and to create authority where no actual authority exists. [...] The law relating to companies and to <b>ostensible</b> <b>authority</b> are in reality only a sub-set of the rules relating to {{apparent authority}} and the law of agency generally, but because of the prevalence of the issue in relation to corporate law (companies, being artificial persons, are only ever able to act at all through their human agents), it has developed its own specific body of case law.

It is customary that the documentation and electronic materials issued to the public by the firm will carry a clear statement identifying the legal nature of the firm and listing the partners separately as general and limited. Hence, unlike the GPs, the limited partners do not have inherent agency authority to bind the firm unless they are subsequently held out as agents (and so create an agency by estoppel); or acts of ratification by the firm create <b>ostensible</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
