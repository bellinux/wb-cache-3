A design technique for root placement with full state feedback using transfer functions for all-pole plant {{is presented in}} this thesis. A number of examples are presented to demonstrate the procedure with this design technique when all the system states are available to be measured and fedback. The design procedure presented is applicable for linear, time invariant (LTI) systems in the s-domain for continuous time. In {{order to get the}} roots at desired locations by transfer function methods very high gains are required. Therefore, the design procedure should place the zeros in offset locations. To obtain some guidelines for offsetting the zeros, the root movement as a function of gain, <b>offset</b> <b>zero</b> locations chosen by matrix methods to put the roots at the desired locations, and arbitrarily chosen <b>offset</b> <b>zero</b> locations are observed on numerous system examples.

We show that IBS calculations for the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) damping ring, {{when using the}} formalism of Bjorken-Mtingwa, a modified formalism of Piwinski (where η^{ 2 }/β {{has been replaced by}} H), or a simple high-energy approximate formula all give results that agree well. Comparing theory, including the effect of potential well bunch lengthening, with a complete set of ATF steady-state beam size versus current measurements we find reasonably good agreement for energy spread and horizontal emittance. The measured vertical emittance, however, is larger than theory in both <b>offset</b> (<b>zero</b> current emittance) and slope (emittance change with current). Almost all the offset error can be accounted for by considering the expected projected vertical emittance due to machine errors rather than the real emittance. This result is consistent with the assumed Coulomb log factor being close to the correct one. The slope error indicates measurement error and/or additional current-dependent physics at the ATF...|$|E

Information {{technologies}} allow multidimensional {{analysis of}} information {{about the state of the}} power system in a single information space in terms of providing network-centric approach to control and use of unmanned aerial vehicles as tools for condition monitoring of three-phase network. Methodology. The idea of energy processes in three independent (rather than four dependent) curves vector-functions with values in the arithmetic three-dimensional space adequately for both 4 -wire and 3 –wire circuits. The presence of zero sequence current structural (and mathematically) features a 4 -wire scheme of energy from a 3 -wire circuit. The zero sequence voltage caused by the displacement of the zero voltage phases. <b>Offset</b> <b>zero</b> in the calculations can be taken into account by appropriate selection of the reference voltages. Both of these energetic phenomena with common methodical positions are described in the framework of the general mathematical model, in which a significant role is played by the ort zero sequence. Results. Vector approach with a unified voice allows us to obtain and analyze new energy characteristics for 4 –wire and 3 –wire circuits in sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal mode, both in temporal and frequency domain. Originality. Symmetric sinusoidal mode is balanced, even with non-zero reactive power. The converse is not true. The mode can be balanced and unbalanced load. The mode can be balanced and unbalanced voltage. Practical value. Assessing balance in network mode and the impact of instantaneous power on the magnitude of the losses, will allow to avoid the appearance of zero sequence and, thus, to improve the quality of electricity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{profilometer}} for three-dimensional (3 D) surface topography measurement is presented. The profilometer has large measuring range, {{high precision}} and small measuring touch force. It {{is composed of}} a two-dimensional (2 D) displacement sensor, a 3 D platform based on vertical scanning, measuring and control circuits and an industrial control computer. When a workpiece is measured, the vertical undulation of the profile at a sampling point leads to a <b>zero</b> <b>offset</b> of the 2 D displacement sensor. According to the <b>zero</b> <b>offset,</b> a piezoelectric actuator and a servo motor drive the vertical scanning platform to move vertically {{to ensure that the}} lever returns to its balance position. So the non-linear error caused by the rotation of the lever is very small even if the measuring range is large. When the stylus barges up against a steep wall, the horizontal resistance force results in another <b>zero</b> <b>offset</b> of the 2 D displacement sensor. If the <b>zero</b> <b>offset</b> exceeds a quota, the vertical scanning platform descends to make the stylus climb the steep wall successfully. According to the theoretical and experimental analysis, the profilometer can measure roughness, profile of sphere, step, groove and other 3 D surfaces with curvature precisely...|$|R

40|$|Configuration {{transform}} operations such as dip moveout, {{migration to}} <b>zero</b> <b>offset,</b> and shot and offset continuation use seismic data recorded {{with a certain}} measurement configuration to simulate data as if recorded with other configurations. Common-shot migration to <b>zero</b> <b>offset</b> (CS-MZO), analyzed in this paper, transforms a common-shot section into a zero-offset section. It can be realized as a Kirchhoff-type stacking operation for 3 D wave propagation in a 2 D laterally inhomogeneous medium. By application of suitable weight functions, amplitudes of the data are either preserved or transformed by replacing the geometrical-spreading factor of the input reflections by the correct one of the output <b>zero</b> <b>offset</b> reflections. The necessary weight function can be computed via 2 D dynamic ray tracing in a given macrovelocity model without any a priori knowledge regarding the dip or curvature of the reflectors.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, there has been {{considerable}} research and interest in a topic known by various names, such as Time Reverse Acoustics (TRA), Time Reverse Mirrors (TRM), and Time Reverse Cavities (TRC), which exploits reciprocity and the time symmetric property of the wave equation. Very little of this work has been directed at the seismic exploration imaging problem. In fact, {{most of the work}} has had application in sonar, medical and non-destructive testing applications. Here we present some initial results of applying this technology to the seismic imaging of a salt dome flank. We create a set of synthetic traces representing a multi-level, walk away VSP for a model composed of a simplified Gulf of Mexico vertical velocity gradient and an embedded overhanging salt dome. To process these data, we first apply the concepts of TRA to the synthetic traces. This creates a set of stacked traces without having to perform any velocity analysis or complicated processing. Each of these stacked traces is equivalent to the output of a spatially coincident, or <b>zero</b> <b>offset,</b> down hole source and receiver pair. Thus we have the equivalent of a <b>zero</b> <b>offset</b> seismic section as if it were collected from down hole sources and receivers. After having applied the TRA concepts, we then apply conventional post stack depth migration to this <b>zero</b> <b>offset</b> section to produce the final image of the salt dome flank. Our results show a very good image of the salt. In fact, the image created is nearly identical to an image actually using data from down hole, <b>zero</b> <b>offset</b> source and receiver pairs. The simplicity of the TRA implementation provides a virtually automated method to create a stacked section {{as if it had been}} collected from the reference frame of the borehole containing the VSP survey.
