5|$|Beat 'em ups {{are related}} to—but {{distinct}} from—fighting games, {{which are based}} around <b>one-on-one</b> matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both <b>one-on-one</b> fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a game will feature both kinds of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Hip Hop International (HHI) {{was founded}} in 2002 in the United States by Howard and Karen Schwartz. There are two {{categories}} of competitions: World Battles and World Hip Hop Dance Championship. Within the World Battles category, there are four titles including three-on-three breaking champions, <b>one-on-one</b> popping champion, <b>one-on-one</b> locking champion, and <b>one-on-one</b> all styles (freestyle) champion. The World Hip Hop Dance Championship is for hip-hop crews. There are four divisions: junior (ages 7–12), varsity (12–18), adult (18+), and mega crew (all ages). Each crew must have at least five {{but not more than}} nine people (mega crew must have 15–40) and must perform a routine that showcases three styles of hip-hop dance. For the 2009 competition, there were 120 crews representing 30 countries. HHI also created the USA Hip Hop Dance Championship and the television show America's Best Dance Crew.|$|E

5|$|Michael Rush (3 January 1844 – 17 December 1922) was an Irish Australian sculler {{noted for}} his <b>one-on-one</b> {{competitions}} against champion opponents, which drew vast crowds of spectators. He attempted {{to win the}} World Sculling Championship.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} <b>one-on-one</b> duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a <b>one-on-one</b> fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs out. If the player declines, your morale will drop. If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If you accept the officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in the duel.|$|E
5|$|Yao {{enrolled}} at the Antai College of Economics & Management of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2011. He is taking a tailored degree program with mostly <b>one-on-one</b> lectures to avoid being a distraction on campus.|$|E
5|$|Portions of {{the video}} were also {{televised}} along with <b>one-on-one</b> interviews with Ezarik by several national and local news programs in the United States, including CNN, Fox News Channel, WTAE-TV, and WPXI-TV. ABC News Now also included independent reporting by an ABC News Radio reporter in their video interview.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{gameplay}} involves <b>one-on-one</b> 2.5D style fighting. Mortal Kombat uses {{a single}} two-dimensional fighting plane (at 60 frames per second), although characters are rendered in three-dimensional fashion, {{intended to give}} depth and range to portrayals of various projectiles. Unlike previous Mortal Kombat games, four buttons on the game controller represent attacks and are each linked to a corresponding limb.|$|E
5|$|Rush then {{engaged in}} a series of <b>one-on-one</b> matches with the scullers William Hickey, the Australian champion, and his brother Richard Hickey. Rush, being {{unfamiliar}} with rowing outrigger wager boats, on that occasion failed to win the championship from Hickey, but returned to the Lower Clarence with prize money totalling over £700.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the river, Robb divides his forces, sending the aforementioned 2,000 men to distract Lord Tywin's army. Due to the false information Robb {{gave to the}} captured Lannister scout, Lord Tywin's force believes it is the whole Stark army. The remainder of Robb's men sneak up on Jaime Lannister's army, defeating them and capturing Jaime. When captured, Jaime challenges Robb to a <b>one-on-one</b> duel to settle the matter, which Robb declines.|$|E
5|$|Dance Dance Revolution, {{released}} in 1998, is a rhythm {{game in which}} players dance on pressure-sensitive pads in an order dictated by on-screen instructions. The game was highly successful both in and outside Japan, unlike games such as GuitarFreaks, DrumMania and Beatmania, though the latter had some success in Europe. Released the same year, Enix's Bust a Groove features a similar focus on dancing but employs a more conventional input method. The game contains competitive <b>one-on-one</b> battles, and grants the player more freedom than typical rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|Fiorentina had {{chances to}} equalise {{in the second}} half, with a long shot from {{substitute}} Matías Fernández tipped over the crossbar by Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina, and Iličić missing a <b>one-on-one.</b> The team also brought on Rossi in place of Joaquín after 72 minutes, his first action since his injury in January. Despite being reduced to ten men {{for the last ten}} minutes after a second booking for Gökhan Inler after he fouled Iličić, Napoli extended their lead in injury time when substitute Mertens scored a third after being set up by Callejón.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Betty Sanders met MalcolmX {{after one}} of his lectures, then again at a dinner party; soon she was {{regularly}} attending his lectures. In 1956 she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to BettyX. <b>One-on-one</b> dates were contrary to the Nation's teachings, so the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds of others, and MalcolmX {{made a point of}} inviting her on the frequent group visits he led to New York City's museums and libraries.|$|E
5|$|Jetpac Refuelled {{features}} a multiplayer mode {{that can be}} played either offline using a split screen or online via Xbox Live. In this mode, the player has to compete <b>one-on-one</b> in a race to build and refuel their craft before their opponent does. Fuel and rocket pickups can be stolen from opponents by shooting them or by using an EMP blast at close range. Lives are unlimited in multiplayer {{and the winner is}} determined by the highest score. A version of the original 1983 Jetpac is also included in the game.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{exceptional}} {{because he}} played point guard despite being 6ft 9in (2.06m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players. He combined {{the size of}} a power forward, the <b>one-on-one</b> skills of a swingman, and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him {{one of the most dangerous}} triple-double threats of all time; his 138triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 181. Johnson is the only player in NBA Finals history to have triple-doubles in multiple series-clinching games.|$|E
5|$|Leto won the 2003 and 2004 World Cyber Games, and {{was signed}} {{to become a}} {{professional}} game player that same year. He remained champion until he was defeated in 2005, and {{was known for his}} quiet, patient style of play, and his skill in <b>one-on-one</b> matches. In 2006 he retired from professional gaming. He is currently working as a real estate agent in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Numerous weapons may {{be picked}} up during a race by flying over different-coloured weapon pads. Yellow pads equip the player with {{offensive}} weaponry to destroy other racers and green pads provide defensive weapons such as mines, shields and speed boosts. Game modes carried over from Wipeout HD include <b>one-on-one</b> races, tournaments, time trials, speed laps, and Zone mode. The latter mode revolves around survival as the player's ship automatically accelerates to extreme speeds.|$|E
5|$|On the April 30, 2007, {{episode of}} Raw, Edge and Orton {{met in a}} <b>one-on-one</b> match. Edge won the match by pinning Orton {{following}} a spear. Edge then moved to the SmackDown brand on the May 11 episode after cashing in the Money in the Bank briefcase (which he had won from Mr. Kennedy on the same episode of Raw) to win the World Heavyweight Championship from then-champion The Undertaker. With this move, Rated-RKO was officially disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Set {{within a}} fictionalized {{version of the}} San Francisco Bay Area, {{the game is played}} from a third-person {{perspective}} and its open world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Players control Marcus Holloway, a hacker who works with the hacking group DedSec to take down the city's advanced surveillance system known as ctOS. There are multiple ways to complete missions, and each successful assignment increases the follower count of DedSec. Cooperative multiplayer allows for competitive <b>one-on-one</b> combat and connecting with other players in order to neutralize a player who is causing havoc.|$|E
5|$|The first {{broadcast}} {{debate of}} the campaign took place on 28 September 2011, the day that nominations closed, on RTÉ Radio 1's News at One programme. This {{was followed by a}} series of televised <b>one-on-one</b> interviews with the candidates on RTÉ One's evening Prime Time programme on the same day. A second debate was held on The Late Late Show on 30 September; David Norris was not interviewed alone as the other six candidates were as he had been interviewed the previous week on the programme, but was included in the later panel debate.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{features}} a multiplayer mode for <b>one-on-one</b> tactical battles. Players spend a predefined points budget on assembling a squad of up to six humans, aliens, or a mixture of both. Human units are customizable in terms of weaponry, armor and gadgets. A simplified version of the single-player perk system is also present. Alien units may not be customized but possess the abilities of corresponding aliens types in the single-player mode of the game.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{breakers}} dance {{within a}} cypher or an Apache Line. A cypher is a circular shaped dance space formed by spectators that breakers use to perform or battle in. Cyphers {{work well for}} <b>one-on-one</b> b-boy or b-girl (break-boy/break-girl) battles; however, Apache Lines are more appropriate when the battle is between two crews—teams of street dancers. In contrast to the circular shape of a cypher, competing crews can face each other in this line formation, challenge each other, and execute their burns (a move intended to humiliate the opponent, i.e. crotch grabbing).|$|E
5|$|While {{wandering}} fields, towers, caves, seas, and dungeons, {{the player}} randomly encounters monsters, {{after which the}} game shifts to battle mode. The game's battle mode introduces groups of monsters, which is an upgrade from the <b>one-on-one</b> battles of Dragon Quest. In the battle mode, the player gives orders to the characters on how to fight the monsters. Once the player defeats all of the monsters, the characters gain experience points and gold. The experience points raise the characters' experience levels. This improves the characters' attributes, and they may also learn new spells.|$|E
5|$|X-Men vs. Street Fighter {{features}} gameplay {{similar to}} Street Fighter, but incorporates dual-character selection and tag team-based combat. Each player selects two characters {{to compete in}} a <b>one-on-one</b> battle, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The players are given the ability to switch between their characters at any point during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes.|$|E
5|$|Aaron Ward and Sterett, {{independently}} {{searching for}} targets, both sighted Yūdachi, who appeared {{unaware of the}} approach of the two U.S. destroyers. Both U.S.ships hit Yūdachi simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, heavily damaging the destroyer and forcing her crew to abandon ship. The ship did not sink right away, however. Continuing on her way, Sterett was suddenly ambushed by Teruzuki, heavily damaged, and forced to withdraw from the battle area to the east. Aaron Ward wound up in a <b>one-on-one</b> duel with Kirishima, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage. She also tried to retire from the battle area to the east but soon stopped dead in the water because the engines were damaged.|$|E
5|$|Ascension is {{the only}} {{installment}} in the series to feature online multiplayer for both competitive and cooperative play. Up to eight players on two teams of two to four players (or a four to eight player deathmatch) battle for control of a map in order to earn rewards from the gods. Players can also fight each other in <b>one-on-one</b> matches. Players must sell their champion's soul to either Zeus, Hades, Ares, or Poseidon, which allows players to try different weapons, armor sets, and powers inspired by the god of their choice, and extras can be unlocked.|$|E
5|$|Having traversed {{the major}} {{basketball}} continents in his basketball career, Ginóbili {{is one of}} the few players who has enjoyed success under both the physical, <b>one-on-one</b> play of the NBA and the more technical, jump-shooting rule set of FIBA. He is one of only two players in basketball history, along with Bill Bradley, to win the EuroLeague, an Olympic gold medal, and an NBA Championship ring. He is also the first non-U.S. player to win both the NBA championship ring and the Olympic gold medal, and the second Latin American to be selected to play in an NBA All-Star game (after Panama's Rolando Blackman).|$|E
5|$|He {{broke his}} fibula during August 2009, which {{resulted}} in him being ruled out of playing for eight weeks. He finished 2009–10 with 39 appearances and 13 goals. His first appearance of 2010–11 came in the opening match, a 1–0 home defeat to Hereford on 7 August 2010, in which he missed an early opportunity to score, shooting wide of the goal having been <b>one-on-one</b> with goalkeeper Adam Bartlett. His first goals of the season came after scoring twice in a 7–0 home victory over Barnet on 21 August 2010, the first a shot into the bottom left of the goal and the second a close-range header. He finished the season with 48 appearances and 29 goals, including 28 goals in the League Two, making him the division's top scorer.|$|E
5|$|In Super Mario Kart, {{the player}} takes control {{of one of}} eight Mario series characters, each with differing capabilities. In single player mode players can race against {{computer-controlled}} characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups {{can be used to}} gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the clock in a Time Trial mode. In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups or can race against each other <b>one-on-one</b> in Match Race mode. In a third multiplayer mode – Battle Mode – the aim is to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, Benfica defeated Stade Dudelange 18–0 on aggregate, establishing a European record for biggest win on aggregate. However, {{at a later}} stage of the competition, they conceded a record home defeat to Manchester United and were eliminated. After a one-year competing in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Benfica returned to the European Cup and reached their fifth final in 1968. After eliminating Juventus 3–0 in the semi-finals, Benfica faced Manchester United at Wembley Stadium on 29 May 1968. Bobby Charlton opened the score but Jaime Graça equalised on the 79th minute. Near the end of regular time, Eusébio squandered a <b>one-on-one</b> chance against Alex Stepney and the match went to extra time, where three goals in eight minutes gave the English side their first European title.|$|E
5|$|Infinity Blade is a {{fighting}} game with role-playing elements developed by Chair Entertainment and Epic Games and released through the Apple App Store on December 9, 2010. It {{is the first}} iOS video game to run on the Unreal Engine. In the game, the unnamed player character fights a series of <b>one-on-one</b> battles in a derelict castle to face the immortal God King. When in battle, players swipe the screen to attack and parry, and tap the screen to dodge and block enemy attacks. Upon victory or defeat, the player restarts the game as the character's descendant with the same items and experience level.|$|E
5|$|Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is {{the second}} {{installment}} in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of 2D fighting games. It utilizes the same <b>one-on-one</b> tag team format previously employed in X-Men vs. Street Fighter. The player chooses a team of two fighters, each sporting their own life gauge; {{at the start of}} the match, the first selected character is controlled by the player, while the second character remains off-screen and acts as support. Using a combination of joystick movements and button presses, the player must execute various moves to deplete the opposing team's life gauges. The first player to completely drain the opponent's health is declared the winner. If the timer reaches zero, the player that possesses the most health wins.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is {{the third}} entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of 2D {{fighting}} games. The game utilizes similar tag team-based game mechanics to its predecessor, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. Before starting each match, the player selects a team of two fighters to compete in <b>one-on-one</b> combat. The player is free to swap between their characters at any point during battle. While one character fights, their teammate resting off-screen slowly regenerates their life gauge. The first team to exhaust their opponent's vitality wins the match; however, if the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|On the June 26, 2000 {{edition of}} Raw, the APA won a Tag-Team Battle Royal against seven other teams {{to win a}} WWF Tag Team Championship match. During {{the weeks leading up}} to Fully Loaded, Edge and Christian avoided {{defending}} the Tag Team Championship against the APA. On July 10, 2000, the APA were scheduled to face Edge and Christian for the Tag Team Championship, but Edge announced that he would face Bradshaw <b>one-on-one</b> in a match, which Bradshaw lost. Later that week on SmackDown!, Edge and Christian were scheduled to defend their Tag Team Championship against the APA, but they again made a <b>one-on-one</b> match, where Christian was defeated by Faarooq. At Fully Loaded, the APA won the Tag Team match by disqualification; due to WWF rules, Edge and Christian retained the Tag Team Championship. On the September 7, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, the Dudley Boyz and the APA formed an alliance. The following week on Raw, the APA faced Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) in a losing effort. Then, on the September 18, 2000 edition of Raw, the Dudley Boyz also lost to Buchanan and The Goodfather. After the match, all the members of the Right to Censor (Buchanan, The Goodfather, Steven Richards, and Val Venis) attacked the Dudley Boyz, which resulted in the APA coming out to help the Dudley Boyz, as a part of their alliance. The Dudley Boyz and the APA were then booked in an Eight-man Tag Team match against Right to Censor at Unforgiven, which Right to Censor won via pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Only {{six minutes}} later, in the 62nd minute, Stoke had their key chance and only shot on {{target of the}} match with Kenwyne Jones in the 61st minute. A looping ball {{over the top of}} the Manchester City defence by Matthew Etherington allowed Jones a <b>one-on-one,</b> but he failed to convert, firing {{straight}} at goalkeeper Joe Hart with the ball ricocheting off both striker and keeper before bobbling to safety. Doubts over Matthew Etherington's fitness resurfaced when he was taken off in the 63rd minute, with Stoke City still in the game at 0–0 as it stood.|$|E
5|$|Razer {{made its}} debut in the fourth heat of series two of Robot Wars, which was viewed by almost six million people on BBC Two. It had been {{finished}} late {{the night before the}} recording. Radio interference caused Razer to be hard to control in the Gauntlet stage of the competition, but it successfully navigated the obstacle course and progressed to the Trial. This phase was a robotic football match, wherein Razer scored the first goal to reach the heat semi-final. Its opponent for this <b>one-on-one</b> battle was Inquisitor, a box-shaped robot equipped with a rotating flail. Whilst Razer made the stronger start, crumpling Inquisitor's flail support, the cush drives in its motors sheared after an impact on the arena floor. This rendered Razer immobile and ended a promising run.|$|E
