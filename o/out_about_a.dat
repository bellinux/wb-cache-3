When the Warners find <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> star that will grant a wish to the first person that touches it, the Warners, the villagers (the Animaniacs cast), and the king race to get to it first. Although children and adults rated Wakko's Wish highly in test-screenings, Warner Bros. decided to release it direct-to-video, rather than spend money on advertising. Warner Bros. released the movie on VHS on December 21, 1999; the film was then released on DVD on October 7, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Schirra gave {{a public}} lecture at Rice University after {{returning}} to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra's successful flight down the news schedules; public concern about the relative effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over Soviet military rockets. He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting was friendly and informal despite the circumstances. Robert Kennedy, Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> potential political career, {{the same way he}} had sounded out John Glenn a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA. His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission, then the prime crew for the 1965 Gemini 6A mission, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft - earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled - and finally commanding the first Apollo mission, Apollo 7, in 1968. He retired from NASA in the summer of 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E

When the Joes attack the Appalachian base, the battle ends when Hawk tackles Cobra Commander, and knocks him out with a punch to the face. In the aftermath, the Joes are still active and fully funded.|$|E

500|$|It took [...] "fifteen man-years" [...] {{and three}} actual {{years to develop}} the game. [...] In a 2006 interview, lead {{designer}} Johnson said, [...] "I had never really designed a game before ... It's funny {{looking back on it}} now—just by happenstance I ended up creating a very open ended system where players could go anywhere and do whatever and a story sort of unfolded." [...] Ybarra stated that the game was almost cancelled more than once, and came <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> year behind schedule. Johnson was guided by Archon designer Paul Reiche III during development. Reiche advised him to draft a [...] "story network" [...] that would highlight all the most important points of the story and list the in-game objects necessary to advance from one to the next. The designers rewrote the script multiple times. The group designed what they called a [...] "fractal generator", which took six man-years to develop and allowed them {{to increase the number of}} planets in the game from 50 to 800. The game was one of the earliest to use procedurally generated content for planets and everything on them. The techniques used created a type of roguelike environment on each planet, with the contents randomly distributed. The story network was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox game design. They created a separate ecosystem generator over the course of two man-years of work. The alien names were created by randomly combining syllables until they had names they liked, and their code for simulating communications was rewritten four times before completion.|$|E

2500|$|Stevens {{called the}} majority's faith in [...] "corporate democracy" [...] an {{unrealistic}} method for a shareholder to oppose political funding. [...] A derivative suit is slow, inefficient, risky and potentially expensive. [...] Likewise, shareholder meetings only happen {{a few times}} a year, not prior to every decision or transaction. [...] Rather, the officers and boards control the day-to-day spending, including political spending. [...] According to Stevens, the shareholders have few options, giving them [...] "virtually nonexistent" [...] recourse for opposing a corporation's political spending. [...] Furthermore, most shareholders use investment intermediaries, such as mutual funds or pensions, and by the time a shareholder may find <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> corporation's political spending and try to object, the damage is done and the shareholder has funded disfavored speech.|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 78 we find <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> rival who's {{male and}} {{a poet and}} whose entry initiates an episode of jealousy that comes to a close in only Sonnet 86. [...] The rivalry between the poets {{may appear to be}} literary, but, {{according}} to the critic Joseph Pequigney, it is in reality a sexual rivalry. This is disturbing because the subject in the sonnet is one that the persona has found erotically profitable, in part because the other poet may be superior in learning and style. Shakespeare is not concerned with poetic triumph he is vying only for the prize of a fair friend. The combat between the two rivals is indirect and the speaker never addresses his literary adversary and only mentions his beloved. It is the body language of Sonnet 78 (the first in the series) 79, 80 and 84 that serves to convert the topic of letters into that of eroticism. Shakespeare is known for his usage of puns and double meaning on words. So it isn't surprising that he uses wordplay in the first quatrain on [...] "pen" [...] for the male appendage, or, as a Stein-cum-Joyce might say, [...] "a pen is a penis a pen," [...] is fully utilized. The poet remarks at 78.4, [...] "every alien pen hath got my use," [...] where [...] "alien" [...] = 'of a stranger' and [...] "use," [...] besides 'literary practice,' can = 'carnal enjoyment.' These sexual allusions are made in passing; they are overtones, restricted to a line or two.|$|E
