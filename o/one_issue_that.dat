5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{emerged from}} these studies {{was the problem}} of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{has arisen}} {{is whether a}} Singaporean who votes {{in a foreign country}} where the right to vote is not {{exclusive}} to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of Commonwealth countries, including Singapore, who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (or do not require such leave) to register to vote in general elections and local government elections. When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{has often}} raised {{concerns}} {{is the use}} of cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> led to {{accidents}} {{with the}} CFM56-3C engine was {{the failure of}} fan blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> was {{foreseen}} as {{a potential}} problem was the supply of skilled officers to the Army in wartime, and a committee was established in 1906 under Sir Edward Ward to study the matter. It issued two reports, one focusing on university and school corps, {{and one on the}} Special Reserve. The main recommendation of the former was to reorganise the existing school Cadet Corps and university Rifle Corps, which had been formed on an ad-hoc basis as part of the broader Volunteer movement, into a uniform force, administered and supported by the War Office.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> complicates {{finding a}} {{correctly}} fitting bra is that band and cup sizes are not standardized, but vary considerably from one manufacturer to another, resulting in sizes that only provide an approximate fit.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> divided Guild {{from the}} more {{conservative}} elements of his party was his opposition to attempts by the railroad executives to bypass state law banning the merger of the Boston and Maine Railroad with the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad; this was effected de facto {{through the use of}} holding companies, and then legislatively approved, after the fact, during the Draper administration.|$|E

25|$|There {{can also}} be {{regional}} differences in voter turnout. <b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> arises in continent-spanning nations, such as Australia, Canada, the United States and Russia, is that of time zones. Canada banned the broadcasting of election results in any region where the polls have not yet closed; this ban was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada. In several recent Australian national elections, the citizens of Western Australia knew which party would form the new government {{up to an hour}} before the polling booths in their State closed.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> was {{particularly}} contentious as the Bill was being debated in Parliament was {{the appointment of}} judges to the Court, with opposition parties claiming that the Attorney-General would make partisan choices. These concerns were because the entire bench was to be appointed simultaneously, and no clear statement had been made about how they would be selected. However, the level of concern was considerably lessened when Wilson announced that the appointments {{would be based on}} merit and seniority. Appointments to the Court were expected and unsurprising. The most senior Justices on the Court of Appeal were appointed to the new Court.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> sparked {{tensions}} between France and Canada began {{shortly after the}} creation of la Francophonie, an international organization of wholly and partially French-speaking countries modeled somewhat after the Commonwealth of Nations. While Canada agreed in principle to the organization's creation, it was dismayed by France's position that not only should Quebec participate as an equal, independent member, but {{that the federal government}} and (by omission) the other provinces with significant French minorities could not. This was seen by many French-Canadians outside of Quebec as a betrayal. This was also seen by some Canadians as France supporting the Quebec sovereignty movement. Some go as far as saying the Francophonie was created to help push the international recognition of Quebec, but in reality the Francophonie was created to promote international cooperation between all French speaking nations, including many newly independent former French colonies in Africa.|$|E

500|$|To obtain certain {{snow and}} ice sound effects, sound {{designer}} Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake. However, the foley work for the film was recorded on the foley stage on the Warner Bros. lot by a Warner Bros. crew. The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds (22.6kg) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary {{snow and ice}} sounds for the film. Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded (corresponding to five different types of snow), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in {{the final version of}} each scene. <b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> the production team was [...] "particular" [...] about was the sound of Elsa's footsteps in the ice palace, which required eight attempts, including wine glasses on ice and metal knives on ice; they ended up using a mix of three sounds.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, Stivers {{announced}} his candidacy for a rematch in 2010. According to an op-ed article in The New York Times, <b>one</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> Stivers and Kilroy {{have both been}} vocal about is the prospective repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides direct election of United States Senators. [...] Stivers had backpedaled on his support of the repeal after Kilroy made an issue of his stance. [...] The race {{is one of the}} most closely watched in the United States House of Representatives elections, 2010, and it will include a third party candidate. [...] The Republican Party has marked it as one of their targeted races according to a U.S. News & World Report article. [...] Time notes that she may have trouble in her historically Republican district if there is an electoral backlash to spending by the Obama Administration because of her short history of voting along party lines. [...] On November 2, Stivers won the rematch.|$|E
500|$|<b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{occasionally}} rises {{is whether}} the monarchies are too expensive when compared to republics, or whether particular monarchies are more expensive than others, to maintain. This comparison {{may be hard to}} draw, since financial administration may differ radically from country to country, and not all profits and costs are publicly known, and because of different arrangements regarding [...] the private property of the monarch. In the UK, the Crown Estate has a special legal status making it neither government property nor the private property of the monarch. Revenues from these hereditary possessions have been placed [...] at the disposition of the British government (thus proceeding directly to the Treasury) by every monarch since the accession of George III in 1760; the revenues of GBP 304.1 million (fiscal year of 2015/16) far exceed the expenses of the British royal family in this sense resulting in a [...] "negative cost" [...] of the British monarchy.|$|E

500|$|When the 34th United States Congress {{convened in}} December 1855, members opposed to Democratic President Franklin Pierce (most of them Northerners) held the {{majority}} in the House, while the Democrats retained their majority in the Senate. That House majority, however, was not fully unified, with some members adhering to the new anti-Nebraska party, and others loyal to the new nativist American (or [...] "Know-Nothing") party. The Know Nothings were also fractious, with some former Whigs and some former Free Soilers in their ranks. The result was a House that was unable to elect a Speaker for two months. When they finally agreed on the election of Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts, the House quickly turned to the matter of Kansas. Preventing the expansion of slavery to Kansas was the <b>one</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> united Banks' fragile majority, and the House resolved to send three members to investigate the situation in that territory; Sherman was one of the three selected.|$|E
500|$|From 1903 onwards, the RSDLP {{were divided}} between two major groups: the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. After the {{suppression}} of the 1905 Revolution by the Russian Empire, the RSDLP held its 5th Congress in May–June 1907 in London with the hopes of resolving differences between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. <b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> still separated the two groups was the divergence of their views on militant activities, and in particular, [...] "expropriations". The most militant Bolsheviks, led at the 5th Congress by Vladimir Lenin, supported continuation of the use of robberies, while Mensheviks advocated a more peaceful and gradual approach to revolution, and opposed militant operations. [...] At the 5th Congress, a resolution was passed condemning participation in or assistance to all militant activity, including [...] "expropriations" [...] as [...] "disorganizing and demoralizing", and called for all party militias to be disbanded. This resolution passed with 65per cent supporting and 6per cent opposing (others abstained or did not vote) with all Mensheviks and even some Bolsheviks supporting the resolution.|$|E
500|$|Although Hypsilophodontidae was {{interpreted}} as a natural group in the early 1990s, this hypothesis has fallen out of favor and Hypsilophodontidae {{has been found to}} be an unnatural family composed of a variety of animals more or less closely related to Iguanodontia (paraphyly), with various small clades of closely related taxa. [...] "Hypsilophodontidae" [...] and [...] "hypsilophodont" [...] are better understood as informal terms for an evolutionary grade, not a true clade. Thescelosaurus has been regarded as both very basal and very derived among the hypsilophodonts. <b>One</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> has potentially interfered with classifying Thescelosaurus is that not all of the remains assigned to T. neglectus necessarily belong to it. Clint Boyd and colleagues found that while the clade Thescelosaurus included the genus Bugenasaura and the species that had been assigned to that genus, there were at least two and possibly three species within Thescelosaurus, and several specimens previously assigned to T. neglectus could not yet be assigned to a species within the genus. It appears to be closely related to Parksosaurus.|$|E
