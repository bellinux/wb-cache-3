5|$|When Wilkes {{returned}} from California to New York City, {{he began to}} work for William T.

Wilkes, however, renamed the paper to Porter's Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times,</b> a title it retained until 1859. In September 1859, Abraham C. Dayton, who had previously worked for the Spirit, left the paper and because he had purchased a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper at one point from Porter, began publishing a paper he called Porter's Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> Dayton got a court order preventing Wilkes from using Porter's name, so Wilkes changed <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> his paper to Wilkes' Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times,</b> while Dayton continued to publish Porter's Spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> Dayton was only able to publish until August 1861, however, as Wilkes drove the other paper out of business.

5|$|Another theory by Shinhachiro Matsumoto {{suggests}} Noh {{originated from}} outcastes struggling to claim higher social status by catering {{to those in}} power, namely the new ruling samurai class <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> The transferral of the shogunate from Kamakura to Kyoto {{at the beginning of}} Muromachi period marked the increasing power of the samurai class and strengthened the relationship between the shogunate and the court. As Noh became the shogun's favorite art form, Noh was able to become a courtly art form through this newly formed relationship. In 14th century, with strong support and patronage from shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was able to establish Noh as the most prominent theatre art form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
