5|$|Inside the Onondaga territory, {{the route}} {{initially}} serves {{only a handful}} of scattered homes separated by long stretches of dense forests. After , however, the road bends to the northeast and enters the town of Onondaga and the hamlet of Indian Village, the main population center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> NY11A quickly runs through the linear community, crossing Hemlock Creek on its way to another lightly developed, mostly wooded stretch along the east bank of Onondaga Creek. The route passes {{only a handful of}} isolated homes before ending at an intersection with US11 on the northern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> The junction is located just south of the hamlet of Nedrow, located along US11 between the Onondaga territory and the Syracuse city line.|$|E
5|$|Although most of NY37 in {{the town}} of Bombay is {{contained}} within the reservation, a short portion east of Hogansburg and the St. Regis River and west of Tarbell Road is located outside the reservation limits. Within this stretch, NY37 meets both the eastern end of NY37C and the northern terminus of NY95. East <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> NY37 roughly parallels the CSX Transportation-owned Montreal Subdivision northeast to Fort Covington, where NY37 crosses the railroad line and intersects Water Street (unsigned NY970T), a connector to Quebec Route132 on the northern side of the Canadian border.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed to the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
5|$|East of Lewiston village, NY104 follows Ridge Road {{through a}} sparsely {{populated}} area of Niagara County. Much of this portion of NY104 is bordered on its southern end by the Tuscarora Indian Reservation. At the Lewiston hamlet of Dickersonville, the extents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> head south, and development along NY104 increases slightly. NY104 meets the northern terminus of NY429 at the Lewiston–Cambria town line and crosses over NY425 at Streeters Corners. Just east of this location is an intersection with NY93 {{in the community of}} Molyneaux Corners. The two routes form a concurrency east to Warrens Corners, a hamlet on the Cambria–Lockport town line, where NY93 turns south to serve the city of Lockport.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory {{to address the}} {{problems}} Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people. World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E

5|$|A {{settlement}} {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made a more accurate survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within the reservation. He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} east bank that {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. His plan was to stake a pre-emption claim at the falls. However, Franklin Steele also had plans to stake a claim. On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to the falls, built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's claim, as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E
5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through {{the edge of the}} community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E
5|$|Irataba also welcomed {{bands of}} Yavapai onto the {{reservation}} {{after they had}} been subject to massacres by US troops, or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands. The meager resources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871–72, General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking {{for a group of}} Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre, and Irataba {{had no choice but to}} turn the war party over to the army. He traveled to the trial proceedings at Fort Date Creek, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, Ohatchecama, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was not the one who had turned them over to Crook.|$|E
