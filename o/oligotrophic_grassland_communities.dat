40|$|This report {{discusses}} the endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle (Scottish Highland cattle) in two study sites. The study sites consist of ligotrophic grassland, heathiand and former arable fields. EndozoochorOUs seed dispersal may {{play an important}} role in the development of oligotrophic grassland and heath on these former arable fields. The study sites have been divided in different area parts. In each area part plots of 20 by 20 m were created. In these plots vegetation was recorded, seed supply was determined and the number of dung pats was counted. Seed that survived the passage through the cattle was determined in the greenhouse. Also germination on field dung pats was determined. Target species form a small part of the seed supply in both study sites. Selectivity of cattle in terrain use determined the seed intake. The species dominant in seed intake could be determined by hand clipping in the grazing area. High number of dung pats was found on the mesotrophic grassland in both study sites and on the heathland in Delleburen. Cattle avoided the oligotrophic grassland in Delleburen. In Hullenzand the Molinia-stands and the heathland were avoided. Many species of heathland and oligotrophic grassland are dispersed by cattle dung. The species dispersed most are Poa trivialis, P. annua, P. pratensis, CerastiumfontaflUm and Juncus species. In the field less seedlings germinated than in the greenhouse. A number of target species germinated on field dung pats. Most species appearing on a field dung pat were locally new. Sterilising by heating of cattle dung killed almost all seeds but also altered the structure of the dung. Sterilised dung pats were used to examine the amount of seeds blown in by the wind. With sterilised dung pats it was shown that Rumex acetosella was blown in. EndozoochorouS dispersal by cattle is of little importance for the dispersal of plant species of heathland and <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>communities.</b> It is discussed that germination conditions are very important in determining the importance of endozoochorous dispersal for establishment. ...|$|E

40|$|Semi-natural chalk {{grassland}} is an internationally important habitat characterised by high species richness at a fine scale. In both the United Kingdom and other European Countries however, significant areas of {{chalk grassland}} {{have been lost}} to intensive agriculture practices. In the United Kingdom, conservation and expansion of existing chalk grassland sites has become a high priority. Research {{that leads to a}} better understanding of the processes that structure chalk <b>grassland</b> <b>communities</b> may aid these objectives. A number of field trials have been conducted to examine the role of grazing in structuring <b>grassland</b> plant <b>communities,</b> but the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) /plant symbiosis has received less attention. In this research project the structure (presence and abundance of species) of chalk <b>grassland</b> <b>communities</b> growing on the South Downs in the United Kingdom is defined. This is achieved by detailed analysis of extensive plant survey data collected in 1991. Analysis revealed strong patterns relating to species presence and abundance in the chalk <b>grassland</b> <b>communities.</b> In particular evidence of „nestedness‟ and a frequency abundance relationship was found. From these patterns it was deduced that AMF/ plant symbiosis may have a significant role in structuring chalk <b>grassland</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Restoration of wet <b>grassland</b> <b>communities</b> on peat soils {{involves}} {{management of}} nutrient supply and hydrology. The concept of nutrient limitation was discussed {{as well as}} its interaction with drainage and rewetting of severely drained peat soils. Different methods of assessing nutrient limitation were compared and the type and extent of nutrient limitation were determined for several wet <b>grassland</b> <b>communities.</b> It was concluded that a full-factorial field fertilisation experiment is the most preferable method. Plant tissue analyses and soil chemical analyses were considered less suitable, although they may provide helpful additional information. Fertilisation experiments in the laboratory using sods or using test plants appear to be the proper means to study mechanisms or processes, but have a restricted predictive value for field situations. Generalising the results, it seems that many relativily undisturbed <b>grassland</b> plant <b>communities</b> on peaty soils are characterised by N limitation. Phosphate limitation for vegetation on peat soils is mainly observed in specific circumstances such as extreme calcium richness, high concentrations of Fe or as a result of drainage or long-term hay cropping. The latter two may also cause K limitation. Rewetting is regarded as a prerequisite in restoring wet <b>grassland</b> <b>communities.</b> Further restoration measures to influence nutrient availability depend on aims of the management and the individual site conditions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the long-term effects of long-term piggery effluent application on semi-natural grassland ecotop-phytotop changes (above- and below-ground phytomass production, and carbon and nitrogen allocation in <b>grassland</b> <b>communities)</b> in relation to changes (or variability) in topsoil properties. Analysis of phytomass distribution in piggery effluent irrigated <b>grassland</b> <b>communities</b> showed that dry biomass yield varied from 1. 7 − 5. 3 t ha- 1. Variability in soil and plant cover created a unique and highly unpredictable site specific system, where long-term anthropogenic influences established successor communities with specific characteristics of above- and below-ground biomass distribution. These characteristics depend more on <b>grassland</b> <b>communities</b> than on soil chemical properties. Families of grasses (Poaceae) dominated the surveyed communities and accumulated most carbon and least nitrogen, while legumes accumulated most nitrogen and lignin and least carbon. Carbon concentrations in above-ground biomass had minor variations, while accumulation of nitrogen was strongly influenced by species diversity (r = 0. 94, n = 10, p < 0. 001) and production of above-ground biomas...|$|R
