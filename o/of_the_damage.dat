5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> from Dean was {{concentrated}} in the states of Texas and Oklahoma. The damage, if any, was mainly due to the heavy rain across both states. The total cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> totaled to $500,000 (1995 USD; $707,000 2008 USD).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the site}} was {{restored}} during the archaeological investigations, it suffered considerable damage in the 1976 Guatemala earthquake. This resulted in destruction {{of some of the}} restoration work, although some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> has now been repaired.|$|E

30|$|Step 1. Create and get {{boundary}} points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> {{region to}} create a queue to store boundary points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> region. To get a boundary point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> region, pixel value is 1 in <b>the</b> <b>damaged</b> region in <b>the</b> binary template image mask. For each pixel point of image mask, if the pixel value is 1, and its eight-neighborhood pixels value at least one is 0, then store the pixel to created the queue. Eventually, the queue is boundary points of damaged region.|$|R

Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> was caused by heavy rain, which triggered widespread flash flooding and landslides. Many of the areas Bilis flooded were later affected by Typhoon Kaemi, Typhoon Prapiroon, and intense Typhoon Saomai.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan {{killed at}} least 216 people, with 118 {{unaccounted}} for. The total cost of damage was around $2billion (1988USD). All of the deaths and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> were due to the Joan portion of Hurricane Joan–Miriam.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane King struck Miami {{around midnight}} local {{time with a}} very compact area of strong winds. Its eye was about 5.2miles (8.4km) in diameter; {{the western edge of}} the eye moved across Miami International Airport, which {{reported}} wind gusts of 125mph (202km/h), and the eastern side struck the Miami Weather Bureau office, which recorded sustained winds of 122mph (197km/h). The principal damage zone was sharply-defined in an area 14miles (23km) in diameter; the boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> resembled the path of a tornado, although a subsequent analysis indicated the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> was not tornadic in nature. There was one confirmed report of a damaging tornado in Davie. As it made landfall, Hurricane King produced lightning near its center, which was the first confirmed occurrence in Florida. The Weather Bureau considered King the severest hurricane since the 1926 Great Miami Hurricane to hit the area.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, lack of power {{prevented}} communications {{and the outside}} world had little knowledge of the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> in Dominica. A citizen named Fred White ended that by using a battery-operated ham radio to contact the world.|$|E

5|$|According to an Iranian {{radio station}} report, 200 villages {{sustained}} severe damage or were totally destroyed.

Local officials initially estimated the cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> at $67million 1997 US$ (roughly 89.5million 2008 USD). The estimate was later raised to 100million 1997 USD (roughly 133.6million 2008 USD).

In Matamoros, part of the city lost power and running water; in Valle Hermoso, two schools were damaged; in Reynosa, 180people were evacuated from low-lying areas in five districts of the city, while in San Fernando, the main highway through the city was closed, and traffic on the bridge over the Conchos River was restricted to one lane.|$|E

Downtown Tokyo sustained the worst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage,</b> where 8,000homes were flooded.

5|$|Across its path, Bingiza {{destroyed}} 25,464houses {{and damaged}} 36schools. Overall, {{the damage was}} less than expected, given {{the strength of the}} cyclone. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> occurred due to the poor infrastructure and drainage systems of Madagascar, along with high levels of poverty. A total of 34deaths were reported, along with 13injuries. When Bingiza made its final landfall, it produced five days of rainfall to a region already severely affected by flooding. In Vangaindrano district in southeastern Madagascar, the cyclone caused widespread flooding that isolated five villages, as well as covering fields of rice and other crops. A total of 310people in the southern portion of the country were left homeless.|$|E
