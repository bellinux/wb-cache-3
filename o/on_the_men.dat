5|$|According to news reports, {{the first}} {{passenger}} trains {{left the city}} at 9:00am, and continued running throughout the day. Around 10:00am, General W. S. Hancock arrived and was followed by 360–400 federal troops from New York and Fort Monroe, who relieved those guarding Camden Station. They brought with them two 12 pounder artillery pieces. From that point <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of the 5th and the federal troops took turns guarding the station.|$|E

On her way to port she had {{encountered}} , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With {{the assistance of the}} crews from two sloops, the guardship , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the pumps, the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further. Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> at the pumps once more, and when she was off Penlee Point, Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} she entered some failed {{business}} ventures, including in 1988 a perfume named Woman (after the 1980 John Lennon song) and, in April 1989, a restaurant named Lennon's—at 13/14 Upper St. Martin's Lane, Covent Garden—which had menu items such as Rubber Sole (a play on the already-punning 1965 Beatles album), as well as Sgt. Pepper's Steak and Penny Lane Pâté. It had a short life as a business venture, as it {{was considered to be}} far too expensive. She would later blame some of these efforts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in her life encouraging her.|$|E

5|$|The bloody Wheatfield {{remained}} {{quiet for}} the rest of the battle. But it took a heavy toll <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who traded possession back-and-forth. The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed to crawl to Plum Run but could not cross it. The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small expanse of agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique significance in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous days with a mortar and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and water shortages also took their toll <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults before they got started.|$|E

5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak {{in a heavy}} fog that allowed the North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies {{on either side of the}} road on low ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> there, and then T-34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed the tanks. Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them there, {{and the likelihood of}} rescue from any other outside agency was equally negligible. The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> many of whom were in a run-down state both mentally and physically.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Eastwood {{directed}} {{two films}} about World War II's Battle of Iwo Jima. The first, Flags of Our Fathers, focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who raised the American flag {{on top of}} Mount Suribachi and featured the film debut of Eastwood's son Scott. This was followed by Letters from Iwo Jima, which dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers {{on the island and}} the letters they wrote home to family members. Letters from Iwo Jima was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay for Letters from Iwo Jima. At the 64th Golden Globe Awards Eastwood received nominations for Best Director in both films. Letters from Iwo Jima won the award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E

Under the command of Colonel Patrick Cleburne, the unit was transferred from state service to Confederate service on July 23, 1861, at Pitman's Ferry, AR and was initially designated as the 1st Arkansas Infantry; This transfer was not binding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> who could opt out if they so desired. The men of Company C (Yell Guards) and Company G (Hindman Guards) declined to transfer to the Provisional Army of the Confederate States, so the men were honorably discharged and their companies were disbanded.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} few decades British athletes have usually won between one and three gold medals at the Olympics; the 2012 Games in London saw three British athletes win four golds (single golds by Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford, and two by Mo Farah). Traditionally Britain was strongest in men's athletics, {{especially}} middle distance running, but over the last 20 years success has been achieved {{in a wide range of}} events and British women have closed the attainment gap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> However, there remain serious concerns about the depth of the sport in Britain, with the number of club athletes reportedly in decline.|$|E
25|$|A third 319th Rifle Division began forming on {{the last}} day of September, 1943, near Kholm in the Northwestern Front, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> and {{equipment}} of the 32nd and 33rd Rifle Brigades. Its order of battle remained the same as the first two formations. The two rifle brigades were from different armies within the Front, but the 319th's divisional headquarters was formed in the 44th Rifle Corps of 22nd Army, before the brigades had been officially disbanded to provide the bulk of the troops for the new division. On October 10, most of the assets of this Front came under the headquarters of the disbanded Bryansk Front to become Baltic Front, renamed 2nd Baltic Front ten days later. The division would remain under these commands until late August, 1944.|$|E

25|$|The wounded Smith was ferried {{across to}} Red Bank, leaving the {{garrison}} leaderless. Varnum {{reported that the}} troops would welcome a British infantry assault, but that the constant barrage was taking its toll <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> Fleury wrote to Washington that all the guns were dismounted except two but that the soldiers of the garrison were able {{to repair the damage}} to the palisades every night. The only safe place in the fort was a ditch on the east side and Fleury would go there to round up men for work details, lashing out at the laggards with his cane. The next in command after Smith was Lieutenant Colonel Giles Russell of Connecticut, but he declined and asked to be recalled. On November 12 Major Thayer accepted command of the fort.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} North Korean armor {{came down the}} trail {{from the north and}} shot up the {{artillery}} positions, enemy infantry closed on the 555th Artillery emplacements and fired <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> with small arms and automatic weapons. Three of the 105mm howitzers managed to continue firing for several hours after daybreak, perhaps until 0900. Then the North Koreans overran the 555th positions. The 90th Field Artillery Battalion suffered almost as great a calamity. Early in the pre-dawn attack, the North Koreans scored direct hits on two 155mm howitzers and several ammunition trucks of A Battery. Only by fighting resolutely as infantrymen, manning the machine guns on the perimeter and occupying foxholes as riflemen, were the battalion troops able to repel the North Korean attack.|$|E

When these mortals come for Duncan, he is ready and follows them back to their hideout, rescuing Fitz, who is about to be guillotined and confronting their leader, a wild-eyed fanatic who wants to destroy all Immortals.
