5|$|Plan 9 {{demonstrated}} that an integral concept of Unix—that every system interface could be {{represented as a}} set of files—could be successfully implemented in a modern distributed system. Some features from Plan 9, like the UTF-8 character encoding of Unicode, have been implemented in other operating systems. Unix-like operating systems such as Linux have implemented 9P, Plan 9's file system, and have adopted features of rfork, Plan 9's process creation mechanism. Additionally, in Plan 9 from User Space, several <b>of</b> <b>Plan</b> 9's applications and tools, including the sam and acme editors, have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity. Several projects seek to replace the GNU operating system programs surrounding the Linux kernel with the Plan 9 operating system programs. The 9wm window manager was inspired by 8½, the older windowing system <b>of</b> <b>Plan</b> 9; wmii is also heavily influenced by Plan 9.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} conceptual {{tools for}} the analysis <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour. These are, firstly, a model <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> systems as learning systems, and then three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour, each described by defining a pair of dichotomous concepts at their far ends: 'blueprint' versus 'process' modes of planning; 'rational-deductive' decision-making versus 'disjointed incrementalism'; 'normative' versus 'functional' <b>planning.</b> Each <b>of</b> these concepts is discussed in detail, and some indicators {{for the analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour are suggested. Finally, a more complex model is constructed which combines the three dimensions. Elements of this model are firstly {{the level at which}} planning is conducted within a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> systems, and secondly, the 'planning sub-structure', that is the technology-image reflecting the nature <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> problems and available planning technologies. From this model one can derive a number of researchable hypotheses about planning behaviour. ...|$|R
