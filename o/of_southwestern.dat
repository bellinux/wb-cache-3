5|$|Both the Virgin Anasazi and the Parowan Fremont {{disappear}} from the archaeological record <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Utah by about 1300.

5|$|Basque, not an Indo-European language, {{survived in}} the region of the Pyrenees. The people <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Gaul and northeastern Hispania (roughly present-day Aquitaine and Navarre) were {{regarded}} by Julius Caesar as ethnically distinct from the Celts, and the Aquitanian language they spoke was Vasconic like Basque, judging from place names. The Aquitani adopted Latin under Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were issued}} along the coast, while Coast Guard personnel went door-to-door on Grand Isle urging residents {{to leave the}} area. From there through the coast <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Florida, small craft were advised to remain near shore due to rough seas. Offshore, workers were removed from oil rigs. Many Mississippi citizens, having experienced the destruction of Hurricane Camille just five years earlier, quickly left their coastal homes.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{during the}} season was {{relatively}} minimal. In early June, Tropical Storm Barbara moved ashore just northwest of the Mexico–Guatemala border, causing $55 million (2007 USD) in damage and 4 deaths. In late July, Cosme passed south of the island of Hawaii as a weakening tropical depression; light rain and increased surf resulted. A few days later, Dalila passed offshore the coastline <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Mexico, killing 11 and causing minimal damage. Hurricane Flossie followed a similar track to Cosme in mid-August, producing gusty winds and light precipitation in Hawaii. Hurricane Henriette in early September produced torrential rainfall in southwestern Mexico, killing 6 and causing $25 million in damage. Baja California received moderate rains from Hurricane Ivo in mid-September, though no damage nor fatalities were reported. In mid-October, Tropical Storm Kiko passed just offshore the coastline <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Mexico. Though no deaths were reported on the Mexico mainland, the storm capsized a ship with 30 people on board, 15 of whom were recovered dead, and 9 of whom were reported missing. Overall, the season ended with $80 million in damage and 49 deaths.|$|E

5|$|The Harpy Tomb is {{a marble}} chamber from a pillar tomb {{that stands in}} the {{abandoned}} city of Xanthos, capital of ancient Lycia, a region <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Anatolia {{in what is now}} Turkey.

5|$|After making {{landfall}} near Jacmel, Hurricane Gustav began traversing northwestward {{across the}} mountainous terrain <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Haiti, dumping heavy rains as it passed. With favorable atmospheric conditions the storm maintained its hurricane intensity {{for several hours}} after landfall, but the high mountains over which it was traveling disrupted its lower level circulation. The eye because ragged and clouded over as Gustav weakened to a tropical storm. A large mid- to upper-level anticyclone over the Florida Straight slowed Gustav's movement, holding it over the northern coast of Haiti's southern peninsula. Rainfall from the storm, which had been heavy since its landfall, began to accumulate as the storm's movement stalled. Although the storm's upper levels began experiencing moderate shear, and although parts of its circulation were still interacting with the mountains <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Haiti, enough of Gustav's convection was over the Gulf of Gonâve that {{on the morning of}} August 27 its organization started to improve. That afternoon, as a broad ridge extended from the Gulf of Mexico into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Gustav began to slowly pull to the west, away from the island of Hispaniola. Increased shear weakened the storm as the building ridge to the north of Gustav imparted a southerly component to the storm's motion.|$|E
5|$|After no {{tropical}} cyclone activity in July and August, the third tropical storm formed offshore <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Mexico on September3. Like {{the previous two}} {{tropical cyclone}}, this storm had a peak of 50mph (80km/h), and did not intensify further. Tropical Storm Three headed northwestward, and began paralleling the coast of Baja California. On September8, Tropical Storm Three turned abruptly south-southwestward, and dissipated by the next day. The outer rainbands of this system were expected to bring squally weather over the Baja California Peninsula; instead, this storm turned away without causing any impact.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{collection of}} Willie Nelson materials (1975–1994) {{became part of}} the Wittliff collections <b>of</b> <b>Southwestern</b> Writers, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas. The collection contains lyrics, screenplays, letters, concert programs, tour itineraries, posters, articles, clippings, personal effects, promotional items, souvenirs, and documents. It documents Nelson's IRS troubles and how Farm Aid contributions were used. Most of the material was collected by Nelson's friend Bill Wittliff, who wrote or co-wrote Honeysuckle Rose, Barbarosa and Red Headed Stranger. In 2014, Nelson donated his personal collection to the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. The items include photographs, correspondence, song manuscripts, posters, certificate records, awards, signed books, screenplays, personal items and gifts and tributes from Nelson's fans.|$|E
5|$|During a 2003 {{biological}} {{inventory of}} the Mikea Forest, a forest region <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Madagascar, a single specimen of the rodent genus Macrotarsomys was collected. This animal {{turned out to be}} distinct from both previously known species of the genus—bastard big-footed mouse, which is widespread in western Madagascar, and the larger greater big-footed mouse, known only from the Ankarafantsika National Park. Accordingly, Steven Goodman and Voahangy Soarimalala named it in 2005 as a new species, Macrotarsomys petteri. The specific name, petteri, honors French zoologist Francis Petter for his contributions to the study of Malagasy rodents. Petter's big-footed mouse, the largest species in the genus, is most similar to greater big-footed mouse, which may be its closest relative.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of the cyclone, the National Hurricane Center recommended for interests along the coast <b>of</b> <b>southwestern</b> Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm. Upon regaining tropical storm status on June 1, the governments of Guatemala and Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Sipacate, Guatemala to Barra de Tonala, Mexico. Later, as the track became more apparent, the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning, and a tropical storm watch was extended westward to Salina Cruz, Mexico. Officials in Mexico allocated emergency funds for southern regions of Chiapas and Oaxaca in preparation for a potential flooding disaster. At least 1,400people were evacuated in Chiapas to emergency shelters.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Madagascar's three established sites, a further seven sites {{are listed as}} tentative and are under consideration by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee for elevation to official status.
