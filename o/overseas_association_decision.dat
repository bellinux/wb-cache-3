40|$|There are 14 United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), {{of which}} nine are {{associated}} with the European Union (EU) via the <b>Overseas</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Decision</b> (OAD) adopted by the EU in 2013. Gibraltar, meanwhile, is part of the EU under Article 355 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Only the citizens of Gibraltar were able to vote in the referendum on the United Kingdom’s (UK) membership of the EU, but the consequences for all are potentially very significant. The UKOTs benefit currently from economic and environmental cooperation, as well as development assistance and policy dialogue. The article considers briefly the growth {{of the relationship between the}} UKOTs and the EU, before setting out the key aspects of the relationship which the Territories are keen to maintain. The second half of the article focuses on the (minor) role the UKOTs played in the referendum debate, and what might happen to the present levels of cooperation as the UK disengages from the EU...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission (EC) {{recently}} tabled a Green Paper on {{the future}} relations between the European Union (EU) and the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs). The document is intended to spark a broad public debate on the opportunity of replacing the current <b>Overseas</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Decision</b> (OAD) of 2001 with an “innovative partnership” for the territories when the present agreement expires on 31 December 2013. The Commission will hold an online consultation covering the issue from 1 July to 17 October 2008. This remains without prejudice to a possible revision of the OAD {{before the end of}} 2011, in accordance with its article 62. The need for the launch of the debate arose out of the recognition that the current OCT-EU association is based on an outdated development cooperation logic, whereas the OCTs potential and the challenges they are facing would require an approach that focuses on the strengthening of their competitiveness, the facilitation of regional integration and the reduction {{of the impact of the}} factors that contribute to their vulnerability [...] Chapter I. - Implications of EPA on Caribeban OCTs.
