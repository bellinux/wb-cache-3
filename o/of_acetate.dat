40|$|In this work, we {{evaluate}} the physic-chemical characteristics and volatile compounds {{during the second}} fermentation and aging of typical Brazilian sparkling wines. For this purpose, second fermentations were conducted by the traditional method using a base wine elaborated with Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Riesling Italic, and fermented with S. cerevisiae vr. bayanus EC 1118 strain. Samples were collected from 0 to 360 days, and evaluated {{with respect to the}} basic physic-chemical characteristics, yeast population, and the concentration of volatile compounds. The results showed that the second fermentation, other than an increment in the alcohol concentration leads to a small increase in volatile acidity, where total acidity decreased during fermentation, and increase again during aging. Yeast population declined rapidly after fermentation, but autolysis initiated just after 9 month of aging. Based on the concentration of volatile compounds, three profiles could be defined: (1) a fermentation profile defined by higher concentrations <b>of</b> <b>acetates</b> and lower concentrations of ethylates and fatty acids; (2) a post-fermentation profile with intermediary concentrations <b>of</b> <b>acetates,</b> and increased concentrations of fatty acids, and their ethyl esters; and (3) a mature profile with higher concentrations of diethyl succinate, fusel alcohols, volatile fatty acids, and their ethyl esters, and lower concentrations <b>of</b> <b>acetates...</b>|$|R

When a very strong solution was used, more gas was evolved at the anode than at the cathode, {{in the proportion of}} 4 to 3 nearly: that from the anode was a mixture of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid; that from the cathode pure hydrogen. When a much weaker solution was used, less gas was evolved at the anode than at the cathode; and it now contained carburetted hydrogen, as well as carbonic oxide and carbonic acid. This result of carburetted hydrogen at the positive electrode has a very anomalous appearance, if considered as an immediate consequence of the decomposing power of the current. It, however, as well as the carbonic oxide and acid, is only a secondary result; for it is the water alone which suffers electro-decomposition, and it is the oxygen eliminated at the anode which, reacting on the acetic acid, in the midst of which it is evolved, produces those substances that finally appear there. This is fully proved by experiments with the volta-electrometer (707.); for then the hydrogen evolved from the acetate at the cathode is always found to be definite, being exactly proportionate to the electricity which has passed through the solution, and, in quantity, the same as the hydrogen evolved in the volta-electrometer itself. The appearance of the carbon in combination with the hydrogen at the positive electrode, and its non-appearance at the negative electrode, are in curious contrast with the results which might have been expected from the law usually accepted respecting the final places of the elements.|$|E
60|$|The Effects {{of certain}} other Salts and Fluids.--Two leaves {{were placed in}} a {{solution}} of one part <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> of ammonia to about [page 49] 146 of water, and were acted on quite as energetically, but perhaps not quite so quickly, as by the carbonate. After 10 m. the glands were black, and in the cells beneath them there were traces of aggregation, which after 15 m. was well marked, extending down the tentacles for a length {{equal to that of}} the glands. After 2 hrs. the contents of almost all the cells in all the tentacles were broken up into masses of protoplasm. A leaf was immersed in a solution of one part of oxalate of ammonia to 146 of water; and after 24 m. some, but not a conspicuous, change could be seen within the cells beneath the glands. After 47 m. plenty of spherical masses of protoplasm were formed, and these extended down the tentacles for about the length of the glands. This salt, therefore, does not act so quickly as the carbonate. With respect to the citrate of ammonia, a leaf was placed in a little solution of the above strength, and there was not even a trace of aggregation in the cells beneath the glands, until 56 m. had elapsed; but it was well marked after 2 hrs. 20 m. On another occasion a leaf was placed in a stronger solution, of one part of the citrate to 109 of water (4 grs. to 1 oz.), {{and at the same time}} another leaf in a solution of the carbonate of the same strength. The glands of the latter were blackened in less than 2 m., and after 1 hr. 45 m. the aggregated masses, which were spherical and very dark-coloured, extended down all the tentacles, for between half and two-thirds of their lengths; whereas in the leaf immersed in the citrate the glands, after 30 m., were of a dark red, and the aggregated masses in the cells beneath them pink and elongated. After 1 hr. 45 m. these masses extended down for only about one-fifth or one-fourth of the length of the tentacles.|$|E
60|$|In a large {{majority}} of these twenty cases, a varying degree of inflection was slowly caused by the phosphate. In four cases, however, the inflection was rapid, occurring in less than half an hour or at most in 50 m. In three cases the phosphate did not produce the least effect. Now what are we to infer from these facts? We know from ten trials that immersion in distilled water for 24 hrs. prevents the subsequent action of the phosphate solution. It would, therefore, appear as if the solutions of chloride of manganese, tannic and tartaric acids, which are not poisonous, acted exactly like water, for the phosphate produced no effect on the leaves which had been previously immersed in these three solutions. The majority of the other solutions behaved to a certain extent like water, for the phosphate produced, after a considerable interval of time, only a slight effect. On the other hand, the leaves which had been immersed in the solutions of the chloride of rubidium and magnesium, <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> of strontium, nitrate of barium, and citric acid, were quickly acted on by the phosphate. Now was water absorbed from these five weak solutions, and yet, owing to the presence of the salts, did not prevent the subsequent action of the phosphate? Or [page 216] may we not suppose* that the interstices of the walls of the glands were blocked up with the molecules of these five substances, so that they were rendered impermeable to water; for had water entered, we know from the ten trials that the phosphate would not afterwards have produced any effect? It further appears that the molecules of the carbonate of ammonia can quickly pass into glands which, from having been immersed for 20 m. in a weak solution of sugar, either absorb the phosphate very slowly or are acted on by it very slowly. On the other hand, glands, however they may have been treated, seem easily to permit the subsequent entrance of the molecules of carbonate of ammonia. Thus leaves which had been immersed in a solution (of one part to 437 of water) of nitrate of potassium for 48 hrs.--of sulphate of potassium for 24 hrs.--and of the chloride of potassium for 25 hrs.--on being placed in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water, had their glands immediately blackened, and after 1 hr. their tentacles somewhat inflected, and the protoplasm aggregated. But it would be an endless task to endeavour to ascertain the wonderfully diversified effects of various solutions on Drosera.|$|E
