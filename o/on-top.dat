25|$|In May 2008, both Shueisha and Studio APPP halted manga/OVA {{shipments}} of JoJo after a complaint had been launched against them {{by a group}} of online Muslim protestors after a scene from one of the OVA's episodes features Dio reading a book depicting pages from the Qur'an. This recall affected the English-language releases as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year. Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting <b>on-top,</b> and destroying, mosques. Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being published on April 7, 2009, and thus their publication was continued.|$|E

50|$|Story synopsis: Kreepy Hallow {{is set in}} the 1860’s {{along the}} St. Lawrence River, when the first {{appointed}} female teacher, Miss Ichaboda Krane, takes over the ghostly schoolroom built <b>on-top</b> of a sacred Iroquois burial ground. With a classroom filled with eclectic children, her “eye” on Bartholomeus Van Tassel, a few unexpected guests, and a jealous local woman Electra Van Brunt watching her every move, Miss Ichaboda Krane’s Halloween celebration turns into a most haunting affair. Narrated by Brazillia R. Kreep, Kreepy Hallow tells the tale of Ichaboda Krane’s encounter with all things that go bump in the night as the dreadful Headless Horseman rides again.|$|E
50|$|Ben Chapman {{portrayed the}} Gill-man for the {{majority}} of the scenes shot at Universal City, California. Many of the <b>on-top</b> of the water scenes were filmed at Rice Creek near Palatka, Florida. The costume made it impossible for Chapman to sit for the 14 hours of each day that he wore it, and it overheated easily, so he stayed in the back lot's lake, often requesting to be hosed down. He also could not see very well while wearing the headpiece, which caused him to scrape Julie Adams' head against the wall when carrying her in the grotto scenes. Ricou Browning played the Gill-Man in the underwater shots, which were filmed by the second unit in Wakulla Springs, Florida.|$|E
50|$|The {{nightmare}} sequence, where Linda gets decapitated by Malfeitor (to {{where her}} hands exaggeratedly move around) in the hospital, {{was done with}} a stand-in that came for Kitaen where her head was ducked low and had a Styrofoam head <b>on-top</b> connected with a poll, with a wig that matched Kitaen's hairstyle. Luebsen cited that he was nervous from the scene as the axe used was a real one, and he was swinging it {{very close to the}} stand-in. Special-effects artist Tassilo Baur explained that although they used a real axe, they had also used prop axes for safety reasons, but as well as to improve their performances. Baur also had some props that were hinged so that they preciously hit a specific spot.|$|E

50|$|The Wopmay orogen can be {{subdivided}} into (east to west): a passive continental margin, the Wopmay fault zone, the Great Bear magmatic zone, and the Hottah terrane. The passive margin developed around 1970-1890 Ma <b>on-top</b> of the Slave Craton. The Wopmay fault zone {{is probably a}} suture between the Slave craton and the Hottah terrane. No Archean crust have been found west of this suture. The Great Bear magmatic zone {{is the result of}} arc magmatism around 1875-1840 Ma when these rocks were deposited on and intruded into the Hottah terrane and Slave craton. The magmatic arc now forms a 3-4.5 km thick basin overlying the Hottah-Slave transition. The cryptic Hottah terrane is a magmatic arc which consists of a 1936-1890 Ma-old suite of plutons intruded into 2.0-2.4 Ga metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks. It probably extends east beneath the Great Bear magmatic zone.|$|E

5000|$|The station {{first opened}} for service on August 30, 1996, for the {{historic}} Charlotte Trolley, with one track and one wooden platform. In 2001, during {{construction of the}} Westin Charlotte, the original wooden platform was removed and the bridge over the John Belk Freeway was refurbished. In mid-2002, the station reopened with a temporary wooden platform {{at the end of}} the bridge over the John Belk Freeway. In 2003, the station was renamed the Westin Station after completion of the Westin Charlotte; a new platform for the station was built <b>on-top</b> of the parking structure of the adjacent hotel. [...] On February 6, 2006, the station was closed again for reconstruction for the LYNX Blue Line; the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) decided going forward to call it Stonewall Station again. The station officially reopened for service on Saturday, November 24, 2007, and as part of its opening celebration fares were not collected. Regular service with fare collection commenced on Monday, November 26, 2007. [...] Charlotte Trolley service resumed on April 20, 2008, but was scaled back to weekend and special events in 2009. In 2010, the Charlotte Trolley service to the station was discontinued. [...] In 2015, the side platforms were lengthen to allow three-car trains at the station.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, burlesque {{performers}} and actresses sometimes used photographic advertisement as business cards to promote themselves. These adverts and business cards could often {{be found in}} almost every green room, pinned-up or stuck into [...] "frames of the looking-glasses, in the joints of the gas-burners, and sometimes lying <b>on-top</b> of the sacred cast-case itself." [...] Understanding the power of photographic advertisements to promote their shows, burlesque women self-constructed their identity to make themselves visible. Being recognized not only within the theater itself but also outside challenged the conventions of women's place and women's potential in the public sphere. [...] "To understand both the complicated identity and the subversive nature of the 19th-century actress, one must also understand that the era's views on women's potential were inextricably tied to their sexuality, which in turn was tied to their level of visibility in the public sphere: regardless of race, class or background, it was generally assumed that the more public the woman, the more 'public,' or available, her sexuality", according to historian Maria Elena Buszek. Being sexually fantasized, famous actresses in early 20th-century film were both drawn and photographed and put on posters to be sold for personal entertainment. Among the celebrities who were considered sex symbols, {{one of the most}} popular early pin-up girls was Betty Grable, whose poster was ubiquitous in the lockers of G.I.s during World War II.|$|E
40|$|Methylamine {{adsorption}} on the ordered Ni 3 Al(111) and NiAl(110) surfaces {{has been}} investigated by high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Methylamine adsorbs molecularly at both surfaces at low temperature (90 K). The experiments show that methylamine interacts with the surface aluminium atoms on both surfaces, resulting in a positive binding energy shift relative to the Al 2 p bulk contributions. A shift towards lower binding energy is also observed on NiAl(110) attributed to first and second layer surface Al atoms not bonded to methylamine. According to total energy calculations methylamine binds through its N atom to Al <b>on-top</b> sites on NiAl(110) while the Ni <b>on-top</b> site {{is found to be}} slightly preferred over the Al <b>on-top</b> site on Ni 3 Al(111). Calculated adsorbate induced shifts are, however, in good agreement with the experimental values only when methylamine is situated in the Al <b>on-top</b> site on both surfaces. In both cases, a lone pair bonding mechanism is found...|$|E
40|$|By using {{low-energy}} electron diffraction (LEED), {{we observed}} a (root 5 x root 5) R 26. 7 degrees {{pattern in the}} coadsorption of Bi and K (or Cs) on Cu(001) at room temperature. Both (root 5 x root 5) R 26. 7 degrees-Bi,K and -Bi,Cs structures were determined by a tensor LEED analysis. The two structures are ordered mixed phases and similar to each other: Bi atoms are located at surface fourfold hollow sites and K (or Cs) atoms occupy <b>on-top</b> sites of the substrate surface Cu atoms. Significant rumpling of 0. 13 Angstrom (-Bi,K) or 0. 19 Angstrom (-Bi,Cs) {{is found in the}} top Cu layer. It is suggested that the <b>on-top</b> site occupation of K or Cs atoms is stabilized by additional bonds with surrounding Bi atoms. The Hamilton-ratio tests suggest that K atoms displace laterally from the exact <b>on-top</b> position, but that Cs atoms are upright on the <b>on-top</b> sites. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.
