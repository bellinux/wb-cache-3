5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E

Now, on the occasion of this visit, Smuts chose to give his address <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> Pan-Africanism.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 David Pountney was {{appointed}} to succeed Fisher as chief executive. He had worked with the company since the 1970s, most recently on a 2006 The Flying Dutchman with Terfel which was set in space. In 2013 he programmed a trilogy of operas set in Tudor England: Donizetti's Anna Bolena, Maria Stuarda and Roberto Devereux, with another trilogy the following year, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> fallen women – Puccini's Manon Lescaut, Henze's Boulevard Solitude and Verdi's La traviata. For 2016 Pountney scheduled another trilogy, this time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> Figaro, consisting of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro and Rossini's The Barber of Seville and a new work, Figaro Gets a Divorce with music by Elena Langer and libretto by Pountney.|$|E
5|$|It portrayed Hall as a humourless moralist {{who had a}} {{great deal}} in common with the opponents of her novel.

The image horrified Hall; her guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, The Master of the House.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Symphony has a non-customary structure, {{comprising}} two movements {{instead of}} the common three or four.

5|$|A {{preoccupation with}} his own {{mortality}} permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony used throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping {{had never been in}} intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} {{detailed}} study of common descent with modifications by expanding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Palmer was {{appointed}} {{professor in the}} Department of Philosophy at Texas A University. The same year saw the publication of her Animal Ethics in Context with Columbia University Press. Among reviews of this book were pieces by Bernard Rollin in Anthrozoös, Jason Zinser in The Quarterly Review of Biology, J. M. Dieterle in Environmental Ethics, Scott D. Wilson in Ethics and Daniel A. Dombrowski in the Journal of Animal Ethics. She has subsequently published papers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> assisting animals in the wild—ideas discussed in her Animal Ethics in Context—in animal-focussed journals, prompting commentary from Joel MacClellan, Gordon Burghart, and Catia Faria.|$|E

5|$|The {{biography}} of Macrinus is notoriously unreliable, {{and after a}} partial reversion to reliability in the Life of Elagabalus, the Alexander Severus, {{one of the longest}} biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> the wise philosopher king. Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – Herodian up to 238, and probably Dexippus in the later books, for the entire imperial period the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte as well as Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Ammianus Marcellinus and Jerome – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.|$|E
5|$|Writing in {{the book}} The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward, {{director}} of Film Studies at the University of Exeter, considered Le Dernier Combat and The Fifth Element to be Besson's two film's which focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> environmental damage, as waste and pollution are visible throughout both films. Capitalism was also {{considered to be a}} theme; consumer commodities were said to be signs of death, such as the abandoned cars in the desert and the floating washing machines in a flooded abandoned factory.|$|E
5|$|For {{his second}} envoi, {{not wishing to}} test the Académie's {{tolerance}} too far, Bizet proposed to submit a quasi-religious work {{in the form of}} a secular mass on a text by Horace. This work, entitled Carmen Saeculare, was intended as a song to Apollo and Diana. No trace exists, and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it. A tendency to conceive ambitious projects, only to quickly abandon them, became a feature of Bizet's Rome years; in addition to Carmen Saeculare, he considered and discarded at least five opera projects, two attempts at a symphony, and a symphonic ode <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> Ulysses and Circe. After Don Procopio, Bizet completed only one further work in Rome, the symphonic poem Vasco da Gama. This replaced Carmen Saeculare as his second envoi, and was well received by the Académie, though swiftly forgotten thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Her next {{success was}} Jhankaar Beats, a comedy {{revolving}} around {{the music of}} legendary composer R D Burman, which saw her playing a small and glamorous role alongside Shayan Munshi, Juhi Chawla, Rahul Bose, Rinke Khanna and Sanjay Suri. Produced by Pritish Nandy, publishing director of The Times of India, the film was made on a budget of Rs.25million (US$525,000), marking the sixth {{in a row of}} small to medium budget films made by Pritish Nandy Communications (PNC). Despite being part of a wave of offbeat films that mostly failed to make an impact at the box office, it drew public attention upon its release, which led to a commercial success among a restricted audience targeted by a selective release in twenty cities. It {{was one of the first}} films made in Hinglish, a mixture of Hindi and English. In 2005, she starred in Shaadi No. 1, which had no female lead. This comedy, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> modern marriage, was directed by David Dhawan, a renowned film director from this genre.|$|E
5|$|K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was {{watching}} a Marathi film where two warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are attacked by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving Sivaji in grief. Prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote a story <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves a queen. He fights 100 warriors and dies {{in his attempt to}} re-enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a Chief Minister or a popular social worker like Medha Patkar. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director S. S. Rajamouli selected this script, but made several changes to it. Rajamouli re-characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt that the relationship between a queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{many of the}} revolutionaries {{attended}} a theatre production <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> tyranny, called Rome Saved. The lead actor was Morante, playing Cicero. The police chief requested Morante to feign illness and not appear, so that the play could be replaced with Misanthropy and Repentance by the German novelist and playwright August von Kotzebue. Rumors of police censorship spread quickly; Morante ignored the request and performed the play as planned. In the fourth act, Morante made a patriotic speech, about the Gaul threat to Rome (the Gauls are ancestors of the French people) {{and the need for}} strong leadership to resist the danger. This scene lifted the revolutionaries' spirits and led to frenzied applause. Juan José Paso stood up and cried out for the freedom of Buenos Aires, and a small fight ensued.|$|E
