40|$|Abstract Background Incident {{reporting}} {{is the most}} common method for detecting adverse events in a hospital. However, under-reporting or non-reporting and delay in submission of reports are problems that prevent early detection of serious adverse events. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether it is possible to promptly detect serious injuries after inpatient falls by using a natural language processing method and to determine which data source is the most suitable for this purpose. Methods We tried to detect adverse events from narrative text data of electronic medical records by using a natural language processing method. We made syntactic category decision rules to detect inpatient falls from text data in electronic medical records. We compared how often the true fall events were recorded in various sources of data including progress notes, discharge summaries, image <b>order</b> <b>entries</b> and incident reports. We applied the rules to these data sources and compared F-measures to detect falls between these data sources with reference to the results of a manual chart review. The lag time between event occurrence and data submission and the degree of injury were compared. Results We made 170 syntactic rules to detect inpatient falls by using a natural language processing method. Information on true fall events was most frequently recorded in progress notes (100 %), incident reports (65. 0 %) and image <b>order</b> <b>entries</b> (12. 5 %). However, F-measure to detect falls using the rules was poor when using progress notes (0. 12) and discharge summaries (0. 24) compared with that when using incident reports (1. 00) and image <b>order</b> <b>entries</b> (0. 91). Since the results suggested that incident reports and image <b>order</b> <b>entries</b> were possible data sources for prompt detection of serious falls, we focused on a comparison of falls found by incident reports and image <b>order</b> <b>entries.</b> Injury caused by falls found by image <b>order</b> <b>entries</b> was significantly more severe than falls detected by incident reports (p Conclusions By using natural language processing of text data from image <b>order</b> <b>entries,</b> we could detect injurious falls within a shorter time than that by using incident reports. Concomitant use of this method might improve the shortcomings of an incident reporting system such as under-reporting or non-reporting and delayed submission of data on incidents. </p...|$|R

[...] Handwritten reports or notes, manual <b>order</b> <b>entry,</b> non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to errors and injuries to patients, [...] A follow up IOM report in 2001 advised use of electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions. Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable hospital medical error. A 2006 report by the Institute of Medicine estimated that a hospitalized patient is exposed to a medication error each day {{of his or her}} stay. While further studies have estimated that CPOE implementation at all nonrural hospitals in the United States could prevent over 500,000 serious medication errors each year. Studies of computerized physician <b>order</b> <b>entry</b> (CPOE) has yielded evidence that suggests the medication error rate can be reduced by 80%, and errors that have potential for serious harm or death for patients can be reduced by 55%, and other studies have also suggested benefits. Further, in 2005, CMS and CDC released a report that showed only 41 percent of prophylactic antibacterials were correctly stopped within 24 hours of completed surgery. The researchers conducted an analysis over an eight-month period, implementing a CPOE system designed to stop the administration of prophylactic antibacterials. Results showed CPOE significantly improved timely discontinuation of antibacterials from 38.8 percent of surgeries to 55.7 percent in the intervention hospital. CPOE/e-Prescribing systems can provide automatic dosing alerts (for example, letting the user know that the dose is too high and thus dangerous) and interaction checking (for example, telling the user that 2 medicines ordered taken together can cause health problems). In this way, specialists in pharmacy informatics work with the medical and nursing staffs at hospitals to improve the safety and effectiveness of medication use by utilizing CPOE systems.|$|E

In both queueing systems, if units are not processed by one of the servers, those units are not lost, instead they retry to receive service by merging with the incoming arrival units. To approximate the asymptotic performance of the above queueing systems, a recursive algorithm is suggested, and appropriate performance measures are presented to be used as comparison criteria at the design stage. Furthermore, numerical results are provided and approximation outcomes are compared against those from a simulation study...|$|R
