The judge invoked a maxim in Islamic jurisprudence on preventing damage to justify the ban. He also ordered the home ministry, the broadcasting commission, and other state institutions {{to take action against}} former staff working at other media organisations within seven days upon request by the majority shareholders. The AG office in a press release said the appeal would be primarily based on the order to the authorities to enforce the ban which was clearly in violation of the constitution. “The home ministry nor any <b>other</b> <b>state</b> <b>institution</b> has the legal authority to prevent any individual from being employed anywhere of his or her choosing,” the statement in local language Dhivehi read. The statement also noted that the court had clearly denied the ex-Haveeru staff as a third party in the case to have a say which was in violation of the constitution and “Audi alteram partem.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{major problem}} of the {{transformation}} of the political, juridical and economic system of the state capitalism in the East European states is the securing of the positive approach of the population towards the reforms. An attempt to change the set order that governed private property rights and economy activities without having this in mind would have been a failure {{at the very beginning of}} these reforms. The conflict between the idea of free business ventures and the way of thinking of the socialist ideology that all people must have the same properties could not be successfully resolved without promoting a new social balance or at least finding some ways to ease hardships of the social reforms. The social function of private property could in this regard become an effective instrument for resolving this conflict. The process of transformation in Bulgaria is coming into the second decade. So the time has come not only to ask questions but to compare potential answers with the already given practical examples. In this regard it is of a great interest to analyse the jurisprudence of the newly established Bulgarian Constitutional Court. There is no <b>other</b> <b>state</b> <b>institution</b> like the Constitutional Court, having in mind the effects of its decisions, that could be in the centre of the process of transformation of the legal and economic system in Bulgaria. Especially, in the problematic field of the legal and economic order where the potential for various conflicts within a society that undergoes quick changes is at its pick, the Constitutional Court could become a power of balance, a leading actor or an obstacle for the necessary reforms. The author attempts to survey how property in constitutional sense in Bulgaria is defined, how the constitution of the major principles of economy could have impact on private property, how the standards under which state and private property are governed could be coordinated and how property should be governed in order to achieve the best benefit for all the economic subjects and how it could be used to obtain the optimal results within the process of transformation. The reader would firstly have the opportunity to obtain a view on the major legal regulations that govern the law of private property in constitutional sense having in mind the historical background. Then the organisation and the competencies of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court are described and the regulations and procedures governing the relationship between the regulations of the newest constitution and the regulations that came into effect before coming in force of the newest Bulgarian Constitution. The opinions of the Constitutional Court towards private property regulations are compared to the academic works in this field. At the end, the essence of the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court in regard to private property is shown and the opinion of the author to the structure of property regulations in constitutional sense is offered...|$|E
