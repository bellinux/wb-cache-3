5|$|In June 1940, the Wehrmacht had conquered most of Western Europe and Scandinavia. At that time, {{the only}} major power {{standing}} in the way of a German-dominated Europe was the British Empire and the Commonwealth. After having several peace offers rejected by the British, Adolf Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to destroy the RAF in order to gain air superiority <b>or</b> <b>air</b> supremacy as a prelude to launching Operation Sea Lion, an amphibious assault by the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) onto the British mainland.|$|E

5|$|As December began, the Japanese {{experienced}} considerable {{difficulty in}} keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of Allied air and naval {{attacks on the}} Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops, who by 7 December were losing about 50men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground <b>or</b> <b>air</b> attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 of that number were still alive, and only about 12,000 remained more or less fit for combat duty, with the rest incapacitated by battle wounds, disease, or malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|BCal {{entered into}} a bid to acquire at least one Concorde. However, BCal {{eventually}} arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and Aérospatiale respectively, to be maintained by either BA <b>or</b> <b>Air</b> France. BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required {{a high level of}} aircraft usage to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax. Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage. Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 energy crisis led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, Hitler {{gave the}} German armed forces (Wehrmacht) a {{directive}} (Directive No. 16) that ordered provisional preparations for invasion of Britain. This operation was codenamed Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seelöwe). Before {{this could be}} carried out, air superiority <b>or</b> <b>air</b> supremacy was required. The Luftwaffe was to destroy the RAF {{in order to prevent}} it from attacking the invasion fleet or providing protection for the Royal Navy's Home Fleet which might attempt to prevent a landing by sea. On 1 August Hitler gave the Luftwaffes commander-in-chief, Reichsmarschall (Empire Marshal) Hermann Göring and the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force) a (Directive No. 17) to launch the air assault.|$|E

5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water <b>or</b> <b>air,</b> which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
5|$|Like other lambeosaurines such as Parasaurolophus and Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus had a {{distinctive}} crest {{on the top}} of its head. Its nasal cavity ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions have been made for the function or functions of the crest, including housing salt glands, improving the sense of smell, use as a snorkel <b>or</b> <b>air</b> trap, acting as a resonating chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes of the same species to recognize each other. Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the most widely accepted of the various hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation <b>or</b> <b>air</b> trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

5|$|One of the higher-level predators {{within its}} ecosystem, the Australian swellshark feeds on {{crustaceans}} (particularly crabs and rock lobsters), cephalopods (including squid and octopus), and small fishes. Even large-sized prey {{tends to be}} swallowed whole; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to digestion. Like {{the other members of}} its genus, this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water <b>or</b> <b>air</b> into its stomach, as a defense against predators. These include larger fishes, such as the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and marine mammals. By inflating, the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices, make itself harder to swallow, or simply intimidate a would-be predator. Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species, but these are poorly documented.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas <b>or</b> <b>air</b> is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E
5|$|The 75th Ranger Regiment (U.S. Army Rangers) is {{the premier}} light-infantry {{unit of the}} United States Army and is {{headquartered}} at Fort Benning, Georgia.

The Army places much importance on the 75th Ranger Regiment and its training; it possesses the capabilities to conduct conventional and most special operations missions.

5|$|The CDF is {{the most}} senior {{appointment}} in the ADF. The CDF commands the ADF, and is notionally the equal of the Secretary of Defence, the most senior public servant in the Department of Defence. The CDF is the only four-star officer in the ADF and is a general, admiral <b>or</b> <b>air</b> chief marshal. As well as having command responsibilities, the CDF is the Minister for Defence's principal military adviser. Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin is the current CDF, and assumed this position on 30 June 2014. Hugh White, a prominent academic and former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence, has criticised the ADF's current command structure. White argues that the Minister plays too large a role in military decision-making and does not provide the CDF and Secretary of Defence with necessary and sufficient authority to manage the ADO effectively.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol's core cadet {{activity}} is the summer encampment.

Activities include the classroom courses, physical training, leadership development, and drill & ceremonies. Encampments are usually held at the wing (state) level and, when available are usually at military installations, preferably active United States Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command <b>or</b> <b>Air</b> National Guard installations, with military support.|$|E
