In the island of Panay, the natives declare that no one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been afflicted with buboes until the people from Bohol - who, as we said above, abandoned Bohol {{on account of the}} people of Maluco - came to settle in Panay, and gave the disease to some of the natives. For these reasons the governor, Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, founded the town of Arevalo, {{on the south side of}} this island; for the island runs north and south, and on that side live the majority of the people, and the villages are near this town, and the land here is more fertile." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Smith, Perot, and the EDS executives ruptured openly in September 1985, {{during a meeting}} in Dallas that brought the EDS executive compensation issue to a head. Smith was reluctant to accept the EDS plan, substituting a plan of his own. Described in Irreconcilable Differences by Doron Levin, EDS' CFO was explaining to Smith how they felt GM's plan was inferior, when Smith lost his temper. [...] "People in the room later would remember Smith's angry explosion as being wondrous and terrifying at the same time: wondrous for the extreme colors and sounds it brought to the room, terrifying because none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen someone lose his temper so completely in a business meeting. The EDS officers stared in disbelief {{as the chairman of}} the world's biggest and most powerful company lost it." ...|$|E

[...] Glynn walked in, took over this mess, and he just brought calm to the situation. [...] I've never seen such an extraordinary example of leadership in my entire career. [...] Absolutely magnificent. [...] No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night. [...] He and he alone brought all of the scared people together. [...] And you've got to remember that the flight controllers in those days were -- they were kids in their thirties. [...] They were good, but very few <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren't used to that. [...] All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken. [...] They were faced with things that they didn't understand, and Glynn walked in there, and he just kind of took charge." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 28 June 2016, Farage made {{a speech}} in the European Parliament in which he claimed that a {{hypothetical}} failure for the EU to forge a trade deal with an exiting UK would [...] "be far worse for you {{than it would be}} for us", to heckling and laughing by Parliament members. He insulted his fellow MEPs, claiming that [...] "virtually none" [...] <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> had done [...] "a proper job" [...] in their lives. Media around the world covered Farage's speech, including his comment: [...] "... when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me. Well I have to say, you're not laughing now are you?" [...] and his prediction that Britain will not be the only country to leave the EU. [...] In response, Guy Verhofstadt compared Farage's referendum posters with Nazi propaganda and credited the Brexit campaign with causing a multi-billion loss in the stock exchange. Explicitly addressing Farage, Verhofstadt added, [...] "... Ok. Let’s be positive. Finally, we're {{going to get rid of}} the biggest waste in the budget of the (European) Union, that we have paid for 17 years, your salary." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 310 BC the consul Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus went to Sutrium with {{reinforcements}} and {{was met by}} {{a superior}} force of Etruscans who were lined up for battle. He went up the hills and faced the enemy. The Etruscans charged in haste, throwing away their javelins. The Romans pelted them with javelins and stones. This unsettled the Etruscans and their line wavered. The Romans charged, the Etruscans fled and, as they were cut off by the Roman cavalry, they headed for the mountains instead of their camp. From there {{they went to the}} impassable Ciminian Forest, which the Romans were so scared of that none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> crossed it. Marcus Fabius, one of the brothers of the consul, who had been educated by family friends in Caere in Etruria and spoke Etruscan, offered to explore the forest, pretending to be an Etruscan shepherd. He went as far as Camerinum in Umbria, where the locals offered supplies and soldiers to the Romans. Quintus Fabius crossed the forest and ravaged the area around the Cimian Mountains. This enraged the Etruscans, who gathered the largest army they had ever raised and marched on Sutrium. They advanced to the Roman rampart, but the Romans refused to engage, so they waited there. To encourage his outnumbered soldiers Quintus Fabius told them that he had a secret weapon and hinted that the Etruscans were being betrayed. At dawn the Romans exited their camp and attacked the sleeping Etruscans, who were routed. Some fled to their camp, but most made for the hills and the forest. The Etruscan cities of Perusia and Cortona and Arretium sued for peace and obtained a thirty-year truce.|$|E
