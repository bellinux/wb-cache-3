5|$|A review <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> at The Ritz in New York on January 6, 1989 {{highlights}} the good shape and musicianship of the band, but remarks {{that the new}} songs were played with considerably less enthusiasm {{than the rest of}} the show. Although the band continued to tour regularly, the songs from Imaginos had already disappeared from their shows by the end of 1989, never to be performed live again.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> in {{a losing}} effort, NC State quarterback Erik Kramer {{was named the}} game's offensive most valuable player, while on defense, NC State cornerback Derrick Taylor won the honor. Kramer finished the game having completed 12 of his 19passes for 155yards.

5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about the success <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man {{appeared}} on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who {{appeared to have been}} the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they fail}} to win the competition, a YouTube video <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> gains the band {{popularity}} at school. David Bowie (portraying himself) sees the video and sends an e-mail to Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band {{as one of their}} first artists. Will is so excited and overwhelmed that he falls {{down in the middle of}} the school hallway (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's Lodger album). The last scene takes place during Charlotte's graduation ceremony where Will and Sa5m are confirmed as dating.|$|E
5|$|The career mode {{is broken}} {{up into a}} dozen-some show sets, each set {{consisting}} of about 3-5 songs. The video for each set includes the band's introduction, banter between the band and crowd between songs, and final ovations on conclusion of the show. The player must unlock each set in order as to move forward. Once a set is complete, the player is shown the game's ranking <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> and for each song, based on factors such as percentage of notes hit correctly, the longest streak of properly played consecutive notes, and how long they kept the virtual crowd excited about their performance. The player then unlocks the ability to play the individual songs outside of sets.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter, despite {{changing}} musical trends, Peerson's music {{showed significant}} roots in Renaissance polyphony. However, he was adept {{in the use}} of then-modern compositional procedures; this is evident in his often daring use of chromaticism, especially seen in word painting. Some of his finest music is contained in his set of 15 Latin motets, which was probably composed {{around the turn of the}} century. Existing only in a single copy, it originally consisted of five part-books but the Cantus book is lost. Richard Rastall, professor of historical musicology at the University of Leeds, spent 12 years reconstructing the missing part. The complete Latin motets have been published by Antico Edition, and a recording <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> by Ex Cathedra entitled Peerson: Latin Motets was produced by Hyperion Records in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1955 cricket season, Headley {{was invited}} to become a {{national}} coach, a post created by the Jamaican government, which involved working mainly with young people. Headley and his second son travelled back to Jamaica, {{while the rest of}} the family remained in England. Headley had a heavy workload, particularly in rural areas; together with his assistant Dickie Fuller his role involved encouraging school children to watch and play cricket, and trying to improve standards and facilities throughout the country. Headley became involved in the selection of teams, taking some of them overseas. At this time, he discovered the future West Indian Test player Roy Gilchrist and future Jamaican cricketer Henry Sewell. However, critics in the 1960s complained that there were not enough Jamaicans in the Test side and blamed Headley and Fuller, although the government remained supportive <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>performance.</b> In 1961, Headley coached for six months in Nigeria and earned praise from the Nigerian Cricket Association. His official coaching role in Jamaica ended after a new government withdrew funding for coaching in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop {{before moving to the}} next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>performance</b> {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of this tour, My Chemical Romance dubbed {{themselves}} The Black Parade for the first part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>performance,</b> convincing many concert goers that The Black Parade was initially a separate, opening band. During the tour there were several cancellations and some members left the tour for personal or medical reasons. Leading up to their tour date at The DCU Arena, many of the staff members of the tour fell ill with food poisoning. The band Circa Survive had to replace Muse, members of which also suffered from the same food poisoning. On January 11, 2007 Frank Iero left the tour because of an unspecified illness. He was replaced by Drive By guitarist Todd Price. Mikey Way took time off to get married and spend time with his new wife (Alicia Simmons) and was replaced by guitar tech, Matt Cortez, from April 18, 2007 until October 4, 2007. Six shows were cancelled from April 29, 2007 to May 4, 2007 after the band and crew contracted food poisoning. Bob Bryar suffered injuries relating to his wrists during the tour which led to the cancellation of the show at the University of Maine on October 27, 2007. Bryar left the tour on November 9, 2007 and was replaced by a friend of the band, Wagner, who wished to remain anonymous. Following the November 11, 2007 show in Newcastle, Frank Iero left the tour to return home after learning about a family member's illness. He was replaced by Matt Cortez.|$|E
