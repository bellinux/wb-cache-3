50|$|Gravitational microlensing is {{an astronomical}} {{phenomenon}} {{due to the}} gravitational lens effect. It {{can be used to}} detect <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> range from the mass of a planet to the mass of a star, regardless of the light they emit. Typically, astronomers can only detect bright <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> emit much light (stars) or large <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> block background light (clouds of gas and dust). These objects make up only a minor portion of the mass of a galaxy. Microlensing allows the study of <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> emit little or no light.|$|R

5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass <b>object</b> <b>that</b> {{is neither a}} planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the {{neighborhood}} of other material around its orbit.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of development program formation for territorial community {{based on the}} cluster approach has been offered. The mechanism {{is based on a}} conceptual cluster model of programs. This model includes four clusters: cluster of <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> form the capability of territorial community, cluster of <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> form "overcapability" of the community; cluster of <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> define the focus area of the territorial community; and a cluster of <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> do not meet the overall focus area of local community, but generate some profit. Based on different cluster layout in program, four versions of a mathematical model of the program have been developed...|$|R

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any <b>object</b> <b>that</b> produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 200 {{million light-years}} from Earth with a {{redshift}} of 0.016 is Abell 3627; {{also called the}} Norma Cluster, {{it is one of}} the most massive galaxy clusters known to exist, at ten times the average cluster mass. Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive <b>object</b> <b>that</b> is pulling the Local Group, the Virgo Supercluster, and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive <b>object</b> <b>that</b> {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} CFBDSIR 2149-0403; an independently moving 4-7 Jupiter-mass <b>object</b> <b>that</b> likely forms part of the AB Doradus moving group, less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a spectral class T brown dwarf, Delorme speculates {{that it may be}} a planet.|$|E
5|$|In astrophysical plasmas, Debye {{screening}} prevents electric fields from directly {{affecting the}} plasma over large distances, i.e., {{greater than the}} Debye length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> separates charge over a few tens of Debye lengths. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible <b>object</b> <b>that</b> could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective {{one with an}} albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter.

However, if it turns out upon further investigation that an object named {{as if it were a}} plutoid has not achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, the IAU has stated it will be reclassified, but keep its name.|$|E

5|$|On 12 September, the University of Leicester team {{announced}} that the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution. The positive indicators were that the body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; it had severe scoliosis of the spine possibly making one shoulder higher than the other. An <b>object</b> <b>that</b> {{appeared to be an}} arrowhead was found under the spine and the skull had severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} <b>object</b> <b>that</b> {{rests on a}} {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any <b>object</b> <b>that</b> comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}.

Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.|$|E
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
