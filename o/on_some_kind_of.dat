25|$|Although the {{literary}} sources mention laeti {{only from the}} 4th century onwards, {{it is likely that}} their antecedents existed from as early as the 2nd century: the 3rd-century historian Dio Cassius reports that emperor Marcus Aurelius (ruled 161–180) granted land in the border regions of Germania, Pannonia, Moesia and Dacia, and even in Italy itself, to groups of Marcomanni, Quadi and Iazyges tribespeople captured during the Marcomannic Wars (although Marcus Aurelius later expelled those settled in the peninsula after one group mutinied and briefly seized Ravenna, the base of the Adriatic fleet). These settlers may have been the original laeti. Indeed, there is evidence that the practice of settling communities of barbari inside the Empire stretches {{as far back as the}} founder-emperor Augustus himself (ruled 42 BC - 14 AD): during his time, a number of subgroups of German tribes from the eastern bank of the Rhine were transferred, at their own request, to the Roman-controlled western bank, e.g. the Cugerni, a subgroup of the Sugambri tribe, and the Ubii. In 69, the emperor Otho is reported to have settled communities of Mauri from North Africa in the province of Hispania Baetica (modern Andalusia, Spain). Given the attestation of several auxiliary regiments with the names of these tribes in the 1st and 2nd centuries, it is likely that their admission to the empire was conditional <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> military obligations (Tacitus states that the Ubii were given the task of guarding the West bank of the Rhine) i.e. that they were laeti in all but name.|$|E

500|$|Richard Armitage plays series protagonist John Porter. Porter {{served with}} the SAS until he was {{discharged}} after he spared {{the life of a}} boy who was believed to have subsequently killed two soldiers in his unit following a rescue operation the night before the Iraq invasion. He is brought back into service by Section 20 seven years later. He is married to Diane, and has a daughter, Alexandra. Armitage described Porter as a [...] "damaged hero", and [...] "sort of like Lucas North, only <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> go-faster drug." [...] In order to fit into the role, Armitage had to [...] "bulk up for the role," [...] and performed a lot of training for about ten weeks in the UK, and then flew to Johannesburg the day after filming the eighth series of Spooks wrapped up, where he proceeded with more training. He was trained from [...] "how to hold a gun to how you can run through a door without getting your head blown off." [...] Armitage had not trained as hard as in the past; the intensity of such training almost made him pass out after the first workout, stating [...] "filming Spooks is demanding, but nowhere near as physical as this." [...] Armitage performed most of his own stunts.|$|E
500|$|To {{accommodate}} the video production, {{the equivalent of}} a television studio control room—costing US$3.5million—was built for the tour. Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called CD-i. It used fivebroadcast camera systems, 12Laser Disc players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12directors, 19video crew members, and two separate mix stations to operate. To enable each band member to perform away from their personal monitor speakers on the main stage, sound engineers used joysticks to control a panning matrix for each member's in-ear monitor as they moved around. Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance." [...] This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, [...] "their show depends <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> response to what's happening at the moment in that place. So if it turns out they want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse." [...] The band shot new video for the displays {{over the course of the}} tour.|$|E

500|$|James Cromwell {{was cast}} as Zefram Cochrane, {{the pilot and}} creator of Earth's first warp capable vessel. The {{character}} of Zefram Cochrane had {{first appeared in the}} Original Series episode [...] "", played by Glenn Corbett. Cromwell's Cochrane is much older and has no real resemblance to Corbett, which did not bother the writers. They wanted to portray Cochrane as a character going through a major transition; he starts out as a cynical, selfish drunk who is changed by the characters he meets {{over the course of the}} film. Although the character was written with Cromwell in mind, Tom Hanks, a fan of Star Trek, was approached for the role by Paramount first, but he had already committed to the film That Thing You Do! and had to reject the part. Frakes commented that it would have been a mistake to cast Hanks as Cochrane due to him being so well known. Cromwell had a long previous association with Star Trek, having played characters in The Next Generation episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "", as well as a role in [...] [...] " [...] actually came in and read for the part", Frakes said. [...] "He nailed it." [...] Cromwell described his method of portraying Cochrane as always playing himself. Part of the actor's interest in the film was his involvement in Steven M.

5000|$|Researchers {{uncovered}} mounting {{empirical evidence}} of the idiosyncratic nature of media effects on individuals and audiences, identifying numerous intervening variables, such as demographic attributes, social psychological factors, and different media use behaviors. With these new variables added to research, {{it was difficult to}} isolate media influence that resulted in any media effects to an audience's cognition, attitude and behavior. As Berelson (1959) summed up in a widely quoted conclusion: [...] "Some <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> communication <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> issues have brought to the attention <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> people under <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> conditions have <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> effect." [...] Though the concept of an all-powerful mass media was diluted, this did not determine that the media lacked influence or effect. Instead, the pre-existing structure of social relationships and cultural contexts were believed to primarily shape or change people's opinions, attitudes and behaviors, and media merely function within these established processes. This complexity had a dampening effect upon media effects studies.|$|R
