5|$|The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the endomembrane {{system is}} linked to the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, we {{measured}} the morphometric and histological {{changes in the}} cyprinid loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, during the early period of growth. Eyes, yolk length, yolk height, and yolk volume of the larva decreased for 16 days post hatching (DPH) (P 0. 05), the most anterior extension of the head × the posterior end of the supraoccipital, the most anterior extension of the head × the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the dorsal fin, the most anterior extension of the head × the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the pectoral fin, the posterior end of the supraoccipital × the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the pelvic fin, and the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the dorsal fin × the ventral <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the caudal fin gradually decreased, whereas the most anterior extension of the head × the dorsal <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the caudal fin, the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the dorsal fin × the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the anal fin, the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the dorsal fin × the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the pectoral fin, and the insertion of the dorsal fin × the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the pelvic fin gradually increased (P< 0. 05). In the cyprinid loach, the retina is composed of six layers: the epithelial layer, ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, outer limiting membrane, and rod and cone layer (RCL). After hatching, part of the RCL gradually increased in density. The kidney and midgut epithelium were already formed in the cyprinid loach just after hatching and grew gradually in subsequent days...|$|R
