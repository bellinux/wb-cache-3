5|$|In 1892 Piłsudski {{returned}} from exile {{and settled in}} Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in Šilalė district). In 1893 he joined the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) and helped organize its Lithuanian branch. Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible internationalism he remained a Polish nationalist. In 1894, as its chief editor, he began publishing an underground socialist newspaper, Robotnik (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a typesetter. In 1895 he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|Once a vote occurred, and {{a measure}} passed, {{he could do}} nothing, since his promise to {{physically}} interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the matter was <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance,</b> it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands. If there was no veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E
25|$|The bumpnose {{trevally}} is <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to fisheries {{throughout its}} range, caught using hook and line, bottom trawls, beach seines, and various fish traps.

25|$|The bumpnose trevally, Carangoides hedlandensis (also {{known as}} the bumpnose {{kingfish}} and onion kingfish) is a species of relatively small inshore marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The bumpnose trevally is fairly common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Samoa in the east. It is a small species by carangid standards, reaching a maximum known length of 32cm, and can be distinguished from the similarly shaped Carangoides armatus by a distinct 'bump' on the snout, which gives the fish its common name. The species inhabits coastal waters, often living along bays and beaches, where it takes shrimp, small crabs, and juvenile fish as prey. The bumpnose trevally is <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line, trawls, and seine nets. It is also <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to anglers, taken by baits from beaches and piers, and is considered a modest table fish.|$|E
25|$|Long {{before the}} war was over, privateering could be evaluated, and clearly it was <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b> Only a handful of vessels fell victim, and these were {{balanced}} by losses of the privateers themselves. Two attempts at privateering on the west coast, the J. M. Chapman Plot {{and that of the}} Salvador Pirates resulted in capture and trials for piracy.|$|E
25|$|The longnose {{trevally}} is <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to fisheries {{throughout its}} range, taken by hook and line, bottom trawls, gill nets and {{various types of}} trap. It is usually sold fresh, and is often not distinguished from other species of carangid. The species is occasionally caught by boat anglers, as well as beach fishermen on the South African coast. They take small baits and are considered good for eating.|$|E

50|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, the University of Valence was <b>of</b> only <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b> From 1738 to 1764, its {{transfer}} to Grenoble was contemplated but {{this project was}} abandoned.|$|R
25|$|Although Athens and Attica {{were also}} ethnically Ionian, the Ionic order was <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> in this area. The Temple of Nike Aptera on the Acropolis, a small amphiprostyle temple {{completed}} around 420 BC, with Ionic columns on plinthless Attic bases, a triple-layered architrave and a figural frieze, {{but without the}} typical Ionic dentil, is notable. The east and north halls of the Erechtheion, completed in 406 BC, follow the same succession of elements.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-six of {{the fifty}} broad {{mangrove}} types {{found in the}} world grow well in the Sundarbans. The commonly identifiable vegetation that grow in the dense mangrove forests at the Sundarbans are salt water mixed forest, mangrove scrub, brackish water mixed forest, littoral forest, wet forest and wet alluvial grass forests. The Bangladesh mangrove vegetation of the Sundarbans differs greatly from other non-deltaic coastal mangrove forests and upland forests associations. Unlike the former, the Rhizophoraceae are <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The blacktip {{trevally}} is <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> {{to commercial}} fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line and various netting methods, {{from where it}} is sold fresh, salted or dried at market. The species is considered a good gamefish and can be taken by fish or squid baits as well as various patterns of lure and fly. When taken from the water, the fish often 'grunt' in similar manner to a young pig. They are considered an excellent table fish despite being {{known to be a}} host to parasitic infection in some regions.|$|E
50|$|The blue striped grunt is edible, {{and when}} caught, is marketed fresh. It is only <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> {{commercial}} <b>importance,</b> however. There {{have been reports}} of ciguatera poisoning from consumption of this fish.|$|R
50|$|St. Marks {{is a small}} {{commercial}} seaport, {{which in}} the past was <b>of</b> some <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> in the oil industry; however, it is currently used primarily by commercial fishermen and recreational boaters.

50|$|Devario auropurpureus {{is a small}} {{species of}} danionin fish endemic to Lake Inle in Myanmar. It is a schooling, active, {{plankton}} eater. It is <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> commercial <b>importance</b> as an aquarium pet, usually sold under the older name Inlecypris auropurpurea.|$|R
25|$|Rockwell {{transferred}} {{from high school}} to the Chase Art School at the age of 14. He then went on to the National Academy of Design and finally to the Art Students League. There, he was taught by Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent DuMond; his early works were produced for St. Nicholas Magazine, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) publication Boys' Life, and other youth publications. As a student, Rockwell was given small jobs <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b> His first major breakthrough came at age 18 with his first book illustration for Carl H.

25|$|The cleftbelly {{trevally}} (Atropus atropos) (also {{known as}} the cleftbelly kingfish, Kuweh trevally and thin crevalle) is a species of tropical marine fish of the jack family, Carangidae. The species inhabits coastal waters throughout the Indo-West Pacific region from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan in the east, often found near the water's surface. The cleftbelly trevally is {{the only member of the}} genus Atropus and is distinguished by a number of anatomical characteristics, with a deep median groove in the belly giving the species its common name. It is not a large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 26.5cm. Cleftbelly trevally are predatory fish, taking a variety of small crustaceans and fish. The species is <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to fisheries throughout its range.|$|E
25|$|The bludger is <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to {{fisheries}} {{throughout its}} range, taken by hook and line {{as well as}} gill nets and various types of fish trap. Separate catch statistics are not kept for the species, as it is often not distinguished from other trevallies. The blugder is also of some interest to anglers, although the level of interest differs between countries. In South Africa it is considered a good catch by boat anglers and spearfishermen and is generally regarded as high quality table fare. In Australia it is still considered a good gamefish, but of a lower caliber than related species such as giant and bluefin trevally, and {{is regarded as a}} poor table fish. Its soft, oily flesh is often used for bait when reef fishing. It may be caught using small baits or lures.|$|E

25|$|The {{border between}} the two states became a major irritant, and in November 1997 a border {{committee}} {{was set up to}} try to resolve that specific dispute. After federation and before independence the line of the border had been <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> because it was only a demarcation line between federated provinces and initially the two governments tacitly agreed that the border should remain as it had been immediately before independence. However, on independence the border became an international frontier, and the two governments could not agree on the line that the border should take along its entire length, and they looked back to the colonial period treaties between Italy and Ethiopia for a basis in international law for the precise line of the frontier between the states. Problems then arose because they could not agree on the interpretation of those agreements and treaties, and it was not clear under international law how binding colonial treaties were on the two states.|$|E
25|$|The longfin trevally, Carangoides armatus (also {{known as}} the longfin kingfish, longfin cavalla and armed trevally), is a species of inshore marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is common in {{tropical}} to subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan in the east, typically inhabiting inshore reefs and bays. The species is easily distinguished by its elongate dorsal and anal fin lobes and filamentous dorsal rays, as well as its scaleless breast. Longfin trevally are pelagic predators, taking a variety of small fish, cephalopods and crustaceans, and reach sexual maturity at around 21cm. The species has a maximum known length of 57cm and weight of 3.5kg. The longfin trevally has a very complex taxonomic history which is closely intertwined with another currently valid species, Carangoides ciliarius, which may yet prove to be synonymous. Longfin trevally are <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance</b> to fisheries throughout their range and are considered good table fish, and are occasionally taken by anglers.|$|E
25|$|The {{paper of}} Dr. I.N. Bolotov and colleagues (2013) {{summarizes}} {{data on the}} northern localities of Parnassius mnemosyne, which are mostly situated in the Russian Federation and gives a thorough description of the species' northern range location. It is shown that the northernmost populations in the exist within the karst landscapes {{in the north of}} White Sea-Kuloi Plateau (between 65°35' and 66°03' N) in the downstream of the Soyana and Kuloi rivers and in the north of Timan Highland (66°10' N) along the shore of Kosminskoe Lake (the Pechora River basin). Northern limits of the clouded Apollo's range appear to be strongly determined by the distribution of its larval host plants (primarily Corydalis solida and the role of climate and relief seem to be <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> <b>importance.</b> Many Russian populations inhabit the state nature reserve territories: Kizgi Scerries Reserve (Karelia Republic), Pinega and Soyansky reserves (Arkhangelsk Oblast), Pechoro-Ilychsky and Belaja Kedva reserves (Komi Republic).|$|E
50|$|The {{yellowtail}} trumpeter is <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> commercial <b>importance</b> {{throughout its}} range, caught with handlines, seines, and other inshore fishing gear. It {{is not considered}} particularly good as food, and is considered a nuisance by many recreational fishermen who target bream in local estuaries.|$|R
50|$|A place <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> {{economic}} <b>importance</b> at {{the time}} of the Norman Conquest, a reference to Leigh (Legra) appears in the Domesday Book survey of 1086. Ley is a place-name element found also in the nearby towns and villages of Hadleigh, Rayleigh, Hockley, and Thundersley.|$|R
50|$|The bulk of its diet {{includes}} zooplankton, insects, crustaceans, algae, and detritus. It is <b>of</b> <b>minor</b> commercial <b>importance,</b> {{primarily in}} China, {{where it is}} canned. In Hong Kong, it is not favored as a table fish because the flesh is unpalatable and very bony.|$|R
