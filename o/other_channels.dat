5|$|Bow Back Rivers or Stratford Back Rivers is {{a complex}} of {{waterways}} between Bow and Stratford in east London, England, which connect the River Lea to the River Thames. Starting in the twelfth century, works were carried out to drain Stratford Marshes {{and several of the}} waterways were constructed to power watermills. Bow Creek provided the final outfall to the Thames, and the <b>other</b> <b>channels</b> were called Abbey Creek, Channelsea River, City Mill River, Prescott Channel, Pudding Mill River, Saint Thomas Creek, Three Mills Back River, Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River.|$|E
5|$|Cross Game {{was adapted}} as an anime {{television}} series produced by SynergySP {{and directed by}} Osamu Sekita, with character designs by Yuuji Kondō and music by Kotaro Nakagawa. The series aired on the TV Tokyo network beginning on April 5, 2009 in the 10:00–10:30am slot; episodes began syndication later in April 2009 on AT-X and <b>other</b> <b>channels</b> in Japan, and finished airing on March 28, 2010. The first DVD volume of episodes was released in Japan on July 24, 2009, with additional DVDs released monthly.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but <b>other</b> <b>channels</b> can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers or <b>other</b> <b>channels,</b> {{which form}} as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the first}} network run, which {{achieved}} average viewing figures of more than six million, the BBC has repeated the series six times: between 1992 and 1993 (Series One only), 1994 and 1995 (nine episodes only), and 2000 and 2001 (in remastered form), as well as in 2003, 2005 and 2006. <b>Other</b> <b>channels</b> that have shown repeats include UK Gold (1994–95), Bravo (1996–97), Cartoon Network (2001–02), Boomerang (2001–03) and Syfy (2009). In Scotland, the BBC screened a Gaelic dub, Tairnearan Tar As ("Thunderbirds Are Go") in the early 1990s.|$|E

As of 2012 there are 10 nationwide and 21 regional DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting – Terrestrial) television channels, and more than 30 <b>other</b> <b>channels</b> either produced in the Republic of Croatia or produced for the Croatian market and broadcast via IPTV (Internet Protocol television), cable or satellite television. The electronic communications market in Croatia is regulated by the Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM), which issues broadcast licenses and monitors the market.

5|$|The {{producers}} of Benefits Street defended the series, {{arguing that the}} reaction to it demonstrated the importance of making such a documentary. The series was mentioned in the House of Commons, and prompted some political debate {{on the topic of}} welfare. A number of programmes were commissioned by <b>other</b> <b>channels</b> covering the same topic, while Channel 4 commissioned a follow up series provisionally titled Immigration Street that would follow the lives of immigrants living in the United Kingdom. Benefits Street gave Channel 4 their highest viewing figures for any show since 2012. In August 2014, Love Productions confirmed the second series of Benefits Street was being filmed in Kingston Road, Stockton-on-Tees, England, United Kingdom. Series two aired from 11 May 2015 for four episodes.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} Prison Break—a man deliberately getting himself {{sent to prison}} {{in order to help}} someone escape—was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring {{thought it was a good}} idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to <b>other</b> <b>channels</b> but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series. Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds. Thus, the miniseries never materialized. Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24, Fox decided to back the production in 2004. The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script.|$|E
