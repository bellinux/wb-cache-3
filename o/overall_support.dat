25|$|Indeed, the 2009-2011 period {{marked a}} u-turn in the rather pacifist {{military}} policy of Germany and also represented a crucial test for allied cooperation. The {{intensity of the}} fighting sparked a public debate in Germany whether German troops should even participate in a war. The only considerable support for the troops appeared {{in the form of}} a 2008 petition to restore a military award entirely reserved for valor; 22 soldiers were awarded with this Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. However, <b>overall</b> <b>support</b> for the military operation plunged down to an all-time low following the deadly September 2009 air strike, prompting observers to believe that ongoing combat operations would affect the general elections in 2009 and 2013 respectively (the only party to explicitly speak out against the war, Die Linke, failed to make noteworthy gains in these elections, though). Others regarded the unexpected move as a reaction to sharp criticism Germany long faced for opting out a more offensive role in the Afghanistan war.|$|E

The party managed to draw supporters from the mainstream right, including some high-profile defectors from the RPR, UDF, and National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP). In the 1984 European elections, eleven of the 81 FN candidates came from these parties, and the party's list also included an Arab and a Jew (although in unwinnable positions). Former collaborators were also accepted in the party, as Le Pen urged the need for [...] "reconciliation", arguing that forty {{years after the war}} the only important question was whether or not [...] "they wish to serve their country".

2500|$|The All-Ukrainian Sovnarkom's decree [...] "On {{implementation}} of the Ukrainization of the educational and cultural institutions" [...] (July 27, 1923) {{is considered to be}} the onset of the Ukrainization program. The (August 1) decree that followed shortly [...] "On {{implementation of}} the equal rights of the languages and facilitation of the Ukrainian language" [...] mandated the implementation of Ukrainian language to all levels of state institutions. Initially, the program was met with resistance by some Ukrainian Communists, largely because non-Ukrainians prevailed numerically in the party at the time. The resistance was finally overcome in 1925 through changes in the party leadership under the pressure of Ukrainian representatives in the party. In April 1925 the party Central Committee adopted the resolution on Ukrainization proclaiming its aim as [...] "solidifying the union of the peasantry with the working class" [...] and boosting the <b>overall</b> <b>support</b> of the Soviet system among Ukrainians. A joint resolution aimed at [...] "complete Ukrainization of the Soviet apparatus" [...] as well as the party and trade unions was adopted on April 30, 1925. The Ukrainian Commissariat of Education (Narkomis) was charged with overseeing the {{implementation of the}} Ukrainization policies.
