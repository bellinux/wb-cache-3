5|$|Bede's scriptural commentaries {{employed}} the allegorical method <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> and his history includes accounts of miracles, which to modern historians has seemed {{at odds with}} his critical approach to the materials in his history. Modern studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world-view of Early Medieval scholars.|$|E
5|$|The Stalinist {{occupation}} of Eastern Europe {{was the issue}} of prime concern, and it raised many problems <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> At first, the International held that, while the USSR was a degenerated workers' state, the post-World War II East European states were still bourgeois entities, because revolution from above was not possible, and capitalism persisted.|$|E
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} {{that the reason for}} the diversity <b>of</b> <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> quantum mechanics is that they are not connected by continuity relations with classical physics, and also the reason is the impossibility of operationalist definition of the vector of state. The problem lies in the incompatibility of the philosophical foundations <b>of</b> <b>interpretations,</b> which results in the difficulty of building a unified picture of the world. To solve the problem, we identify general philosophical foundation <b>of</b> <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> quantum mechanics and built their classification. We also show that in more general theories, the part of which is quantum mechanics, it is possible to integrate (reconcile) the philosophical foundations <b>of</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 2 tabl...|$|R

5|$|The {{view has}} been taken that judges may assign meaning to vague {{constitutional}} provisions or statutes {{on the basis of}} their own ideological preferences, hence disregarding Parliament's intention.

5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language.

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and {{on the degree of}} importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The exact date of {{transition}} {{can be a}} matter <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC, Caesar's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC, and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. However, most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves, the Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC, as the defining event ending the Republic.|$|E

5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard's role in all this appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of My Work as an Author.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{central theme}} {{involves}} {{the examination of}} the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49.|$|E
5|$|This {{can be used}} {{to derive}} the {{correlation}} of the quantum polarisations of the two photons. Their prediction was confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov in 1950. This was the first experimental confirmation of a pair of entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. The result was subsequently explained by Richard Dalitz and Frank Duarte. Apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was never bothered by issues <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> in quantum mechanics.|$|E

50|$|Gracia {{has written}} a {{philosophical}} understanding of the conditions that must be satisfied by the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> texts which are regarded as revealed by religious communities.

Gracia has also written on religious skepticism in Latin America.|$|R
5|$|In the {{canonical}} I Ching, the hexagrams {{are arranged in}} an order dubbed the King Wen sequence after King Wen of Zhou, who founded the Zhou dynasty and supposedly reformed the method <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> The sequence generally pairs hexagrams with their upside-down equivalents, although in eight cases hexagrams are paired with their inversion. Another order, found at Mawangdui in 1973, arranges the hexagrams into eight groups sharing the same upper trigram. But the oldest known manuscript, found in 1987 and now held by the Shanghai Library, was almost certainly arranged in the King Wen sequence, and it has even been proposed that a pottery paddle from the Western Zhou period contains four hexagrams in the King Wen sequence. Whichever of these arrangements is older, it is not evident that {{the order of the}} hexagrams was of interest to the original authors of the Zhou yi. The assignment of numbers, binary or decimal, to specific hexagrams is a modern invention.|$|E
5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E
5|$|Latin American {{novels that}} explore {{political}} themes, but {{that do not}} centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”. For example, Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cortázar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> In the Time of the Butterflies (1994), by Julia Álvarez, {{tells the story of}} the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo régime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of El imperio de los sueños 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “United States of Banana” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States of Banana, who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of Distant Star (1996), by Roberto Bolaño, begins on 11 September 1973, with the coup d’état by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be read as a meditation on the horror of absolute power”.|$|E

5|$|The first {{remarkable}} historiographical school <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> of {{the history}} of Argentina was founded by members of the 1837 generation, including Bartolomé Mitre. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism: a conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and an attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to the charismatic authority of the caudillos. These authors' views were treated as canonical {{until the end of the}} 19thcentury, when the proximity of the centennial encouraged authors to seek new perspectives. The newer authors would differ about the relative weight of the causes of the May Revolution and about whose intervention in the events was more decisive, but the main views expressed by Mitre were kept, such as to consider the revolution to be the birth of modern Argentina and an unavoidable event. These authors introduced the idea of popular intervention as another key element. By the time of the World Wars, liberal authors attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective; Ricardo Levene and the Academia Nacional de la Historia were exponents of this tendency, which still kept most perspectives of Mitre. Left-wing authors took a revisionist view based on nationalism and anti-imperialism; they minimized the dispute between criollos and peninsulars and portrayed events as a dispute between enlightenment and absolutism. However, most of their work was focused on other historical periods.|$|E
