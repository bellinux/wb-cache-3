5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip,</b> while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Mark {{goes to the}} Bahamas on a {{supposed}} business trip, Kate decides to follow him there and expose him. She finds Carly and Amber at the airport, who explain that Mark has been using Kate {{as the owner of}} the companies he defrauded from, which would—were his fraud to be discovered—result in her going to prison. Kate also finds out that Mark has been seeing yet another woman: someone he has met <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip.</b> This, and the possibility of him facing prison, motivates her to take action with the help of Carly's legal expertise.|$|E
5|$|When Archbishop Eadsige of Canterbury died in October 1050, {{the post}} {{remained}} vacant for five months. The cathedral chapter elected Æthelric, a kinsman of Godwin and a monk at Canterbury, but were over-ruled when Edward appointed Robert Archbishop of Canterbury the following year. Godwin {{was attempting to}} exercise his power of patronage over the archbishopric, but the king's appointment signalled that the king was willing to contest with the earl over the traditional royal rights at Canterbury. Although the monks of Canterbury opposed it, the king's appointment stood. Robert went to Rome to receive his pallium and returned to England where he was ceremonially enthroned at Canterbury on 29 June 1051. Some Norman chroniclers state that he visited Normandy <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip</b> and informed Duke William, the future William the Conqueror, {{that he was the}} childless King Edward's heir. According to these chroniclers, the decision to make William the heir had been decided at the same lenten royal council in 1051 that had declared Robert archbishop.|$|E

50|$|<b>On</b> <b>this</b> last <b>trip,</b> {{he visited}} serval cave {{formations}} near Mumbannar, Victoria.

5|$|While {{she tried}} to involve herself {{in the arts and}} {{sciences}} and distance herself from society protocols, she continued to feel the burden of her duties. Christmas 1877 provided respite for Alice, as all the family gathered together again, and she doted on her youngest daughters Alix and Marie. She was too exhausted to attend the wedding of her niece, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, in Berlin, in January 1878. In the Autumn of 1878, Queen Victoria paid for the Grand Ducal family to holiday in Eastbourne, where they stayed in a house on the Grand Parade. Alice performed various royal duties <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip</b> and visited her mother at Osborne before returning to the New Palace at Darmstadt in late 1878.|$|E
5|$|While {{the north}} and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the {{mountain}} were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and ice cascades. To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, C. E. Rusk searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip</b> that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily crevassed eastern side of the summit ice cap. One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was “thrilling to the point of extreme danger.” Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the Mazamas finally climbed the west face of Adams. This route is straightforward, but made difficult by icefalls, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.|$|E

25|$|Although Lewis and Clark had {{travelled}} {{this way}} previously, {{many of their}} specimens had been lost.

In London he spent time organising his large plant collection and discussing his experiences with other scientists.|$|E

25|$|In 1867, a local {{newspaper}} funded his trip to the Mediterranean aboard the Quaker City, including a tour of Europe and the Middle East.

25|$|In 1870 Julius Vogel {{included}} a Wellington-Wairarapa railway in his Great Public Works policy and visited London {{to arrange a}} loan to finance the policy. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip</b> he was approached by several contracting firms and a contract that included {{the first section of}} the Wairarapa Line was awarded to Brogden & Sons.

25|$|In 1908 {{he went to}} Bombay, {{hoping to}} board a ship to visit Palestine but was refused a permit, and {{had to return to}} the north. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip</b> he {{recognised}} a basic dilemma of the Christian mission to India. A brahmin had collapsed in a hot, crowded railway carriage and was offered water by the Anglo-Indian stationmaster. The brahmin could accept it in only his own drinking vessel. Sundar Singh realised that India would not readily convert to Western-style Christianity, although people had responded to his sadhu's robe.|$|E

25|$|Rusk {{began his}} {{mountaineering}} {{career in the}} summer following the completion of his first year of teaching school. He and his uncle W. A. Maxwell ascended Mount Adams via the South Climb. The next year, 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of Adams. This was the first recorded circuit by white women and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip,</b> he named Avalanche Valley and Rusk Glacier; however, the Rusk Glacier name was not official until 1901 when Rusk assisted Harry Fielding Reid in mapping Adams.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} reached New York City by {{ship and}} went to Cincinnati where Mohr worked {{for a while in}} a German chemical company. On 3 March 1849, hit with gold fever, he set out with a group of 50 men for the gold mines of California, where they searched for gold on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada (US) in the Yuba Valley. The strenuous work of a gold miner and the continuous standing in cold water worsened his health. So, in December 1850, he traveled back to Cincinnati. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip,</b> he met Duke Paul Wilhelm of Württemberg, who was returning from an expedition.|$|E

25|$|Stalin's native Caucasus posed a {{particular}} problem due to its highly multi-cultural mix. Stalin opposed the idea of separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani autonomous republics, arguing that these would likely oppress the many minorities within their territory; instead he called {{for the formation of}} a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea, resulting in the Georgian Affair. In the summer of 1921, he returned to the southern Caucasus, there calling on Georgian Communists to avoid the chauvinistic Georgian nationalism which he believed marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip,</b> Stalin met with his son Yakov, and brought him back to Moscow with them; Nadya had given birth to another of Stalin's sons, Vasily, in March 1921.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, {{after leaving}} Dunedin, Anscombe {{embarked}} on a longer world trip accompanied by his two daughters now aged 29 and 17 years.

The Dominion reports the group's recent return in April 1929. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip,</b> Anscombe seemed particularly interested in architecture, city and street planning, {{and the use of}} lighting at night time.
