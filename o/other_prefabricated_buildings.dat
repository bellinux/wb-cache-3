5000|$|The Allied Works Council, {{the builder}} {{of this and}} <b>other</b> wartime <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings,</b> was formed in February 1942 to {{co-ordinate}} and facilitate {{the needs of the}} Australian and US military forces in Australia during the war. The work carried out by the Allied Works Council included roads, camps, hospitals, ammunition depots, aerodromes, mess and recreation facilities, and gun emplacements. The Allied Works Council is significant because so much of their construction work transformed Australia, leaving a post-war legacy of roads and buildings still in use for peaceful pursuits.The Defence Canteen igloo was purchased by the Atherton Tableland Agricultural Society for a very low price after the war. When the Atherton Shire Hall, built in 1898, was destroyed by fire in 1948, the war-time igloo became a Community Centre. A committee was formed to manage the hall and they set about building a dance floor measuring 5,000 square feet with a further 2,000 square feet of galleries for seating. The £4,000 needed for this work was put up by the Atherton Shire Council, and money raised by the Atherton Choral Society and the Atherton Players. Both these groups put all their spare funds into improving the facilities, later adding chairs, stage lighting and dressing rooms. A contest was held to name the new Community Centre hall and Miss Eileen Burke won with the name [...] "Merriland". In July 1951, the committee gave a Grand Ball to celebrate the opening with over 1,200 people in attendance. Merriland Hall went on to host most of the social and cultural occasions of Atherton for many years.|$|R

40|$|Most of {{industrial}} <b>buildings</b> are <b>prefabricated</b> structures and built on high seismic risk zones. <b>Prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> must be earthquake resistant {{which can be}} possible if structural elements and their connections are properly built. In recent years, <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> which have no RC walls were damaged heavily during earthquakes. In this paper, prefabricated industrial structures, damaged during Ceyhan (1998), Kocaeli (1999) and Düzce (1999) earthquakes, and reasons of structural damages are studied. Additionally design and construction precautions are given for building an earthquake resistant prefabricated structure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> {{systems are}} once again gaining popularity. The new {{prefabricated}} paradigm offers the integration of several approaches previously ignored: automated manufacturing, integrated building services and environmental sustainable principles. Consistency, predictable environmental control, modular flexibility, quick assembly and affordability are promising features of modern manufactured construction. Though the concept of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> is not new, this type of construction {{may be the only}} hope in obtaining a truely sustainable architecture for our future. This paper attempts to define and evaluate several <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> systems, ranging from a ‘kit-of-parts’ to fully assembled ‘volumetric’ modules. It aims to categorise various manufactured types among a vast amount of information, and to observe their attributes regarding materials, flexibility, structural integrity, delivery and constructability. This paper suggests that pre-fabricated architecture can deliver high order design and diversity within the framework of waste reduction, renewable systems integration and optimal performance. <br /...|$|R
