5|$|Jibneh Arabieh or jibneh baida is a {{white table}} cheese served {{with any of the}} above dishes. Ackawi cheese is a common {{variation}} of jibneh baida. Ackawi cheese has a smoother texture and a mild salty taste. Labaneh is a pasty yogurt-like cream cheese either served <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> with olive oil and za'atar—which is generally called labaneh wa za'atar—or in a khubz sandwich.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Callot, his {{declared}} aim, {{in which}} he largely succeeded, was to make etchings look like engravings, to which end he sacrificed willingly {{the freedom of the}} etched line, whilst certainly exploiting to the full the speed of the technique. Like most etchers, he frequently used engraving <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> in addition to etching, but produced no pure engravings.|$|E

50|$|In {{some states}} and provinces, {{optional}} plates {{can also be}} vanity <b>plates</b> and are <b>a</b> choice of motorists who want a more distinctive personalized plate. However, {{the maximum number of}} characters <b>on</b> <b>an</b> optional <b>plate</b> may be lower than <b>on</b> <b>a</b> standard-issue <b>plate.</b> For example, the U.S. state of Virginia allows up to 7.5 characters (a space or hyphen is counted as 0.5 character) <b>on</b> <b>a</b> standard-issue <b>plate,</b> but only up to 6 characters on many of its optional plates. In some states, a motorist may also check the availability of a desired combination online.|$|R
25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 plasmid was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, the cells were grown <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E
25|$|Salvador Dalí painted several {{pictures}} involving Hitler. The Enigma of Hitler (1939) {{depicts a}} torn photograph of Hitler <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> in a typically surreal landscape over which hangs a broken telephone and an umbrella. He also painted the Metamorphosis of the Face of Hitler into a Moonlit Landscape (1958). One of his late works was Hitler Masturbating (1973), depicting just that, with Hitler seen from behind in an armchair {{in the center}} of a snow-filled desolate landscape.|$|E
25|$|While {{searching for}} a {{companion}} to the large-proper-motion star Lalande 1299, in 1917 Dutch–American astronomer Adriaan van Maanen discovered a star with an even larger proper motion located a few arcminutes to the northeast. He estimated the annual proper motion of the latter as 3arcseconds. This star had been previously recorded <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> taken November 11, 1896 for the Carte du Ciel Catalog of Toulouse, and it showed an apparent magnitude of 12.3. The initial spectral classification was type F0.|$|E

25|$|As Professor of Vocal Physiology at Boston University, Bell {{was engaged}} in {{training}} teachers {{in the art of}} instructing deaf mutes how to speak and experimented with the Leon Scott phonautograph in recording the vibrations of speech. This apparatus consists essentially of a thin membrane vibrated by the voice and carrying a light-weight stylus, which traces an undulatory line <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of smoked glass. The line is a graphic representation of the vibrations of the membrane and the waves of sound in the air.|$|E
25|$|Three {{embassies}} {{were sent}} by Charlemagne to Harun al-Rashid's {{court and the}} latter sent at least two embassies to the Charlemagne. Harun al-Rashid {{is reported to have}} sent numerous presents to Charlemagne, such as aromatics, fabrics, a clock, a chessboard, and an elephant named Abu 'Abbas. The automatic clock was a water-clock made of brass, described in the 807 Royal Frankish Annals. It marked the 12 hours with balls of brass falling <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> every hour, and also had twelve horsemen who appeared in turn at each hour.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of a mass}} {{emigration}} of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti {{became a}} popular take-out dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken curry, potatoes, a boiled egg and various vegetables, most notably the kousenband or yardlong bean. Another variation includes shrimp and aubergine. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg and yardlong beans are served side by side <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate,</b> with the aloo puri folded in fours on top. One then has the option to spice the dish with a very hot chutney made of Madame Jeanette peppers.|$|E
50|$|Many methods {{worked to}} an extent; they allowed the plate {{to be exposed}} hours, or even days, after coating.

25|$|The East Gallery {{houses a}} much-expanded {{selection}} of life sciences exhibits. Many exhibits relate {{directly to the}} immediate local environment, such as the Glass Settling Plate (barnacles and other creatures are grown <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> in the Bay, then put live under a mobile microscope to be observed from both above and below) and the Algae Chandelier (visitors can pump air to nourish overhead tanks of colorful phytoplankton). Other exhibits explore different biological systems and processes, such as the imaging station with mouse stem cells, the live cow’s eye dissections, and the Live Chicken Embryo (one of {{the oldest of the}} Living Systems exhibits, showing live chicken embryos at different stages of development).|$|E
25|$|Millais {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{respected}} of British ornithologists and bird artists, producing between 1890 and 1914 a series of books on birds and other natural history subjects. In the study of ornithology he was renowned for his portraiture of wildfowl and game birds, the subjects of his three most famous works: Natural History of British Feeding Ducks; British Diving Ducks and British Game Birds. They rank amongst the finest work on wildfowl ever published. Each bird receives individual treatment in text and detailed chromolithographs, some of which are by his friend and pre-eminent bird artist of the day Archibald Thorburn (1860–1935). Each species is represented by two or three individuals <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> drawn in attitudes of feeding, resting and courtship.|$|E

25|$|An {{original}} and indigenous rival {{to the big}} two U.S. giants was the quintessentially British fast-food chain Wimpy, originally known as Wimpy Bar (opened 1954 at the Lyon's Corner House in Coventry Street London), which served its hamburgers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> with British-style chips, accompanied by cutlery and delivered to the customer's table. In the late 1970s, to compete with McDonald's, Wimpy began to open American-style counter-service restaurants and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re-branded as Burger Kings between 1989 and 1990 by the then-owner of both brands, Grand Metropolitan. A management buyout in 1990 split the brands again and now Wimpy table-service restaurants can still be found in many town centres whilst new counter-service Wimpys are now often found at motorway service stations.|$|E
25|$|Although many kiosks {{have been}} fitted with {{replacement}} backs over recent years, unmodified examples generally have the identity of their manufacturer marked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> on the outside {{at the bottom of}} their back panel. The only exceptions are the few Mk1 models made by Bratt Colbran, which are anonymous. A supplementary way of identifying the manufacturer is by means of casting marks on the various component parts – i.e. LF, CC, MF, MS and BC – which were used to various extents over the years. A more consistent manufacturer mark can be found at about shoulder height on the inner face of the back panel. These marks generally identify both the manufacturer and the precise model of kiosk. Up to around 1949, the year of manufacture is also included. The more recently erected non-BT K6 kiosks (generally painted black) are for the most part new castings, sourced from new manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{temporal}} probabilistic models such as {{the hidden}} Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model {{the correlations between the}} activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which take into account the rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data. The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate.</b> Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.|$|E

500|$|The Medallic Art Company of New York {{converted}} Borglum's {{models to}} coinage dies. The first 1,000 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars were struck on a medal press at the Philadelphia Mint on January 21, 1925, the 101st anniversary of General Jackson's birth; Borglum and {{officials of the}} Association were present. [...] The first piece struck was mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> made of gold mined in Georgia for presentation to President Coolidge. The second was mounted on a silver plaque, and presented to Secretary Mellon. The remainder of the first thousand were placed in numbered envelopes; some were presented to officials or {{those involved in the}} Stone Mountain project. Between January and March 1925, that mint struck 2,310,000 of the authorized mintage of 5,000,000, plus 4,709 pieces reserved for inspection by the 1926 Assay Commission. Except for the first thousand, for which Randolph paid in gold, the pieces were sent to the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, which advanced the funds to purchase them from the government.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{portrait}} of Sigmund Freud in close-up, then shows a picture of Farmer's mother. The song's lyrics are subtitled. Still images of Farmer are then shown in silhouette wearing a white and transparent nightgown. With each line of the song, an image of Farmer appears. When the chorus begins, Farmer turns blue and begins to dance {{in front of a}} backdrop featuring stars and the moon. Three children are shown looking at Farmer. After another verse, which again features still images of Farmer, shots of the singer jumping are intercut with shots of her singing along with the track with her arms clutched to her breast. Afterwards Farmer and the three children are shown holding placards with the words [...] "Maman a tort". Following another verse the singer's decapitated head is pictured <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> on a table in front of the children who are holding knives and forks. The singer is again shown in blue and cries before being slapped in the face. A low-angle shot of Farmer shows her readjusting the strap of her nightgown and is intercut with images of her in silhouette. The video ends with a portrait of Freud.|$|E
