5|$|A {{study in}} 2004 by Melanie Metzger and Susan Mather found that Black male signers used {{constructed}} action, {{with or without}} constructed dialogue, more <b>often</b> <b>than</b> White signers, but never used constructed dialogue by itself. These results were not reproduced in a later study into constructed action and constructed dialogue by McCaskill, which found that Black signers not only used constructed dialogue, but did so more frequently than white signers.|$|E
5|$|All-electric and plug-in hybrid {{vehicles}} {{also have}} lower maintenance costs {{as compared to}} internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems break down much less <b>often</b> <b>than</b> the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems on board last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. PEVs do not require oil changes and other routine maintenance checks.|$|E

5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more <b>often</b> <b>than</b> the rest of the population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more <b>often</b> <b>than</b> those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury {{on the part of the}} uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tellurium}} {{is found}} with gold more <b>often</b> <b>than</b> in uncombined form, {{it is found}} even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. Fish and crustaceans {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more <b>often</b> <b>than</b> they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E

5|$|Burnett Hillman Streeter {{proposed}} Caesarea or Beirut {{for three}} reasons: it contains, after the New Testament, the two Epistles of Clement; it represents an eclectic {{text in the}} New Testament, Antiochian in the Gospels and Alexandrian in the Acts and Epistles, it suggests some place where the influence of Antioch and of Alexandria met; {{the text of the}} Old Testament appears to be a non-Alexandrian text heavily revised by the Hexapla, the Old Testament quotations in New Testament more <b>often</b> <b>than</b> not agree with Alexandrinus against Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large {{that they can be}} mistaken for a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more <b>often</b> <b>than</b> they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{a physics}} {{professor}} at the University of Central Florida wrote a paper arguing that it is mathematically impossible for vampires to exist, based on geometric progression. According to the paper, if the first vampire had appeared on 1 January 1600, and it fed once a month (which is less <b>often</b> <b>than</b> what is depicted in films and folklore), and every victim turned into a vampire, then within {{two and a half}} years the entire human population of the time would have become vampires.|$|E

In a UK series of 37 patients, 10 (27%) developed advanced kidney disease.

About 20% of children that exhibit nephrotic or nephritic features experience long permanent renal impairment.|$|E
