5|$|By {{the end of}} January, Pole {{had dropped}} to twenty-one votes, but the French faction {{remained}} split between Carafa, de Bourbon, Lorraine, and Salviati; Este's candidacy, though desired {{by many in the}} French College, had not yet been put forward, perhaps having been held back in hopes that he would be more acceptable as the conclave dragged <b>on.</b> <b>Toward</b> the end of January, in accordance with traditional efforts to counter dillatory cardinals, the amenities and rations of the conclave were decreased and the upper story windows were closed to reduce the natural lighting and fresh air. Soon afterwards, Ridolfithe French candidate most acceptable to Farnesedied amid accusations of poisoning on January 31.|$|E
5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he {{gathered}} together {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to intercept the attackers. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, his force {{caught sight of the}} raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within sight of the pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp.|$|E
5|$|The Mud Bay force {{travelled}} in Arunta {{and came}} ashore at 23:00 in the Maclaren King, {{two of the}} ship's launches, the three Japanese landing craft and the two powered whaleboats. A base was established at Mud Bay, where a dressing station was prepared and heavy equipment, including all but one 2-inch mortar per company, was cached. The Australians then {{set out on a}} gruelling march to Kilia, guided by Papuan policemen. As they moved off, a violent thunderstorm broke, and it started to rain heavily. The force pushed <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> Kilia, but made slow progress that night due to the steep terrain and heavy rain. They were still half a mile from Kilia at 08:30 on 23 October, when they encountered the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|The {{companies}} under Pitcairn's command got {{beyond their}} officers' control {{in part because}} they were unaware of the actual purpose of the day's mission. They fired in different directions and prepared to enter private homes. Colonel Smith, who was just arriving with the remainder of the regulars, heard the musket fire and rode forward from the grenadier column to see the action. He quickly found a drummer and ordered him to beat assembly. The grenadiers arrived shortly thereafter, and once order was restored among the soldiers, the light infantry were permitted to fire a victory volley, after which the column was reformed and marched <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> Concord.|$|E
5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> the northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost {{parallel to the}} Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, {{proving to be a}} great scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving his wife and son gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour {{to pack up and}} leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} context effects of TV {{programme}} embedded interactivity <b>on</b> the attitude <b>toward</b> an advertisement placed within the interactive programme. In the 2 (two way communication) x 3 (user control) experimental study, 246 respondents participated. The {{results show that}} the impact of actual interactivity <b>on</b> attitude <b>toward</b> the advertisement is mediated by perceived interactivity. Subsequently, telepresence (the feeling of being present in the mediated environment) has a crucial mediating role to explain the context effect of perceived interactivity <b>on</b> attitude <b>toward</b> the advertisement. With regard to the underlying mechanism, the results show that telepresence is positively correlated with the amount of positive programme thoughts. In addition, the positive programme thoughts have a positive effect <b>on</b> the attitude <b>toward</b> the ad, above and beyond the effect of positive thoughts about the advertisement...|$|R

25|$|The German plan {{of advance}} {{included}} Rollbahn A {{passing through a}} crossroad {{in the center of}} Rocherath and Rollbahn B skirting the southern edge of Krinkelt and continuing <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> Wirtzfeld. The Germens' first objective was to break through the defending line of the inexperienced U.S. 99th Infantry Division and positions of battle-hardened 2nd Infantry Division. Once they cleared the Americans from the twin villages, they needed to seize Elsenborn Ridge so they could control the roads to the south and west and ensure supply to the German troops.|$|E

The children surged down the stairs and those at the front were trapped and crushed by the weight of the crowd behind them.|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} the {{previous}} operations meant that both armies still had large detachments out towards Königsberg. The emperor spent the afternoon in forming up the newly arrived masses, the deployment being covered by an artillery bombardment. At 5 o'clock all was ready, and Ney, preceded by a heavy artillery fire, rapidly carried the Sortlack Wood. The attack was pushed <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> the Alle. Marshal Ney's right-hand division under Marchand drove part of the Russian left into the river at Sortlack, while the division of Bisson advanced on the left. A furious charge by Russian cavalry into the gap between Marchand and Bisson was repulsed by the dragoon division of Latour-Maubourg.|$|E
25|$|The {{splitting}} of Army Group South {{enabled the}} launching of Operation Edelweiss and Operation Fischreiher, the two main thrusts of the Army Groups. Both groups had to achieve their objectives simultaneously, instead of consecutively. The success of the initial advance was such that Hitler ordered the Fourth Panzer Army south to assist the First Panzer Army to cross the lower Don river. This assistance was not needed and Kleist later complained that Fourth Panzer Army clogged the roads and {{that if they had}} carried <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> Stalingrad, they could have taken it in July. When it turned north again two weeks later, the Soviets had gathered enough forces together at Stalingrad to check its advance.|$|E
