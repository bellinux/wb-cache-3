5|$|In February 313, Constantine {{met with}} Licinius in Milan, where they {{developed}} the Edict <b>of</b> <b>Milan.</b> The edict stated that Christians {{should be allowed}} to follow the faith without oppression. This removed penalties for professing Christianity, under which many had been martyred previously, and returned confiscated Church property. The edict protected from religious persecution not only Christians but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose. A similar edict had been issued in 311 by Galerius, then senior emperor of the Tetrarchy; Galerius' edict granted Christians the right to practise their religion but did not restore any property to them. The Edict <b>of</b> <b>Milan</b> included several clauses which stated that all confiscated churches would be returned as well as other provisions for previously persecuted Christians.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Habsburgs had been {{involved}} in a major power struggle with the French kings of the House of Valois over the control of the remains of the realm of Charles the Bold, whose daughter and heiress Mary Maximilian had married. Maximilian's second marriage in 1493 with Bianca Maria Sforza from Milan then got the Habsburgs directly involved in the Italian Wars, clashing again with the French kings over the control of the Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Milan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cardinals who {{simultaneously}} {{were also}} bishops usually {{appear in the}} documents with both titles: cardinalitial and episcopal. The only exceptions are archbishop Uberto Crivelli <b>of</b> <b>Milan,</b> who subscribed papal bulls only as cardinal, and Ruggiero of Benevento, who generally was styled only as archbishop, while his cardinalate was mentioned very infrequently.|$|E

In theatres such as Iraq and Afghanistan, man-portable missile were often used against strongpoints and improvised armour within populated areas. Reducing collateral damage to nearby civilians became a major political factor in such campaigns.|$|R

5|$|In 1482, Leonardo, who {{according}} to Vasari was a talented musician, created a silver lyre {{in the shape}} of a horse's head. Lorenzo de' Medici sent Leonardo to Milan, bearing the lyre as a gift, to secure peace with Ludovico Sforza, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Milan.</b> At this time Leonardo wrote an often-quoted letter describing the many marvellous and diverse things that he could achieve in the field of engineering and informing Ludovico that he could also paint.|$|E
5|$|In 1506 Leonardo {{returned}} to Milan. Many {{of his most}} prominent pupils or followers in painting either knew or worked with him in Milan, including Bernardino Luini, Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio and Marco d'Oggiono. At this time he may have commenced a project for an equestrian figure of Charles II d'Amboise, the acting French governor <b>of</b> <b>Milan.</b> A wax model survives and, if genuine, is the only extant example of Leonardo's sculpture.|$|E

5|$|A search began for a {{suitable}} Serb {{to lead a}} collaborationist regime. From {{the date of the}} Yugoslav capitulation, pro-German politicians, including the president of the fascist Zbor movement, Dimitrije Ljotić, former Belgrade police chief and Minister of the Interior, Milan Aćimović, the current Belgrade police chief, Dragomir Jovanović, Đorđe Perić, Steven Klujić and Tanasije Dinić met almost daily to assist in this process. Several high-profile men were considered by the Germans, including former Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković, former Foreign Minister Aleksander Cincar-Marković, Aćimović, Ljotić, and Jovanović. Förster decided on Aćimović, who in early 1939 had briefly been Minister of the Interior in the pro-Axis government <b>of</b> <b>Milan</b> Stojadinović. He formed his Commissioner Government on 30 April 1941, consisting of ten commissioners.|$|E
5|$|Alboin moved west in his march, invading {{the region}} of Liguria (north-west Italy) and {{reaching}} its capital Mediolanum (Milan) on September 3, 569, only to find it already abandoned by the vicarius Italiae (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with {{the administration of the}} diocese of Annonarian Italy. Archbishop Honoratus, his clergy, and part of the laity accompanied the vicarius Italiae to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of Genua (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture <b>of</b> <b>Milan,</b> when he assumed the title of dominus Italiae (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences {{in the northern part of}} the Po plain, and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.|$|E

5|$|Constantine was {{the first}} Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, and he played an {{influential}} role in the proclamation of the Edict <b>of</b> <b>Milan</b> in 313, which declared religious tolerance for Christianity in the Roman empire. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was adopted by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century.|$|E
