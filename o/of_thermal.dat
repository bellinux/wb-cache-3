5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E

40|$|Background. Currently, thermal imagers with matrix {{radiation}} detectors (MRD) {{are widely}} used in medicine. A common feature <b>of</b> these <b>thermal</b> imagers {{is the ability to}} sample the signal in two directions: horizontal and vertical. Such thermal imagers are undersampled. That is why the question of evaluating the effectiveness <b>of</b> such <b>thermal</b> imagers is very relevant now. Objective. The aim of the paper is to provide a physico-mathematical model <b>of</b> a <b>thermal</b> imager to calculate the minimum temperature difference perceived (MTDP). Methods. It is proposed to determine MTDP based on the physico-mathematical model <b>of</b> the <b>thermal</b> imager for determining the minimum resolution temperature difference. Results. The developed physico-mathematical model <b>of</b> a <b>thermal</b> imager with MRD allows calculating MTDP that enables determining the spatial resolution <b>of</b> a <b>thermal</b> imager outside the Nyquist frequency. It is proposed to consider the Average Modulation at Optimum Phase (AMOP) as the line scale average contrasts, which allow obtaining an equation for calculating the MTDP function. Conclusions. The proposed physico-mathematical model provides an opportunity to determine the spatial resolution <b>of</b> the <b>thermal</b> imager outside the Nyquist frequency, which {{is an important factor in}} the effect on the thermal imaging quality...|$|R

However, the station eventually became outdated, and notification of its partial closure was given in October 1975, with some units being closed the following October. It was then only used as a stand-by station, operating only at peak electrical demand times. Finally, after some units having been in operation for about 40years, the station ceased to generate electricity on 26 October 1981. At the time of closure, only 98MW of the station's capacity was in use.|$|E
5|$|Lithium's {{coefficient}} <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> {{expansion is}} {{twice that of}} aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E
5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E

Tungsten has the lowest coefficient <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> expansion of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
