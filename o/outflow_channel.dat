The canyon system starts in the west with Noctis Labyrinthus; proceeding to the east are Tithonium and Ius chasmata, then Melas, Candor and Ophir chasmata, then Coprates Chasma, then Ganges, Capri and Eos chasmata; finally it empties into an <b>outflow</b> <b>channel</b> region containing chaotic terrain that ends in the basin of Chryse Planitia.|$|E
500|$|While {{executing}} a loop near Chuuk, {{the tropical}} depression intensified into Tropical Storm Tip, though the storm failed to organize significantly {{due to the}} influence of Tropical Storm Roger. Reconnaissance aircraft provided the track of the surface circulation, since satellite imagery estimated the center was about [...] from its true position. After drifting erratically for several days, Tip began a steady northwest motion on October 8. By that time, Tropical Storm Roger had become an extratropical cyclone, resulting in the southerly flow to be entrained into Tip. An area of a tropical upper tropospheric trough moved north of Guam at the time, providing an excellent <b>outflow</b> <b>channel</b> north of Tip. Initially, Tip was predicted to continue northwestward and make landfall on Guam, though it turned to the west early on October 9, passing about [...] south of Guam. Later that day, Tip intensified to attain typhoon status.|$|E
500|$|During {{the next}} three days, the {{disturbance}} maintained vigorous, but poorly organized convection. Data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft on June19 failed to locate a surface circulation. That afternoon, the TCFA was re-issued. On the afternoon of June20, the Hurricane Hunters finally founded a closed circulation, but outflow from nearby Typhoon Hal inhibited further development. Early on June22, the TCFA was cancelled because of a decrease in thunderstorm activity. By June24, however, vertical wind shear had begun to relax, coinciding with {{an expansion of the}} storm's southwesterly <b>outflow</b> <b>channel.</b> Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the cyclone. After an increase in thunderstorm activity, the TCFA was re-issued for the fifth and final time on the evening of June24. Based on a rapid improvement in the system's convective structure and Dvorak classifications of tropical storm intensity, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical storm Irma early on June25. Shortly thereafter, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured winds of [...] and a minimum barometric pressure of , though these winds were displaced roughly [...] {{to the west of the}} center. Based on this, the JMA followed suit and declared the system a tropical cyclone at 06:00UTC on June25. At around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started to follow the storm and assigned it with the local name Daling. At midday on June25, the JMA upgraded Irma to severe tropical storm intensity ...|$|E

500|$|The serious {{nature of}} the {{environmental}} problems the lake has been experienced has been widely publicised and has {{been brought to the}} attention of the Supreme Court of India. Public Interest Litigations (PILs) have been filed in court demonstrating the environmental dangers posed to the lake by sewage, wastes and effluents. The PILs have sought injunctions of the court for setting up of an integrated ring sewage system encircling the Lake; release of funds by the Government of India to undertake measures to check pollution and to inaugurate a High Powered Committee to monitor proper utilisation of the allotted funds. The committee is under obligation to post feedback of progression developments from time to time, directly to the Supreme Court. The PIL, filed in 2001, has resulted in a number of directives from the court to the funding and implementing agencies and the case is continuing. Consequently, under the National Lake Conservation Plan of the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India, funds to the extent Rs 2987.6million were sanctioned in September 2005 for the conservation of the lake. The restoration and rehabilitation measures envisaged under the [...] "Conservation and Management of Dal" [...] are under various stages of implementation with the funds allocated by the Government of India for the purpose. Some of the measures undertaken for rehabilitating the lake to bring it to its original eutrophication free status involved measures such as construction of siltation tanks, mechanical deweeding, regrouping of houseboats, deepening of <b>outflow</b> <b>channel</b> and removal of bunds and barricades, including some floating gardens. In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on new construction works close to the lakefront, including the building of new house boats. Resettlement plans for migrating the population from the lakefront have also evolved. The long-term development plans also deal with the reafforestation of catchment area to reduce erosion movement and movement of silt and to regulate grazing by livestock. Recent reports indicate that, as of 2010, 40% of the measures have been implemented.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{more recent}} imagery has also {{emphasized}} that the term [...] "valley network" [...] incorporates a large variety of different valley forms across {{a number of different}} scales in different martian geological settings. Any branched valley system on a scale smaller than an <b>outflow</b> <b>channel</b> can be termed a valley network, probably incorporating a large variety of geomorphological formation processes. Some valley networks run for over 2000nbsp&km across the martian landscape. Some may change width downstream. Some have drainage densities which do match some terrestrial values. Narrower, less deep valley networks are present, but probably are more rare than their larger equivalents.|$|E
2500|$|Although dry air {{significantly}} reduced deep convection on 4 March, MFR upgraded Gafilo to a tropical cyclone {{because of a}} banding eye, when the system began to expand its clockwise circulation and track west-southwestwards. By dual outflow channels, Gafilo underwent rapid deepening and reached category 4 strength on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on 5 March, as MFR also upgraded Gafilo to an intense tropical cyclone late on the same day. On 6 March, besides warm sea surface temperature above 29°C, the atypical third <b>outflow</b> <b>channel</b> from the west made conditions for the cyclone more favourable. Therefore, MFR upgraded Gafilo to a very intense tropical cyclone with a very well-defined circular and warm [...] diameter eye at 06Z, when it also reached category 5 strength on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. At 12Z, Gafilo attained its peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 125 knots (230km/h, 145mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to , although microwave imagery showed that the eyewall replacement cycle had begun.|$|E

[...] Clays which require water for their formation have been found within the borders of this supposed lake. They were identified as Mg/Fe-bearing phyllosilicates and Al-rich phyllosilicates, using with hyperspectral data from CRISM. [...] Further study, published in 2016, using both OMEGA (Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer on Mars Express) and CRISM found that a capping layer lies above an Al-rich clay layer (probably Al-smectite and/or kaolins). [...] Beneath this layer is Fe-rich clay, called nontronite smectite, and then a layer of zeolite or hydrated sulfate. [...] Small deposits of alunite and jarosite were also discovered.

2500|$|On 9 February 1999, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} low, that had developed within the monsoon trough about [...] {{to the northeast}} of Cairns, in Queensland, Australia. At this time strong westerly winds persisted around the northern side of the low, however, a weak pressure gradient and light winds existed {{to the south of}} the system and the monsoon trough. This was because of a deep area of low pressure near south-eastern Queensland, had an intense pressure gradient to its south, which prevented the trade winds extending up to the monsoon trough. Throughout 9 February the tropical low moved eastwards under the influence of a middle-to upper-level trough over eastern Australia, however, over the next day the trough dissipated along with the deep area of low pressure. As a result, an area of strong ridging developed to the south of the system, while the trade winds rapidly extended northwards to the monsoon trough. The upper level pattern also became favorable for further development, with an <b>outflow</b> <b>channel</b> forming on the equator-ward side of the system. The low subsequently rapidly intensified during 10 February, with atmospheric convection surrounding the system dramatically improving. The system was subsequently named Rona by the BoM later that day, after it had developed into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. At around the same time the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories and designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 20P, after it had become equivalent to a tropical storm. As it was named the system was located about [...] to the east of the northern Queensland coast, and had started to move towards the southwest {{under the influence of the}} subtropical ridge of high pressure.|$|E

50|$|By 1979 it {{was thought}} that <b>outflow</b> <b>channels</b> formed in single, catastrophic {{ruptures}} of subsurface water reservoirs, possibly sealed by ice, discharging colossal quantities of water across an otherwise arid Mars surface.

Many <b>outflow</b> <b>channels</b> begin at Chaos or Chasma features, providing evidence for the rupture that could have breached a subsurface ice seal.|$|R
40|$|<b>Outflow</b> <b>channels</b> on Mars {{are long}} sinuous linear {{depressions}} that occur {{mostly in the}} equatorial area (+ or - 30 deg latitude). They differ from small valley networks by being larger and arising full-born from chaotic terrains. <b>Outflow</b> <b>channels</b> resemble terrestrial stream beds, and their origin has generally been attributed to water in catastrophic floods or mudflows. The problem of channel origin is examined here {{from the perspective of}} erosional characteristics and the resultant landforms created by former and present-day ice streams and glaciers on earth. From morphologic comparisons, an ice-stream origin seems equally well suited to explain the occurrences and form of the <b>outflow</b> <b>channels</b> on Mars, and in contrast with the hydraulic hypothesis, ice streams and ice sheets produce terrestrial features of the same scale as those observed on Mars...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} ice streams in Antarctica reveal a {{mechanism}} of basal motion that may apply to channels and valleys on Mars. The mechanism is sliding {{of the ice}} on deformable water-saturated till under high pore pressures. It has been suggested by Lucchitta that ice was present in <b>outflow</b> <b>channels</b> on Mars and gave them their distinctive morphology. This ice may have slid like Antarctic ice streams but on rubbly weathering products rather than till. However, to generate water under high pore pressures, elevated heatflow is needed to melt {{the base of the}} ice. Either volcanism or higher heatflow more than 2 b. y. ago could have raised the basal temperature. Regarding valley networks, higher heatflow 3 b. y. ago could have allowed sliding of ice-saturated overburden at a few hundred meters depth. If the original, pristine valleys were somewhat deeper than they are now, they could have formed by the same mechanism. Recent sounding of the seafloor in front of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica reveals large persistent patterns of longitudinal megaflutes and drumlinoid forms, which bear remarkable resemblance to longitudinal grooves and highly elongated streamlined islands found on the floors of martian <b>outflow</b> <b>channels.</b> The flutes are interpreted to have formed at the base of ice streams during the last glacial advance. Additional similarities of Antarctic ice streams with martian <b>outflow</b> <b>channels</b> are apparent. Antarctic ice streams are 30 to 80 km wide and hundreds of kilometers long. Martian <b>outflow</b> <b>channels</b> have similar dimensions. Ice stream beds are below sea level. Carr determined that most common floor elevations of martian <b>outflow</b> <b>channels</b> lie below martian datum, which may have been close to or below past martian sea levels. The Antarctic ice stream bed gradient is flat and locally may go uphill, and surface slopes are exceptionally. Martian channels also have floor gradients that are shallow or go uphill locally and have low surface gradients. The depth to the bed in ice streams is 1 to 1. 5 km. At bankful stage, the depth of the fluid in <b>outflow</b> <b>channels</b> was 1 to 2 km, according to the height of bordering scarps. The similarity between Antarctic ice streams and martian <b>outflow</b> <b>channels</b> suggests that ice may have flowed through and shaped the <b>outflow</b> <b>channels,</b> and that perhaps the mechanism of motion of Antarctic ice streams also operated in <b>outflow</b> <b>channels.</b> In addition, sliding on deformable rubble may explain the formation of small valley networks. The large Siple Coast Antarctic ice streams are thought to slide over longitudinally grooved, deforming till, where much of the movement is within the till. The till is saturated with water at high pore pressures that nearly supports all of the weight of the ice. The small differential between overburden pressure and pore pressure at the bed {{is more important than the}} volume of water, but water needs to be supplied to the till interface. For pore pressures to remain high, the ice streams have to act as a seal that blocks the flow of water through them, and the rock underneath has to be of low permeability to prevent the water from draining away...|$|R
