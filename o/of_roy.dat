5|$|A Roy of the Rovers {{computer}} game was released, on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1988. It was {{split into two}} parts: the first an adventure game, in which– taking the role <b>of</b> <b>Roy</b> Race– the player had to find and rescue the kidnapped Melchester team, before then playing the second part, which consisted of a charity match {{to raise funds for}} the club. The fewer players recovered before the match began, then the smaller the team who could take part. In the extreme, Roy would be the only player for Melchester. The game received mixed reactions; the Spectrum version received 7/10 from Your Sinclair, but only 3/10 from Sinclair User.|$|E
5|$|Bjørnebye's {{experiences}} as a Reds' player in the 1994–95 season under the management <b>of</b> <b>Roy</b> Evans, were markedly more successful than that of previous campaigns. He gained a regular place in the senior team, supplanting the left back position from Julian Dicks, and featured in the 2–1 win against Bolton Wanderers in {{the final of the}} 1995 League Cup Final on 2 April 1995. Subsequent injury, a broken leg sustained on 5 April 1995 in a 3–1 win match against Southampton, terminated his season and he was replaced by Steve Harkness.|$|E
500|$|Comparisons {{have been}} drawn between the fictional Roy Race and the captain of England's 1966 World Cup winning team, Bobby Moore, whose playing career spanned a similar {{time-scale}} to that <b>of</b> <b>Roy's.</b> Moore's death in 1993, {{just days after the}} last edition <b>of</b> the <b>Roy</b> <b>of</b> the Rovers comic was published, produced a [...] "literature of tribute", framed around themes [...] "remarkably similar to those at the center <b>of</b> the <b>Roy</b> Race fiction and ideology... there was a clear sense of mourning for the loss of an age".|$|R

5|$|Bona Allen saddles were {{available}} through the Sears mail order catalog, and many Hollywood actors used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company, including cowboy actors Gene Autry, the cast of Bonanza, and Roy Rogers, who used a Bona Allen saddle on his horse Trigger. A statue <b>of</b> <b>Roy</b> Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, bridles, and other leather products.|$|E

He built up his own personal collection, which consisted of both modern paintings as well as African art and Chinese ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} <b>of</b> <b>Roy,</b> the Avalanche hired Jared Bednar from the Calder Cup champions, the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League, as head coach. On December 10, 2016, the Avalanche allowed 10 {{goals in a}} 10–1 loss to the Canadiens. The Avalanche closed out their season {{with a record of}} 22–56–4, resulting in a franchise-low 48 points and a last-place finish in the league; this was the worst record of any team in the NHL since the Atlanta Thrashers finished with a record of 14–61–7 and 39 points in the 1999–2000 season (which was their first season in the league).|$|E

5|$|His first 13 {{games for}} the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio {{throughout}} the season, but finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, although Ian Rush had scored more goals in the league. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League without making any impact {{in any of the}} major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment <b>of</b> <b>Roy</b> Evans as successor built up hope for the future.|$|E

5|$|Many American {{pilots who}} took part in World War II grew up during the 1930s enthusiastically reading flying pulps such as Flying Aces, and were captivated by the {{adventure}} stories, an experience that no doubt played a part in their decision to become military aviators themselves. Joseph W. Rutter, a pilot in the Army Air Force in 1944, recalls this vividly in his book Wreaking Havoc: A Year in an A-20, as does First Blue, the biography <b>of</b> <b>Roy</b> Marlin Voris, World War II ace and two-time commander of the Blue Angels.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, {{although}} they never finished lower than fourth in the table. The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, particularly after the death <b>of</b> <b>Roy</b> Kilner in 1928. The effectiveness of the main bowlers was reduced by age and injury; only Macaulay remained at something approaching his bowling peak. However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930.|$|E
