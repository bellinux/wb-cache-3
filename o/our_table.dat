25|$|After Super Tuesday {{all five}} territories had their contests. Puerto Rico held a primary {{and the four}} smaller insular areas (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and U.S. Virgin Islands) had {{convention}} style caucuses where no straw polls were taken, therefore <b>our</b> <b>table</b> does not show popular vote percentages in these rows {{but the number of}} delegates committed to each candidate. Romney secured all but two delegates from the territories. Of the six selected delegates from the Virgin Islands, one was elected as uncommitted, and another bound to Paul. On the Virgin Islands every caucus goer had six votes that he or her could cast for six different delegates. Every person wanting to be a delegate needed to pledge to a candidate or declare to be 'uncommitted' before the voting started. The six persons with the most votes became National Convention delegates. Only four persons ran as delegates pledge to Romney and they all got elected. The persons that ran as delegates pledge to Paul got a plurality of the votes, but only one of them was elected.|$|E

[...] This did not bother me much, as Indians do not eat such food. [...] At dinner-time that same day, when I sat down to <b>our</b> <b>table,</b> I saw to my surprise that there were pancakes before us. These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed them to us. [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on <b>our</b> <b>table</b> and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] I want you to understand, sir, that I will not stand for such treatment. [...] My Indians are the principal feature of this show, and they are the one people I will not allow to be misused or neglected. [...] Hereafter, see to it that they get just exactly what they want at meal-time. Do you understand me, sir”’ [...] ‘Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir,’ exclaimed the embarrassed manager. [...] After that, we had no more trouble about our meals.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Titanic indeed had a [...] list to port leaving Southampton. [...] Inadequate {{trimming}} {{of cargo}} and bunkers would likely result in such {{and the crew}} seems to have demonstrated a lack of proficiency on several occasions. [...] A list to port was noted by several Titanic survivors including Lawrence Beesley who wrote in his book about the sinking: [...] "I then called the attention of <b>our</b> <b>table</b> {{to the way the}} Titanic listed to port (I had noticed this before), and we watched the skyline through the portholes as we sat at the purser's table in the saloon." [...] (The dining saloon windows were double rows of portholes covered on the inside with screens of leaded decorative glass with no clear view of the outdoors.) [...] This was echoed by [...] survivor Norman Chambers, who testified that after the collision: [...] "However, there was then a slight list to starboard, with probably a few degrees in pitch; and as the ship had a list to port nearly all afternoon, I decided to remain up." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{engaged in}} one of the {{favorite}} activities of military personnel on the island: alcohol consumption. Both the soldiers and the instructors at the base drank excessively, as alcohol was cheap and plentiful. Toole remarked in another letter to Fletcher, [...] "We are all rotting here at the moment. The decreased draft has meant no trainees since June...the inactivity here, coupled with the remnants of a rainy and enervating summer has (have?) plunged the English instructors into an abyss of drinking and inertia. Occasionally someone will struggle off to the beach or to San Juan, but the maxim here remains, 'It's too hot. When Emilie Griffin paid Toole a visit in December 1961 she was dismayed at what she saw. Toole was notably depressed and while dining at a local hotel she noted that [...] "the windows on all sides of <b>our</b> <b>table</b> were filled with perfect rainbows. Ken was sitting in a pocket of darkness surrounded by these brilliant colored arches and he never looked at them." [...] Adding to Toole's dismay, his class ring from Tulane went missing and he searched the entire base for it, questioning everyone, until concluding that it had been stolen. Disgusted, he wrote home, [...] "It's a wonder I haven't been stabbed yet or paralyzed by intestinal diseases on this insane little geographical mountain top protruding from the Caribbean. However, under any circumstances the loss of the ring affects me deeply." ...|$|E

40|$|We list here Hecke {{eigenvalues}} {{of several}} automorphic forms for congruence subgroups of SL(3; Z).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{deterministic}} phase-concurrent hash table in which {{operations of the}} same type are allowed to proceed concurrently, but operations of different types are not. Phase-concurrency guar-antees that all concurrent operations commute, giving a determin-istic hash table state, guaranteeing {{that the state of}} the table at any quiescent point is independent of the ordering of operations. Fur-thermore, by restricting <b>our</b> hash <b>table</b> to be phase-concurrent, we show that we can support operations more efficiently than previous concurrent hash <b>tables.</b> <b>Our</b> hash <b>table</b> is based on linear probing, and relies on history-independence for determinism. We experimentally compare <b>our</b> hash <b>table</b> on a modern 40 -core machine to the best existing concurrent hash tables that we are aware of (hopscotch hashing and chained hashing) and show that we are 1. 3 – 4. 1 times faster on random integer keys when opera-tions are restricted to be phase-concurrent. We also show that the cost of insertions and deletions for <b>our</b> deterministic hash <b>table</b> is only slightly more expensive than for a non-deterministic version that we implemented. Compared to standard sequential linear prob-ing, we get up to 52 times speedup on 40 cores with dual hyper-threading. Furthermore, on 40 cores insertions are only about 1. 3 × slower than random writes (scatter). We describe several applica-tions which have deterministic solutions using <b>our</b> phase-concurrent hash <b>table,</b> and present experiments showing that using our phase-concurrent deterministic hash table is only slightly slower than us-ing our non-deterministic one and faster than using previous con-current hash tables, so the cost of determinism is small...|$|R
