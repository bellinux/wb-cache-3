40|$|Our {{paper is}} a {{synthesis}} of the practical achievements of a research programme financed by the Ministry of Education and Research of Romania, focused on auditing by information-based means the financial statements of different business establishments. It is well-known the fact that since the financial auditor is not {{an employee of the}} audited company the financialaccounting information is submitted on various media, which means {{it is highly unlikely that}} it could be incorporated in the auditing software. At this level of our research, we suggest a prototype of information-based product that would facilitate the work and exchange of financial-accounting information. In other words, our prototype is based on an <b>on-line</b> <b>dialogue</b> interface with the audited company, which will allow the auditor a quick development of the audit files (both the permanent and current ones) based on electronic evidence. At the same time, we shall make a presentation of certain financial-accounting restrictions considered when developing the marketable version of the information product called FINAUDIT...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{collaborative}} learning {{has supported the}} hypothesis that dialogue between peers and between peers and teachers facilitates learning by the peer participants in the dialogue. Examples of these dialogues show dozens of turns (individual utterances by participants) in a single learning session. In contrast, measurements of interaction from computer-supported {{collaborative learning}} environments show that <b>on-line</b> <b>dialogue</b> looks much different, {{with an average of}} approximately one posting or less per student per week. Measurements of learning in these environments do suggest learning is occurring, but presumably, not based on the same kind of dialogue described in research on face-to-face collaboration. Some possible explanations for how the learning is arising in CSCL environments are offered based on the Vicarious Learning Project (Lee, Dineen, McKendree, & Mayes, 1999; McKendree, Stenning, Mayes, Lee, & Cox, 1998). We believe that much of the learning in CSCL environments occurs from the observation of the dialogue, the reflection induced by the potential of submitting, and at least in the cases described, the interaction between the face-to-face and on-line environments...|$|E
40|$|Following an <b>on-line</b> <b>dialogue</b> with Dennett (Velmans, 2001) {{this paper}} {{examines}} {{the similarities and}} differences between heterophenomenology (HP) and critical phenomenology (CP), two competing accounts of the way that conscious phenomenology should be, and normally is incorporated into psychology and related sciences. Dennett’s heterophenomenology includes subjective reports of conscious experiences, but according to Dennett, first person conscious phenomenena in the form of “qualia” such as hardness, redness, itchiness etc. have no real existence. Consequently, subjective reports about such qualia should be understood as prescientific attempts to make sense of brain functioning that can be entirely understood in third person terms. I trace the history of this position in behaviourism (Watson, Skinner and Ryle) and early forms of physicalism and functionalism (Armstrong), and summarise some of the difficulties of this view. Critical phenomenology also includes a conventional, third person, scientific investigation of brain and behaviour that includes subjects’ reports of what they experience. CP is also cautious about the accuracy or completeness of subjective reports. However, unlike HP, CP does not assume that subjects are necessarily deluded about their experiences or doubt that these experiences can have real qualities that can, in principle, be described. Such experienced qualities cannot be exhaustively reduced to third-person accounts of brain and behaviour. CP is also reflexive, in it assumes experimenters to have first-person experiences that they can describe much as their subjects do. And crucially, experimenter’s third-person reports of others are based, in the first instance, on their own first-person experiences. CP is commonplace in psychological science, and given that it conforms both to scientific practice and common sense, I argue that there is little to recommend HP other than an attempt to shore up a counterintuitive, reductive philosophy of mind...|$|E
40|$|We will {{describe}} various {{ways in which}} we formulate joint research agendas with CSOs. Next to varied face-to-face events, from once-offs to continuous dialogues, we have set up a web-portal for <b>on-line</b> <b>dialogues.</b> We have so far done three <b>on-line</b> <b>dialogues</b> to articulate research questions, in different domains. We started with discussing five different applications of nanotechnologies that have their impacts on environment and health. Then we discussed two different fields of social studies: research on domestic violence issues and research with Roma and other travelling minority groups. All these <b>on-line</b> <b>dialogues</b> have been prepared in longer co-operations with Community Organisations, such as Environmental NGOs, Women’s Associations and Roma and Travellers Communities. We can see clear differences between the natural sciences dialogue and the other two. Also, we are becoming more aware of the required follow-up [...] and the practical web requirements. To answer the research requests, we turn to Science Shops and Research Funders. Science Shops are university-units or NGOs, doing or mediating research for Community Groups -already since the 1970 s-, in all research fields, so science, humanities, arts, social sciences, engineering, etc. By making use of students in their curriculum, the service is affordable or even free. Please see workshop by Linda Hawkins if you want to learn more. We will thus also share some experiences on the {{ways in which we}} have set up ten new Science Shops as part of the project, and we will highlight our studies on the role of research funders in supporting Community-Engaged Research. For this, we interviewed policy makers and funders in UK, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands and more countries. Finally, we {{will describe}} the way that the International Living Knowledge Network has enabled us to create this project, and we are interested to discuss follow-up and spin-off opportunities with the participants...|$|R
40|$|In {{what ways}} are {{computer}} networking practices comparable to face-to-face therapy? With the exponential increase in computer-mediated communication {{and the increasing}} numbers of people joining topically based computer networks, the potential for grass-roots therapeutic (or antiherapeutic) interchange is greatly augmented. Here we report the results of research into exchanges on an electronic bulletin board devoted {{to the topic of}} suicide. Over an 11 -month period participants offered each other valuable resources in terms of validation of experience, sympathy, acceptance, and encouragement. They also asked provocative questions and furnished broad-ranging advice. Hostile entries were rare. However, there were few communiques that parallel the change-inducing practices more frequent within many therapeutic settings. In effect, <b>on-line</b> <b>dialogues</b> seemed more sustaining than transforming. Further limits and potentials of on-line communication are explored...|$|R
40|$|Humans produce speech {{incrementally}} and <b>on-line</b> as the <b>dialogue</b> progresses {{using information}} from several different sources in parallel. A dialogue system that generates output in a stepwise manner {{and not in}} preplanned syntactically correct sentences needs to signal how new dialogue contributions relate to previous discourse. This paper describes a data collection which is the foundation for an effort towards more humanlike language generation in DEAL, a spoken dialogue system developed at KTH. Two annotators labelled cue phrases in the corpus with high inter-annotator agreement (kappa coefficient 0. 82). ...|$|R
40|$|ENJEUX-S is a development/research project {{financed by}} the AAP program (Industry Canada) from November 2004 to November 2006. Its {{objectives}} are to develop and validate an advanced games and simulations environment, based on a Web Services and telecommunications architecture to support the development and experimental activities of the generic game and simulation shells of the SAGE portal. This environment will support multi-user functions by means of transactional and interpersonal types of interactivity. Relying on a Web Services model, the environment will allow real-time interaction (digital telephony or videoconferencing) and animation (video, voice, sound, graphics or images). This advanced environment will provide transparent support for games and simulations developed {{by means of the}} generic shells implemented in the SSHRC-INE project. The core of the ENJEUX-S project integrates the components of real-time communication in the domain of Internet-based educational games and simulations. This integration - one of the original aspects of this project - enables the utilisation of enhanced educational situations (feedback, <b>on-line</b> <b>dialogue,</b> immediate assistance, shared strategies, help, etc.), where the real world meets the virtual world so as to investigate simple or complex 2 -D or 3 -D learning situations. On the one hand, the addition of multimedia components to educational games and simulation interfaces (interactivity) and, on the other hand, the instantaneous and simultaneous interactions provided by the proposed architecture, allow the handling of educational situations where geographically dispersed users will be able to act together, make concurrent decisions and cooperate among themselves all in real-time, thus emphasizing the emotional, communicative and social potential of educational situations. In summary, the environment developed in the ENJEUX-S project aims at developing user-friendly, on-line training situations, based on dialogue and intervention in teleconferencing mode (virtual face-to-face). This workshop will first present the design stages underlying the development of this environment, followed by examples of the operation of the environment using games and simulations developed within the SAGE project. Finally, participants will be invited to comment on the proposed environment with respect to their training requirements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the perception of ‘agrobiodiversity’ by 45 individuals being directly or indirectly involved in the Dutch agro-food chain. The {{analysis is}} based on an <b>on-line</b> stakeholder <b>dialogue</b> (OSD) entitled ‘Vision on Agrobiodiversity’ and 25 personal interviews. The OSD was held between October 1999 and May 2000 and generated 105 contributions. It was initiated to investigate the limited attention for and fragmented perception of agrobiodiversity. In the process we were confronted with basic causes for these attitudes. This study first considers the advantages of an OSD over traditional forms of professional dialogue, such as conferences and working groups. The results of the OSD lead us to the observation that Dutch policy-making on agrobiodiversity has been mainly motivated by international obligations and has involved a very limited number of stakeholders nationally. To be effective, such policy-making will: (a) remain problematic without a coherent view consensus on the role of agrobiodiversity in the overall organisation of agricultural production, and (b) require higher investments in discussing and communicating the relevance of agrobiodiversity with all relevant stakeholders in the agro-food chain...|$|R
