5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} the upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is the removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery {{can be used as}} part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> via the abdomen is recommended over removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. This is {{descriptive}} work to show <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{internal and}} external quality control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervix <b>uterus</b> cytology in <b>the</b> Cauca's Department for the year 2009. Objective: Determine quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cytology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervix <b>uterus</b> in <b>the</b> Cauca Department. Methods: We worked with the gather information about the 9 laboratories and with the obtained results from the external quality control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervix <b>uterus</b> made by <b>the</b> Health's Laboratory public <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cauca Health's Departmental Secretary. Results: We found that the cytology was made by not qualified or certificate personnel in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IPS and EPS that offer this service, the cytology's laboratories do not apply <b>the</b> recommendations <b>of</b> quality evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervix <b>uterus</b> cytology,according to recommendations by Bethesda's system 2001.

5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|In August 1955 Beryl felt unwell {{and went}} for tests: she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> and was given two years to live. The couple reacted to the news in different ways, and while Beryl began to drink heavily—up to a bottle of whisky a day to dull the pain—George began to work harder, and began a close friendship with a school teacher, Pat Howson.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} {{the upper part of}} the cervix lies the bladder, {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures than the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{surgical treatment}} <b>of</b> herniation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravid <b>uterus</b> through <b>the</b> mesoduodenum, displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descending duodenum around <b>the</b> gravid <b>uterus,</b> and concurrent herniation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{small and large}} intestines into the omental bursa in a cow. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical report. ANIMAL: Three-year-old, five-month-pregnant Swiss Braunvieh cow. METHODS: Repositioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> displaced <b>uterus</b> and descending duodenum without transection and anastomosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duodenum was performed through a right flank laparotomy. Concurrent displacement of a large portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small and large intestines into the omental bursa {{was not associated with}} intestinal strangulation and was corrected manually. The defects in the omentum and mesoduodenum were sutured. RESULTS: There were no postoperative complications, and the cow was healthy at discharge from the clinic 1 week after surgery. Telephone follow-up revealed that the cow had delivered a live calf and was producing a normal amount <b>of</b> milk. <b>The</b> cow was slaughtered 14 months after <b>the</b> surgery because <b>of</b> an udder problem. CONCLUSIONS: Herniation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravid <b>uterus</b> through a tear in the mesoduodenum with subsequent displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descending duodenum around <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> combined with internal omental herniation caused nonspecific clinical signs and no ileus. Exploratory laparotomy in an early stage of pregnancy facilitated reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> displaced <b>uterus</b> without transection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descending duodenum...|$|R
40|$|Hamster embryos enter <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> in {{pregnant}} females {{nearly one}} day earlier than unfertilized eggs in cycling females. The hypothesis that a substance derived from eicosanoids is {{released by the}} embryos, but not by oocytes, to hasten their transport to <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> was tested by examining <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and PAF antagonists on egg transport in <b>the</b> hamster. Administration <b>of</b> indomethacin {{had no effect on}} embryo transport, whereas administration <b>of</b> NDGA delayed <b>the</b> transport <b>of</b> eggs to <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> in pregnant but not in cycling hamsters. The PAF antagonists TCV- 309 and BN- 52021 delayed significantly <b>the</b> transport <b>of</b> eggs to <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> in pregnant animals, but not in cycling animals; i. e., they retarded <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> embryos but not <b>of</b> oocytes to <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> Administration <b>of</b> PAF to cycling hamsters hastened <b>the</b> oviductal transport <b>of</b> ova. These data suggest that, in the hamster, <b>the</b> earlier passage <b>of</b> embryos to <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> as compared to oocytes is mediated by PAF. Thrombocytopenia was detected in early-pregnant hamsters, and PAF-like activity was detected in spent media of two-cell through morula stage hamster embryos. These results suggest that preimplantation hamster embryos produce PAF-like activity that mediates embryonic signaling to the oviduct as well as pregnancy-associated thrombocytopenia...|$|R
50|$|Emergency {{exploratory}} laparotomy with cesarean delivery {{accompanied by}} fluid and blood transfusion are indicated for <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> uterine rupture. Depending on <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rupture and <b>the</b> condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient, <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> may be either repaired or removed (cesarean hysterectomy). Delay in management places {{both mother and}} child at significant risk.|$|R
5|$|Pelvic and vaginal {{ultrasounds}} {{are helpful}} {{in the diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound may appear normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E
5|$|The cervix was {{documented}} in anatomical literature {{in at least}} the time of Hippocrates; cervical cancer was first described more than 2,000 years ago, with descriptions provided by both Hippocrates and Aretaeus. However, there was some variation in word sense among early writers, who used the term to refer to both the cervix and the internal uterine orifice. The first attested {{use of the word}} to refer to the cervix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> was in 1702.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{treatment}} {{option for}} endometrial cancer is abdominal hysterectomy (the total removal by surgery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus),</b> together with {{removal of the}} fallopian tubes and ovaries on both sides, called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In more advanced cases, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy may also be recommended. If the disease is diagnosed at an early stage, the outcome is favorable, and the overall five-year survival rate in the United States is greater than 80%.|$|E
50|$|Harvey Karman in the United States refined the {{technique}} {{in the early}} 1970s with <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Karman cannula, a soft, flexible cannula that avoided the need for initial cervical dilatation and so reduced <b>the</b> risks <b>of</b> puncturing <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b>|$|R
30|$|After {{performing}} the procedure bilaterally in cases <b>of</b> STLH, <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> was morcellated. We {{found it easier}} and faster to morcellate <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> without disconnecting it from the cervix prior to the morcellation procedure. Anchoring <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> to <b>the</b> cervix makes <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> stable and prevents it from rolling around. Two kinds of morcellators were used, the X-Tract Tissue Morcellator (Gynecare, Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson) and the SAWALHE Electromechanical Morcellator (Karl Storz). Cauterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervical stump and cervical canal was then done by unipolar cautery.|$|R
25|$|Once fertilized, the oocyte (egg) {{remains in}} the oviduct for {{approximately}} 5.5 more days, and then descends into <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> <b>The</b> initial single cell combination is already dividing and by <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> entry into <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> <b>the</b> egg might have already reached the blastocyst stage.|$|R
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes {{that occur in the}} follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located at}} the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior pituitary secretes antidiuretic hormone, which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.|$|E
5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
40|$|Isoprenaline {{produced}} dose-dependent reductions <b>of</b> responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolated <b>uterus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat {{produced by}} an EC 80 of acetylcholine. Propranolol {{acted as a}} competitive antagonist to isoprenaline. Labetolol also reduced the acetylcholine-induced contractions but was much less potent than isoprenaline. The greatest reduction was smaller than that produced by isoprenaline. Propranolol antagonized <b>the</b> lower doses <b>of</b> labetolol. It is suggested that labetolol possesses partial agonist activity at <b>the</b> β-adrenoceptors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat isolated <b>uterus...</b>|$|R
40|$|Incarceration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravid <b>uterus</b> {{is a rare}} obstetric {{disorder}} that is often not recognized despite <b>the</b> ready availability <b>of</b> ultrasound. However, detailed imaging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disturbed uterine and pelvic anatomy - from an obstetric point <b>of</b> view- is <b>the</b> key in reducing the potentially severe complications of this condition and planning its treatment. In this paper, we will describe the specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of an incarceration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravid <b>uterus</b> and we will discuss <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> magnetic resonance imaging in defining anatomy and in the medical decision whether to operate or not. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions {{is the source}} of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray exhibits aplacental viviparity, in which the developing embryos are nourished initially by yolk, which is later supplemented by nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses; the inner lining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> bears a series of parallel lengthwise folds. The reproductive cycle for females is probably biennial, while males are capable of mating every year. Mating occurs from November to January, and the young are born the following year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The litter size ranges from 3 to 32, increasing {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for the}} production of ovocytes, and for the preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E
50|$|After delivery, leukorrhea {{accompanied}} by backache and foul-smelling lochia (post-partum vaginal discharge, containing blood, mucus, and placental tissue) may suggest <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> involution (<b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> returning to pre-pregnancy size) due to infection. A number of investigation such as wet smear, Gram stain, culture, pap smear and biopsy are suggested to diagnose the condition.|$|R
30|$|Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) {{syndrome}} probably develops {{secondary to}} a defect or retardation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Müllerian ducts. In this condition, a superior part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vagina, <b>uterus</b> and fallopian tubes are either hypoplastic or aplastic. However, ovaries are usually normal [1].|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} open {{questions}} concerning <b>the</b> functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>uterus.</b> One <b>of</b> these open questions concerns exactly how <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> operates as an organ {{to perform the}} very organized act of contracting, in a synchronized way, to expulse a new human into this world. If {{we do not understand}} how <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> works when it is working normally, it is obvious that {{we will not be able}} to detect or even prevent problems when it does not work properly leading to child born before time, sometimes with tragic consequences.|$|R
5|$|While copper IUDs may {{increase}} menstrual bleeding {{and result in}} more painful cramps hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether. Cramping can be treated with NSAIDs. Other potential complications include expulsion (2–5%) and rarely perforation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> (less than 0.7%). A previous model of the intrauterine device (the Dalkon shield) was {{associated with an increased}} risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E
25|$|In the {{pregnant}} sow, uteroferrin is highly {{expressed in the}} uterine fluids. Due to <b>the</b> unique anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porcine <b>uterus,</b> and <b>the</b> specific, progesterone-induced expression of TRAP; it is hypothesized that uteroferrin acts as an iron transport protein.|$|R
30|$|IUA {{formation}} is considered multifactorial, although the true pathophysiological process is still unknown. <b>The</b> specific characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> puerperal <b>uterus</b> {{and time of}} intrauterine intervention are important predisposing factors in adhesion formation. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> other factors still remains obscure.|$|R
25|$|Hysterectomies are {{sometimes}} performed with abdominoplasty. A hysterectomy consists in removing <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> {{and it may}} be complete (when the body, fundus and cervix are removed) or partial (when only the uterine body is surgically removed). This procedure is normally performed by gynecologists and it is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most common gynecological surgeries. This type of surgery is used to treat some benign tumors, cancers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ovaries, <b>uterus</b> or cervix, endometriosis and are also performed in transmen.|$|R
