5|$|Mark McNeilly {{writes in}} Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare that a modern {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> his importance throughout Chinese history {{is critical in}} understanding China's push to becoming a superpower in the twenty-first century. Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons and The Art of War in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu's time. There is a great perceived value in Sun Tzu's teachings and other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{designs for}} Pokémon are often highly {{analogous}} to real-life creatures, but also encompass inanimate objects. Director Junichi Masuda and graphic designer Takao Unno {{have stated that}} inspiration for Pokémon designs can come from anything. The variety of animals and culture across the world {{provide the basis for}} countless ideas to be incorporated into the franchise. The environment a Pokémon would live in is taken into account when they are designed. The lei-like Comfey fits appropriately in the Hawaii-inspired Alola region <b>of</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Moon. Masuda has stated that each element of a design has a functioning reason. In some cases, the design team creates a footprint that a Pokémon could make and designs a creature around that. Some designers look to game mechanics for inspiration, seeing where particular typing combinations could be interesting. Typing assignment varies during the design process, sometimes a Pokémon receives a type after it is created and other times they are designed around a particular type.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} Pokémon {{are capable of}} {{evolving}} into a larger and more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to {{a wider variety of}} attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release <b>of</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{development}} of Red and Green, all Pokémon {{were designed by}} Ken Sugimori, a long-time friend of Tajiri, {{and a team of}} fewer than ten people, including Atsuko Nishida who is credited as the designer of Pikachu. By 2013 a team of 20artists worked together to create new species designs. A committee of five people determine which designs are incorporated into the games, with Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida finalizing the look of each creature. Furthermore, Sugimori is responsible for the boxart legendary Pokémon and all of the official artwork for the games. According to Yoshida, the number of rejected Pokémon designs is five to ten times more than the number that are finalized in each game. In rare cases, rejected designs are brought back and released in a later generation. Shigeru Ohmori, director <b>of</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Moon, admitted that creating new Pokémon has become a difficult task with the sheer number of creatures designed over the franchise's 20-year history. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} diversity in recent religious narrative, which embraces stereotypical, moralizing stories about encounters with mountain spirits and supernatural 'Owners', {{as well as}} myths concerning heroes and deities. Particularly in tales concerned {{with the creation of}} the earth and the origin of useful plants, a reworking of Catholic imagery is often noticeable. Among the best-known myths are those about the opening of the Maize Mountain by the Lightning deities, the struggle <b>of</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> his Elder Brethren, and the marriage <b>of</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Moon. The early-colonial Quichean Twin myth, set out in the Popol Vuh, has not been transmitted, although fragments are recognizable in recent narrative; the name of one of its heroes, Xbalanque, was {{around the turn of the}} 20th century still known in the Alta Verapaz. Early creation mythology is found in the Popol Vuh and in some of the Books of Chilam Balam.|$|E
25|$|Sunlight: Trees {{generally}} {{require a}} good deal <b>of</b> <b>sun,</b> <b>and</b> most bonsai need direct sunlight {{during the growing season}} to thrive. Some shade-tolerant species of bonsai cannot thrive with too much direct sunlight, however, and it is the grower's role to site the bonsai specimens to provide the correct lighting for each type. Most bonsai will be located in an area that gets several hours of direct daylight. Shade-tolerant bonsai can be placed behind barriers (walls, buildings), sited on shaded benches or stands, or shaded by netting to reduce the impact of direct sunlight.|$|E

25|$|Aristarchus {{also wrote}} a book On the Sizes <b>and</b> Distances <b>of</b> the <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Moon, which is his only work to have survived. In this work, he {{calculated}} the sizes <b>of</b> the <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Moon, {{as well as their}} distances from the Earth in Earth radii. Shortly afterwards, Eratosthenes calculated the size of the Earth, providing a value for the Earth radii which could be plugged into Aristarchus' calculations. Hipparchus wrote another book On the Sizes <b>and</b> Distances <b>of</b> the <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Moon, which has not survived. Both Aristarchus and Hipparchus drastically underestimated the distance <b>of</b> the <b>Sun</b> from the Earth.|$|R
25|$|From certain {{expressions}} used in astrological {{texts that}} are {{earlier than the}} 7th century BC it would appear, indeed, that the beginnings at least of the calculation <b>of</b> <b>sun</b> <b>and</b> moon eclipses belong to the earlier period, but here, too, the chief work accomplished was after 400 BC, and the defectiveness of early Babylonian astronomy may be gathered {{from the fact that}} as late as the 6th century BC an error of almost an entire month was made by the Babylonian astronomers in the attempt to determine through calculation the beginning of a certain year.|$|E
25|$|This {{butterfly}} frequents forest {{paths and}} streams. The male is fond <b>of</b> <b>sun</b> <b>and</b> avoids the shade. It frequents flowers especially of Mussaenda frondosa, Ixora coccinea, Jasminum species and Asystasia gangetica. Periodically raids thicker forest patches, especially where Atalantia species {{are to be}} found in search of females to mate with. Has a rapid unidirectional flight and frequently changes course, hopping up and down in its flight path. Difficult to catch. Known to bask in the sun. Attracted to damp patch and has greater tolerance to other butterflies and humans while lapping up the mineral rich moisture. Known to visit animal droppings.|$|E

A second layer of lighter-gauge steel reinforcement bars was added, followed by two layers of expanded metal. A specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure. A layer of tar for waterproofing, and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy, hollow structure ready for decoration.|$|E
