5|$|The victim, as {{presented}} by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism <b>of</b> <b>individuality,</b> but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a hallmark of the modern condition.|$|E

In situations of increasing physical dependence, {{one of the most important}} ways to hold a resident in personhood is by sustaining and protecting their body. This requires knowledge <b>of</b> the unique <b>individuality</b> <b>of</b> the nursing home resident. The importance of knowing to nursing practice has been well established, but the application of knowledge <b>of</b> the unique <b>individuality</b> <b>of</b> the resident is rarely been investigated. Aim: To investigate the application of knowledge <b>of</b> the unique <b>individuality</b> <b>of</b> nursing home residents in daily care, by nurse-assistants. Research question: How is the nurse-assistants knowledge of a nursing home resident’s unique individuality applied in daily care? Method: A multiple-case study was carried out and data was collected from formal care plans, observations and interviews with nurse-assistants and residents. Data was analysed according to the themes of Kukla's theory. Results: Knowledge <b>of</b> the unique <b>individuality</b> is written in formal care plans, but is mostly applied automatically by nurse-assistants in the daily care for residents Conclusion: The nurse-assistants applies knowledge of the resident's distinctive ways of moving, their embodied desires and needs, bodily presence and sense of self and give physical pleasure in daily care. Nurse-assistants protects and respects the resident's bodily privacy and boundaries and adjusts its rhythms of one's conversation, gesture and touch. Recommendations: Further research into the unique <b>individuality</b> <b>of</b> nursing home residents in the daily care to provide more individualized care and personal care plans...|$|R

You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|Several anti-cult {{groups also}} {{considered}} the church a cult. The local {{branch of the}} Centre contre les manipulations mentales (CCMM, or Centre Roger Ikor) directed an intense campaign against the group with repeated warnings in the media, and the President of the Union nationale des associations de défense des familles et de l'individu (UNADFI), Catherine Picard, said on television that she considered the church a cult. Criticism against the Church includes methods of recruitment (considered aggressive proselytism) in psychiatric hospitals, schools, buses and similar environments directed to suffering people, a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, pressure on prospective members to quickly join the group, family breakdowns, identical language and clothing of followers reflecting a loss <b>of</b> <b>individuality,</b> education of children that is considered indoctrination, many banned activities (among them music, television, makeup and trousers for women who must also have long hair covered with a scarf), an hysterical environment at worship, desocialization of the faithful, excessive appeals for money, unverifiable and dubious healings that may be detrimental to members' health and the strong influence on members and lack of qualifications of Kennel. A delegate from the CCMM said that criticism was based on facts collected from former members and their families, some {{of which had been}} used in court (as in Vesoul). In response to writer in the Protestant journal Réforme Benoît Hervieu-Léger, who contended that a sole case in Besançon would have been sufficient to criticize the whole federation, the delegate also stated that complaints did not come exclusively from the church of Besançon. The association also noted many similarities with another Pentecostal church it considered a cult, the Mission of Full Gospel - Christian Open Door. As of 2010, MIVILUDES continued to monitor the Church of Besançon because of its hold over the faithful.|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} devoted to {{overview}} and analysis of V. S. Merlin’ theory <b>of</b> integral <b>individuality.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the study is to reveal a system’s background {{of the theory of}} integral individuality; to designate its current issues and to put new tasks of its further advancement. Methodology and research methods. Problematic and comparative analyses are used. A systematization of the main assumptions of the theory by V. S. Merlin shows that it is based on a general systemic approach and current ideas about integration. Results. It is demonstrated that the system-based approach provides a multi-focus perspective to view the integral individuality. Mostly, the following system ideas are embedded in V. S. Merlin’s theory. They are the concepts of structural levels, teleology, and polymorphism. With respect to the theory <b>of</b> integral <b>individuality,</b> a human is shown as a big system. It consists of a hierarchical set not included in each other, but relatively autonomous operative multilevel subsystems. They link one to another in a polymorphic multi-valued (many-tomany) way. The main features <b>of</b> integral <b>individuality</b> are seen as the hierarchical arrangement and levels, integration and differentiation, teleology and causality, flexibility of polymorphic links (between levels) and rigidity of causal links (within levels). In spite of its maturity, this theory can be put in a further progress. This perspective has been elaborated based on three key ideas – multi-quality, commonality, and isomerism. Scientific novelty. The routes of the phenomenon <b>of</b> integral <b>individuality</b> are uncovered. Its main properties are described: a systemic version of integrity, hierarchy, and polymorphism. Some topical problems are highlighted within the theory <b>of</b> integral <b>individuality.</b> Next tasks can be set to further develop the theory <b>of</b> integral <b>individuality.</b> They focus on shift from the systemic viewpoint to a multi-systemic outline, to combine integrity and commonality, to provide an isomerism coming from the polymorphic framework. Practical significance. The materials and thesis stressed in this article can be useful for researchers studying holistic conceptions of human. The theory <b>of</b> integral <b>individuality</b> can guide investigations designated to test Merlin’s assumptions under various conditions. </p...|$|R

25|$|It {{is also at}} {{this time}} when the concept of fashion, {{as it is known}} today, begins. Prior to this point, clothes as a means of {{self-expression}} were limited. Guild-controlled systems of production and distribution, and the sumptuary laws made clothing both hard to come by and expensive for the common people. However, by 1750 the consumer revolution brought about cheaper copies of fashionable styles, allowing members of all classes to partake in fashionable dress.

25|$|Japan's society prepares {{its people}} to work {{primarily}} {{for the good of}} the whole society rather than just the individual, and the salaryman is a part of that. Salarymen are expected to work long hours, additional overtime, to participate in after-work leisure activities such as drinking and visiting hostess bars with colleagues, and to value work over all else. The salaryman typically enters a company after graduating college and stays with that corporation his whole career. Other popular notions surrounding salarymen include karōshi, or death from overwork. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is the expected career choice for young men and those who do not take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word salaryman is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack <b>of</b> <b>individuality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{found in}} {{classical}} Athenian tragedy {{an art form}} that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in The Birth of Tragedy was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian Kunsttrieben ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the satyr. He is {{the horror of the}} annihilation of the principle <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> {{and at the same time}} someone who delights in its destruction.
