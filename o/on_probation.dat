5|$|When World War II broke out, Shaw took a {{break from}} acting and joined the Royal Air Force. He was {{commissioned}} as an Acting-Pilot Officer <b>on</b> <b>probation</b> in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 25 April 1941 {{and over the next}} three months was promoted to Pilot Officer <b>on</b> <b>probation,</b> then Flying Officer and then Flight Lieutenant. According to his obituary in the Guardian, he saw little action in the service and was told the only chance he would have to fly would be as a rear gunner. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech. He continued to hold a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commission after the war until he resigned the commission on 10 February 1954; he was permitted to retain his rank.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this phenomenological study was to {{describe}} the experiences of first-year online community college students <b>on</b> academic <b>probation</b> at a small, rural community college in central North Carolina. Four research questions guided the study: (RQ 1) How do first-year, online community college students who are <b>on</b> academic <b>probation</b> describe their academic experiences? (RQ 2) What do participants identify as reasons for receiving poor grades and being placed <b>on</b> academic <b>probation?</b> (RQ 3) How do participants <b>on</b> academic <b>probation</b> describe what {{they could have done}} differently to avoid being placed <b>on</b> academic <b>probation?</b> (RQ 4) What do participants who are <b>on</b> academic <b>probation</b> do to successfully return to satisfactory academic progress? The researcher used a phenomenological design to examine the gap in the existing research, specifically that there is insufficient understanding of the experiences of first-year community college students who take online courses and are placed <b>on</b> academic <b>probation.</b> This study focused on the experiences of students who attended a community college in central North Carolina. Data was collected through interviews, written documents, and a focus group and primarily analyzed through coding and establishing themes. Four themes emerged: Lack of Preparedness, Lack of Perseverance, Lack of Communication, and Optimism for the Future...|$|R

5|$|The {{jury found}} Bell guilty, and {{he faced the}} {{possibility}} of up to 22years in prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for September 20, 2007. Bell's new defense attorneys, Bob Noel, Walter Lee Perkins Jr., Peggy Sullivan, Louis Scott and Carol Powell-Lexing, requested a new trial {{on the grounds that}} Bell should not have been tried as an adult. A request to lower Bell's $90,000bond was denied on August 24, 2007, due to his juvenile record. Bell had been put <b>on</b> <b>probation</b> for a battery that occurred December 25, 2005. While <b>on</b> <b>probation,</b> he was convicted of another battery charge and two charges of criminal damage to property. One of the battery charges was reportedly for punching a 17-year-old girl in the face. The media had initially reported that Bell had no prior criminal record. On September 4, 2007, Judge Mauffray vacated the conspiracy conviction on the grounds that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile, but he let the battery conviction stand. Bell appealed his conviction, principally on the ground that he had been improperly tried as an adult. On September 14, 2007, Louisiana's Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Bell's battery conviction, agreeing that this remaining charge was not among those for which a juvenile may be tried as an adult.|$|E
