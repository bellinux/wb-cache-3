40|$|The {{performance}} of the mechanical ventilation system in large spaces is proposed to be evaluated by macroscopic numbers describing the air flow. This includes the air changes <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> the air change <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> floor area, the momentum jet number, and the nominal time constants. To determine which number is the best choice, experimental studies in nine big waiting halls were performed. The indoor environment in the mechanical ventilated spaces can be assessed by the measured local mean air velocity, carbon dioxide level, and local age of air. Correlations of the measured mean values of local air velocity, carbon dioxide level, and local age of air with those macroscopic flow number are investigated. It is found that the relationships of the air change <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> the air change <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> floor area and the nominal time constants with the mean air speed, the mean carbon dioxide concentration, and the mean local age of air were not clear.

40|$|Abstract. Concern {{about the}} {{possible}} effects of genetically modified crops has increased the demand for segregating grains during handling and processing operations. Research {{on the amount of}} commingling of different grains in an elevator is limited. This study evaluated the level of commingling at a grain flow rate of 51 t/h (2000 bu/h) at the research elevator facility of the USDA-ARS, Grain Marketing and Production Research Center (GMPRC), Manhattan, Kansas. White corn was first loaded in the elevator followed by yellow corn. Samples were taken after the yellow corn had passed the elevator boot, weighing scale, and grain cleaner. Samples were sorted by color and components were weighed to determine commingling, defined as the percentage of unwanted grain in the total grain mass. Residual grain was also collected from each piece of equipment after each replication. Commingling for the first 380 kg (15 bu, approximately 1 % of the leg <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> was approximately 4 %; it decreased to 0. 5 % within the first metric ton of load (2 % of the leg <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour).</b> Residual grain in the dump pit and elevator boot amounted to 0. 24 % and 1. 41 % of the total load, respectively.
