5|$|After Australia {{ended with}} 509 {{and took a}} 334-run lead, Tallon took two {{difficult}} catches to dismiss key batsmen {{at the start of}} England's second innings. Miller removed Cyril Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot to Tallon. Bill Edrich was then caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball that went straight <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ball took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, but they recovered. Later, he caught Godfrey Evans for 50 from Johnson as England ended at 441. Australia reached their target of 98 with two wickets down, completing an eight-wicket victory. Tallon conceded five and 12 byes in the two innings respectively.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; one with a brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat, the second with a red dress <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot {{with her in the}} brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with her in the red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E

5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis. On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant {{to show off the}} Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south to participate in the Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight.

5|$|Following the Nevada kickoff, Turner handed off to Scott, {{who picked}} up two yards. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Turner connected with Torrey Smith on a 26-yard toss for a third-down conversion. Scott then rushed for three {{yards to the}} Nevada 49-yard line, and carried it again down the middle, this time breaking free for a 49-yard touchdown run. On the following Nevada series, Kaepernick mounted a 38-yard drive to the Maryland 34-yard line, but failed to convert on fourth and12. On the next series, Da'Rel Scott was handed the ball four times in succession to pick up first downs with rushes of 11, 23, 30yards and a touchdown on a two-yard run. The score and extra point gave Maryland a two-touchdown lead, 42–28. Nevada's offense returned to the field with 7:44remaining {{in the game and}} used almost three minutes in a 37-yard drive that culminated in an interception by Maryland safety Jeff Allen on the Maryland 38-yard line. After no gain on a rush by running back Morgan Green, Maryland attempted an end-around. Turner was stepped <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> handoff was botched. The intended recipient, Heyward-Bey, dropped the ball but managed to recover it for a loss of six yards. After Nevada called a time out, Green rushed for a five-yard gain. Nevada expended its last remaining time out to stop the clock with 4:06left. Maryland punted it away on fourth down with 11yards to go.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{returned}} {{for the following}} match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test. Australia batted first and reached 7/774 declared, its highest score of the tour, which underpinned a victory by an innings and 363 runs. Johnson made 27, after coming in at 6/669 and playing a supporting role in a 105-run partnership with Sam Loxton, who made 159 not out. Acting captain Hassett declared without further addition to the score after Johnson fell at 7/774. Johnson {{played a leading role}} with the ball, taking his only ten-wicket match haul for the tour. After the hosts’ openers had put on 74, Johnson removed both in quick succession to leave Gloucestershire at 2/79. He later took the last three wickets as Gloucestershire collapsed from 6/257 to be all out for 269. Johnson had totalled 6/68 from 31.4 overs. Hassett elected to enforce the follow <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> home side reached 2/72 before Johnson took five of the last eight wickets to help end the innings for 132. Johnson ended with 5/32 from 17.1 overs for a match total of 11/100.

5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an anti-spin parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended {{at a faster rate}} and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E

5|$|On New Year's Day 1911 {{the body}} of Léon Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London.

The case became {{connected}} in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at {{the time for the}} link was scant. The historian FG Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because {{he was one of the}} informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists.|$|E
5|$|Protein folding {{does not}} occur in one step. Instead, {{proteins}} {{spend most of their}} folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, waiting in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein's energy landscape. Through a process known as adaptive sampling, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a Markov state model (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are discrete-time master equation models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on GPUGRID) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear parallelization, leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's phase space (all the conformations a protein can take <b>on)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.|$|E

5|$|The Cabinet War Rooms is an {{underground}} complex {{that served as}} a British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan. Their historical value was recognised early <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted. The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982, a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £6 million. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010.|$|E
