40|$|Background: Nowadays, e-Learning is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} effective media of education. Since {{there is a tendency to}} implement this project at Lorestan university of medical sciences, the current study aimed to investigate the feasibility of implementing e-Learning project at this university from the perspective of professors, students, managers and executive staff in 2012 - 13.    Materials and Methods: The study design was descriptive and cross sectional. Using stratified random sampling, 316 students, 84 faculty members and 13 managers and staff were selected by census method. In order to collect data, Darab Multidimensional Questionnaire (DMQ) (<b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> training and technical experience, cultural <b>readiness,</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> equipment, <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> communication network, <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> regulations, <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> human resource, <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> management, <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> training policies, <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> security and <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> support) was used.
