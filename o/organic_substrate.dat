2500|$|Fermentative {{hydrogen}} production is the fermentative conversion of <b>organic</b> <b>substrate</b> to biohydrogen manifested by {{a diverse group}} bacteria using multi enzyme systems involving three steps similar to anaerobic conversion. Dark fermentation reactions do not require light energy, so {{they are capable of}} constantly producing hydrogen from organic compounds throughout the day and night. Photofermentation differs from dark fermentation because it only proceeds in the presence of light. For example, photo-fermentation with Rhodobacter sphaeroides SH2C can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen. Electrohydrogenesis is used in microbial fuel cells where hydrogen is produced from organic matter (e.g. from sewage, or solid matter [...] ) while 0.2 - 0.8 V is applied.|$|E

However, bonding of flip-chips to <b>organic</b> <b>substrates</b> {{is still a}} challenge regarding cost-efficiency and assembly yield. Limits of soldering like shearing stress due to CTE differences and high process temperatures can be overcome with adhesives. Simultaneously, the reliability requirements result in high demands to adhesives and <b>organic</b> <b>substrates.</b> Compared to expensive isotropic/anisotropic conductive adhesives (ICA/ACA) the use of thermoplastic adhesive without any conductive fillers offers fast and cost-efficient assembly with rework option. In this work a thermo-mechanical bonding process interconnects thinned flip-chips to thermoplastic polyurethane circuit boards without additional adhesive. The substrate itself acts as stretchable PCB and adhesive/underfiller. The technology achieves very high assembly yield and is comparable to NCA bonding on common <b>organic</b> <b>substrates</b> like FR 4 or polyimide (PI).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have potential}} military, industrial, biomedical, environmental, and residential applications. However, implementing sensor networks and realizing their potential faces various challenges. Sensors nodes should be small in size, ultra-low-power, and WSNs {{should be comprised}} of large quantities of sensor nodes [1][2]. These challenges emphasize the need for low-cost and eco-friendly substrates suitable for mass production of wireless sensor nodes. <b>Organic</b> <b>substrates</b> {{is one of the}} leading solutions to realize ultra-low cost and eco-friendly sensor networks [3]. This paper presents the first IEEE 802. 14. 4 and ZigBee complaint wireless sensor node on <b>organic</b> <b>substrates.</b> The wireless node is a System-on-Package (SoP) solution operating at 2. 4 GHz with a printed Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) on <b>organic</b> <b>substrates</b> using inkjet printing technology.

30|$|The pH {{values of}} the <b>organic</b> <b>substrates</b> are {{alkaline}} for rabbit, sheep, cow and pig, ranging between 7.94 and 8.52. But the pH values of poultry (5. 88) and plant compost (6.84) are acids. This acidity can be proved by the large in nitrogen and mineral in poultry manure (Sherman 2003). The ash varied between 31.48  % (pig) and 84.4  % (vegetable compost). These values are relatively high because the <b>organic</b> <b>substrates</b> used contained sand, particularly the vegetable compost with 84.4  %. The carbon in cow dung is higher compared to the carbon in cow dung used by Bisht et al. (2007) to evaluate the reproductive potential of the earthworms (Metaphire posthuma). The nitrogen ranged from 1.07  % in vegetable compost to 2.56  % in sheep dung.

40|$|Dissolved organic {{nitrogen}} (DON) {{acts as a}} large reservoir of fixed nitrogen. Whereas DON utilization is common in the microbial community, {{little is known about}} utilization by macrophytes. We investigated the ability of the coexisting temperate marine macrophytes Zostera noltii, Cymodocea nodosa, and Caulerpa prolifera to take up nitrogen and carbon from small <b>organic</b> <b>substrates</b> of different molecular complexities (urea, glycine, L-leucine, and L-phenylalanine) and from dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from algal and bacterial cultures (substrates with a complex composition). In addition to in{{organic nitrogen}}, nitrogen from small <b>organic</b> <b>substrates</b> could be taken up in significant amounts by all macrophytes. Substrate uptake by the aboveground tissue differed from that of the belowground tissue. No relationships between carbon and nitrogen uptake of small organics were found. The preference for individual <b>organic</b> <b>substrates</b> was related to their structural complexity and C:N ratio. Uptake of algae-derived organic nitrogen was of similar magnitude as inorganic nitrogen, and was preferred over bacteria-derived nitrogen. These results add to the growing evidence that direct or quick indirect DON utilization may be more widespread among aquatic macrophytes than traditionally thought. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{excited state}} of polyoxometalates, (POM) arising from {{absorption}} of {{light at the}} O → M charge transfer (CT) band (near-VIS and UV light), is a powerful oxidizing reagent.

The currently accepted mechanism of H-abstraction as the initial reaction of excited POM with <b>organic</b> <b>substrates</b> (mainly alcohols) is modified by addition of one more step that involves the formation of OH radicals which, as is well known, react with <b>organic</b> <b>substrates,</b> mainly alcohols, by H-abstraction. In view of the formation of OH radicals, and the high oxidizing ability of the excited POM, the photochemical selective oxidation of <b>organic</b> <b>substrates,</b> reported so far, in aqueous solutions, should be considered with reservation.
