40|$|Organizational {{commitment}} is a psychological condition which is ‘‘describing {{the relationship between}} employee and organizations’’ and ‘‘providing to maintain the employee’s decision {{to stay in the}} organization’’. It is stated that an important factor in organizational <b>c</b> <b>ommitment</b> effort of the people for general purpose and in terms of for feeling itself as part of a group. Organizational {{commitment is}} thought to be important since sport has become as a sector which increasing day by day among the people of the place and importance and people in the sport trend to a common goal through organizational commitment. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect on the level of organizational commitment, level of organizational commitment and individual differences the ath letes who play as active in amateur level within the boundaries of province Bolu. Research was desingned in the relational screening model and data were collected using survey. In this study was used three - dimensional organizational comm itment scale (A ffe ctive Commitment,Continuance Commitment, Normative Commitment) to determine organizational commitment what was developed by Allen - Meyer and adopted to Turkish by Wasti (2000). Research consist of 144 athletes who play active football in the amatur leagues 2013 - 2014 season in the province Bolu and who paticipated to the research voluntarily. In addition population and study sample is the same. Average age of the athletes is 21, 78 and averaga football age is 9, 26. As a result of the statistical analysis, no significant differences were found in terms of organiza itonal commitment dimensionals, th e level of satisfaction from clup facilities, the level of satisfaction supporting fro m team - mates and the level of dialog with clup managment (p> 0. 05). Hovewer significant differences were found the dimensions of the affective and normative commitment dialog level differences with sporty responsibles p< 0. 05). Significant diffrences were found dimension of the continuance commitment education level difference (p< 0. 05) furthermore negative significant were found between age, education and football age with continuance commentment. Consequently, rather than clup managments and clup facilities, sporty responsibles are more effective on the commitment level for amat uer football players. It could be said as a cause of this that, football players and sporty responsibles are in direct relation to each other. In addition it could be said that, the higher the age and football age tend to feel compulsion to team by themsel ves decrease...|$|R

40|$|Arundo donax has {{attracted}} interest {{as a potential}} bioenergy crop due to a high apparent productivity. It uses C 3 photosynthesis yet appears competitive with C 4 grass biomass feedstock?s and grows in warm conditions where C 4 species {{might be expected to}} be that productive. Despite this there has been no systematic study of leaf photosynthetic properties. This study determines photosynthetic and photorespiratory parameters for leaves in a natural stand of A. donax growing in southern Portugal. We hypothesise that A. donax has a high photosynthetic potential in high and low light, stomatal limitation to be small and intrinsic water use efficiency unusually low. High photosynthetic rates in A. donax resulted from a high capacity for both maximum Rubisco (Vc,max 117 ??mol CO 2 ?m? 2 s? 1) and ribulose- 1 : 5 -bisphosphate limited carboxylation rate (Jmax 213 ??mol CO 2 ?m? 2 s? 1) under light-saturated conditions. Maximum quantum yield for light-limited CO 2 assimilation was also high relative to <b>other</b> <b>C</b> 3 species. Photorespiratory losses were similar to <b>other</b> <b>C</b> 3 species under the conditions of measurement (25 %), while stomatal limitation was high (0. 25) resulting in a high intrinsic water use efficiency.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between carbon isotope discrimination ( 13 &Delta;) of C 3 vegetation and long-term (30 years) and short-term (growing period) precipitation was investigated. Different species of Stipa, a dominant grass genus in the (semi-) arid Asian steppes, and <b>other</b> <b>C</b> 3 species were collected along aridity gradients in Inner Mongolia in 2005 (11 sites, 71 samples) {{and in the}} Republic of Mongolia in 2006 (40 sites, 45 samples). The data set was expanded with published and unpublished data of Stipa and <b>other</b> <b>C</b> 3 species (11 studies covering 8 years, including 64 observations of Stipa, and 103 observations of <b>other</b> <b>C</b> 3 species) and C 3 community bulk-samples (11 samples). Weather data were geostatistically interpolated for all sampling sites and years. 13 &Delta; of Stipa followed different relationships for the individual years when related to mean annual precipitation due to large anomalies between annual and long-term average precipitation patterns. However, the 13 &Delta; response to rainfall converged when the (long-term) mean annual precipitation was replaced by year-specific mean daily precipitation during the growing period (PG). Remarkably, the 13 &Delta;-response to (PG) for C 3 species as a whole (including herbaceous dicots, semi-shrubs and grasses) and also the C 3 community-level response were virtually identical to that of Stipa. The relation was also valid outside the geographical and climatic range where it was developed, giving proof of its robustness...|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to}} explore the following research questions: Does online instruction differ from traditional classroom instruction in regard to the development of affective learning? What emphasis is placed on developing a ffective skills in the traditional versus the virtual classroom? What instructional techniques are common or different toward developing affective learning in comparison of the traditional and virtual classroom? What specific types of lessons, activities, and assessments do teachers in each format use to ensure affective learning? What perceptions do teachers in the traditional and virtual classroom have with regard to affective learning and the implications with present and future learning in the affect ive domain through online instruction? Purposeful sampling was utilized to select five traditional classroom teachers and five virtual classroom teachers from Illinois. The state of Illinois was selected because in addition to academic learning standards, the Illinois Department of Education provides specific standards for social and emotional learning (SELS) in all grades. Three themes identified within the data include d : acknowledg ment and valu e of the impact of teacher immediacy on student learning, <b>c</b> <b>ommitment</b> to providing affective learning opportunities within the curriculum, and teacher perceptions about affective learning in online education. The responses showed that teachers in both settings acknowledged that affective learning was highly valued in their instructional program s. Interview analysis showed that teachers in the traditional and virtual settings were {{aware of the importance of}} providing affective support and developing affective skills in the classroom. Interview analysis show ed that there were many similarities between traditional and virtual curriculum in the development of instructional methodology to develop affective learning. The perspectives about online v er s us traditional education were sharply divided along the lines of teac her experience within the virtual platform. Traditional teachers did not believe that the virtual teacher or the virtual classroom could provide the necessary supports to build affective learning. Virtual teachers were much more amenable to online learni ng. Their perceptions were based on their described successes in the virtual classroom. They reflected on their efforts to build in affective supports and to implement instructional methodology which they believed were successful in developing their stud ents in terms of the academic and affective domains. Overall, the study showed that virtual schools and virtual teachers do place significant emphasis on affective learning and that their overall pedagogy is similar to that of traditional classrooms and t raditional teachers. Virtual schools have the capacity to impact student affective learning. Research into the impact that virtual schools have on K - 12 students and the affective domain will provide parents with the information needed to place their chil d ren in the best - suited learning environment. It will also provide educators with the data to inform and reform instruction to better meet the needs of all K - 12 learners. Tucker, Kimberly J.
