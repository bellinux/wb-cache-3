5|$|Bo's populist {{approach}} to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers {{take to the}} streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition, and rising fuel charges. Similar protests in China are frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation. Bo's government instead held televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. His handling <b>of</b> <b>situation</b> earned him praise as a comparatively progressive leader. A businessman who was reportedly involved in organizing the strike was later sentenced on 20 years in prison for disrupting transport and gangsterism.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new {{provisions to}} cover this sort <b>of</b> <b>situation.</b> Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property, owed by the landlord to anyone who could reasonably {{be expected to be}} harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a landlord who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by their failure to repair.|$|E

The key to delivery of such ubiquitous services is the ability to detect user and service situations and take appropriate action. Detection <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> requires awareness <b>of</b> some dimensions of user and service contexts, in particular spatial and temporal dimensions. This paper describes a context driven approach to the detection and management <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> based on an ontology <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> that integrates the key concepts <b>of</b> context, <b>situation</b> theory, situation-action machines and rule markup languages.

40|$|Abstract. Context-aware {{applications}} use {{and manipulate}} context information to detect high-level situations, {{which are used}} to adapt application behavior. This paper discusses the specification <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> in context-aware applica-tions and introduces a rule-based approach to detect situations. Situations are specified {{using a combination of}} UML class diagrams and OCL constraints. We support a wide range <b>of</b> <b>situations,</b> which can be composed of more elementary kinds of context. We discuss how to cope with distribution and to exploit it beneficially for context manipulation and situation detection. We employ a ge-neric rule-based platform (DJess [2]) to support the derivation <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> in a distributed fashion. ...|$|R
