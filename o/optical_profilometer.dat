40|$|Optical three {{dimensional}} (3 D) mapping routines {{are used}} in inspection robots to detect faults by creating 3 D reconstructions of environments. To detect surface faults, sub millimeter depth resolution is required to determine minute differences caused by coating loss and pitting. Sensors that can detect these small depth differences cannot quickly create contextual maps of large environments. To solve the 3 D mapping problem, a sensor fused approach is proposed that can gather contextual information about large environments with one depth sensor and a SLAM routine; while local surface defects can be measured with an actuated <b>optical</b> <b>profilometer.</b> The depth sensor uses a modified Kinect Fusion to create a contextual map of the environment. A custom actuated <b>optical</b> <b>profilometer</b> is created and then calibrated.
