5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> lie {{down for an}} hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|In the Third Test in Cape Town, Macartney scored 44, {{before taking}} 5/44 {{in the second}} innings to ensure that Australia would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> chase a solitary run. He bowled three of his victims and removed Billy Zulch twice. The hosts {{struggled}} against the dual spin of Macartney and Mailey. Australians went on to secure a ten-wicket victory. Macartney finished the Test series with seven wickets at 14.86. He totalled 492 runs at 70.28 and 14 wickets at 17.14 for the tour, against topping the batting averages.|$|E
5|$|Tuition is {{paid for}} by general {{taxation}} in Germany, although only 27% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%. Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax cut {{for the rich and}} a tax rise for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay them back.|$|E

5|$|A new {{application}} {{for the same}} route was made on 16 April 1907, this time from Solicitor H. M. Helliesen, Wholesaler A. Thune-Larsen, and Works Manager T. Poppe of Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS), the company which operated one the city tramways. This time the plans were slightly changed, with the route proposed built with a tramway {{rather than as a}} railway. In particular, the line was to connect to the Gamleby Line (then called the Oslo Line) of KSS's network and run up Ekeberg to an intersection between Ekeberveien and Kirkeveien. The plans called for a regular street tram with regular city tram vehicles. At the time, the city limits of Oslo went at Sjømannskolen. The application for the part within Oslo was sent to the city, while for the section outside the city, the application was sent to the Ministry of Labour. Within Oslo, a new line would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be built from Oslo Hospital to Sjømannskolen, while from Oslo Hospital to the city center, the line would follow the Gamleby Line.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, {{ridership}} {{had increased}} to 2.5 million per year, up 278% from 1991, giving a 7% {{market share in}} the corridor. To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. At the same time, a new freight terminal was to be built at Ganddal, meaning that the section would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be shared with intercity trains. The upgrade involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was started in 2006 and {{was estimated to be}} completed by 2009. It was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while {{the last part of the}} upgrade was completed. The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican National Trios Championship {{was created}} in 1985. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; Spanish for World Wrestling Council) was given the promotional control of the title while the Commission <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> approve the {{champion}}s. The first champion crowned was the team of Los Infernales (Spanish for The Infernals; MS-1, Pirata Morgan and El Satánico). CMLL controlled the championship from 1985 until 1994, when Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA; Spanish for Assistance Consultancy and Administration) {{took control of the}} championship. The first champion of the AAA-controlled era was Los Hermanos Dinamita (Spanish for The Dynamite Brothers; Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000 and Universo 2000). When the AAA began to co-promote events with Promotora Mexicana de Lucha Libre (PROMELL), the title became jointly operated; when the AAA and PROMELL split up in 1996, the championship was vacated. The Commission returned the championship to CMLL, allowing them to hold a tournament to crown the new champions, the team of Blue Panther, Fuerza Guerrera and El Signo. Since 1996, the titles have been exclusively controlled by CMLL.|$|E

25|$|A {{reasonable}} compromise {{for using}} {{large numbers of}} passwords is to record them in a password manager program, which include stand-alone applications, web browser extensions, or a manager built into the operating system. A password manager allows the user to use hundreds of different passwords, and <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remember a single password, the one which opens the encrypted password database. Needless to say, this single password should be strong and well-protected (not recorded anywhere). Most password managers can automatically create strong passwords using a cryptographically secure random password generator, as well as calculating the entropy of the generated password. A good password manager will provide resistance against attacks such as key logging, clipboard logging and various other memory spying techniques.|$|E

25|$|Sandusky faced {{a maximum}} {{sentence}} of 442 years in prison. According to NBC News, Sandusky likely faced a minimum sentence of 60 years – at his age, effectively a life sentence. Sentencing {{was scheduled for}} October 9, 2012. At that same hearing, prosecutors requested to the court that Sandusky be declared a sexually violent predator under Pennsylvania's version of Megan's Law, which would subject him to stringent reporting requirements if he is released. Sandusky would not <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> report his address to police every three months {{for the rest of}} his life, but would also have to participate in a court-approved counseling program. However, this designation will likely be symbolic since Sandusky will almost certainly die in prison. Earlier, on August 30, the Pennsylvania Sexual Offenders Assessment Board recommended that Sandusky be declared a sexually violent predator.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{recruited}} guerrilla fighters had {{to follow}} a two months basic military training program {{that is different from}} the physical training (PT) programs. The basic training consists of having to identify firearms and getting used to specific models and their physical operation, such as the Russian AK-47 and U.S. M16 assault rifles, as well as mortar rifles and basic communication systems. The PT programs are separate from the main training schedule, as they are included in the day-to-day life of a guerrilla, by climbing mountains, running with loads, participating in the digging of military trenches, making bunkers and occasionally also some swimming programs taking place in natural water resources such as rivers and lakes. Playing of soccer is another activity available to all male and female guerrillas as it gives them a proper mental relaxation. FARC clearly advises all guerrilla commanders to avoid assigning barely trained guerrillas directly in the front lines, establishing that they <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> serve in rear lines when coming fresh from basic training.|$|E
25|$|Rosenholm Station was {{established}} with two goals in mind. The first was creating an efficient {{park and ride}} station for commuters from Follo and Østfold. The second was to target IBM employees. The station was situated {{too far from the}} residential area to be of much value for the residents at Holmlia. Proposals for a station at Rosenholm were first put forward in 1976, but at the time the Norwegian State Railways concluded that there would not be sufficient ridership from the station. By 1987 the number of residents and work places had increased sufficiently that the agency reconsidered. The station opened on 1 July 1988, after a large parking facility with 250 spaces built at the site. The site was chosen because it was immediately within the city limits of Oslo, and thus <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay an Oslo fare. It was also situated before Mosseveien on E18 where the greatest congestion occurs. The plans called for up to 800 parking places to be built in the future. Investments totaled 2.6 million Norwegian kroner.|$|E
