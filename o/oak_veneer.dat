No {{basement}} was possible because of the low level roads beneath the library and a tall book stack was deemed inappropriate because of the desire to keep {{the height of the}} building low, so it did not overwhelm the surrounding buildings. Storage of the volumes was on the same level as the reading areas: this dual function led to the low ceiling height of three metres. Space was created in the reference library by opening up sections of the floors into double height reading spaces.

50|$|The most {{elaborate}} furniture in this style was made around 1815-25, often incorporating columns with rope-twist carving, animal-paw feet, anthemion, stars, and acanthus-leaf ornamentation, sometimes {{in combination with}} gilding and vert antique (antique green, simulating aged bronze). The Red Room at the White House is {{a fine example of}} American Empire style. A simplified version of American Empire furniture, {{often referred to as the}} Grecian style, generally displayed plainer surfaces in curved forms, highly figured mahogany veneers, and sometimes gilt-stencilled decorations. Many examples of this style survive, exemplified by massive chests of drawers with scroll pillars and glass pulls, work tables with scroll feet and fiddleback chairs. Elements of the style enjoyed a brief revival in the 1890s with, particularly, chests of drawers and vanities or dressing tables, usually executed in <b>oak</b> and <b>oak</b> <b>veneers.</b>|$|R

60|$|It {{always seemed}} to me that there are three writers which every one who wants to know how to use the English {{language}} effectively should study; and these are Shakspeare, Bunyan, and Defoe. One great secret of their hold on the popular mind is their being so radically and thoroughly English. They have the solid grain of the English <b>oak,</b> not <b>veneered</b> by learning and the classics; not inlaid with arabesques from other nations, but developing wholly out of the English nationality.|$|R
50|$|Veneered MDF {{provides}} many of {{the advantages}} of MDF with a decorative wood veneer surface layer. In modern construction, spurred by the high costs of hardwoods, manufacturers have been adopting this approach to achieve a high quality finishing wrap covering over a standard MDF board. One common type uses <b>oak</b> <b>veneer.</b> Making veneered MDF is a complex procedure, which involves taking an extremely thin slice of hardwood (approx 1-2mm thick) and then through high pressure and stretching methods wrapping them around the profiled MDF boards. This is only possible with very simple profiles because otherwise when the thin wood layer has dried out, it will break at the point of bends and angles.|$|E

5000|$|Dénes Györgyi, a {{professor}} at the Industrial Art School in Budapest, won the Hungarian Classroom design competition sponsored by Hungary's Ministry of Education in 1930 which features Magyar folk art combined with deep wood carvings and historic stained glass windows. The walls of the room are <b>oak</b> <b>veneer</b> stained a soft tobacco brown. The wood in the panels was carefully selected and matched, so that the natural grains form interesting decorative patterns. The ceiling is 70 wooden cazettas suspended in a wooden frame and has a predominant hue of [...] "paprika red", a color inspired by the peppers which are hung to dry over white fences in Hungary. The cazettas are decorated with folk motifs (birds, hearts, and tulips) in turquoise, green, and white were painted by Antal Diossy in Budapest. Joining the ceiling and walls is an inscription frieze with the first two stanzas of Himnusz, the Hungarian National Anthem by Ferenc Kölcsey. Above the blackboard is the coat of arms of the University of Buda which was founded in 1388. At the top is the crown of St. Stephen, the patron saint of Hungary and its first Christian king. The student seats are made of oak and are unadorned except for stylized carved tulip ornaments on the back. A bench along the rear wall and guest chairs are upholstered in blue. Along the corridor wall, panels carved with floral, plant, and bird designs invoke a [...] "tulip chest" [...] which are the traditional hope chests of Hungarian village brides that are decorated with tulips. In the display case lined with soft blue velvet is an exhibit of Hungarian porcelain, lace, embroidery, and costumed dolls. Stained and painted glass windows depict the legend of Hungary's founding as well as important events in the nation's history and culture. The rear window depicts King Nimrod and his sons, Hunor and Magor, who pursued a white stag from the east to the fertile Danube plain. Descendants of Hunor became the Huns and those of Magor became the Magyars. The bay windows commemorate historic figures and events of the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and 17th and 19th centuries. The oak entrance doors bears deep carvings of tulips, pomegranate leaves, daisies, and wheat. The door's center panel states the date of the room's completion in 1938. The carvings were made by American wood carvers of Hungarian birth from plaster models that were made in Budapest to ensure Magyar authenticity.|$|E
40|$|The nearly 50 {{million acres}} of oak-dominated {{woodlands}} in the North Central states are a common and economically {{important part of the}} landscape of this region. Red, black and white oaks are the principal species found in these woodlands, though several other oak species can be locally important. High-quality red and white <b>oak</b> sawlogs and <b>veneer</b> logs are in demand and sell for top prices. Oaks are considered one of the best fuel woods, and many trees are cut each year for home heating or for use as chips in industrial or institutional boilers. Smaller oak logs are used for pulpwood. Thus, oak wood will continue to be economically important in the future. Oak forests are important for other reasons, too. They provide habitat for wild animals, and their acorns are an important food source for game species such as deer, turkeys and squirrels. Because they can grow to an old age, forests o...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effects of impregnation chemicals on the combustion properties of 3 -ply laminated veneer lumber (LVL) made of Oak (Quercus petraea subsp. İberica) and Poplar (Populus tremula L.). For this purpose, oak wood was used as the outer ply and poplar used for the core ply in LVL. Borax (BX), boric acid (BA), borax+boric acid (BX+BA), and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) were used as impregnation chemicals, and urea formaldehyde (UF), phenol formaldehyde (PF), and melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) adhesives as bonding agent were used to produce LVLs. The vacuum – pressure method was used for the impregnation process. The combustion test was performed according to the procedure defined in the ASTM–E 69 standards, and during the test the mass reduction, temperature, and released gas (CO, O 2) were determined for each 30 seconds. As a result, di-ammonium phosphate was found to be the most successful fire retardant chemical in LVL with MUF adhesive. LVL produced from a combination of <b>oak</b> and poplar <b>veneers</b> with MUF adhesive and impregnated with DAP can be recommended {{to be used as a}} fire resistant building material where required...|$|R
40|$|The {{flammability}} {{characteristics of}} <b>oak</b> <b>veneer</b> plywood were evaluated in the Cone Calorimeter. Samples of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 in.) thick and 19. 05 mm (3 / 4 in.) thick <b>oak</b> <b>veneer</b> plywood were coated with 3, 6, and 9 coats of either oil-based polyurethane or water-based polycrylic clear finishes and tested at incident heat fluxes of 35, 50, and 75 kW/m 2 along with uncoated samples. Both {{the type of}} finish {{and the number of}} coatings were found to influence the ignition time, the measured peak heat release rate, and the minimum flux for ignition of the samples. The ignition times for the coated samples were 2 to 3 times lower than the unfinished samples. Predicted times to ignition differed by a factor of 2 to 3 from the measured values (with the exception of the samples with nine coats of finish.) The predicted ignition temperatures differed by as much as 100 ºC from the measured temperatures. The Quintiere flammability parameter, b, was found to be positive for all testing scenarios, suggesting a propensity for flame spread at the incident heat fluxes evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The initial {{research}} {{describes a}} new type of fiber boards for the furniture interior design, developed in cooperation with ATB (Leibniz-Institute for Agricultural Engineering) by using a new method of raw materials preparation and specific production technologies of ATB. The main raw materials are aerobically aged hemp stalks. The samples are made of hemp chips with a long preservation time and fastened together with the UF glue. Specimens are 8 mm thick and correspond to a medium-density fiberboard, fitting standard EN 622. Due to the fact that non-veneered material can be used only in non-load-bearing constructions, material improving technologies were studied, such as increase of board density, increase of glue percentage, partially substitution of wet-preserved hemp chips with a dry hemp and/or wooden chips to equalize moisture content of obtained mixture. The particular article describes how the new material is veneered with the <b>oak</b> <b>veneer</b> obtaining three-ply composite board with the improved mechanical properties that allows to use these boards in a load-bearing constructions. Tests are performed with the veneered material to determine such parameters as static bending strength (MOR), modulus of elasticity in static bending (MOE), swelling in thickness and hardness...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} kinds of coating materials on the properties of flat pressed wood plastic composite (WPC) panels were studied in this work. Rotary-cut birch veneer, sliced <b>oak</b> <b>veneer,</b> phenolic impregnated paper, polyethylene (PE) film, and recycled polyethylene (rPE) layer were used as coating materials. One or two-side coating of WPC panels was carried out simultaneously with their fl at pressing. No coupling agents were used for production of WPC. It was found that properties of fl at pressed WPC panels improved by coating with all investigated coating materials. The highest values of modulus of rupture (MOR) were observed in WPC panels coated with rotary-cut birch veneer and MOR values were higher in along direction than in across direction of veneer fibers. The highest values of water resistance were observed in WPC coated with PE fi lm or rPE layer. Coating of WPC with natural veneer leads to the decreasing of water resistance. Besides, water resistance of WPC coated with one side of natural veneer was higher in comparison with two side coated WPC panels with natural veneer. The two-side coating of WPC with phenolic impregnated paper, PE film or rPE layer leads to the decreasing of water absorption and thickness swelling...|$|E
40|$|Using {{written and}} studio {{research}}, the above research question is interrogated through {{a body of}} practical work, that evolved into a static exhibition titled Second skin: new knitting at The Ivan Dougherty Gallery, Paddington, New South Wales, Australia, in January/February 2008. This thesis examines knitting {{as a form of}} constructed textile in an historical and contemporary context and explores the integral relationship it has with fashion and textiles, as well as questioning the significance of interplay between fashion and art. The primary aim of this research is to explore contemporary knitwear designers working in the high-fashion&# 146; area of design and investigate how they are challenging traditionally established rules and perceptions, and potentially blur the boundaries of what is considered fashion design, into art. While conceptual fashion design has always been a debateable issue among fashion scholars as to whether it can be viewed as fashion, antifashion or possibly art, this thesis examines the influences of modernity and deconstruction in relation to knitting, to establish a conclusion regarding the contemporary position and understanding of knitting in society at present. Through gathering both primary and secondary research nationally and internationally, knitting has been examined in relation {{to the ways in which}} contemporary designers working in the realm of knitting are unravelling these traditionally based preconceptions, and analysing what they are accomplishing through the use of mixed media applications, post-knitting treatments, yarn and stitch manipulation, and challenging sculptural form to create a new visual language through artisanal production. The body of work presented explores the concepts established in the written research relative to perception and deconstruction, and provokes questions which challenge the notion of knitting as fashion, art or both. Through hand and machine knitting techniques, Second skin: new knitting examines body scarification in the form of tribal markings, which allows each pieces to transform into a second skin that convey interpretive narratives and visual messages. The predominant medium utilised is 100 % Australian wool and in conjunction, incorporates mixed media materials such as silk organza and semi precious stones, and technological processes include laser cutting and etching of Tasmanian <b>oak</b> <b>veneer</b> and leather...|$|E
