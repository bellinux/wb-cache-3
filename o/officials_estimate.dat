5|$|The {{number of}} {{civilian}} casualties in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed156 in 24 instances of war crimes and another 47 as victims of murderduring the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The Croatian Helsinki Committee disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period. When submitted as evidence, their report {{was rejected by the}} ICTY due to unsourced statements and double entries contained within. Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing. ICTY prosecutors set the number of civilian deaths at 324. Croatian government <b>officials</b> <b>estimate</b> that 42 Croatian civilians were killed during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Communications on {{the island}} failed due to the winds; the entire island was left without power and phone service. The winds greatly damaged 715power poles and 513transformers, leaving about $52million in {{electrical}} damage reported (2002USD, $ USD). The local weather office's communication link was cut off after flooding damaged a telecommunication facility, causing the National Weather Service in Honolulu, Hawaii, to provide backup support by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. Many anemometers near the northern coastline failed from the winds. The winds collapsed several walls at the Guam Memorial Hospital, resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport received damage to navigation equipment. Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's water wells inoperable, with most of Guam left without water service following the storm. <b>Officials</b> <b>estimate</b> the typhoon destroyed 1,300homes, severely damaged 1,825, and lightly damaged 4,800.|$|E

5|$|The {{thousands}} of residents without power celebrated Thanksgiving by cooking turkeys on outdoor grills or smokers. Army and Air Force planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations {{to the thousands}} left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kauai due to several days of power outages. By {{three weeks after the}} hurricane, utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in Oahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kauai. By around a month after the hurricane passed the island, utilities were restored to most of the entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well. One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while cleaning up after the hurricane. Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights. Following the storm, significant redevelopment occurred in Poipu, where the hurricane flooded areas several hundred feet inland. Hurricane Iniki struck the same area ten years later. <b>Officials</b> <b>estimate</b> a hurricane similar to Iwa striking Oahu in 1992 could cause up to $7.5billion in damage (USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} the tunnel's {{construction}} and opening coincides with PortMiami Deep Dredge Project that will see the port dredged deeper to accommodate larger ships expected following {{the completion of the}} Panama Canal expansion, now expected to be completed in 2016 (previously 2014). This will allow much larger ships, known as New Panamax, which will have a capacity of more than double that of Panamax ships to traverse the canal. This is predicted to cause a major increase in the Port of Miami's cargo traffic, which would overwhelm the intersection of Port Boulevard and Biscayne Boulevard without the tunnel. In 2009, 870,000 trucks moved cargo {{in and out of the}} port; and port <b>officials</b> <b>estimate</b> that that number will increase to around 1.4 million when larger ships start arriving. In 2010, about 800,000 TEU's were moved through the port, and port director Bill Johnson said that with the right marketing to major shippers, that number should double by 2020. Currently, the largest cargo ships that dock at the port have a capacity of around 4,200 TEU's (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units). After the canal expansion and port dredging, ships as large as 7,500 to 8,500 TEU's will be able to dock there.|$|E

25|$|The Saginaw city {{government}} can only legally tear down blighted properties that are publicly owned, {{a number that}} stands above 400. The federal grant provides funds to demolish nearly 950 structures. After the grant's approval, Saginaw city officials announced a program to purchase unwanted, abandoned structures from property owners, which would be then {{added to the list}} of homes to tear down. <b>Officials</b> <b>estimate</b> that there are nearly 1,200 privately owned homes within the city limits that are worthy of demolition.|$|E

25|$|Melamine {{may have}} been added to fool {{government}} protein content tests after water was added to fraudulently dilute the milk. Because of melamine's high nitrogen content (66% by mass versus approx. 10–12% for typical protein), it can cause the protein content of food to appear higher than the true value. <b>Officials</b> <b>estimate</b> that about 20 percent of the dairy companies tested in China sell products tainted with melamine. On January 22, 2009, three of those involved in the scandal (including one conditional sentence) were sentenced to death in a Chinese court.|$|E
25|$|Haiti also {{suffers from}} severe {{environmental}} degradation. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haiti’s forests remain, {{and in many}} places the soil has eroded {{right down to the}} bedrock. Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, Haitians have created an illegal market for coal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican <b>officials</b> <b>estimate</b> that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of Egyptians, numbering between 10% and 15% of the population, mostly {{belong to the}} native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church. The most recent declarations, made by Pope Shenouda III and bishop Morkos of Shubra in 2008, put forward the number of Orthodox Copts in Egypt as being over 12 million. Other estimates made by church <b>officials</b> <b>estimate</b> this number to be 16 million. Protestant churches claim a membership of about 300,000 Egyptians, and the Coptic Catholic Church is estimated to have a similar membership among Egyptians. Based on these estimates, {{the total number of}} Christians in Egypt is between 5% and 20% of a total population of 80 million Egyptians. While some government sources have claimed a percentage of around 6 to 10%, a number of published sources such as the Washington Institute, in addition to some of the Coptic sources, uphold that Christians represent more than 10% of the total population and claim that they actually still compose up to 15 or even 20% of the Egyptian population.|$|E

[...] Additionally, Stampede <b>officials</b> <b>estimate</b> that for every dollar spent at Stampede Park, tourists spend $2.65 {{in the rest of}} the city.

500|$|Few surface {{observations}} were {{taken during the}} passage of the hurricane, though officials reported that southern Mexico experienced the brunt of the storm. Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, near where Pauline made landfall, reported a peak wind gust of 70mph (115km/h) several hours before the hurricane moved through the area; no reports were available after that time. An anemometer in Acapulco reported a wind gust of 59mph (95km/h) with sustained winds of 46mph (75km/h). However, <b>officials</b> <b>estimate</b> Pauline might have been a hurricane while passing through the area. The hurricane produced very heavy rainfall along its path, with many areas receiving more than 15inches (381mm). According to the Comision Nacional del Agua, precipitation was recorded at 2,132 sites. The two highest reported rainfall totals are 27.1inches (688mm) at San Luis Actlan, and 32.62inches (930mm) at Puente Jula, near Paso Overjas. This made Pauline the wettest tropical cyclone in the history of Guerrero. In Acapulco, the hurricane dropped [...] of rainfall in 24 hours. This broke the city precipitation record set originally in 1974; the 1997 total represented about 25% of the city's annual rainfall. Seas of about 30ft (9m) were reported along the Oaxaca coastline while the hurricane made landfall.|$|E
