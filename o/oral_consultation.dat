To achieve this, Norwegian authorities worked towards establishing an inspection procedure to insure that the facilities remained solely used for 'peaceful activities'. This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator of the facility. The first <b>oral</b> <b>consultations</b> between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} {{the occurrence of}} professional delay in the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS). METHODS: Fifty-nine patients (51 women and 8 men; average age, 60. 5 years; age range, 32 to 88 years) diagnosed with BMS at our institution were retrospectively studied. Data were collected about the onset of <b>oral</b> symptoms, <b>consultations</b> with medical and dental practitioners, and misdiagnosis before definitive BMS diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: The average delay from {{the onset of the}} symptoms to definitive diagnosis was 34 months (range, 1 to 348 months; median, 13 months). The average number of medical and dental practitioners consulted by each patient over this period and who initially misdiagnosed BMS was 3. 1 (range, 0 to 12; median, 3). Candidiasis and aspecific stomatitis were the most frequent misinterpretations of the symptoms before appropriate referral. In about 30 % of cases, no diagnosis of the oral symptoms was made or explanation given. CONCLUSION: Professional delay in diagnosing, referring, and appropriately. managing BMS patients occurred frequently in the group studied. No significant differences were found in the number of medical and dental practitioners who were consulted. Emphasis must therefore be placed upon educational efforts to improve health care providers' awareness of BMS. This should increase the rate of recognition and appropriate referral or treatment of patients with chronic orofacial pain due to BMS...|$|R

The skin surrounding the nodule became erythematous and slightly scaly soon. She was treated with topical corticosteroids and <b>oral</b> antibiotics after <b>consultation</b> at an outpatient clinic. Despite the treatment, exacerbation of skin lesions was observed. The patient was admitted to the Department of Gynecology and, after consultation, was referred to the Department of Dermatology with the preliminary diagnosis of bacterial skin infection of the mons pubis and vulval area. Bacteriological tests were negative twice. Fungal mycelium was demonstrated on direct mycological examination and Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. granulosum was cultured.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether an interdisciplinary, multifaceted oral health education program delivered to pediatric nurse practitioner students at the University of California, San Francisco, would improve their knowledge, confidence, attitudes, and behaviors regarding the provision of <b>oral</b> health assessments, <b>consultations,</b> referrals, and services to young children during well-child visits. Thirty pediatric nurse practitioner students were included in the study. Participants completed a written survey before and after receiving an interdisciplinary educational intervention that included didactic education, simulation exercises, and clinical observation by a pediatric dental resident. Between pre-intervention and post-intervention, a significant improvement was seen in the pediatric nurse practitioners' knowledge of oral health topics (p < 0. 001), confidence when providing oral health counseling (p < 0. 001), and attitudes about including oral health counseling in their examinations (p= 0. 006). In the post-intervention survey, 83 percent of the subjects reported having incorporated oral examinations into their well-child visits.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} and generally accepted that enlargement of parotid salivary glands, as part of HIV-related salivary gland diseases (HIV-SGD), may be the initial symptoms/manifestations of the HIV infection. Oral mucoceles and ranulas are also frequently described as oral manifestations, in association with HIV infection. However, {{little is known about}} these latter lesions as being the initial symptoms indicative of an HIV infection. This prospective study has investigated the possibility that oral mucoceles in general, and ranulas in particular, could be the initial symptoms of an underlying and undiagnosed HIV infection. A total of 50 patients including cases of oral mucoceles and ranulas were consulted in a tertiary referral hospital set up. Nineteen (63 %) out of 30 HIV-positive patients presenting with oral mucoceles/ranulas, did not know their HIV status at the first <b>consultation.</b> <b>Oral</b> mucoceles/ranulas were for these patients, the only motives for visiting the health facility, and they were also the only clinical identifiable features (symptoms). Oral mucoceles and ranulas should, in the context of HIV-salivary gland diseases, be considered as initial symptoms and early manifestations of HIV infection. Routine HIV testing in all patients with oral mucoceles and ranulas is, according to this study, justified and should be recommended. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Studies {{have shown}} poor {{knowledge}} of oral contraceptives among women attending government health clinics {{and women in}} rural areas. Little {{is known about the}} level of contraceptive knowledge in educated, affluent, career-orientated women, although it could be expected that access to information would be greater. The study objective was to describe the profile, knowledge and understanding of oral contraceptive users in a private general practice in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods: Over a period of 3 months, all women attending a private general practice who were using an oral contraceptive were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Informed written consent was obtained in all cases. Results: Fifty-one women participated in the study. Most women were nulliparous (71 %), held a tertiary educational qualification (80 %), were employed (84 %) and were not concerned about the cost of their pill (65 %). Most respondents (86 %) obtained their information from a doctor. However, only 12 % of women were aware of the danger of extending the active pill-free interval. Less than half (49 %) were aware that their pill was less effective if taken more than 12 hours late and only 31 % of women knew that their pill was effective again after taking seven active tablets. Conclusions: Educated, affluent women attending a private general practice lacked basic knowledge of the <b>oral</b> contraceptive pill. <b>Consultations</b> by practitioners need to be improved.

40|$|A escolha do tema do presente trabalho, com o objetivo de contribuir com a história do ensino {{superior}} no Brasil, surgiu da necessidade de compreender as políticas de acesso ao ensino superior no Brasil e mais especificamente, no interior paulista, por isso a escolha do Instituto Isolado de Ensino Superior (IIES) - FFCL de Presidente Prudente- 1959 - 1975, primeira instituição de ensino superior da região e uma das células da UNESP, cuja gênese é pouco conhecida. Por meio de depoimentos orais, consulta a documentos oficiais, da imprensa, e bibliográfica, construí o que pude resgatar da história da instituição. O IIES-FFCL/PP era pleiteado, na década de 1950, atendendo ao interesse da classe média local, para ilustração dos seus filhos e também interesses eleitoreiros locais e centrais. Foi conquistada num momento em que o país vivia a política desenvolvimentista, para o que uma faculdade era importante ícone. Formou professores para o ensino secundário, para o ensino superior público e, principalmente, para o ensino superior privado que começou a se expandir, a partir de meados da década de 1960. Centro de pesquisas, notadamente a pesquisa regional, seus resultados levaram à análise e interferência no espaço regional, por meio da extensão, e são, essas produções, importantes fontes de referência. Sofreu dificuldades com a repressão do regime militar implantado em 1964, formou cidadãos críticos e militantes, muitos dos quais seriam professores na própria instituição e ainda hoje, trabalham na UNESP. Ao ser agrupado a outros IIES para criação UNESP, em 1976, sofreria a perda de 200 das vagas públicas que oferecia anualmente, para formação de professores, justamente num momento histórico de expansão do segundo grau, com a escola pública carente de professores habilitados [...] ..

40|$|Students of North American Indian history should applaud Miller, Calloway, and Sattler for {{producing}} this splendid reference guide. The volume extends {{the work of}} Francis Paul Prucha, who edited two bibliographies referencing thousands of books, journals, news articles, governmental documents, and other sources on Indian history and Indian-white relations. The tremendous growth in scholarship regarding the American Indian past {{would have been far}} less impressive without Prucha 2 ̆ 7 s contribution. The compilers of this new volume, working {{under the aegis of the}} Newberry Library 2 ̆ 7 s D 2 ̆ 7 Arcy McNickle Center, have made it possible for that growth in scholarship to continue. Increasingly, as the compilers point out, the study of the Indian past is crossing the boundaries of academic disciplines. Between 1985 and 1990 many historians, anthropologists, linguists, sociologists, geographers, legal scholars, and others realized the advantages of producing works that combine archival research with anthropological fieldwork, <b>oral</b> history, and <b>consultations</b> with Indian communities. While this bibliography, like Prucha 2 ̆ 7 s works, cites the standard histories of Indian wars, governmental policy, trade, and missions in its thirteen chapters, it also includes references to works in such fields as Indian ethnohistory, social history, legal history and Indian law, environmental history, and Native American literature. Although the bibliography 2 ̆ 7 s comprehensive index guides users readily to a particular topic, students of the 2 ̆ 2 New 2 ̆ 2 Indian history will especially want to examine the chapters on the growing fields of ethnohistory and Indian social life. The chapter on ethnohistory divides references according to the geographical location of an Indian group and provides numerous sources on US and Canadian tribal cultures. The chapter on Indian social life includes works on Indian education, women and women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences, demography, health and medicine, and images and stereotypes of Indians. The D 2 ̆ 7 Arcy McNickle Center has also sponsored New Directions in American Indian History, a volume of bibliographic essays edited by Calloway that examines trends in Indian scholarship from 1980 to 1985. Although an excellent historiography, it is not comprehensive and has not proven as useful to researchers as have the volumes of bibliographic citations. In the future, the Center 2 ̆ 7 s staff intends to produce additional volumes of bibliographic essays and of bibliographic citations on an alternating basis. One would hope that the volumes containing citations would take precedence. We beggars cannot be choosers, however. The compilers of this bibliography deserve an ovation for their work.

50|$|Because of the build—up in Vietnam, the 95th was {{reactivated}} 26 March 1963 at Ft. Benning, Georgia and alerted for overseas movement. On 26 March 1968 the 95th Evacuation Hospital (Smbl) {{arrived in}} the Republic of Vietnam to carry on in the outstanding tradition of its predecessors.The Advanced party arrived at the proposed site of the hospital; a sandy beach called “Red Beach” with no access road on the 20th of March 1968. By the time the ship (USS Geiger)arrived with personnel and TAT equipment on the 26th of March 1968, an access road had been started, the site plan completed and Sea Bees were assigned to assist. The initial phase of construction was the preparation of defensive position, perimeter wire and tentage for billets. During the initial phase the unit provided its own mess, electrical power, potable water and hospital laundry facilities.By the 1st of April the vertical construction was initiated consisting of two by four frames for tent wards. Incorporated in the initial construction {{was the use of}} parts of the “MUST: unit to provide proper conditions for traumatic surgery in the tropics. There was some uncertainty that the “MUST” unit would arrive in time, so by conserving on available construction resources the unit was able to construct a tropical structure suitable for air-conditioning.The construction for the first 100 beds was completed by the l0th of April which had been set as a tentative date of opening, however the vessel with the general cargo of the unit had not arrived in port. By the time that the general cargo arrived on the l4th off April 1968, additional work had been competed and the first 100 beds was reported operational on the 28th of April. By the 30th of April the hospital was 99% filled, additional beds were rapidly being added so that on 8 May, 300 beds were reported operational. The 27th day of May saw a 400 bed hospital with a census of 240 and an experience of a total of 320 medical patients, 941 surgical patients and 1058 outpatients, with a total of 1261 admission and 1021 dispositions. Seven hundred and fifty-nine of these patients were not from transfer by direct admissions. It was obvious to the staff that this evacuation hospital must continue to improve its procedures because it was to a great extent operating as a Surgical Hospital as well as an Evacuation Hospital. The hospital personnel soon adapted to the situation and found that combined operation of a tent Evacuation Hospital and a “MUST” operating room or complex was feasible.During the following month (May) the unit was continually harassed by enemy action in the nearby areas requiring the personnel to put in arduous 12 hour shifts of patient care and then sleep or stand watch on the perimeter the other 12 hours. To a man and woman without exception, they all did their assigned tasks in an orderly uncomplaining manner. By the end of June the hospital had experienced an additional 1215 admissions and 1188 outpatients for a total of 2476 admissions in the first 63 days of operation. During the preceding time, a new site was being constructed for the hospital some eight miles distance away at the foot of Monkey Mountain.Not only was it necessary for the staff to build and run the tent hospital, they were also required to use that spare time they had to visit the new site and offer needed advise and plan for the future move of their respective sections onto the new site. Plans were carefully laid and the move was scheduled to start by the 4th of July.By the last week of June personnel of the operating hospital on Red Beach were cut to a minimum and worked daily at the new site in preparation for the move without interrupting patient care at either site. Patient census was reduced as low as the situation would allow and the actual move began with one third of the staff moving to the new site on the 4th and 5th of July 1968.In July, the remainder of the staff moved with approximately 60 patients and by the evening of the 7th of July the hospital reported 323 beds operational. In a period of 71 days the personnel of the 95thEvacuation Hospital built one 400 bed “tent” hospital from the ground up on Red Beach, incorporating the use of parts of a “MUST” unit, operated it under combat conditions and moved completely to another location without interruption of its mission, providing its own mess, electrical power, water supply and hospital laundry.As of this date the 95th Evacuation Hospital (Smbl) continues its mission of taking care of the sick and wounded under more pleasant conditions. The present hospital is a 320 bed air conditioned facility offering area medical support to US Military units without organic medical support in the Da Nang area. The hospital also provided medical care to the Free World Military Assistance Forces and Civilian war Casualties. Hospitalization is provided for all classes of patients within the Lintits of available specialties. Selected patients are prepared for further evacuation to medical facilities providing specialized treatment not available at the 95th Hospital.The organization includes four full time dispensaries serving outlying units in the Da Nang Area. The wide range of professional capabilities available has made the 95th Evacuation Hospital a referral center for difficult and sophisticated cases in Northern Military Region I. Neurology, Dermatology, Special Radiologic Procedures, <b>Oral</b> Surgery, Psychiatric <b>Consultations,</b> Orthopedic Surgery, Neuro—Surgery, General surgery are some of the many specialties that have made the hospital the major medical treatment facility in this region. Active “on the job” training in all specialties of medicine is constantly being performed by medical corps officers and Vietnamese physicians as well. Medical, surgical and consultative assistance is provided to the Duy—Ton and Provincial Hospital of Da Nang on a regular basis.A future program is anticipated to train Vietnamese enlisted men technical skills in laboratory, radiology, pharmacy and ward procedures. The 95th Evacuation Hospital was closed down on March 31st 1973 and abandon in place.|$|R
