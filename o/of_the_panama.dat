5|$|Charles Edward Magoon (December 5, 1861 – January 14, 1920) was an American lawyer, judge, diplomat, and {{administrator}} who is {{best remembered}} as a governor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal Zone, Minister to Panama, and an occupation governor of Cuba. He was also the subject of several scandals during his career.|$|E

5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access {{coupled with the}} fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan. With the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.|$|E
5|$|During her {{tenure in}} office, she {{presided over the}} {{handover}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal from the US to Panama and the economic downturn that resulted {{from the loss of}} US personnel. Hobbled by new spending restrictions passed by the opposition-controlled Legislative Assembly, and her administration's corruption scandals, she had difficulty passing her legislative initiatives. Her popularity declined, and her party's candidate José Miguel Alemán lost to the PRD's Torrijos in the subsequent general elections to succeed her.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which took place while six American-Hawaiian ships {{were being held}} in various Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled {{with the fact that}} the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April.

5|$|The voyage {{taught the}} Navy more fueling {{stations}} were needed around the world, and the strategic potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal, which {{was completed in}} 1914.

5|$|When Iowan began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Eastbound {{shipments}} were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. With the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.|$|E

5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E

5|$|By 1911, Winnipeg was {{the third}} largest city in Canada, and {{remained}} so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around {{the start of the}} 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth {{in the second half of}} the decade was a result of the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Captain Ernest J. King, {{who later}} rose {{to serve as}} the Chief of Naval Operations during World War II, assumed command on 20 June 1930. Lexington was assigned, {{together}} with Saratoga, to defend the west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931. While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys, the enemy forces succeeded in making a landing. Shortly afterward, all three carriers transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers. The most important of these was when Saratoga successfully defended the Caribbean side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal from an attack by Lexington. Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for King with a destroyer and scored a kill on Lexington on 22 March while the latter's aircraft were still searching for Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|Chile, {{facing the}} Pacific Ocean, {{has a large}} British presence. Over 50,000 British {{immigrants}} settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914. A significant number of them settled in Magallanes Province, especially {{in the city of}} Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Strait of Magellan. Around 32,000 English settled in Valparaíso, influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century. However, the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of them away from the city or back to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Eichelberger was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant in the 25th Infantry on 11 June 1909, but {{was transferred to the}} 10th Infantry at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, on 22 July. In March 1911, the 10th Infantry was despatched to San Antonio, Texas, where it became part of the Maneuver Division, which was formed to undertake offensive operations during the Border War with Mexico. Then, in September, it was sent to the Panama Canal Zone. It was in Panama that Eichelberger met Emmaline (Em) Gudger, the daughter of Hezekiah A. Gudger, the Chief Justice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal Zone Supreme Court. After a brief courtship, they were married on 3 April 1913.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} {{toward the end}} of October 1961, a {{low-pressure}} area persisted in the western Caribbean Sea, north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal Zone. On October25, an upper-level anticyclone moved over the low; the next day, a trough over the western Gulf of Mexico provided favorable outflow for the disturbance. At 0000UTC on October27, a ship nearby reported southerly winds of 46mph (74km/h). Later that day, the airport on San Andres Island reported easterly winds of 60mph (95km/h). The two observations confirmed the presence of a closed wind circulation, centered about 70miles (110km) southeast of San Andres, or 155mi (250km) east of the Nicaraguan coast; as a result, the Miami Weather Bureau began issuing advisories on the newly formed Tropical Storm Hattie.|$|E
5|$|Headley {{was born}} in Colón, Panama on 30 May 1909, the son of DeCourcy Headley and Irene Roberts. Neither of Headley's parents was from Panama; his father was from Barbados and his mother from Jamaica, but they had moved to Panama while DeCourcey worked on the {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Canal. By the time Headley {{was five years old}} the Canal was complete, and the family moved to Cuba in search of further employment. In 1919, concerned by the amount of Spanish being spoken by her son, Headley's mother took him to Jamaica so he could be educated in an English-speaking school.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, {{a second}} French company, the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama, {{was created to}} take over the project. A minimal {{workforce}} of a few thousand people was employed primarily to comply with <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colombian <b>Panama</b> Canal concession, to run <b>the</b> <b>Panama</b> Railroad, and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in salable condition. The company sought a buyer for these assets, with an asking price <b>of</b> US$109,000,000. In <b>the</b> meanwhile they continued with enough activity to maintain their franchise. Phillipe Bunau-Varilla, <b>the</b> French manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New <b>Panama</b> Canal Company, eventually managed to persuade de Lesseps that a lock-and-lake canal was more realistic than a sea-level canal.|$|R
