5|$|A {{more recent}} proposal, the exomembrane hypothesis, {{suggests}} that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the <b>original</b> <b>cell</b> then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{reproduce}} {{through a}} process of cell division in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. For prokaryotes, cell division occurs {{through a process}} of fission in which the DNA is replicated, then the two copies are attached to parts of the cell membrane. In eukaryotes, a more complex process of mitosis is followed. However, the end result is the same; the resulting cell copies are identical {{to each other and to}} the <b>original</b> <b>cell</b> (except for mutations), and both are capable of further division following an interphase period.|$|E

This was ordered from local makers Stothert & Pitt in 1875, although to the Fairbairn pattern. As for the later Fairbairn cranes, the <b>original</b> <b>cell</b> plate was changed to a design of a single flat plate stiffened by riveted T section ribs, rather than the original cellular structure. In August 1878 the crane had been completed and tested, at a cost of £3,600 for the machinery, plus the masonry foundations.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} dinophyte {{chloroplast}} is the peridinin-type chloroplast, {{characterized by the}} carotenoid pigment peridinin in their chloroplasts, along with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c2. Peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts. The peridinin chloroplast is bounded by three membranes (occasionally two), having lost the red algal endosymbiont's <b>original</b> <b>cell</b> membrane. The outermost membrane is not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum. They contain a pyrenoid, and have triplet-stacked thylakoids. Starch is found outside the chloroplast. An important feature of these chloroplasts is that their chloroplast DNA is highly reduced and fragmented into many small circles. Most of the genome has migrated to the nucleus, and only critical photosynthesis-related genes remain in the chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|In {{multicellular}} animals {{the same}} principle has been put {{in the service of}} gene cascades that control body-shape. Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of morphogen gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and diffuses through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other morphogens that signal back to the <b>original</b> <b>cell.</b> Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling controls embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through feedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make structural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs.|$|E

The liquid acted as the electrolyte, readily seeping through the porous pot and making contact with the cathode material.

The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. [...] In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species.

The contamination appears to have originated both in the <b>original</b> <b>cell</b> stock and in monkey tissue used for production. In 2004 the United States Cancer Institute announced that it had concluded that SV40 is not associated with cancer in people.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1912, {{the vast}} number of imitators {{prompted}} Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese water torture cell. In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked {{to the top of}} the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult – the cage prevented Houdini from turning – the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break. The <b>original</b> <b>cell</b> was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called [...] "Houdini Upside Down". This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did.

The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912. Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926.|$|E

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} thermal inactivation of Aspergillus niger spores in phosphate-citrate buffer was studied. The thermal inactivation {{pattern of}} the spore consisted of a shoulder, an accelerated decline, and a tail at various constant temperatures around 60 degrees C.

The model parameters including the rate coefficients, the time lag, and the existence ratio of thermotolerant cells were analyzed at various temperatures. The tailing was not observed at an initial concentration below 10 (3) cells per ml.

Therefore, they can be passage without any limitation. The aim of this research was to choose the best way of producing clone of cells. Methods: in this study, Bovine Kidney (BK) cell line was used to be cloned through limiting dilution method in which Vero cells were used as feeder layer. Vero cells were first cultured in DMEM supplimented with 7 % heat inactivated calf serum and after a monolayer were formed, their growth was arrested by Mitomycin C. The cloned cells after incubation were separated and cultured in a new flask. After several experiments different clones were obtained and cultured for further studies. Results: Karyotype of clone cells were determined and compared with <b>original</b> <b>cells.</b> It was shown that cloned cells were more homogenous in early passages and their karyotypes showed less variability than original ones. Cloned and <b>original</b> <b>cells</b> were inoculated with HSV- 1 and Parainfluenza virus 3 in order to evaluate its biological abilities. Tissue culture of infectious dose 50 (TCID 50) of each virus was calculated and it was shown that there was no significant different between the HSV- 1 titers before and after cloning whereas the titer of the Parainfluenza virus 3 was significantly higher in the <b>original</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusions: Cloned cells of BK showed more stable karyotype and were less sensitive to parainfluenza type- 3 virus infection than <b>original</b> BK <b>cells...</b>|$|R
