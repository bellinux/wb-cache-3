For the cost issue, the analysis was carried out to calculate the whole foundation cost for a circular raft surrounded by a water tank and also for a piled raft. It is shown that using the new foundation system will give a decrease in the initial foundation cost by 28 % compared to using a piled raft with a pile length equal to 24 m. The effect of dynamic loads was also investigated and the results showed that the tower-foundation-soil system, using a circular raft surrounded by a water tank, successfully avoids resonance through the rotor excitations...|$|E

Land surface models have employed a variety of fine root distributions, but it is unclear which is the most accurate. To test if the choice of root distribution mattered, a sensitivity test was conducted on the Community Land Model with Carbon-Nitrogen Interactions (CLM-CN) for three different root distributions. The sensitivity test showed that the CLM-CN was sensitive to root distribution, and thus the choice of root distribution did matter. An existing dynamic root distribution was adapted to use <b>observed</b> <b>soil</b> nutrient <b>profiles</b> instead of the original prescribed nutrient profiles and was run in the CLM-CN. The new dynamic root distribution was evaluated against existing root distributions and was shown to have: (1) vegetation with reduced water stress and (2) modeled fine root carbon profiles which most closely matched the <b>observed</b> <b>soil</b> organic carbon <b>profiles.</b> The new dynamic root distribution appears to be an improvement over existing root distributions.

40|$|Legacy soil maps {{typically}} {{consist of}} a tessellation of polygon soil map unit delineations where the map units {{consist of a}} defined assemblage of soil classes assumed to exist in more-or-less fixed proportions. There are several limitations {{in this kind of}} mapping approach that relate to the original intent of the soil survey, the effect of mapping scale, and the nature of soil polygon boundaries. Yet perhaps a more fundamental limitation is {{the fact that most of}} the time, the soil classes that comprise the soil map units are not mapped individually: in effect their spatial distributions are unknown beyond the qualitative indications given in the accompanying soil map unit report. Spatial disaggregation of soil map units attempts to map the spatial distribution of the individual soil classes that comprise a legacy soil map. We developed an approach called "Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees" (DSMART). DSMART samples the polygons of a legacy soil map and uses classification trees to generate a number of realisations of the potential soil class distribution. The realisations are then used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the individual soil classes. These estimates are mapped as raster grids, which can overcome some of the limitations of mapping scale and polygon boundaries inherent in the original legacy soil map. We demonstrate the DSMART approach on a legacy soil map from the former Dalrymple Shire in central Queensland, Australia. We mapped the estimated probability of occurrence of the 71 soil classes in the legacy soil map, as well as the most probable soil class, second-most-probable soil class and the degree of confusion between them as determined by a confusion index. Validation on 285 <b>observed</b> <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> indicated that for 48. 4 % of the validation <b>profiles,</b> the <b>observed</b> <b>soil</b> class was identified in the top three most probable soil classes.

40|$|Scaling methods allow {{a single}} {{solution}} to Richards' equation (RE) to suffice for numerous specific cases of water flow in unsaturated soils. During the past half-century, many such methods were developed for similar soils. In this paper, a new method is proposed for scaling RE {{for a wide}} range of dissimilar soils. Exponential-power (EP) functions are used to reduce the dependence of the scaled RE on the soil hydraulic properties. To evaluate the proposed method, the scaled RE was solved numerically considering two test cases: infiltration into relatively dry soils having initially uniform water content distributions, and gravity-dominant drainage occurring from initially wet <b>soil</b> <b>profiles.</b> Although the results for four texturally different soils ranging from sand to heavy clay (adopted from the UNSODA database) showed that the scaled solution were invariant {{for a wide range}} of flow conditions, slight deviations were <b>observed</b> when the <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> was initially wet in the infiltration case or deeply wet in the drainage case.

A study was conducted to evaluate tillage effects on the movement of water and nitrate–nitrogen (NO 3 –N) in the root zone under continuous corn (Zea mays L.) production. Four tillage treatments considered were: chisel plow (CP), moldboard plow (MP), no-tillage (NT), and ridge-tillage (RT). The root zone water quality model (RZWQM: V. 3. 25) was used to conduct these simulations. Three years (1990 – 1992) of field <b>observed</b> data on <b>soil</b> water contents and NO 3 –N concentrations in the <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> were used to evaluate the performance of the model.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate, at site scale, the {{influence}} of freezing and freeze/thaw cycles on the survival of fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci in soil, in a climate change perspective. Viable cells of both fecal indicators were counted in ten different <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> and at different depths, before and after a winter season. Before the winter period and during grazing, viable cells of fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci were detected only in the first 10 cm below ground, while, after the winter period and before the new seasonal grazing, a lower number of viable cells of both fecal indicators was detected only in some of the <b>soil</b> <b>profiles,</b> and within the first 5 cm. Thus, a significant decrease in viable cells was <b>observed</b> in all <b>soil</b> <b>profiles,</b> due to cold shock, freezing, prolonged exposure to subzero temperatures, and alternating freezing and thawing periods, even though this decrease was not uniform at site scale. Taking into consideration the results of specific investigations, we hypothesised that the non-uniform spatial distribution of grass roots within the studied soil ccould play an important role in influencing this phenomenon, while several abiotic factors, such as organic matter, grain size and specific weight of particles, total porosity, and relative density, did not play any significant role. In a climate change perspective, taking into account also the local trend in air temperature, a different distribution of microbial pollution over time is expected in spring waters, and a higher risk of transmission of infections is expected throughout the year. The progressive increase in air temperature, with emphasis on the minimum one, will cause a progressive decrease in freezing and freeze/thawing at higher altitudes, therefore minimising cold shocks on microbial cells, and causing spring water pollution also during winter, differently from the actual observations...|$|R

An important feature of the scheme is the inclusion of vertical heterogeneity of soil hydraulic parameters is modelling unsaturated flow. The simulated soil moisture for HAPEX site using a vertically homogeneous soil has a positive bias in the upper soil layers and a negative bias in the deep soil layers. Taking into account the soil vertical heterogeneity greatly eliminates this discrepancy and results in an excellent agreement between annual cycles of modelled and <b>observed</b> <b>soil</b> moisture <b>profiles.</b> The mean annual soil moisture in the top 1. 6 m of soil increased from 394 mm for homogeneous case to 433 mm for the heterogeneous case, consistent with 435 mm observed.

The simulated monthly averages of surface temperature and fluxes follow observations over the year, except for January when the model overestimates the latent heat flux due to its failure in simulating high rates of dew fall. The deviation of modelled monthly mean surface fluxes from observations are well within the estimated observational errors.

40|$|A {{validation}} {{study of the}} physical based pesticide leaching model WAVE is presented. The model considers a mechanistic description of 1 -D water, solute and heat transport. Linear sorption isotherms and first order degradation sub-models are used to simulate pesticide sorption and transformation. The first order degradation rates are reduced when temperature and moisture stress in the <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> occur. The model is conceived to describe pesticide fate within rigid mineral soils. Model tests were therefore done using data collected at a sandy (Vredepeel) and a loamy soil (Weiherbach). Both field data and lysimeter data were {{used to evaluate the}} performance to describe water, bromide, ethoprophos, bentazone and isoproturon transport in soil. The evaluation procedure presented by Vanclooster et al. (Agric. Water Mgmt,, Vol. 44, pp. 1 - 19) was completely adopted. The measured soil moisture in the sandy soil could only successfully be described after calibrating the hydraulic functions using field <b>observed</b> <b>soil</b> moisture <b>profiles.</b> Zn addition, the predicted balance terms, such as the soil water drainage, were subject to a lot of uncertainty. Bromide transport in the sandy soil was poorly described with the equilibrium solute transport model. Anomalies were also observed when simulating the transport of the inert tracer in the lysimeter at the loamy site. The fate of the weakly sorbing bentazone component was appropriately described at the Vredepeel field site. However, the retardation of the strongly sorbing ethoprophos and isoproturon components was poorly simulated. Further, the pesticide dissipation varied considerably in time, which could not be accounted for with the first order degradation model. The need for model calibration illustrates the constraints when using mechanistic models such as WAVE to predict field scale pesticide fate and transport. The adoption of a mechanistic model for registration purposes may therefore be subjected to a lot of uncertainty. Ln addition, processes affecting pesticide fate and transport are still poorly represented within the model. Deficiencies are related to the description of non-linear sorption, time dependent pesticide degradation, and pesticide volatilisation. Future developments with the model should therefore envisage to improve the parametrisation reduce the output uncertainty, and improve process descriptions of essential processes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Transitional areas between upland {{and aquatic}} habitats, {{commonly}} known as wetland, were once viewed as unproductive areas and were drained for farming or pasture. Wetlands are now accepted as significant ecological resources, and their protection is a mandate of federal, state, and local land managers. Due to the diversity of wetland areas, the appropriate assessment of wetland resources cannot be accomplished without long term monitoring of wetland functions. Knowledge of the duration of saturation and associated anaerobic conditions of soils in wetlands is critical to correctly classify and assess wetland areas. Soil, hydrological, and biogeochemical characteristics of the soils of the Jackson-Frazier wetland were observed from October 1992 through March 1994. Weekly observations of water levels and redox potential at depths of 25, 50, and 100 cm were made in order to characterize the degree and duration of saturation and the anaerobic conditions in the soil over time. Permanently installed piezometers measured free water in the soil and indicated the presence of two separated water tables from {{the onset of the}} rainy season in October until February when the entire <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> became saturated with free water. Platinum electrodes measured redox potential in the soil and indicated anaerobic conditions for ten months during the first season of observation and through March of the second season. Anaerobic conditions were considered to be achieved when Fe⁺³ was reduced to Fe⁺² at a potential of 200 millivolts. The highly reducing conditions correspond to periods of soil saturation indicated by piezometers. Concentrations of iron and manganese <b>observed</b> in <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> correspond to conditions of prolonged saturation and reduction confirmed by monitoring. A soil stratigraphic study done with auger holes revealed a recent alluvial deposit of montmorrillonitic clay overlying lacustrine silts identified as the Irish Bend Member of the Willamette Formation. The clay deposit overlying the surface of the wetland acts as an aquitard and creates extensive surface ponding, which maintains the saturated habitat required for wetland vegetation. The subsurface hydrology is controlled by water flowing through the Irish Bend silts which results in saturation of the soils from below. Biogeochemical transformations of iron and manganese due to suboxic and anaerobic conditions are controlled by this type of soil saturation in the Jackson-Frazier wetland...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study was}} to provide farmers and rural development offices with a tool and methodology for predicting, monitoring of soil salinity for a better agronomical strategy. The experiments were carried out in the highly complex and heterogeneous semiarid Kalâat Landalous irrigated district of Tunisia. The field and laboratory measurements of soil and water properties were conducted in 1989 and 2006 at different observation scales (2900 ha, 1400 ha, 5200 m long transect, and <b>soil</b> <b>profiles).</b> Seventeen years of reclamation of a saline and waterlogged soil led to the reduction of average electrical conductivity of the soil saturated paste extract (ECe), measured at 5 soil depths (from 0 to 2 m) below the plant salt tolerance threshold and the dilution of groundwater salinity from 18. 3 to 6. 6 dS m- 1. The variation in soil salt storage (¿Mss = Mss 2006 - Mss 1989) in the vadose zone was negative, equal to about - 145 × 103 ton (˜- 50 ton ha- 1). During the same period, the salt balance (Siw–Sdw) estimated from the input dissolved salt brought by irrigation water (Siw) and output salts exported by the drainage network (Sdw) was equal to - 685 × 106 kg and the Sdw was 945 × 106 kg. Under irrigation and efficient drainage, the soil salinization could be considered as a reversible process. At the transect scale, the high clay content and the exchangeable sodium percentage was negatively correlated to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

40|$|The European Soil Database (ESDB) version 2. 0, {{released}} in 2004, is the resulting {{product of a}} collaborative project involving all countries of the European Union and {{a large part of}} the former USSR. The ESDB is the only harmonized soil database across Europe. It consists of a number of components including: the Soil Geographical Database of Eurasia (SGDBE) at scale 1 : 1, 000, 000, which is a digitized European soil map and related attributes; a PedoTransfer Rules Database (PTRDB), which is a set of attributes that have been derived using pedotransfer rules on the attributes of the SGDBE; and the <b>Soil</b> <b>Profile</b> Analytical Database of Europe (SPADBE), that contains a number of <b>observed</b> and estimated <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> for Europe. The ESDB has been used successfully in numerous applications at European scale, as documented by the European Soil Data Centre that acts as custodian of the database. The European Soil Database (ESDB) aims at providing users with a harmonized set of soil parameters for agro-meteorological and environmental modelling at regional, national, and continental level for Eurasia and North African countries. The next revision (version 3. 0) sees an extension into the Mediterranean Basin through the inclusion of data for Turkey. The development of a soil geographical database for Turkey at a scale of 1 : 1, 000, 000 under a common understanding and nomenclature allows the integration of these data into the existing ESDB. In order to comply with its structure, a number of key attributes (soil texture, parent material, WRB classification, land use) have been derived from supplementary local, regional and national soil datasets while other attributes have been obtained from auxiliary environmental datasets derived by remote sensing systems and geospatial processing techniques such as interpolation.

In this study, the hypothesis is tested that discontinuities in the <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> favour piping erosion in loess-derived soils in a temperate humid climate. Abiotic characteristics (clay content, bulk density, Ksat, penetration resis-tance) and the biological activity in the soil were measured for each soil horizon until a depth of at least 40 cm below the pipes (ca. 1. 30 m) for 12 representative <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> with different land use (pasture with and without collapsed pipes, arable land and forest).

40|$|Irrigation uniformity, efficiency, {{leaching}} fraction, {{salt and}} water ages, and evapotranspiration rate were estimated from subsoil salinity data for three cotton fields in Arizona. The estimation of these parameters {{was based on}} the assumption of steady-state water and salt flow through the crop root zone. The levels of salt concentration in the irrigation water were 21. 3, 11. 5, and 11. 6 meq/L for Fields 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Two of these fields were furrow irrigated, and the third was subsurface drip irrigated. Each field was sampled for salt concentrations to a depth of 1. 5 m at 10 - 15 sites. A total of 514 soil samples were collected. Significantly lower salt concentrations were <b>observed</b> in the <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> in Fields 1 and 2 compared to Field 3, but lower variations in the salt concentrations were observed in Field 3 compared with Fields 1 and 2. These variations in salt concentration could be due to restricted water movement within the <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> caused by stratified soil. Since a soil-water extract model indicated little or no chemical precipitation of salt within the <b>soil</b> <b>profile,</b> {{there was no need to}} correct the data for chemical effects. The calculated irrigation uniformity was highest in Field 3 and lowest in Field 1. This may be related to more accurate land leveling in field 2 than Field 1. The irrigation efficiencies were 83. 0 %, 89. 0 %, and 80. 0 % for Fields 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the ages of salt and water was 0. 98, 0. 99, and 0. 97 for Fields 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Leaching fraction was highest in Field 3 and lowest in Field 2. Mean actual ET calculated from the Blaney-Criddle method were 372, 314, and 308 mm for Fields 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Mean ET calculated from the salinity data were 1, 250, 1, 590, and 1, 140 mm for Fields 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Statistically significant correlation coefficients were, however, found between both methods of estimating ET. These values were 0. 97, 0. 86, and 0. 93 for Fields 1, 2, and 3, respectively...|$|R
40|$|During 1980, septage {{was applied}} in rates of 1120 and 1500 kg of {{nitrogen}} per hectare to three different soil textures {{in an attempt}} to determine maximum loading rates. These rates resulted in increased concentrations of nitrates in the soil water for a Hubbard loamy Sanci, Waukegan silt loam and Lester clay loam, indicating that the application rates exceeded the maximum rate that the soils could treat. The first year's results indicate that soil type, application rates and soil depth resulted in no significant difference in total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia, fecal streptococcus and fecal coliforms in the soil water samples. Nitrate concentrations, however, were significantly different between the soils, application rates and soil depths. For the Hubbard loamy sand, rainfall had a larger effect on nitrate concentrations and movement within the <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> than for the Waukegan silt loam or Lester clay 1 oam. 0 n the Waukegan silt loam and Lester clay loam there was relatively little change in the nitrate concentration in the <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> during the period when septage was applied twice a week. After the design loading had been applied to the soil and no further applications made, a sharp increase in nitrate concentrations was <b>observed</b> in the <b>soil</b> <b>profile.</b> This probably resulted from changing the anaerobic surface layer to an aerobic condition resulting in nitrification and subsequent movement of nitrates through the profile following a rainfall event. With no additional septage application, the second year's data indicate a significant difference in nitrate-N between soils, application rates, and depths. Generally, the nitrate concentrations in the Hubbard loamy sand and Waukegan silt loam were less than the first year, but the concentrations in the Lester clay loam were higher than the first year. This indicates that nitrification and nitrate movement in the Lester clay loam are slower than the other two soils. Application resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} concentration of soil water calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium during the first year of the study. However, there was no increase in the phosphorus content of the soil water. Water Resources Research Cente...|$|R

Collection of <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> data can be time consuming and expensive but the data are essential inputs for grazing system simulations and the simulations, in turn, provide us with unprecedented capability to explore grazing systems management. Soils are often not uniform and a practical method is needed for sampling paddocks to obtain representative soil samples suitable for measurement of the hydraulic properties (drained upper limit (field capacity), drained lower limit (wilting point) and saturated hydraulic conductivity) and physical properties (bulk density, texture and depth) of each <b>soil</b> <b>profile.</b> A guiding principle for soil sampling is to always consider how the GrassGro will use the information and the depth to which roots are found in the <b>soil</b> <b>profile.</b> What purpose does a <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> serve in a GrassGro simulation?

40|$|The HC 27 <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> {{database}} {{consists of}} generic <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> developed by John Dimes and Jawoo Koo. The 27 <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> were generated based on three criteria that crop models are most responsive to: texture, rooting depth (proxy of water availability), and {{organic carbon content}} (proxy of fertility). Three levels for each category were classified using the boundary conditions based on the meta-analysis of WISE 1. 1 <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> measured at crop land areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. There are multiple ways to utilize these generic <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> in crop modeling applications, especially when soil measurement data is not available for the study site. For example, (1) users can choose the one that best matches the soil typically found {{in the study area}} by following the decision tree of three multiple-choice questions {{and use it as a}} starting point, or (2) users can run models with all 27 <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> for a given study site to create a possible range of simulation results, which can be narrowed down later as more site-specific information becomes available. These generic <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> does not replace existing soil mapping efforts nor site-specific soil measurements. Instead this approach addresses the need for a set of reasonably representative and prototypical <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> in certain types of crop modeling applications (e. g., global-scale modeling studies). Due to the nature of being "generic," there will be applications for which the use of HC 27 is not desirable, especially where detailed soil property dynamics beyond the three criteria are emphasized.
