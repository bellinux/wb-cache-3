500|$|After a crazy New Year's Eve, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{realizes that}} {{while under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol, he left a message <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>answering</b> machine of Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), his high school sweetheart. He and NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) immediately travel to Massachusetts and break into Nancy's home while she is on vacation, hoping to erase the message. While Kenneth fumbles with the computer, Jack examines the house and finds evidence that Nancy's marriage is reaching its end. They eventually play the message, after Jack finds the voicemail code, in which Jack reminisces about their times in high school German class. In that class, [...] Jack had the name [...] "Klaus" [...] and Nancy had the name [...] "Greta"—and Jack says that he took the class to be with her. Jack decides not to erase the message, but Kenneth does so anyway. When they return to New York, Kenneth realizes that Nancy's voicemail code (55287) stands for [...] "Klaus", which means that Nancy does have feelings for Jack.|$|E
2500|$|Marzipan's Answering Machine is {{a series}} of {{cartoons}} with almost no animation. It features messages from the other characters, being played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>answering</b> machine belonging to the character Marzipan. In early episodes, the episode number ended in [...]0 (for example, Marzipan's Answering Machine Version 5.0), but since Marzipan changed to a new answering machine, the number ends in [...]2 (for example, Marzipan's Answering Machine Version 15.2). In every episode, Strong Bad prank calls Marzipan, badly pretending to be someone else, such as [...] "Detective Everybody", [...] "Safety Dan", and sometimes other characters. Although the animation is usually just a picture of the answering machine, sometimes there are short animated segments featuring the characters. As of April 1, 2016, there are 17 Marzipan's Answering Machines.|$|E

60|$|The laymen of the Church {{have here}} a {{question}} before them, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>answering</b> of which, as I still think, many others attend. If the Established Church could throw off its lethargy, {{and give the}} Dissenters some speaking token of its zeal for union, I still think that union, to some extent, would be the result. There is a motion tabled (as I suppose all know) for the next meeting of the General Assembly; but something more than motions must be tabled, and something more must be given than votes. It lies practically with the laymen, by a new endowment scheme, to put the Church right with the world in two ways, so that those who left it {{more than thirty years}} ago, and who may now be willing to return, shall lose neither in money nor in ecclesiastical status. At the outside, what will they have to do? They will have to do for (say) ten years what the laymen of the Free Church have done cheerfully ever since 1843.|$|E
