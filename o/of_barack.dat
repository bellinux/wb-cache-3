5|$|Backspacer is {{the ninth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on September 20, 2009. The bandmembers started writing instrumental and demo tracks in 2007, and got together in 2008 {{to work on}} an album.

The music on the album—the shortest of the band's career—features a sound influenced by pop and new wave. The lyrics have a more optimistic look than {{the ones in the}} politic-infused predecessors Riot Act and Pearl Jam, something frontman Eddie Vedder attributed to the election <b>of</b> <b>Barack</b> Obama.|$|E
