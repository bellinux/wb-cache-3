The Agulhas Ridge parallels the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone, {{one of the major}} transform zones of the world. The morphology of the ridge changes dramatically from two parallel segments in the southwest, to the broad plateau-like Agulhas Ridge in the northeast. Because the crustal fabric of the ridge is unknown relating its evolution to hotspots in the southeast Atlantic is an open question. During the RV Polarstern cruise ANT-XXIII- 5 seismic reflection and refraction data were collected along a 370 km long profile with 8 Ocean Bottom Stations to investigate its crustal fabric. The profile extends in NNE direction from the Agulhas Basin, 60 km south of the Agulhas Ridge, and continues into the Cape Basin crossing the southernmost of the Cape Rise seamounts.

The continent–ocean transition (COT) is placed in the interval 207 – 255 km, between unequivocal <b>oceanic</b> <b>crust</b> and the foot of the westernmost fault in the Hornsund Fault Zone. It is not possible to conclude whether this interval is <b>oceanic</b> <b>crust</b> or thinned and intruded continental crust, but we favor the latter interpretation, at least for the eastern part of the COT.

Here the sedimentary rocks have high velocities and are interpreted to be mainly of Mesozoic and Late Paleozoic age. In this interval Moho depths increase abruptly from 15 km in the west to 27 km in the east. Crystalline basement velocities are observed close to the seafloor east of the Knølegga Fault. We suggest that continental breakup north of Greenland–Senja Fracture Zone occurred around 33 Ma, after a period of pull-apart tectonics.
