50|$|Copper {{and copper}} alloys such as brass {{have been found}} to be toxic to {{bacteria}} via the <b>oligodynamic</b> effect. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but common to other heavy metals. Viruses are less susceptible to this effect than bacteria. Associated applications include the use of brass doorknobs in hospitals, which {{have been found to}} self-disinfect after eight hours, and mineral sanitizers, in which copper can act as an algicide. Overuse of copper sulfate as an algicide has been speculated to have caused a copper poisoning epidemic on Great Palm Island in 1979.|$|E

50|$|While silver is {{potentially}} toxic to humans at high doses, {{the risk of}} serious harm from low doses, given over a short term, is slight. Treatment of external infections is considered safe; oral use of colloidal silver is safe for short term administration if the dose is low. Silver is used in some medical appliances because of its anti-microbial nature, which stems from the <b>oligodynamic</b> effect. Chronic ingestion or inhalation of silver preparations (especially colloidal silver) can lead to argyria in the skin and other organs. This is not life-threatening, but is considered by most to be cosmetically undesirable.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{concern is}} the fact that door handles are {{instrumental}} in the spread of many infections. [...] However, some materials, e.g. brass, copper and silver, are slowly poisonous to many germs. The exact mechanism is not known, but is commonly thought to be via the <b>oligodynamic</b> effect, perhaps by some other electrostatic effect. [...] Brass and copper, for example, disinfect themselves of many door handle bacteria within eight hours. Other materials such as glass, porcelain, stainless steel and aluminium do not have this effect. Self-disinfecting door handles are particularly important in hospitals, but useful in any building.|$|E
50|$|Varaka is {{mentioned}} in several ancient Sanskrit documents, particularly in Ayurvedic and medical literature. Varaka means cloth, cloak or {{a thing that}} covers something else. The word varaka {{is mentioned}} with swarna (gold), tara (silver) or rupera (silver) in these documents; the discussion is in three forms of these precious metals: patra (leaf), varaka (thin foil) and bhasma (ash). Ayurvedic documents consider silver as an antimicrobial astringent, while gold is claimed to be an aphrodisiac. This {{is not unique to}} Indian subcontinent; in Europe, edible gold (Aureum potabile) and silver were also claimed to have medicinal properties; later studies found that they can indeed be antibacterial owing to <b>Oligodynamic</b> effect.|$|E
5000|$|Silver {{and most}} silver {{compounds}} have an <b>oligodynamic</b> effect and are toxic for bacteria, algae, and fungi in vitro. The antibacterial action of silver {{is dependent on}} the silver ion. The effectiveness of silver compounds as an antiseptic is based on the ability of the biologically active silver ion (...) to irreversibly damage key enzyme systems in the cell membranes of pathogens. The antibacterial action of silver has long been known to be enhanced by the presence of an electric field. Applying an electric current across silver electrodes enhances antibiotic action at the anode, likely due to the release of silver into the bacterial culture. The antibacterial action of electrodes coated with silver nanostructures is greatly improved in the presence of an electric field.|$|E
50|$|Health {{concerns}} surrounding brass {{stem from}} lead contamination. Lead is sometimes added {{to enhance the}} machinability of brass. It is often present in concentrations around 2%. Thirteen key manufacturers were sued by the California state attorney general on October 1999. Lab tests revealed the average brass key contained more than the acceptable limit of lead. They were required to reduce the lead content to 1.5% after April 2001. By January 1, 2010, the California law states that brass containing less than 0.25% lead must be used for each component that comes {{into contact with the}} wetted surface of pipes, plumbing fittings and fixtures. On the other hand, the copper in brass does create a natural germicidal or <b>oligodynamic</b> effect. Brass doorknobs will virtually disinfect themselves within eight hours.|$|E
5000|$|Mineral {{technology}} {{takes advantage}} of the cleansing and filtering qualities of commonly occurring substances. Silver and copper are well-known <b>oligodynamic</b> substances that are effective in destroying pathogens. Silver {{has been shown to be}} effective against harmful bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. Copper is widely used as an algicide. Alumina, derived from aluminates, filters detrimental materials at the molecular level, and can be used to control the delivery rate of desirable metals such as copper. Working through the pool or spa filtration system, mineral sanitizers use combinations of these minerals to inhibit algae growth and eliminate contaminants. [...] Unlike chlorine or bromine, metals and minerals do not evaporate, and do not degrade. Minerals can make the water noticeably softer, and by replacing harsh chemicals in the water they lower the potential for red-eye, dry skin and foul odors.|$|E
50|$|The medical uses {{of silver}} and silver ions have been known for some time; its use {{can be traced to}} the Phoenicians, who would store their water, wine, and vinegar in silver bottles to keep them from spoiling. There has been renewed {{interest}} in silver coatings for antimicrobial purposes. The antimicrobial property of silver is known as an <b>oligodynamic</b> effect, a process in which metal ions interfere with the growth and function of bacteria. Several in vitro studies have confirmed the effectiveness of silver at preventing infection, both in coating form and as nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer matrix. However, concerns remain over the use of silver in vivo. Considering the mechanism by which silver interferes with bacterial cell function, some fear that silver may have a similarly toxic effect on human tissue. For this reason, there has been limited use of silver coatings in vivo. Despite this, silver coatings are commonly used on devices such as catheters.|$|E
50|$|The {{anti-microbial}} {{properties of}} metal surfaces are of high interest to water sanitation. The metals produce an <b>oligodynamic</b> effect due to oxide formation and subsequent ion formation, making them biocidically active. This prevents contaminants from {{adhering to the}} surface. Coliform bacteria and E.coli content on metal surfaces {{have been shown to}} substantially decrease with time, indicating the ability of these surfaces to prevent biofouling and thus promote sanitation. Of these metal surfaces, copper and zinc {{have been found to be}} most effective.Polyurethane, polyethylene glycol, and other polymers have been shown to reduce external bacterial adhesion, which elicits applications of anti-microbial substances to the polymer and coatings industry. Sustainable alternatives like topographically modified cellulose are also of high interest due to recyclability and low cost. Surfaces that are superhydrophobic are desirable for non-fouling behavior because an affinity for water correlates to an affinity for contaminants. Superhydrophobic xerogels made from silica colloids have been shown to reduce bacterial adhesion, specifically S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The non-fouling applications of these polymers and superhydrophobic coatings is of substantial importance to the field of medical devices.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally certain metal pots {{are used}} to store {{drinking}} water {{in order to ensure}} safety. A study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effect of <b>oligodynamic</b> metals such as copper, silver and brass against enteric gram negative drinking water isolates such as Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella spp., E. coli (MDR), E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and Klebsiella spp. in Kathmandu. The study was conducted at the microbiology laboratory of National College, Kathmandu during September 2007 to January 2008. The test was carried out by preparing broth of the respective microorganisms followed with contaminating autoclaved distilled water with 1 % (by volume) of the prepared broth culture and incubating the contaminated water in the respective metal pots up to 48 h (holding time). Reduction in the microbial load was assessed by pour plating the water content in the metal pots on Nutrient agar medium in every 0, 4 th, 8 th, 12 th, 24 th and 48 th h of incubation (holding time). Among three test pots, copper pot showed the maximum bactericidal action compared to silver and brass pots towards most of the enteric gram negative bacterial isolates of water. Complete inhibition of tested organism was recorded within 4 to 48 hours of holding time. This study suggested the promotion of use of water pots made of <b>oligodynamic</b> metals such as silver and copper, and alloy such as brass to control the gram negative enteric pathogens in drinking water.

40|$|A {{new type}} of silver {{nanoparticles}} containing coating based on inorganic-organic hybrid materials has been developed by the sol-gel technique to achieve antimicrobic properties. The formation of an inactive biofilm layer, which can block the antimicrobic effect, was reduced by decreasing the surface-free energy of the coating. Ag+ ions as effective <b>oligodynamic</b> components are generated by Ag nanoparticles with a size between 5 - 10 nm. The Ag nanoparticles are produced during the drying and curing process. The investigation of the long-time release behavior of Ag+ ions show that the coating has <b>oligodynamic</b> properties for at least several month. The antimicrobic effect of the coating has been proved by inoculation with Gram negative bacterium E. coli. A low surface-free energy of about 19, 5 mN/m could be achieved by using side chain perfluorinated organo alkoxy silanes, which upconcentrate at the coating surface by thermodynamical reasons. Compared with uncoated samples the low surface-free energy of the coating lead to a reduction of biofilm adhesion of about 95 %...|$|E
40|$|This {{retrospective}} study of silver-based therapeutics briefly reviews their history, and then explores the modern application of charged silver particles, especially as an antiviral agent. The recent outbreak of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) suggests this is timely. Medical literature {{shows that a}} variety of viruses have been successfully treated with silver-based drugs. However, ‘silver salts ’ and/or inferior silver preparations lack the bio-availability, active silver content and safety needed to be effective. State-of-the-art, electrolytically produced ‘oligodynamic ’ Ag 1, however, offers distinct advantages and versatility of use over older and cruder formulations. Possessing much smaller, subnanometer-sized particles, greater electrical potential and lower concentrations, it is more bio-available than other formulations. Efficacy against the SARS-related coronavirus, for example, may be enhanced when nebulized Ag 1 is inhaled. This should achieve swift reduction of viral loads, especially in the early stages. Moreover, there is no known toxicity for <b>Oligodynamic</b> Ag 1 in humans. The only known mechanism of resistance also appears to play no role notwithstanding the mutability of the coronavirus. Therefore no functional barrier to the virotoxic effects of <b>oligodynamic</b> Ag 1 may be expected regardless of the rapidity or variety of mutations...|$|E

40|$|Tentamos verificar, em algumas experiências, a ação oligodinâmica da prata sôbre os vírus da coriomeningite linfocitária benigna, amostra WE, da poliomielite, amostra MEF 1, e da vacina, amostra do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, como o haviamos feito com o vírus da gripe, amostras PR 8 e DL/Rio. Nas provas usamos recipientes de barro, recobertos de fina camada de prata na parede interna, ou aquêles em que a prata, sob a forma de pó se misturava ao próprio barro. Esses recipientes são denominados, no comércio, moringas esterilizantes. Colocou-se, no seu interior, a emulsão a 10 % do tecido {{cerebral}} contendo o vírus da coriomeningite linfocitária ou da poliomielite, verificando-se o seu poder patogênico para camundongos, em intervalos regulares, pela injeção intracerebral de 0, 03 ml do material. Os resultados, que podem ser vistos nos Quadros 1 e 2, indicam que aquêles virus resistem à ação oligodinâmica da prata. No caso do vírus da vacina, a diluição foi colocada, da mesma maneira, nos referidos recipientes. O vírus apresentou, também, completa resistência, conforme se vê nas figuras de 1, 2 e 3. Experiências testemunhas feitas com Micrococcus pyogenes e Escherichia coli, cujas suspensões foram igualmente colocadas nas moringas esterilizantes, revelaram que as bactérias não sobreviviam além de 20 horas. Frizamos, na publicação sôbre vírus da gripe, que o referido fenômeno é importante porque sabemos que o efieto oligodinâmico se observa sôbre microorganismos como bactérias, protozoários e outros seres vivos, alterando as suas propriedades ou matando-os sendo, portanto, interessante sob o ponto de vista biológico. O fenômeno pode ainda ser aplicado para o isolamento de vírus, quando em contaminação com bactérias. We {{have tried}} to verify, in some experiments, the silver <b>oligodynamic</b> action upon the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, WE strain the poliomyelitis virus, MEF 1 strain, and the vaccinia virus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz strain, as we have done with the influenza virus, PR 8 strain and DL/Rio strain. In the tests we used clay pitchers covered in the inner surface with {{a thin layer of}} silver of with powdered silver mixed with the clay material. The 10 per cent infectious cerebral emulsion of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or of the poliomyelitis virus were put into the pitcher and the pathogenic power for mice verified, at regular intervals, by the intracerebral injection of 0, 03 ml. The results expressed in the tables 1 and 2 indicates that those viruses resist the silver <b>oligodynamic</b> action. In the case of the vaccinia virus, the dilution was put into the pitcher in the same way. The virus presented, too, complete resistence, as we can see in the figures 1, 2 and 3. Control experiments made with Micrococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli, put into the pitchers with silver, showed that the bacteriae were dead after 20 hours. As we emphasized in the paper about the influenza viruses, the reported phenomenon is important because we know that the <b>oligodynamic</b> effect is observed upon microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa and other living beeings altering its properties or killing them and, therefore, intersting from the biological point of view.
