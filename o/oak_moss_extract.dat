40|$|BackgroundOak <b>moss</b> absolute, an <b>extract</b> {{from the}} lichen Evernia prunastri, is a valued perfume {{ingredient}} but contains extreme allergens. ObjectivesTo compare the elicitation properties of two preparations of <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute: classic <b>oak</b> moss', the historically used preparation, and new oak moss', with reduced {{contents of the}} major allergens atranol and chloroatranol. Patients/materials/methodsThe two preparations were compared in randomized double-blinded repeated open application tests and serial dilution patch tests in 30 oak moss-sensitive volunteers and 30 non-allergic control subjects. ResultsIn both test models, new <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> elicited significantly less allergic contact dermatitis in oak moss-sensitive subjects than classic <b>oak</b> <b>moss.</b> The control subjects did not react to either of the preparations. ConclusionsNew <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> is still a fragrance allergen, but elicits less allergic contact dermatitis in previously oak moss-sensitized individuals, suggesting that new <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> is less allergenic to non-sensitized individuals...|$|R
40|$|Atranol and chloroatranol {{are strong}} contact allergens in <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute, a lichen extract used in perfumery. Fifteen {{subjects}} with contact allergy to <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute underwent a repeated open application test (ROAT) using solutions of an untreated <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute (sample A) and an <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute with reduced content of atranol and chloroatranol (sample B). All subjects were in addition patch-tested with serial dilutions of samples A and B. Statistically significantly more subjects reacted to sample A than to sample B in the patch tests. No corresponding difference {{was observed in}} the ROAT, {{though there was a}} significant difference in the time required to elicit a positive reaction. Still, the ROAT indicates that the use of a cosmetic product containing <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute with reduced levels of atranol and chloroatranol is capable of eliciting an allergic reaction in previously sensitised individuals...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to pure synthetic fragrance materials several natural extracts {{are still in}} use in the perfume industry. Among them <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute, prepared from the lichen Evernia prunastri (L.) Arch., is considered a major contact sensitizer and is therefore included in the fragrance mix used for diagnosing perfume allergy. The process of preparing <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute has changed during recent years and, even though several potential sensitizers have been identified from former benzene extracts, its present constituents and their allergenic status are not clear. In the study reported here, we applied a method developed for the identification of contact allergens present in natural complex mixtures to <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute. The method {{is based on the}} combination of bioassay-guided chemical fractionation, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and structure-activity relationship studies. Our first results showed that atranol and chloroatranol, formed by transesterification and decarboxylation of the lichen depsides, atranorin and chloroatranorin, during the preparation of <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute, are strong elicitants in most patients sensitized to <b>oak</b> <b>moss.</b> Methyl-beta-orcinol carboxylate, a depside degradation product and the most important monoaryl derivative of <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> from an olfactory standpoint, was also found to elicit a reaction in most patients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Chloroatranol and atranol are {{degradation}} products of chloroatranorin and atranorin, respectively, and {{have recently been}} identified as important contact allergens in the natural fragrance <b>extract,</b> <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute. <b>Oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute is widely used in perfumery and {{is the cause of}} many cases of fragrance allergic contact dermatitis. Chloroatranol elicits reactions at very low levels of exposure. In <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute, chloroatranol and atranol are present together and both may contribute to the allergenicity and eliciting capacity of the natural extract. In this study, 10 eczema patients with known sensitization to chloroatranol and <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute were tested simultaneously to a serial dilution of chloroatranol and atranol in ethanol, in equimolar concentrations (0. 0034 - 1072 mu M). Dose-response curves were estimated and analysed by logistic regression. The estimated difference in elicitation potency of chloroatranol relative to atranol based on testing with equimolar concentrations was 217 % (95 % confidence interval 116 - 409 %). Both substances elicited reactions at very low levels of exposure. It is concluded that the differences in elicitation capacity between the 2 substances are counterbalanced by exposure being greater to atranol than to chloroatranol and that both substances contribute to the clinical problems seen in <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute-sensitized individuals...|$|R

40|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>moss</b> {{absolute}} is a long-known, popular {{natural extract}} {{widely used in}} perfumes. It is reported {{as the cause of}} allergic reactions in a significant number of those with perfume allergy. <b>Oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute has been the target of recent research to identify its allergenic components. Recently, chloroatranol, a hitherto unknown fragrance allergen, was identified in <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute. The objective was to assess the clinical importance of chloroatranol as a fragrance allergen by characterizing its elicitation profile. 13 patients previously showing a positive patch test to <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> absolute and chloroatranol were included, together with a control group of 10 patients without sensitization to either of the 2 materials. A serial dilution patch test was performed on the upper back with concentrations ranging from 200 to 0. 0063 p. p. m. of chloroatranol in ethanol. Simultaneously, the participant performed an open test simulating the use of perfumes on the volar aspect of the forearms in a randomized and double-blinded design. A solution with 5 p. p. m. chloroatranol was used for 14 days, and, in case of no reaction, the applications were continued for another 14 days with a solution containing 25 p. p. m. All test subjects (13 / 13) developed an allergic reaction at the site of application of the solution containing chloroatranol. Among them, 12 / 13 (92 %) gave a positive reaction to the 5 p. p. m. solution and 1 to 25 p. p. m. None of the controls reacted (P < 0. 001). The use test was terminated at median day 4. The dose eliciting a reaction in 50 % of the test subjects at patch testing was 0. 2 p. p. m. In conclusion, the hidden exposure to a potent allergen widely used in perfumes has caused a highly sensitized cohort of individuals. Judged from the elicitation profile, chloroatranol is the most potent allergen present in consumer products today...|$|R

2500|$|In Blumenthal's view, {{experiments}} such {{as these}} show that our appreciation of food is subjective, determined by information sent by the senses to the brain: [...] "the {{ways in which we}} make sense of what we are eating and decide {{whether we like it or}} not depend to a large extent on memory and contrast. Memory provides us with a range of references – flavours, tastes, smells, sights, sounds, emotions – that we draw on continually as we eat." [...] His dishes, therefore, tend to be designed to appeal to the senses in concert, and through this to trigger memories, associations and emotions. Thus the Nitro-poached Green Tea and Lime Mousse on the Fat Duck menu is served with spritz of ‘lime grove’ scent from an atomiser; and the Jelly of Quail dish includes among its tableware a bed of <b>oak</b> <b>moss,</b> as well as being accompanied by a specially created scent of <b>oak</b> <b>moss</b> that is dispersed at the table by means of dry ice.|$|R

Between those 509 patients, 157 were patch tested with eight individual substances contained in the fragrance mix: cinnamal, cinnamyl alcohol, eugenol, isoeugenol, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, alpha-amyl cinnamal and Evernia prunastri (<b>oak</b> <b>moss).</b> The most frequent allergens were isoeugenol 57. 9 % (91 / 157), eugenol 55. 4 % (87 / 157), cinnamyl alcohol 34. 4 % (54 / 157) and Evernia prunastri (<b>oak</b> <b>moss)</b> 24. 2 % (38 / 157). There were 62 patients (39. 5 %) who exhibited an allergic reaction to both the fragrance mix and Myroxylon pereirae (balsam of Peru).

40|$|Walt Whitman 2 ̆ 7 s twelve-poem 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss</b> 2 ̆ 2 sequence, {{composed}} {{in the late}} 1850 s then broken up and dispersed by the poet among thirty-three other poems for the 2 ̆ 2 Calamus 2 ̆ 2 cluster of the third (1860) edition of Leaves of Grass, was first printed in 1953 by Fredson Bowers and is now available in several literature anthologies and collections of Whitman 2 ̆ 7 s writings. [1] Apparently inspired by a failed same-sex attachment and its psychological aftermath, 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss</b> 2 ̆ 2 was neglected for forty years after Bowers reassembled the sequence from Whitman 2 ̆ 7 s surviving manuscripts for the 1860 Leaves. But it {{became the subject of}} critical and editorial controversy in the 1990 s, when Alan Helms printed the sequence from the revised 2 ̆ 2 Calamus 2 ̆ 2 versions of the twelve poems and Hershel Parker reprinted Bowers 2 ̆ 7 s edition from the manuscript, with both proponents defending their versions in the journal Nineteenth-Century Literature. [2] In that exchange, Parker 2 ̆ 7 s argument for the manuscript version prevailed, and Bowers 2 ̆ 7 s editorial approach has since become the standard model for reprintings—most recently Betsy Erkkila 2 ̆ 7 s version of the poems alongside photo-facsimile reproductions of the manuscript leaves (see note 1). Yet Erkkila 2 ̆ 7 s unqualified reference to the leaves as 2 ̆ 2 clean and elegantly handwritten 2 ̆ 2 (xii) typifies an ongoing failure by editors adequately to consider the state of the 2 ̆ 2 Live Oak 2 ̆ 2 manuscript. Whereas his initial inscription of this work can indeed be described as clean and elegant, Whitman 2 ̆ 7 s clear and present revisions to the leaves raise significant questions about the form of the sequence and his evolving intentions for its twelve poems. As I will demonstrate in this essay, Bowers 2 ̆ 7 s editorial focus on the final versions of the sundered manuscripts was not well suited for 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss,</b> 2 ̆ 2 and it resulted in his incorporation of changes that Whitman made to the poems after breaking the sequence apart. Along with detailing the transmission of the sequence in manuscript, this essay concludes with an edition of 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss</b> 2 ̆ 2 that restores the sequence to its original, integrated state.

Whitman composed the 12 -poem 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss</b> 2 ̆ 2 sequence in the late 1850 s, apparently {{in response to a}} failed same-sex attachment, and not with the intent to publish it. Yet that act of private commemoration prompted a major creative impulse that produced the 45 -poem 2 ̆ 2 Calamus 2 ̆ 2 cluster, thematically devoted to male comradeship, and his combination of old and new poems that would make up 2 ̆ 2 Children of Adam 2 ̆ 2 (originally 2 ̆ 2 Enfans d 2 ̆ 7 Adam), devoted to sex, procreation, and love of men for women. Whereas both of the larger clusters were printed in the third (1860) edition of Leaves of Grass, 2 ̆ 2 Live <b>Oak,</b> with <b>Moss</b> 2 ̆ 2 was never published intact by Whitman, who instead dispersed and shuffled its 12 poems among the 33 other poems of 2 ̆ 2 Calamus, 2 ̆ 2 eliminating its narrative of love, loss, and resolution. In dismantling the shorter sequence Whitman canceled the most complex and moving account of love and heartache that had yet emerged within American literature.
