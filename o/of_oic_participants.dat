Agonism at peripherally located opioid receptors, however, leads to opioid-induced constipation (<b>OIC),</b> one <b>of</b> the most frequent and debilitating side effects of prolonged opioid use.

Until recently, PAMORAs were restricted to subcutaneous route or to narrow patient populations.

Studies have suggested its efficacy in patients failing traditional constipation treatments; however, insufficient evidence exists to establish its role in primary prevention <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> at this time.

H 577 P LMS 2016 Yangxv, 185 pages :illustrationsThis {{research}} employs two perspectives (i. e. {{continuous process}} improvement perspective and frontline employee perspective) {{to develop a}} new approach, operational improvement competence (OIC), and explores new, useful, empirically-based insights into the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in improving operational, service recovery and new service development performance. OIC is conceptualized as an operational team's ability to use a process perspective and structured methods to continuously improve operational activities and comprises three operational practices 1) continuous improvement; 2) process management; and 3) structured methods. However, the operational environment of service firms is often more dynamic and challenging than that of manufacturing firms so that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in service operations may be affected by certain characteristics concerning service processes, employee characteristics and contextual factors. To offer useful insights into the challenges <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> adoption in service operations, we conduct three empirical studies as follows: Study 1, guided by the operations management (OM) literature and agency theory, proposes that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in operational performance in service operations is contingent on two factors, namely operations control and process control formality. Specifically, we theorize that operations control enhances the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> by suppressing frontline service employees' discretion in service processes and guiding them to follow proper procedures to perform OIC activities. In addition, when there are high levels of ethical risks, operations control will become particularly important. Study 2 examines the impact <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> on new service development (NSD) performance. Since creative ideas are crucial to NSD and it is common that service firms involve frontline employees in the process of NSD, we argue that frontline employees' creativity enhances NSD performance. In addition, since OIC pertains to making changes and solving problems regularly, we argue that OIC has a positive impact on employee creativity. Furthermore, we draw on the contingency theory to argue that the relationships between OIC, employee creativity, and NSD performance are contingent on team's characteristics and contextual environment. Study 3 argues that OIC leads to improved service recovery performance. However, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in enhancing service recovery performance can be hindered by one common problem in service employees, namely stress. We draw on the role stress theory and the conservation of resources theory to argue that the negative impact of stress can be alleviated by job resources, including organization inducement and psychological resilience. Thus, we propose that frontline employees' stress and two types of job resources (i. e. organization inducement and psychological resilience) can moderate the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in improving service recovery performance. Based on data from 146 frontline teams in the banking industry of China, we empirically test the posited hypotheses of these three studies. The main contribution of this research lies in its consideration on the job characteristics of frontline service employees and use of several relevant theories to ascertain the intricacies between OIC and performance outcomes with respect to operational performance, service recovery performance and NSD performance.

40|$|Although opioids offer potent {{analgesia}} {{for severe}} acute and chronic noncancer pain, adverse gastrointestinal effects potentially undermine their clinical utility. In particular, between 40 % and 95 % of patients develop opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Therefore, {{there is a}} consensus that patients should commence laxatives {{at the start of}} opioid therapy and continue throughout treatment. Nevertheless, laxatives are not routinely coprescribed with opioids. Even when concurrent laxatives are prescribed, approximately half the patients treated for OIC do not achieve the desired improvement. Moreover, laxatives do not target the underlying cause <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> (opioid binding to the μ-receptors in the enteric system) and as such are not very effective at managing <b>OIC.</b> The failure <b>of</b> lifestyle modification and laxatives to treat adequately many cases <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> led to the concurrent use of peripherally acting opioid antagonists (such as methylnaltrexone bromide and naloxone) to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events without compromising analgesia. Judicious use of the various options to manage OIC should allow more patients to benefit from opioid analgesia. Therefore, this paper reviews the causes, consequences, and management <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> to help clinicians optimise opioid analgesia...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} separation {{distances between}} odour sources and residential areas to avoid odour nuisance and complaints by the residents, odour impact criteria OIC {{have to be}} adopted by the responsible authorities. There is a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> used for this purpose, which differ by the odour concentration threshold (between 0. 12 ouE m- 3 and 10 ouE m- 3), the averaging period (hourly or instantaneous) and by the tolerated exceedance probability of the adopted threshold (between 0. 1 % and about 35 % of the time). There are two groups <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> used in various jurisdictions: the first one with a low odour concentration threshold and a high tolerated exceedance probability (e. g.

Proponents <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> interpret this supposed implication in several ways. Some argue that the implication in question is a logical one, namely, entailment. Some think that the relation between ‘ought’ and ‘can’ is a relation of presupposition. Still others argue that ‘ought’ conversationally implicates ‘can’. Opponents <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> {{offer a variety of}} counterexamples in an attempt to show that there are cases in which an agent ought to perform a certain action even though she cannot perform that action. Such counterexamples often involve either culpable or nonculpable inability. In cases of culpable inability, the agent renders herself unable to fulfill an obligation. For example, a student is unable to submit a paper on the due date because she procrastinated until it became too late to write a paper by the assigned deadline. In cases of non-culpable inability, the agent somehow becomes unable to fulfill an obligation, through no fault of her own. For example, an agent becomes unable to pay back a loan to a bank because she was robbed {{on her way to the}} bank. This paper attempts to offer counterexamples to <b>OIC</b> <b>of</b> a sort different from the one discussed by opponents <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> so far.
