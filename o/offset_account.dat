40|$|Abstract — Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier (UFMC) {{is a novel}} multi-carrier {{modulation}} technique which {{can be seen as}} a generalization of filtered OFDM and filter bank based multi-carrier (FBMC-FMT). Being a candidate waveform technology for 5 G wireless systems, it combines the simplicity of OFDM with the advantages of FBMC. The FIR-filter, used in UFMC to filter a group of subcarriers, is a key design parameter to gain more robustness in relaxed synchronization conditions, i. e. time-frequency misalignment. It was shown in previous work that very significant SIR improvement can be achieved for UFMC by optimizing the FIR-filter, taking carrier frequency <b>offset</b> into <b>account.</b> In this paper, we optimize the FIR-filter design in UFMC by taking both carrier frequency and timing <b>offset</b> into <b>account</b> in an uplink multi-user FDMA scenario. From the simulation results, up to 3. 6 dB SIR improvement can be achieved with the optimized FIR filter compared to UFMC with non-optimized Dolph-Chebyshev filter and 15. 1 dB SIR gain against classical CP-OFDM system respectively, provided that the normalized carrier frequency and timing offset are uniformly distributed in the interval ± 5 %.

Assessing the carbon offsets associated with urban trees relative to other climate change policies is vital for sustainable development, planning, and solving environmental and socio-economic problems, but is difficult in developing countries. We estimated and assessed carbon dioxide (CO 2) storage, sequestration, and emission offsets by public trees in the Medellin Metropolitan Area, Colombia, as a viable Nature-Based Solution for the Neotropics. While previous studies have discussed nature-based solutions and explored urban tree carbon dynamics in high income countries, few have been conducted in tropical cities in low-middle income countries, particularly within South America. We used a public tree inventory for the Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley and an available urban forest functional model, i-Tree Streets, calibrated for Colombia’s context.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Poster SessionsSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopOffset or industrial participation is a practice that is part of many large international transactions. In the event of a large international transaction involving the purchase of a product (e. g. : equipment or services), the company selling the product, is typically required to compensate the purchasing country for a perceived loss to the economy of the purchasing country. This compensation is called offset. Other terms for offset include industrial participation or industrial cooperation, and there are others. Offset is a legal or formal requirement for many large sales by companies to most foreign governments. Exceptions include the United States and Japan which have other methods of getting the compensation for perceived loss to their economies. Over the past 25 years, the number of countries practicing offset in international sales have increased tenfold to over 150 countries. As estimated by offset associations (i. e. : GOCA, DMA, etc.) <b>offset</b> <b>accounts</b> for 10 % to 15 % of world trade, which translates to about 1 trillion dollars in world trade per year.

40|$|The {{liberalization}} {{of foreign exchange}} regulations in the Philippines starting {{in the second half}} of 1992 turned out to be a major challenge to balance of payments (BOP) compilers as the bank reporting system, which is the main source of data for the external sector accounts, is no longer able to fully capture all foreign exchange transactions. Administrative data should have compensated for the weaknesses of the bank reporting system, but the availability, frequency and timeliness of data from some data-providing agencies posed a big problem. To address some of the gaps uncovered in statistical compilation, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) introduced in the last quarter of 2000 cross border transactions surveys that aim to collect information on transactions of residents with non-residents that do not pass the banking system. These transactions include those involving intercompany or <b>offsetting</b> <b>accounts</b> with parent companies abroad and those that are settled through offshore accounts of residents. While the initial intent was to encourage the participation in the survey of all companies with cross border transactions, the BSP had to limit the respondents to a relatively small sample size that is considered to contribute an appreciable amount to the BOP. This was so because aside from being too costly to administer in terms of manpower requirements, the survey suffers from a low participation rate given the absence of a legal authority by the BSP to collect data from non-financial corporations. This paper will discuss the problems in gathering inputs for BOP compilation, the benefits and constraints in using surveys as a data source to supplement the bank reports and other existing administrative data, as well as future plans to improve the administration of the cross border transactions surveys.
