5|$|Frustrated by Parker's {{perseverance}} {{despite everything}} that's been inflicted, Osborn publicly reveals that he's alive on Halloween. During the battle that ensues between them, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker (and immediately deteriorates on death as all clones do), Parker realises {{he is actually}} the original. During this same period, Osborn may <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently prematurely induces Mary Jane's pregnancy and the stillbirth of the baby.|$|E
5|$|In 1622, several parishioners of Boxgrove, near Chichester in west Sussex, were {{prosecuted for}} playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday, 5 May. There were three {{reasons for the}} prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another {{reflected}} concern about church windows which may <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> broken; the third was that a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt! The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman {{to hit the ball}} twice and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as the incidents involving Jasper Vinall and Henry Brand were to drastically confirm.|$|E
5|$|Although William's main rivals were gone, {{he still}} faced rebellions over the {{following}} years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, {{the introduction of the}} Norman language as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of the upper classes, as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, which may <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.|$|E

5|$|Narseh {{declared}} war on Rome in 295 or 296. He appears to have first invaded western Armenia, where he seized the lands delivered to Tiridates in the peace of 287. Narseh moved south into Roman Mesopotamia in 297, where he inflicted a severe defeat on Galerius in the region between Carrhae (Harran, Turkey) and Callinicum (Raqqa, Syria) (and thus, the historian Fergus Millar notes, probably somewhere on the Balikh River). Diocletian may <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> present at the battle, but he quickly divested himself of all responsibility. In a public ceremony at Antioch, the official version of events was clear: Galerius {{was responsible for the}} defeat; Diocletian was not. Diocletian publicly humiliated Galerius, forcing him to walk for a mile {{at the head of the}} Imperial caravan, still clad in the purple robes of the Emperor.|$|E

The Belgian LBK is notable for its use of defensive walls around villages, something which may <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> necessary because of the proximity of hunter gatherers.|$|E

25|$|The Yogabhashya {{states that}} 'yoga' in the Yoga Sutras has {{the meaning of}} 'samadhi'.

This Shankara may <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the famed Vedantic scholar Adi Shankara (8th or 9th century). Scholarly opinion is still open on this issue.
