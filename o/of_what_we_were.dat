Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that it [...] "eviscerates a basic assumption: that slavery in America ended with the Civil War." [...] She praised the book's {{evidence}} as [...] "relentless and fascinating," [...] although she thought that the conceit of reconstructing Cottenham's life gives the book [...] "a shaky start". Leonard Pitts, {{a columnist for the}} Miami Herald, wrote that [...] "Slavery by Another Name is an astonishing book. It will challenge and change your understanding <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> as Americans - and of what we are. I cannot recommend it to you highly enough." ...|$|E

In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he [...] "was very keen that we thought through carefully the postwar aspects <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to do once the military campaign was over. And I think it's now very public knowledge that that was not well handled. It was not well thought through, it was not well executed. And we lived with the consequences of that." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} and tour for the album Radio-Activity, Kraftwerk {{continued}} to move {{further away from}} their earlier Krautrock style of improvised instrumental music, refining their work more into the format of melodic electronic songs. During the tour for Radio-Activity, the band began to make performance rules such {{as not to be}} drunk on stage or at parties. Karl Bartos wrote that about these rules, stating that [...] "it's not easy to turn knobs on a synthesizer if you are drunk or full of drugs. ... We always tried to keep very aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing while acting in public." [...] During this tour, early melodies that would later evolve into the song [...] "Showroom Dummies" [...] were being performed.|$|E

500|$|Through Caldwell more {{officers}} {{joined the}} protest, including two other celebrated aces, Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes and Squadron Leader John Waddy, {{as well as}} Squadron Leader Bert Grace, Squadron Leader Douglas Vanderfield, and later, Squadron Leader Stuart Harpham. During {{a series of meetings}} early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign en masse, and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, [...] "I meant to make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing, which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up." ...|$|E
500|$|Yorke {{said that}} the {{starting}} point for the record was the [...] "incredibly dense and terrifying sound" [...] of Bitches Brew, the 1970 avant-garde jazz fusion album by Miles Davis. He described the sound of Bitches Brew to Q: [...] "It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the beauty of it. It was at the core <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> trying to do with OK Computer." [...] Yorke identified [...] "I'll Wear It Proudly" [...] by Elvis Costello, [...] "Fall on Me" [...] by R.E.M., [...] "Dress" [...] by PJ Harvey and [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] by the Beatles as particularly influential on the album's songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of film soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone and the krautrock band Can, musicians Yorke described as [...] "abusing the recording process".|$|E

[...] "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] {{was based on the}} 2009 Christmas song [...] "Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas)" [...] written by SpongeBob's voice actor Tom Kenny and his writing partner Andy Paley. They wrote it as [...] "...just sort of a little sample calling card <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> thinking about." [...] The story of the song was conceived with the help of one of the episode's writers Mr. Lawrence. Kenny explained, [...] "...Eventually somebody at Nickelodeon found it [...] on their desk and decided to make it into a holiday special." [...] The network let Kenny and Paley write three more songs for the upcoming special episode (Nickelodeon eventually decided to release a soundtrack album, which became It's a SpongeBob Christmas! Album, containing the songs to coincide with the episode).|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] was {{originally}} written by Natalie Hemby and Blu Sanders in 2008. The idea of writing the song came from Hemby. She explained [...] "My friend Blu Sanders and I were together, and he goes, ‘Have you ever met Lindsay Champan?’ And I was like, ‘Nope!’ Basically he was like, ‘Why don’t we write with her? She has an absolutely gorgeous R voice.’ He was like ‘Let’s {{get together and}} see what we can develop." [...] Hemby also admitted that the song was written for Lindsay Chapman because the song's genre fit Chapman's musical direction at that time. She added, [...] "It had an Al Green-ish feel with a '70s throwback kind of vibe, and that's kind <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going for with her sound." [...] Once the collaboration was completed, the song was never recorded and Hemby said that it [...] "just kind of fell by the wayside". Being a good friend with Clarkson, Sanders decided to take the initiative to send the song with a few other songs to the singer.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] {{was written}} by Andy Gibson, Paul Jenkins and Jason Sellers. According to Sellers, they were at Jenkins' house when they started {{composing}} the song. He explained, [...] "We just {{wanted to write a}} love song. We had an idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> targeting. We didn’t write it as a duet. We wrote it, and Andy thought about recording it. After we got the song written, we played it for Jason. Jason Aldean's idea for it was to make it a duet." [...] The song is the first duet that Aldean has recorded. In an interview with Nashville.com, Aldean revealed that the song was not originally presented to him as a duet. Nevertheless, he and producer Michael Knox thought the lyrics would work for two people if he could find a female artist as a duet partner. Aldean considered a number of female vocalists to record the song with, especially Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood. However, Clarkson remained as his first choice. He explained, ...|$|E
500|$|Creator Tim Schafer {{has said}} that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, [...] "The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen years ago. I was riding a bus, {{thinking}} about a game that would be the complete opposite <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working on, The Secret of Monkey Island [...] And Brütal Legend leapt into my head. I've been hanging on to that name ever since." [...] The title, which he describes as sounding [...] "like the hardest core fantasy thing out there", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of Psychonauts (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{moved to}} Macon, Georgia by May 1, where Walden was {{establishing}} Capricorn Records. The band performed locally, {{as well as}} eighty miles north in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day. The group forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming psychedelic drugs, and hanging out in Rose Hill Cemetery, where they would write songs. Their first performances outside the South came on May 30 and 31 in Boston, opening for the Velvet Underground. In need of more material, the group remade old blues numbers like “Trouble No More” and “One Way Out”, in addition to improvised jams such as “Mountain Jam.” Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band’s sole songwriter, composing songs such as “Whipping Post" [...] and “Black-Hearted Woman.” Much of the material collected on The Allman Brothers Band was written between the period of May to August 1969 and premiered live. According to Johanson, the group gauged crowd reaction to the numbers and adjusted the songs accordingly. [...] "Before {{we went into the}} studio, we had a very clear idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all trying to do musically and that it was unique, totally different from anything else that anyone was playing," [...] said Betts. [...] "From the earliest rehearsals, we all had the same mind-set." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need to keep track <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's {{going to listen to}} it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E
