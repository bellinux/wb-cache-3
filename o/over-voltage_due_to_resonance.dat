40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple and {{effective}} method for classification of fundamental ferroresonance, single phase-to-ground and wire breakage over-voltages. In isolated neutral networks, power frequency <b>over-voltages</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> ferroresonance, single phase-to-ground and wire breakage may exist for a long time, and have very highly similar voltage features. If the improper suppression operation is applied <b>due</b> <b>to</b> incorrect identification, the accident is likely to worsen further. In this paper, the voltage and current features of these faults are analyzed, and a new effective classification criterion for fundamental ferroresonance and single phase-to-ground based on zero sequence current is proposed. A comprehensive identification method based on voltage, current and zero sequence current features is proposed, which is feasible and promising for real applications...|$|R

However, in practice, ground resistance value of substation often {{did not meet the}} required value. It can results to serious failures such as apparatus malfunction and lost of revenue. This paper presents a prototype for automatic monitoring and maintenance of those grounding system. It basically consists of a PC, Terminal Measurement Unit, Data Acquisition Unit, and Relay Board. It measures the grounding resistance and has the ability to actuate fluid sprinkler system at substation grounding system, thus improving and maintaining substation grounding system resistance to an acceptable level. This system will ultimately increase the reliability and efficiency of substation particularly when under transient <b>over-voltage</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> switching and lightning phenomena by reducing lethal ground potential rise...|$|R

Examples are provided by Thorne-Zytkov objects, hot Jupiters, protoplanets with large moons, red supergiants in binaries and globular clusters with central black hole. Instability criteria <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>resonance</b> between internal and orbital frequencies in such a systems has been derived. To achieve assumed goals, generalized planar circular restricted three body problem is investigated {{with one of the}} point masses, M, replaced with spherical body of finite size. Mechanical system under consideration includes two large masses m and M and the test body with small mass μ. Only gravitational interactions are considered. Equations of motion are presented, and linear instability criteria are derived using quantifier elimination. Motion of the test mass μ is shown <b>to</b> be unstable <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>resonance</b> between orbital and internal frequencies if M/d^ 3 < 4 / 3 πρ < M + 3 m (1 +μ/M) ^- 1 /d^ 3, where ρ is the central density of mass M, and d distance between masses m and M (circular orbit diameter). The above result is important for core-collapse supernova theory, with mass μ identified with helium core of the exploding massive star. The instability cause off-center supernova "ignition" relative to the center-of-mass of the hydrogen envelope. The instability is also inevitable during protoplanet growth, with hypothetical ejection of the rocky core from gas giants and formation of the "puffy planets" <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>resonance</b> with orbital frequency.
