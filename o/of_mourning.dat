5|$|On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death {{reached the}} King and Anne, who were overjoyed. The {{following}} day, Henry and Anne wore yellow, {{the symbol of}} joy and celebration in England, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow was the colour <b>of</b> <b>mourning,</b> in addition to black. For this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne {{may have been a}} symbol <b>of</b> <b>mourning.</b> With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but of cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.|$|E
