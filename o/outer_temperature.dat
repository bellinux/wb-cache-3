40|$|Context: Measurements of intracluster gas {{temperatures}} out {{to large}} radii {{are important for}} the use of clusters for precision cosmology and for studies of cluster physics. Previous attempts to measure robust temperatures at cluster virial radii failed. Aims: The goal of this work is to measure the temperature profile of the very relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2204 out to large radii, possibly reaching the virial radius. Methods: Taking advantage of its low particle background due to its low-Earth orbit, Suzaku data are used to measure the <b>outer</b> <b>temperature</b> profile of Abell 2204. These data are combined with Chandra and XMM-Newton data of the same cluster {{in order to make the}} connection to the inner regions, unresolved by Suzaku, and to determine the smearing due to Suzaku's PSF. Results: The temperature profile of Abell 2204 is determined from 10 kpc to 1800 kpc, close to an estimate of r 200 (the approximation to the virial radius). The temperature rises steeply from below 4 keV in the very center up to more than 8 keV in the intermediate range and then decreases again to about 4 keV at the largest radii. Varying the measured particle background normalization artificially by +- 10 percent does not change the results significantly. Predictions for <b>outer</b> <b>temperature</b> profiles based on hydrodynamic simulations show good agreement. In particular, we find the observed temperature profile to be slightly steeper but consistent with a drop of a factor of 0. 6 from 0. 3 r 200 to r 200, as predicted by simulations. Conclusions: Temperature measurements up to the virial radius seem feasible with Suzaku, when a careful analysis of the different background components and the effects of the PSF is performed. The result obtained here indicates that numerical simulations capture the intracluster gas physics well in cluster outskirts.

40|$|Accepted???. Received????; in {{original}} form???? The temperature profile (TP) of the intracluster medium (ICM) is of primeval importance for deriving the dynamical {{parameters of the}} largest equilibrium systems known in the universe, in particular their total mass profile. Analytical models of the ICM often assume that the ICM is isothermal or parametrize the TP with a polytropic index γp. This parameter is ajusted to observations, but has in fact poor physical meaning for values other than 1 or 5 / 3, when considering monoatomic gases. In this article, I present a theoretical model of a relaxed cluster where the TP is instead structured by electronic thermal conduction. Neglecting cooling and heating terms, the stationnary energy conservation equation reduces to a second order differential equation, whose resolution requires two boundary conditions, taken here as the inner radius and the ratio between inner and <b>outer</b> <b>temperature.</b> Once these two constants are chosen, the TP has a fixed analytical expression, which reproduces nicely the observed “universal ” TP obtained by Markevitch et al.
