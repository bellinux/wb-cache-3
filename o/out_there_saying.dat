But I will be the test case. I would welcome that. I would welcome the publicity. I would welcome everything, to make a point in, I guess, our society". These scenes possibly led to the subsequent undercover operation by federal authorities.|$|E

I wonder if the livery man will be awake?' But I got through somehow. I took the buggy down to the stable, and got to my room. I locked my door, but Mrs. Bogart kept saying things, outside the door. Stood <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>saying</b> things about me, dreadful things, and {{rattling}} the knob. And all the while I could hear Cy in the back yard-being sick.

5000|$|Madely has {{received}} significant criticism on {{social networking sites}} for posting selfies and promoting what some perceive to be an unrealistic athletic, muscular female body image on sites like Instagram. In response she has been outspoken against cyberbullying and trolling comments she {{has received}} online on national television, arguing: [...] "I am not putting it <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>saying</b> women should look like me. I’m saying this is how I like to look. The flack [...] I get back is women should not look like that.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Colbert then mocked Bush's sinking {{approval}} ratings: Now, I {{know there}} are some polls <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>saying</b> this man has a 32 percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don't {{pay attention to the}} polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in reality. And reality has a well-known liberal bias ... Sir, pay no attention to the people who say the glass is half empty, ... because 32 percent means it's two-thirds empty. There's still some liquid in that glass, is my point. But I wouldn't drink it. The last third is usually backwash.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2002, Ruzicka {{began working}} with USAID and the Senate Appropriations Committee to {{allocate}} money to rebuild the homes of families that had suffered losses {{as a result of}} military action. After receiving CIVIC's first report, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) sponsored legislation to provide $10 million in U.S. aid to Iraqi civilians who had been harmed by the US military. He said, [...] "Marla Ruzicka is <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Wait, everybody. Here is what is really happening. You'd better know about this.' We have whistle blowers in industry.

5000|$|Author James A. Riley wrote, [...] "A {{line drive}} hitter whose line shots to {{all parts of}} the {{ballpark}} looked like frozen ropes, he had a good eye at the plate and rarely struck out. Going with the pitch to all fields, he hit everything thrown to him and respected no pitcher. Sometimes he would spit at a pitcher's best offerings as it came across the plate, taking two strikes before lining a base hit through the middle. Supremely confident at the plate, the little slugger had no weakness." [...] Fellow Negro leaguer Cool Papa Bell said, [...] "He'd go <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>say</b> 'I guess I'll get me three hits,' and go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and hit that ball. I don't care who pitched, he could do everything." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding his {{coaching}} philosophy, Statham said, [...] "We do things consistently well. Our program is sound.

Our primary focus is to play hard, play well {{and try to do}} it as a team." [...] Statham's on-court demeanor does not include yelling and ref-baiting [...] Said Statham, [...] "I don't like the television color commentators (saying) how you gotta work the referee and draw a T. We're trying to play the right way. They're <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>saying</b> you've got to bend the rules, step out there a little bit. They turn me off, I really don't enjoy that." ...|$|E

Daley said [...] "I've thought about it before and I don't take it off the table. I think right now, to be very frank with you, {{the last thing in}} the world anybody wants to hear about is a race that's two years down the road." [...] Daley further was quoted as saying: [...] "I'm not closing the door and, I know that sounds like a politician, {{but the fact of the}} matter is that these are tough days and I think there's a lot to be done by the Legislature.

500|$|Biden {{declared}} his candidacy for president on January 31, 2007, {{although he had}} discussed running for months prior. It had been speculated that Biden would be offered and accept the position of Secretary of State because of his foreign policy experience and credentials. Biden rejected the notion outright, saying [...] "Under no administration will I accept the job of Secretary of State". He stated that he was focused only on the presidency. At a campaign event, Biden commented, [...] "I {{know a lot of}} my opponents <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>say</b> I'd be a great secretary of state. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'"

2500|$|In a July 2015 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Anselmo {{spoke out against}} Pantera and his other band's usage of the Confederate flag claiming {{it was a mistake}} to use it on their merchandise, albums and other promotional material. Anselmo said [...] "These days, I wouldn't want anything to fucking do with it because truthfully... I wouldn't.

I'm not so sure I'm buying into that." [...] Anselmo said originally that Pantera used the image because they were huge fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd but it was never about promoting hate.|$|R

Albarn said of the recording: [...] "I literally made it on the road. I didn't write it before, I didn't prepare it. I just did it day by day {{as a kind of}} diary of my experience in America. If I left it until the New Year to release it then the cynics <b>out</b> <b>there</b> would <b>say,</b> 'Oh well, it's been tampered with', but if I put it out now they'd know that I haven't done anything because I've been on tour ever since." ...|$|R
500|$|During his campaign, Biden {{focused on}} the war in Iraq and his support for the {{implementation}} of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy. Despite speculation to the contrary, Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, [...] "I know a lot of my opponents <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>say</b> I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" [...] Other candidates' comments that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's, saying of the latter, [...] "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training." [...] Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas.

[...] The tension {{backstage}} was so great that some feared a brawl between the Lion's Den and Tito Ortiz, Kevin Randleman, Mark Coleman and others from the Hammer House (who were in Ortiz's locker room after the event). The situation was escalated to the point that police and security had to be called in to monitor the situation. Jeff Sherwood, creator of Sherdog, wrote after the event: [...] "Someone needs to remind Ken Shamrock that it wasn't Monday Night Raw <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> Not <b>saying</b> he wouldn't tear Tito up though." ...|$|R

I don't see as she seems over-anxious to do {{anything}} there but sit, I tell her. Not but what she knows how well enough. Mr. Gaylord, too, he's great for being round in the kitchen. If he gets up in the night, when he has his waking spells, he had rather take his lamp <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> if there's a fire left, and read, any time, than what he would in the parlor.
