500|$|While Smith was {{competing}} in Britain's Got Talent, Cowell arranged {{for her to}} receive free singing lessons from leading vocal coach Yvie Burnett, who had previously coached 2007 Britains Got Talent winner Paul Potts and 2006 The X Factor winner Leona Lewis. The story was broken by The Sunday Mirror; writing for the paper, Lara Gould characterised the lessons as [...] "secret", while writers for The Daily Mail claimed that the lessons were [...] "likely to upset fellow contestants", and were evidence that Smith was [...] "already being groomed for stardom". During her participation in the competition, Smith was offered record deals, but {{she and her family}} turned them down. Her father, Tony Smith, said [...] "We have had offers from people interested in Faryl. But when Simon Cowell, the big man, says your daughter is special, you listen." [...] Cowell described Smith's potential career during the show, saying [...] "I know she says Katherine [...] is her idol but she is far better than her. She {{is by far the most}} talented youngster I've ever heard. When she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> her voice is just incredible." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the singer}} {{was interviewed by}} Nobel Literature Prize-winning Colombian novelist and {{journalist}} Gabriel García Márquez, who was [...] "astonished by her fantastical work-rate" [...] and said that [...] "Shakira's music has a personal stamp that doesn't look like anyone else's {{and no one can}} sing or dance like her, at whatever age, with such an innocent sensuality, one that seems to be of her own invention." [...] In the United States and the United Kingdom, Shakira drew comparisons to American pop singer Britney Spears as they looked similar in appearance and sported [...] "bleached blonde curls and butter-wouldn't-melt smiles for the kids down the front." [...] However, critics argued that the Shakira's vocal style was very different from Spears', with Ted Kessler from The Observer calling the former an [...] "operatic diva" [...] and writing that [...] "as soon as she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> she slips into gear and motors powerfully past Britney's breathy bump'n'grind." [...] In 2009, Julia Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "Shakira makes comparable Spanish-English 'crossover' acts such as Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias seem like minnows." [...] In an interview with Latina magazine in 2011, Gloria Estefan was asked whether she felt another crossover artist like Shakira could emerge in her lifetime, to which she responded, [...] "I'm always hopeful that somebody, any Latino, is going to succeed in what they do. And of course in music, undoubtedly." [...] Shakira's crossover success also inspired other Latin artists to foray into the English language market and many compared Mexican singer Paulina Rubio's attempt to crossover with her English-language debut album Border Girl to that by Shakira.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the show}} itself was greatly lauded by some critics: Vernon Rice of the New York Post proclaimed, [...] "Irving Berlin has outdone himself this time. No use {{trying to pick}} a hit tune, for all the tunes are hits...Ethel Merman is at her lusty, free and easy best...She is now able to develop a {{consistent}} characterization and stay with it to the show's end. And when she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to sing, she sings!" [...] William Hawkins of the New York World-Telegram said that Merman was [...] "bright as a whip, sure as her shooting, and generously the foremost lady clown of her time" [...] and asserted that the show itself was {{comparable to those of}} Rodgers and Hammerstein, proclaiming, [...] "For verve and buoyancy, unslackening, there has seldom if ever been a show like it...the girls in Annie have the beauty and character of looks one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. And the production has in every way the distinction that has become their hallmark".|$|E

60|$|That is the story, among others, told me by Henry, the waiter. I have, at his request, {{substituted}} artificial {{names for}} real ones. For Henry {{tells me that}} at Capetown Captain Kit's First-class Family and Commercial Hotel still runs, and that the landlady is still a beautiful woman with fine eyes and red hair, who might almost be taken for a duchess--until she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> when her accent {{is found to be}} still slightly reminiscent of the Mile-End Road.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. They {{will not}} only make {{a stop at the}} gate; but there they will knock and call. This also argueth them willing to enter. They will begin to stand without, and to knock at the gate, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. This word, Lord, being doubled, shows the vehemency of their desires, [...] "Lord, Lord, open unto us." [...] The devils are coming; Lord, Lord, the pit <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> upon us; Lord, Lord, there is nothing but hell and damnation left us, if, Lord, Lord, thou hast not mercy upon us; [...] "Lord, Lord, open unto us!" ...|$|E
60|$|Sally stared for a minute; then <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> shut <b>her</b> eyes, {{threw back}} her head, and chuckled.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Crowder <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> as if {{she would}} gasp for breath, {{but she did not}} say anything.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Bowater's {{eyes were}} like lead in her long, dark-skinned face. She <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>her</b> gaze {{travelled}} slowly until, as I realized, it had fixed {{itself on the}} large yellowing photograph behind my back.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Love each other? {{she hates}} me as she'd hate a hump on her back. She'd do me any devilish turn she could. There isn't {{a feeling of}} loathing that she doesn't have for me! She'd like to stamp on me and hear me crack, like a black beetle, and she never <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> but she insults me.' Lionel Berrington {{delivered}} himself of these assertions without violence, without passion or the sting of a new discovery; there was a familiar gaiety in his trivial little tone {{and he had the}} air of being so sure of what he said that he did not need to exaggerate in order to prove enough.|$|E
60|$|Fancy her, then, if you please, {{about five}} feet four inches high--fancy her in the family color of light blue, a little scarf {{covering}} the most brilliant shoulders in the world; {{and a pair of}} gloves clinging close round an arm that may, perhaps, be somewhat too large now, but that Juno might have envied then. After the fashion of young ladies on the continent, she wears no jewels or gimcracks: her only ornament is a wreath of vine-leaves in her hair, with little clusters of artificial grapes. Down on her shoulders falls the brown hair, in rich liberal clusters; all that health, and good-humor, and beauty can do for her face, kind nature has done for hers. Her eyes are frank, sparkling, and kind. As for her cheeks, what paint-box or dictionary contains pigments or words to describe their red? They say she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and smiles always to show the dimples in her cheeks. Psha! she smiles because she is happy, and kind, and good-humored, and not because her teeth are little pearls.|$|E
60|$|The Children's Hospital, {{to which}} I gave that name, {{is in full}} force. All its beds are occupied. There is a new face on the bed where my pretty baby lay, and that sweet little child is now at rest for ever. Much kind sympathy has been here since my former visit, and {{it is good to}} see the walls profusely garnished with dolls. I wonder what Poodles may think of them, as they stretch out their arms above the beds, and stare, and display their splendid dresses. Poodles has a greater {{interest}} in the patients. I find him making the round of the beds, like a house-surgeon, attended by another dog,--a friend,--who appears to trot about with him in the character of his pupil dresser. Poodles is anxious to make me known to a pretty little girl looking wonderfully healthy, who had had a leg taken off for cancer of the knee. A difficult operation, Poodles intimates, wagging his tail on the counterpane, but perfectly successful, as you see, dear sir! The patient, patting Poodles, adds with a smile, 'The leg was so much trouble to me, that I am glad it's gone.' I never saw anything in doggery finer than the deportment of Poodles, when another little girl <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to show a peculiar enlargement of the tongue. Poodles (at that time on a table, to be on a level with the occasion) looks at the tongue (with his own sympathetically out) so very gravely and knowingly, that I feel inclined to put my hand in my waistcoat-pocket, and give him a guinea, wrapped in paper.|$|E

6000|$|During the Protectorate, wickedness was discountenanced, and skulked in {{the holes}} and corners of Mansoul; {{but when a}} debauched monarch, who had taken refuge in the most licentious court in Europe, was called to occupy the throne of his fathers, the most {{abandoned}} profligacy and profaneness were let loose upon the nation. Vice was openly patronized, while virtue and religion were as openly treated with mockery and contempt. Bunyan justly says, [...] "The text calls for sharpness, so do the times." [...] "With those whose religion lieth in some circumstantials, the kingdom swarms at this day." [...] When they stand at the gate, they will [...] "shake like a quagmire--their feigned faith, pretended love, shows of gravity, and holiday words, will stand them in little stead; some professors do with religion just as people do with their best apparel--hang it on the wall all the week, {{and put it on}} on Sundays; they save it till they go to a meeting, or meet with a godly chapman." [...] This state of society called for peculiar sharpness, and Bunyan preached and published, in 1676, this awful alarm to professors. No subject could be more peculiarly applicable than [...] "The Gate of heaven," [...] and [...] "the difficulties of entering in thereat"; a subject of the deepest interest to all mankind--to stimulate the careless to find, and to enter the gate of this the only city of refuge from eternal misery--to fill the heart of God's children with love and joy in their prospects of a blessed immortality--and to sting the hypocrites with the awful thought of finding the gate shut against them for ever. Their cries and tears will be too late; they will stand without and vehemently cry, [...] "Lord, Lord, open unto us"; in vain will be their outcry, [...] "the devils are coming; Lord, Lord, the pit <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> upon us; Lord, Lord, there is nothing but hell and damnation left us, if thou hast not mercy upon us." [...] These were professors who pretended to have found the gate and way to heaven; who passed for pilgrims who were seeking a better, even a heavenly country; such deluded victims must be, of all men, the most miserable.|$|E

5000|$|Desai {{was listed}} as Time's 50 Most Desirable Women and People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in 2011. Esquire {{magazine}} featured Desai as 'A Woman we love' and wrote [...] "The first thing you notice about Preeti Desai are her slinky long legs, model physique and huge doe-like brown eyes. Then she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and a strong Northern English accent burst out - a nostalgic flashback reminiscent of the old Boddingtons advert's that featured glamorous women with pronounced Manchester accents.

Then he takes Joannie to the 1950s when she sees her and Jake failing to arrange a date together. Then he takes her to the 1970s, where Joannie and Jake are very unhappily married.|$|E
50|$|Later that evening, Mother and Marlene {{are riding}} his chopper around Vegas, when a showgirl {{in a car}} catches his eye. He splits with the showgirl and when he returns, Marlene is livid with rage. Setting out into the desert, the Angels and Mother argue {{about what to do}} and how to travel through the desert. Marlene <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and says what {{everyone}} in the gang is thinking. Mother gets angry and says that everyone in the gang can have Marlene. There are no takers, as even the gang members cannot go so low, so Mother takes off on his own.|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm Outta Love" [...] {{has been}} lauded by {{contemporary}} music critics. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic called the song an [...] "aggressive dancefloor item," [...] and added: [...] "The minute she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> she starts reminding you of other singers, especially Aretha Franklin." [...] Michel Paoletta, editor for Billboard magazine, declared [...] "I'm Outta Love" [...] a [...] "sonic joyride ... which moves and grooves with a spirit all its own."
