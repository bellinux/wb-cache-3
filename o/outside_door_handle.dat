5000|$|A {{number of}} safety {{improvements}} {{were made in}} order to comply with new American safety regulations: these included trigger-operated <b>outside</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> a secondary front hood latch, collapsing steering column, soft vent window latches, rotary glove compartment latch and instrument panel knobs labeled with pictographs. US models received a padded instrument panel that was optional in other markets. To meet North American head restraint requirements, VW developed the industry's first high-back bucket seat. The Standard model 111-112, called the 1200 [...] "A" [...] still used the 1200 engine {{but for the first}} time for Europe it came with a 12 volt system.|$|R
5000|$|Additional new {{features}} were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush style <b>outside</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> molded full foam {{front and rear}} seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger 22 gallon fuel tank, and [...] "flush and dry" [...] rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size GM cars. Another structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. Options included swiveling Strato-bucket seats (with console) for coupes, a power moonroof, and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster.|$|R

5000|$|This van {{used the}} [...] {{engine of the}} GAZ-24, between the front seats (not unlike the Dodge A100 or the Volkswagen LT 1st generation), with {{independent}} front suspension also from the GAZ-24 (but springs from the GAZ 13). It borrowed headlights and brake system parts from the Moskvitch 412, <b>outside</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> from the Moskvitch 408, and 15 in wheels of the GAZ-21 Volga. The single rear door hinged at the top, rather than the more-usual side-opening. There were two major models: one, the 2203, seated ten plus driver and passenger, powered by a [...] with 8.2:1 compression; the other, the 22032, a twelve-seat [...] "route taxi", had longitudinal seats and lower 6.7:1 compression (to use more readily available 76 octane petrol), and produced only [...] (The 2203-02 would run on liquified propane). An ambulance, the 22031, was soon added to the range, and made up fully {{a third of all}} 2203s built; there was also a 22035 for blood donor clinics. These were joined by the 22034, for fire departments.|$|R

Another structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. Options included swiveling Strato-bucket seats (with console) for coupes, a power moonroof, and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster. While lesser Chevelles (except the Malibu SS option) came standard with either a 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder or 307-cubic-inch two-barrel V8, Lagunas came standard with a 145-horsepower 350-cubic-inch two-barrel V8. Options included a 350 4-barrel V8 of [...] and a 454 4-barrel V8 rated at [...] Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. Three-speed manual transmission was standard; four-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs that prevented air from entering the system prevented overheating.|$|R
5000|$|The Quattroporte Sport GT S was {{introduced}} at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2007. Taking further the Sport GT's focus on handling, this version employed Bilstein single-rate dampers {{in place of}} the Skyhook adaptive system. Other changes from the Sport GT comprised a lowered ride height and 10 mm wider 295/30 rear tyres, front Brembo iron/aluminium dual-cast brake rotors and red-painted six piston callipers. The cabin was upholstered in mixed alcantara and leather, with carbon fibre accents; <b>outside</b> the <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> were painted in body colour, while the exterior trim, the 20 inch wheels and the exhaust pipes were finished in a [...] "dark chrome" [...] shade.|$|R
5000|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies with 1 {{in a wider}} wheel track, front and rear. The left wheel was {{adjusted}} to have slightly more positive camber than the right, {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 El Caminos. Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush-style <b>outside</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> molded full-foam seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger [...] fuel tank, and [...] "flush and dry" [...] rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster. A benefit of the new body designs was much better visibility of which the unusually thin windshield pillars contributed. A structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. El Caminos shared the [...] "Colonnade" [...] frameless door glass with other Chevelles, and would continue this feature into the next generation as well.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{extensive}} redesign in its 10-year history marked the 1973 Chevelle. Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, convertible and 4-door hardtop models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop {{was replaced by}} a pillared coupe—named [...] "Colonnade Hardtop". This body style featured a semi-fastback roofline, frameless door glass and fixed, styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated [...] front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style <b>outside</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> Wheelbase dimensions were retained; [...] a sporty [...] for coupes and [...] for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127mm) [...] longer and an inch wider with a [...] wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Current {{approaches}} for opening door usually {{focus on the}} recognition of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> in a fixed position, {{but in the process}} of door opening, a manipulator with a mobile platform is very important under real-world scenarios, which brings significance to the location and distance measurement of a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> when the mobile platform is moving. In this paper, a method for location of a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> in HSI color space is presented. The image of the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is captured by the kinect for Xbox 360, and is processed in HSI color space, resulting in a rectangle frame fitted to the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> to be displayed in real time.

25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> recessed rear <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> and a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre licence plate holder. The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden rear <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and prominent front <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> to give it a coupé look. The design was influenced by three historical Alfa Romeo models: the 1900, the Giulietta and the Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31.|$|R
50|$|The Lever lock <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> on a {{backplate}} {{is another}} type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> which operates similarly to the lever latch <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever and just below it, a key hole cut. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a mortice sash lock. Just the like the lever latch, the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle but can also be locked using a key. This locking mechanism is why this type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is used for front and back doors of residential housing.|$|R

50|$|<b>Door</b> <b>handles</b> {{provide a}} {{suitable}} environment for bacteria to spread easily, {{this makes it}} a hotspot for bacteria to gather and create colonies. After {{a study conducted by}} the Worcester Polytechnic institute, WPI, gathered that 1323 bacterial colonies were displaced among 27 <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> This study was conducted on the university campus, an area which is considered fairly dense in population, which many people will access these doors, providing a host for the bacteria to travel elsewhere. Flu viruses can have the potential to last up to 24 hours on <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> Over this period of time, this gives measure for the bacteria to further spread or even other <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> This bacteria on exposure can be harmful to humans, potentially infecting us with diseases such as e-coli, fungal or other viral infections. Many people may forget the potential for bacteria to thrive on <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> and after exposure may touch their face, or other places that may lead to ingesting it into their body. The study conducted by WPI using a hidden camera discovered that out of 1,060 and over of a period of 35 minutes, 86 people touched their face after exposure with the <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Foot-operated {{door opener}} to {{eliminate}} the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> {{as a source of}} contamination Fußtüröffner zur Ausschaltung der Kontaminationsquelle Türklinke Aim: As <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> represent a transmission route for viruses and micro-organisms, a door opening and closing mechanism should be developed without manual operation. Method: To solve the problem, a device for opening the door {{with the help of a}} foot pedal was built into the door leaf. Results: The design enables mechanical opening of the door with a foot pedal without manual operation. Subsequently, the door closes with the help of a mechanical locking mechanism. Discussion: The foot-operated door opener constitutes an additional option to the <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> Together with the equipment of a soft closing mechanism, it is possible to prevent noise emanating from the door latch impinging on the door frame. Using this construction, the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> as a transmission vector is eliminated. In addition, the transport of goods held with two hands simultaneously is facilitated. Conclusion: With a foot-operated door opener instead of the traditional manual <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> it is possible to open doors with a foot pedal. This prevents contamination of <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> with pathogens...|$|R
