40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe thesis main {{objective}} was to produce new and stable fermented <b>sparkling</b> <b>beverages</b> from fruit and infusions/teas, with yeast directed for gourmet restaurants. Ten fruits and eighteen infusions/teas were evaluated for organoleptic properties to choose the best potentially four <b>sparkling</b> <b>beverages.</b> Beverages were characterized for physico-chemical composition, pH, total acidity, ºbrix, soluble protein and phenolic compounds. Antimutagenic potential was analyzed by Ames test. Product shelf-life was established (15 days – juices; 30 days - infusions, at 4 ºC) and microbiology analyses were done during the same period, while pH, ºbrix, total acidity, glucose, ethanol and pressure were monitored. RAPD-PCR allowed the microorganism’s strains identification in beverages. Esters, aldehydes, superior alcohols and phenolic compounds were detected by gas chromatography. Three focus group (32 people; ≥ 18 years old) were organized to evaluate beverage’s acceptability. It was concluded that these beverages were stable from the chemical and microbiological point of view. Its global sensorial appreciation was above the average for all four beverages (> 60 % - infusions; > 80 % - juices) ...|$|R

50|$|Gatyk, a thick {{drinking}} yogurt {{similar to}} kefir, is often served with breakfast and sometimes {{used as a}} condiment on börek or manti, replacing the traditional sour cream. The drink the nation is known for, however, is chal, a fermented camel's milk, which is a white <b>sparkling</b> <b>beverage</b> that has a sour flavour and is popular in Central Asia, particularly in Turkmenistan. Because of specific preparation requirements and it being extremely perishable, chal presents a great challenge for importers to ship outside Turkmenistan or the region for foreign consumption.

This case study used monthly sales revenue from <b>sparkling</b> <b>beverages</b> of data collected routinely from 14 provinces of Southern Thailand during years 2000 - 2006. Linear regression models of log-transformed sales revenue per 1000 population were used to analyse per capita revenue and study product preference with respect to flavour and branch location. Population data was obtained from the 2000 Population and Housing Census of Thailand. The model contains quarterly effects and interactions associated with flavour-branch and branch-year. The average annual per capita consumption value rate was 297 baht for the population of 8. 087 million residents in Southern Thailand. Branches in Samui and Phuket had higher rates than other branches. In addition, areas with different proportions of Muslims in their population had different beverage preferences...|$|R

40|$|Combinatorial peptide ligand library technology, {{coupled to}} mass spectrometry, {{has been applied}} to {{extensively}} map the proteome of orange pulp and peel and, via this fingerprinting, to detect its presence in commercial orange juices and drinks. The native and denaturing extraction protocols have captured 1109 orange proteins, as identified by LC-MS/MS. This proteomic map has been searched in an orange concentrate, from a Spanish juice manufacturer, as well as in commercial orange juices and soft drinks. The presence of numerous orange proteins in commercial juices has demonstrated the genuineness of these products, prepared by using orange fruits as original ingredients. However, the low number of identified proteins in <b>sparkling</b> <b>beverages</b> has suggested that they were prepared with scarce amounts of fruit extract, thus imparting lower quality to the final products. These findings not only increase the knowledge of the orange proteome but also present a reliable analytical method to assess quality and genuineness of commercial products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
