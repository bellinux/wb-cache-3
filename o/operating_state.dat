25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, major works {{were carried out}} to enable the {{platform}} to meet UK Government gas export requirements and after this work had been completed, Piper Alpha was operating in what was known as phase 2 mode (operating with the Gas Conservation Module (GCM)) {{since the end of}} 1980 up until July 1988; phase 2 mode was its normal <b>operating</b> <b>state.</b> In the late 1980s, major construction, maintenance and upgrade works had been planned by Occidental and by July 1988, the rig was already well into major work activities, with six major projects identified including the change-out of the GCM unit which meant that the rig had been put back into its initial phase 1 mode (i.e. operating without a GCM unit). Despite the complex and demanding work schedule, Occidental made the decision to continue operating the platform in phase 1 mode throughout this period and not to shut it down, as had been originally planned. The planning and controls that were put in place were thought to be adequate. Therefore, Piper continued to export oil at just under 120,000 barrels per day and to export Tartan gas at some 33 MMSCFD (million standard cubic feet per day) during this demanding period.|$|E

It has the lowest thermal conductivity and lowest ionization potential of all the non-radioactive noble gases. As a noble gas, it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp. The low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the <b>operating</b> <b>state,</b> and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state, which allows the lamp to be more easily started.|$|E

All participants collaborate on the decentralized {{state estimation}} {{with the help of}} smart contracts. Each participant relies on local measurements and limited boundary information provided by its neighbors to calculate the local state estimation. As the differences in boundary information diminish in a finite number of iterations [74, 75], pertinent local estimates would be integrated seamlessly to represent the ADN’s <b>operating</b> <b>states.</b> The full set of the converged ADN’s <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> is then stored on the state estimation blockchain by the participant with the highest credit score. When all participants have access to actual energy trading information across ADN, the set of <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> local to a participant can only be decrypted by using the participant’s private key.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new methodology for assessing both reliability and well-being indices for composite generation and transmission systems. Firstly, a transmission network reduction {{is applied to}} find an equivalent for assessing composite reliability for practical large power systems. After that, in order to classify the <b>operating</b> <b>states,</b> Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based on Group Method Data Handling (GMDH) techniques are used to capture the patterns of the <b>operating</b> <b>states,</b> during {{the beginning of the}} non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The idea is to provide the simulation process with an intelligent memory, based only on polynomial parameters, to speed up the evaluation of the <b>operating</b> <b>states.</b> For the conventional reliability assessment, the ANNs are used to classify the <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> into success and failure. However, for the well-being analysis, only success states are classified into healthy and marginal by the ANNs. The proposed methodology is applied to the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and to a configuration of the Brazilian South-Southeastern System...|$|R

40|$|It {{is a great}} {{challenge}} for DC microgrids with stochastic renewable sources and volatility loads to achieve better operation performance. This study proposes an energy management strategy based on multiple <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> for a DC microgrid, which is comprised of a photovoltaic (PV) array, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system, and a battery bank. This proposed strategy can share the power properly and keep the bus voltage steady under different <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> (the state of charge (SOC) of the battery bank, loading conditions, and PV array output power). In addition, a microgrids test platform is established. In order to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed energy management strategy, the strategy is implemented in a hardware system and experimentally tested under different <b>operating</b> <b>states.</b> The experimental results illustrate the good performance of the proposed control strategy for the DC microgrid under different scenarios of power generation and load demand...|$|R

40|$|The {{planning}} {{horizon for}} a system development planner is long and a system planner {{must take into account}} potential changes to generation capacity and demand during that horizon. The uncertainties that affect system development are greater than those that apply, for example, in system operations. Thus, it is important to build up a credible set of <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> that is informed by various uncertainties and adequately represents the range of conditions that might reasonably be expected to arise. The next step in the system development process is to assess these <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> for system operability. If a power system is not operable on some (probable) <b>operating</b> <b>states,</b> then it identifies a potential need for investment in the system. However, given the number and range of uncertainties relevant to system development, pragmatic approaches must also be developed allowing their assessment. In this report, a comprehensive system development approach is presented...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{structure}} of a parallel hybrid, different <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> and degrees of freedom for the torque of the combustion engine arise. To manage the transition between the different <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> as well as to provide the setpoint for the torque of the combustion engine, a control strategy is required. The transition between the different <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> can be initiated depending on various vehicular variables like vehicle speed or required drive torque. For the torque setpoint of the combustion engine different approaches are known [1]. The vehicular variables which initiate the transition between the <b>operating</b> <b>states</b> and the approaches for the setting of the torque of the combustion engine can be combined to different heuristic control strategies by basic IF-THEN-rules. The determination of the design parameters of the different control strategies can be regarded as an optimization problem with the objective to “minimize fuel consumption”. As a constraint for the optimization, the state of charge (SOC) of the electrical energy storage has to be sustained. From the optimization results it becomes apparent that for nearly all developed control strategies in all driving cycles and for all vehicle masses a charge sustainability and a reduction of fuel consumption are possible compared to a conventional reference vehicle. The optimal parameters of the strategies depend more or less on the driving cycle and the vehicle mass, but some parameters and approaches for setting the torque of the combustion engine turn out to be comparatively independent. Thus, these control strategies are predestinated for the use in a real vehicle...|$|R
