40|$|We analyze time {{evolution}} of a spherically-symmetric collapsing matter from {{a point of view}} that black holes evaporate by nature. We consider conformal matters and solve the semi-classical Einstein equation G_μν= 8 π G 〈 T_μν〉 by using the 4 -dimensional Weyl anomaly with a large c coefficient. Here 〈 T_μν〉 contains the contribution from both the collapsing matter and Hawking radiation. The solution indicates that the collapsing matter forms a dense object and evaporates without horizon or singularity, and it has a surface but looks like an <b>ordinary</b> black <b>hole</b> from the outside.

50|$|In quantum mechanics, {{the black}} hole emits Hawking {{radiation}} and so can come to thermal equilibrium with a gas of radiation (not compulsory).

This may imply that black holes and white holes are the same object. The Hawking radiation from an <b>ordinary</b> black <b>hole</b> is then identified with the white-hole emission. Hawking's semi-classical argument is reproduced in a quantum mechanical AdS/CFT treatment, where a black hole in anti-de Sitter space is described by a thermal gas in a gauge theory, whose time reversal is the same as itself.|$|R

50|$|The {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} stellar and supermassive black holes implies that in order for black holes to not form, general relativity must fail as a theory of gravity, perhaps due to the onset of quantum mechanical corrections. A much anticipated feature of a theory of quantum gravity is that it will not feature singularities or event horizons and thus black holes would not be real artifacts. In 2002, much attention has been drawn by the fuzzball model in string theory. Based on calculations for specific situations in string theory, the proposal suggests that generically the individual states of a black hole solution do not have an event horizon or singularity, but that for a classical/semi-classical observer the statistical average of such states appears just as an <b>ordinary</b> black <b>hole</b> as deduced from general relativity.|$|R

40|$|Vacuum bubbles may {{nucleate}} {{during the}} inflationary epoch and expand, reaching relativistic speeds.

Bubbles smaller than certain critical size collapse to <b>ordinary</b> black <b>holes,</b> while in the supercritical case the bubble interior inflates, forming a baby universe, which {{is connected to the}} exterior region by a wormhole. The wormhole then closes up, turning into two black holes at its two mouths. We use numerical simulations to find the masses of black holes formed in this scenario, both in subcritical and supercritical regime.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been much {{discussion}} as to whether old black holes have firewalls at their surfaces that would destroy infalling observers.

40|$|Relativistic ultracompact objects {{without an}} event horizon {{may be able}} to form in nature and merge as binary systems, {{mimicking}} the coalescence of <b>ordinary</b> black <b>holes.</b> The postmerger phase of such processes presents characteristic signatures, which appear as repeated pulses within the emitted gravitational waveform, i. e., echoes with variable amplitudes and frequencies. Future detections of these signals can shed new light on the existence of horizonless geometries, and provide new information on the nature of gravity in a genuine strong-field regime. In this work we analyze phenomenological templates used to characterize echolike structures produced by exotic compact objects, and we investigate {{for the first time the}} ability of current and future interferometers to constrain their parameters. Using different models with an increasing level of accuracy, we determine the features that can be measured with the largest precision, and we span the parameter space to find the most favorable configurations to be detected. Our analysis shows that current detectors may already be able to extract all the parameters of the echoes with good accuracy, and that multiple interferometers can measure frequencies and damping factors of the signals at the level of percent.

40|$|One {{possible}} fate {{of information}} lost to black holes is its preservation in black hole remnants. It {{is argued that}} a type of effective field theory describes such remnants (generically referred to as informons). The general structure of such a theory is investigated and the infinite pair production problem is revisited. A toy model for remnants clarifies {{some of the basic}} issues; in particular, infinite remnant production is not suppressed simply by the large internal volumes as proposed in cornucopion scenarios. Criteria for avoiding infinite production are stated in terms of couplings in the effective theory. Such instabilities remain a problem barring what would be described in that theory as a strong coupling conspiracy. The relation to euclidean calculations of cornucopion production is sketched, and potential flaws in that analysis are outlined. However, it is quite plausible that pair production of <b>ordinary</b> black <b>holes</b> (e. g. Reissner Nordstrom or others) is suppressed due to strong effective couplings. It also remains an open possibility that a microscopic dynamics can be found yielding an appropriate strongly coupled effective theory of neutral informons without infinite pair production.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} those time travels mostly {{considered}} by physics, namely {{those in the}} form of the so-called closed timelike curves. Some authoritative scholars have raised doubts about the status of these journeys as proper time travels. By using David Lewis’ famous definition of time travels proposed in 1976, we show that this proper status may actually be recovered, at least in some cosmological contexts containing spacetime regions, such as those concerning black holes described by the Kerr–Newman metric, that allow the formation of local closed curves. But, the mathematical incompatibility between <b>ordinary</b> black <b>hole</b> solutions to Einstein field equations and the cosmological solutions induces us to take into consideration the more general issue pertaining to the slippery interplay between models related to local and global aspects of the world, highlighting, in particular, the different notions of time that these domains inevitably imply. This leads us to think that time is not a univocal entity of the world, but is a scale-related characteristic which claims the adoption, when investigating its ontological status, of a sort of regional approach. We also briefly dwell upon themost appropriate form of realism that such a kind of dispute between local and global models may involve...|$|R
40|$|The braneworld {{description}} of our universe entails a large extra dimension and a fundamental scale of gravity {{that might be}} lower by several orders of magnitude compared to the Planck scale. An interesting consequence of the braneworld scenario is {{in the nature of}} spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to the brane gravitational field equations which could represent black holes with properties quite distinct compared to <b>ordinary</b> black <b>holes</b> in 4 -dimensions. We discuss certain key features of some braneworld black hole geometries. Such black holes are likely to have diverse cosmological and astrophysical ramifications. The cosmological evolution of primordial braneworld black holes is described highlighting their longevity due to modified evaporation and effective accretion of radiation during the early braneworld high energy era. Observational abundance of various evaporation products of the black holes at different eras impose constraints on their initial mass fraction. Surviving primordial black holes could be candidates of dark matter present in galactic haloes. We discuss gravitational lensing by braneworld black holes. Observables related to the relativistic images of strong field gravitational lensing could in principle be used to distinguish between different braneworld black hole metrics in future observations.

It quickly became clear that D-branes and other p-branes, not just strings, formed the matter content of the string theories, and the physical interpretation of the strings and branes was revealed—they are a type of black hole. Leonard Susskind had incorporated the holographic principle of Gerardus 't Hooft into string theory, identifying the long highly excited string states with <b>ordinary</b> thermal black <b>hole</b> states.

The ring singularity is replaced by a classical, circular, rotating string with Planck tension representing the inner engine driving the rotation of all the surrounding matter. The resulting geometry is regular and smoothly interpolates among inner Minkowski space, borderline de Sitter and outer Kerr universe.
