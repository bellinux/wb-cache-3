In such a system, the CBS company would enter into a contract directly with the local authorities <b>to</b> <b>instal</b> and maintain toilets, and managing excreta collection for entire communities, in return for a monthly service fee. The advantages of this approach are higher customer densities, more straightforward and reliable revenue streams, and reduced customer acquisition and capital costs.|$|R

50|$|Although anti-Catholic feeling had {{subsided}} a good deal, it {{flared up}} again {{due to the}} fake Popish Plot of 1678; this followed a false testimony from Titus Oates in which he claimed there was a conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>instal</b> a Catholic king, and he managed to ferment a renewed and fierce persecution of English Catholics.

30|$|Often, {{water supply}} {{companies}} and Authorities undertake activities to promote {{efficient use of}} water. Considering the civil building sector, conservation measures (or water saving measures) generally encourage residents <b>to</b> <b>instal</b> and use high efficiency plumbing fixtures and educate them about water saving habits. Furthermore, interventions aimed at the reuse of water (rainwater and grey water) are strongly recommended and incentivized (Wung et al. 2006). In this regard, the knowledge of water consumptions (per family or per person) is a key issue, useful to planners to build the water reuse systems.|$|R

40|$|Optimal {{decisions}} {{of a firm}} facing the option of retrofitting its plant to reduce pollution and thereby eliminate the need to purchase emissions allowances are analysed. The decision is treated as a real option {{with the price of}} pollution permits following a known stochastic process. The model is formulated as a set of one-dimensional partial differential equations. At discrete points in time, the firm owner makes optimal decisions about the retrofit, including whether to mothball temporarily.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{sensor system}} for the continuous and in-line measurement of hydrogen peroxide in industrial applications is described. The hydrogen peroxide concentration can be measured over the entire pH range, over a wide concentration range of hydrogen peroxide (10 - 3 70 g/l), from 0 to 70 °C, and with high precision and accuracy (errors less than 1 %). The system consists of a bypass in which the necessary electrodes are positioned and electronically controlled. The sensor is very selective for hydrogen peroxide, easy <b>to</b> <b>instal,</b> and it is stable {{for at least two}} months after calibration. The calibration can be done in the process solution during a running process...|$|R

40|$|We {{naturally}} attribute <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups, {{and take}} such <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> have {{consequences for the}} obligations of group members. The threat posed by anthropogenic climate change provides an urgent case. It seems that we, together, have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prevent climate catastrophe, and that we, as individuals, have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> contribute. However, understood strictly, attributions of <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups might seem illegitimate. On the one hand, the groups in question—the people alive today, say—are rarely fully-fledged moral agents, making it unclear {{how they can be}} subjects of obligations. On the other, the attributions can rarely be understood distributively, as concerned with members’ <b>obligations,</b> because <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> do something require a capacity to do it, and individual members often lack the relevant capacities. Moreover, even if groups can have obligations, it is unclear why that would be relevant for members, exactly because members often lack control over whether group obligations are fulfilled. In previous work, I have argued that a general understanding of individual <b>obligations</b> extends non-mysteriously <b>to</b> irreducibly shared <b>obligations,</b> rendering attributions of <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups legitimate. In this paper, I spell out how the proposed account also helps us understand the relation between individual and shared obligations. Even though few individual human agents have any significant control over whether we will be successful in preventing climate catastrophe, our collective capacity to prevent catastrophe and shared preventative <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> do so can give rise <b>to</b> significant individual <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> contribute to its fulfillment...|$|R
50|$|After Emperor Shun died, his {{infant son}} died {{after just one}} year on the throne. The general Liang Ji {{installed}} the seven-year-old Liu Zuan (劉纘) on the throne, overruling the popularity of another candidate, Liu Suan (劉蒜). Despite his young age, Liu Zuan showed signs of resentment towards Liang Ji's domineering influence, and was soon poisoned by the general. The imperial court was once again divided in deciding the successor. One group, led by Li Gu, wanted <b>to</b> <b>instal</b> Liu Suan on the throne, while Liang Ji led another faction which supported the young Liu Zhi (劉志). Cao Teng took Liang Ji's side and urged him to defy his critics, and soon the majority backed down.|$|R

This legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report results from Article 162 of the Penal Code. Partly because of parliamentary questions about this legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report, the need has arisen to gain insight into the value of this leg-islative article and to explore whether the present form of the legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report is satisfactory.
