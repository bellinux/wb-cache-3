5000|$|Unicode {{maintains}} that ligaturing is a presentation issue {{rather than a}} character definition issue, and that, for example, [...] "if a modern font is asked to display 'h' followed by 'r', and the font has an 'hr' ligature in it, it can display the ligature." [...] Accordingly, {{the use of the}} special Unicode ligature characters is [...] "discouraged", and [...] "no more will be encoded in any circumstances". Note, however, that ligatures such as æ and œ are never used to replace arbitrary [...] "ae" [...] or [...] "oe" [...] sequences - [...] "does" [...] can never be written [...] "dœs".Notably, Microsoft Word does not enable ligatures by default, partly for backward compatibility reasons due to its long history.

Thus, in dissimilar welding, weaker materials should be placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancing</b> side to trigger heat from the tool rotation and smooth the material flow formation in the stirred zone. ...|$|R
