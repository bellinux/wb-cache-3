40|$|AbstractThe present work shows a new {{numerical}} {{treatment for}} wear simulation on 3 D contact and rolling-contact problems.

The constitutive equations of the potential contact zone are Signorini’s contact conditions, Coulomb’s law of friction and Holm–Archard’s law of wear. The proposed methodology is applied to predict wear on different contact and rolling-contact problems. Results are validated with numerical solutions and semi-analytical models presented in the literature. The BEM considers only the degrees of freedom involved <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> of problems (those on the solids surfaces), reducing the number of unknowns and obtaining a very good approximation on contact tractions using a low number of elements.
