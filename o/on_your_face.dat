500|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{keyboard}} before turning into an '80s-inspired dance-pop number. Reminiscent of Solveig's hit single [...] "Hello", the song has a [...] "pulsating" [...] French house composition, and a [...] "catchy" [...] hook and chorus, inline with Madonna's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". According to Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice, following the introduction on the keyboard, the music continues to grow as Madonna sings the line, [...] "you feel the wind <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>face</b> and your skin and it's here that I begin my story", and crashes following it. John Mitchell from MTV News described {{that there was a}} [...] "propulsive" [...] energy in the track that felt [...] "authentic and alive". He went on to add that [...] "the calculated perfectionism" [...] of other club tracks by Madonna might appear to be chilly, but the composition of [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] instead was [...] "effervescent" [...] and [...] "happy". According to the sheet music of the song published by Guitar Tabs, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 127 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with Madonna's vocals ranging from C to A. The song follows a sequence of D–B–Amin–G in the verses and D–G–B–Emin during the chorus.|$|E

500|$|Eckhart's {{next project}} was Thank You for Smoking, {{in which he}} played Nick Naylor, a tobacco {{lobbyist}} whose firm researched the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. Eckhart said that he felt challenged playing the role: [...] "You have to say these words that are crazy, and yet {{do it with a}} smile <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>face</b> and have the audience like you. At one point, I'm doing a talk show with a kid who's dying of cancer, and he's going through chemotherapy and the whole thing, and I spin it so the anti-smoking people are the bad guys and I'm the good guy, and I'm this guy's best friend. I mean, it's whacked out." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. It had a limited release in March 2006 and was released worldwide the following month. For his performance, Eckhart received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. A contributor of USA Today wrote that he gave a [...] "standout, whip-smart performance" [...] citing that as Nick Naylor he kept him [...] "likable even in his cynicism." [...] In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer review of the film, it was reported that [...] "Under his chummy but compassionless smile" [...] Eckhart radiated charm and [...] "Naylor's true joys: manipulating arguments, steering debate, cooking words." ...|$|E
500|$|Lagaan was {{met with}} high {{critical}} acclaim. The film currently scores a 95% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, [...] "Lagaan is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals." [...] Derek Elley of Variety suggested that it [...] "could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets". Somni Sengupta of The New York Times, described it as [...] "a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines" [...] Roger Ebert gave three and half out of four stars and said, [...] "Lagaan is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it's a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly defined villains and heroes, a romantic triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. Lagaan is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as [...] "a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it's got a dash of spaghetti western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling." [...] Kuljinder Singh of the BBC stated that [...] "Lagaan is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that will have you laughing and crying, but leaving with a smile." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times argued that the film is [...] "an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it {{to the level of}} an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view." [...] Sudish Kamath of The Hindu suggested that [...] "the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>face,</b> however depressed you might be." [...] The Times of India wrote, [...] "Lagaan has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match, which has audiences screaming and clapping." [...] Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie, coming 10 years later, is by John Nugent of the Trenton Independent, who wrote [...] "a masterpiece ... and what better way to learn a bit about India's colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled in to one (albeit long) classic film." ...|$|E

Character and enemy models are noticeably low polygon, and the textures seem muddy and N64-like at times." [...] However, he {{concluded}} [...] "MDK2 is a well-designed action platformer that will take quite a bit of time to get through its 10 levels.

2500|$|Allantide ( [...] , meaning {{first day}} of winter) is a Cornish festival that was {{traditionally}} celebrated {{on the night of}} 31 October, as well as the following day time. One of the most important parts of this festival was the giving of Allan apples, large glossy red apples that were highly polished, to family and friends as tokens of good luck. Allan apple markets used to be held throughout West Cornwall in the run up to the feast. and in the town of St Just it surpassed Christmas as a time for giving gifts until the late 20th century. A game was also recorded in which two pieces of wood were nailed together {{in the shape of a}} cross. It was then suspended, with 4 lit candles on each arm and Allan apples suspended underneath. The aim being to catch the apples with your mouth without getting molten wax <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>face.</b> For unmarried recipients the apples would be placed under their pillows in the hope that they would bring dreams of their future wife or husband.|$|E

Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E
