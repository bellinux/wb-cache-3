5|$|In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, {{told his}} son {{that not only}} must he gain {{admission}} to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but he must also gain a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses. Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of Elsie Fogerty, the founder and principal of the school. Olivier later speculated that {{it was on the}} strength <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>that</b> Fogerty agreed to award him the bursary.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>that</b> Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had chewed on) and weeping uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is stoned by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>that</b> servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E
5|$|Until 1926, Shamrock Rovers wore {{green and}} white striped jerseys but {{following}} a suggestion by a committee member, John Sheridan, the club chose to adopt the {{green and white}} hooped strip. A close relationship existed between the club and Belfast Celtic {{and it was on}} account <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>that</b> the idea was formed. The first game featuring the new jerseys was against Bray Unknowns in a FAI Cup match on 9 January 1927 at Shelbourne Park. The Hoops lost the game 3–0 and senior members of the club considered abandoning the new strip. Despite this loss, the team continued to wear green and white hoops and have done ever since. The 2007 season was the first season since the hoops were introduced that they were not continuous around {{the main body of the}} jersey. The style of the shirt sleeves has been changed on numerous occasions. The away colours of the club have varied over time. In the early 1980s, the club had a yellow away jersey. In the mid-1990s, a hooped purple jersey was adopted. In 2011, the team wore an all black away strip.|$|E

25|$|There are {{different}} views {{as to which}} personality dimensions are more central in regard to psychopathy. Besides dimensions described elsewhere in this article, studies have linked psychopathy to alternative dimensions such as antagonism (high), conscientiousness (low) and anxiousness (low, or sometimes high). Psychopathy has also been linked to high psychoticism—a theorized dimension referring to tough, aggressive or hostile tendencies. Aspects <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>that</b> appear associated with psychopathy are lack of socialization and responsibility, impulsivity, sensation-seeking (in some cases), and aggression.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the current}} rate of {{increase}} - averaging about 2ppm per year - greenhouse gas concentrations are likely to reach 400ppm by 2016, 450ppm by 2041, and 550ppm by around 2091. It is because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>that</b> environmental organisations and some political parties criticised the 60% target as being insufficiently ambitious, and why they demanded greater cuts (80%-100%), as mentioned below. The exclusion of emissions from aviation and shipping, combined with forecasts for growth in these areas, also means that the net effect of the bill would actually have only been a 35-50% total cut on 1990 levels by 2050.|$|E

25|$|According to {{economist}} David Foot of the University of Toronto, {{the level}} of a woman's education is {{the most important factor in}} determining whether she will reproduce: the higher her level of education, the less likely she is to bear children (or if she does, the fewer children she is likely to have). Overall, researchers have observed childless couples to be more educated, and it is perhaps because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>that</b> they are more likely to be employed in professional and management occupations, more likely for both spouses to earn relatively high incomes, and to live in urban areas. They are also less likely to be religious, subscribe to traditional gender roles, or subscribe to conventional roles.|$|E
25|$|This tour {{can best}} be remembered for being India's first tour to Australia and also for being Bradman's last test series at home and his second last series. It was perhaps because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>that</b> {{it was assumed that}} the Indians were {{actually}} keen to watch Bradman play. Even though India capitulated for scores less than hundred four times on the tour, their batsmen performed well individually. In fact, Dattu Phadkar, who cracked a century in fourth test, and hit three fifties as well, headed the averages. Vijay Hazare became a sensation after his two centuries in the same match. Vinoo Mankad hit two centuries, in the third and fifth tests, however, it was the failure from an experienced campaigner and their team captain Lala Amarnath, which hastened the team's heavy loss.|$|E
