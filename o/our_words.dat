[...] She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a [...] "horrible person", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to [...] "inappropriate" [...] things. In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, [...] "We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death.

2500|$|Novelist Joanna Trollope commented in The Times that, [...] "This is not {{a matter}} of that age-old - and {{impossible}} - difficulty of the plagiarism of ideas. It is something much easier to define, and a danger to all writers. It is - let's not mince <b>our</b> <b>words</b> - the theft of someone's writing, someone's own words stolen in exactly the form in which their brain produced them. And it's a theft to which all writers are vulnerable. Jo Rowling didn't have to do this. I should think that her time in New York was horrible, exacerbated by a lack of support caused, no doubt, by deeply unattractive sourness over her wealth. Well, I applaud her, and I bet I'm not alone. I am thrilled for her, and very grateful to her, for taking the stand she did - and winning." ...|$|E

It classifies each Chinese character given the features derived from its surrounding context. Each Chinese character can be assigned one of four possible boundary tags: s for a character that occurs as a single-character word, b for a character that begins a multi-character (i. e., two or more characters) word, e for a character that ends a multi-character word, and m for a character that is neither the first nor last in a multi-character <b>word.</b> <b>Our</b> implementation used the opennlp maximum entropy package v 2. 1. 0 from sourceforge. 1 1. 1 Basic Features The basic features of <b>our</b> <b>word</b> segmenter are similar to our previous work (Ng and Low, 2004) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a word alignment framework that facilitates {{the incorporation of}} syntax encoded in bilingual dependency tree pairs. Our model consists of two sub-models: an anchor word alignment model which aims to find a set of high-precision anchor links and a syntaxenhanced word alignment model which focuses on aligning the remaining words relying on dependency information invoked by the acquired anchor links. We show that <b>our</b> syntaxenhanced <b>word</b> alignment approach leads to a 10. 32 % and 5. 57 % relative decrease in alignment error rate compared to a generative word alignment model and a syntax-proof discriminative word alignment model respectively. Furthermore, our approach is evaluated extrinsically using a phrase-based statistical machine translation system. The results show that SMT systems based on <b>our</b> <b>word</b> alignment approach tend to generate shorter outputs. Without length penalty, using <b>our</b> <b>word</b> alignments yields statistically significant improvement in Chinese–English machine translation {{in comparison with the}} baseline word alignment. ...|$|R
