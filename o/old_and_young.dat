5|$|The {{district}} of Faisalabad {{is part of}} the alluvial plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent. The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces. These were later identified as <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Oberon was {{influenced}} by two competing forces: impact crater formation and endogenic resurfacing. The former acted over the moon's entire history and is primarily responsible for its present-day appearance. The latter processes were active for a period following the moon's formation. The endogenic processes were mainly tectonic in nature {{and led to the}} formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust. The canyons obliterated parts of the older surface. The cracking of the crust was caused by the expansion of Oberon by about 0.5%, which occurred in two phases corresponding to the <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> canyons.|$|E
50|$|Ageism has {{significant}} {{effects on the}} elderly <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people. The stereotypes <b>and</b> infantilization of <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> people by patronizing language affects <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> people's self-esteem <b>and</b> behaviors. After repeatedly hearing a stereotype that older or younger people are useless, <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> people may begin to feel like dependent, non-contributing members of society. They may start to perceive themselves {{in terms of the}} looking-glass self—that is, in the same ways that others in society see them. Studies have also specifically shown that when <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> people hear these stereotypes about their supposed incompetence and uselessness, they perform worse on measures of competence and memory. These stereotypes then become self-fulfilling prophecies. According to Becca Levy's Stereotype Embodiment Theory, <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> people might also engage in self-stereotypes, taking their culture's age stereotypes—to which they have been exposed over the life course—and directing them inward toward themselves. Then this behavior reinforces the present stereotypes and treatment of the elderly.|$|R

Although the older Peach is kidnapped, Baby Peach is retrieved from the past into the present by Toadsworth, where she is nurtured by both the <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> renditions of him. Baby Bowser appeared {{near the beginning of}} the game in the past to kidnap Baby Peach, although his plans were halted by an encounter with the Mario brothers and a subsequent attack from the Shroobs. Baby Bowser harasses the quartet frequently during their journey by stealing their Cobalt Star shards, and later attacking the group with his older self. Kamek the Magikoopa, Petey Piranha and Fawful, an antagonist from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, appear in the game as well.|$|E

25|$|Generally, in the Middle Ages {{the breasts}} were {{minimized}} in dresses with straight bodices, full skirts and high necklines, designed primarily for function rather than emphasis on form.

Depictions of women in 14th- and 15th-century art show a high, rounded breast silhouette on women <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>young,</b> full-busted and small. This look is not possible without support. The 15th-century ideal form was small-breasted and full-figured, symbolizing abundance of fertility.|$|E

It examines (a) the relationship between customer satisfaction and service quality among elderly consumers, (b) differences in level of satisfaction between <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers, (c) differences in perception-of-service quality between <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers, <b>and</b> (d) differences in perception-of-service quality between elderly male and female customers. Statistically significant differences in levels of satisfaction were discovered between <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers, but no significant relationship was found between level of customer satisfaction and perceived service quality. There were significant differences in perceptions of service quality between <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers, <b>and</b> between male <b>and</b> female <b>older</b> customers. This study provides useful knowledge for restaurant managers about the differences between senior <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> customers.

25|$|The {{successor}} to Albert Sing had large shoes to fill; average performance {{was no longer}} acceptable to the discriminating Bernese supporters. Heinz Bigler and Hans Grütter took over the training until Hans Merkle ultimately succeeded Sing. Merkle had the misfortune to be measured against the championships of his predecessor. Although Geni Meier, Ernst Wechselberger and other players from the championship years continued to play, it mattered little. Merkle was a hard coach of the German school, however, {{and was able to}} keep YB in {{the top half of the}} table, with finishes of second, fifth, and seventh. The mixture of <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> players did not provide the results the Bernese sought, however.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{increasing}} amount {{of research on the}} effect of age on prospective memory where typical studies compare groups of people from different ages. A study by Smith et al. (2010) comparing event-based prospective memory in schoolchildren (7–10 years <b>old)</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> adults found that adults had better memory performance. Another study by Kvavilashvili et al. (2009) comparing time-based prospective memory among young adults (18- to 30-year-olds), young-old adults (60- to 75-year-olds) and old-old adults (76- to 90-year-olds) showed that young adults had better performance. Event-based prospective memory was further compared between young-old and old-old adults and findings were that young-old adults performed better than old-old adults. These studies suggested that there is continual improvement of prospective memory from childhood into young adulthood but that a decline begins in late adulthood.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 11 {{this young}} girl, {{daughter}} of the Laird of Bargarran, in the parish of Erskine, took a violent dislike to one Catherine Campbell, a domestic servant. Christian decided to achieve the death of Catherine by feigning possession by evil spirits, so she threw fits with violent contortions of her body and ejected egg-shells, fur balls, chicken bones, etc. forth from her mouth. So convincing was she, that she achieved {{a great deal of}} attention, and this encouraged her in the end to accuse twenty-four men and women, <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>young,</b> of taking an oath to follow Satan. Six were hung and then burned at Paisley and one committed suicide in gaol in 1697. Strangely several of her victims willingly confessed their pact with the Devil. This {{was one of the most}} cunning and diabolical episodes in the annals of witchcraft, however Christian was never held to account and went on to marry Mr. Millar, the minister of Kilmaurs from 1718 - 21 and after his death actually set the foundations for the thread manufacturing trade of Paisley.|$|E

25|$|Memory {{capabilities}} decline with age, {{evident in}} human degenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer's disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's fitness because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function. Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of oxidative damage {{and its implications for}} aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function.|$|E

500|$|He holds court {{before a}} circle of {{crouched}} and mostly terrified women, accepted by art historians as a coven of witches. Some bow their heads in fear, others look towards him in open-mouthed and rapt awe. Describing the women, art historian Brian McQuade writes that the [...] "sub-humanity of the gathered group is underlined by their bestial features and moronic stares". Satan's absolute power over the women {{has been compared to}} that of the king in Goya's 1815 The Junta of the Philippines, where authority is gained not from respect or personal charisma, but through fear and domination. The women are a mixture of <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>young,</b> and have similar twisted features; all but one are scowling, nervous and obsequious. Goya's use of tone to create atmosphere is reminiscent of both Velázquez and Jusepe de Ribera. The latter was an admirer of Caravaggio and utilised tenebrism and chiaroscuro. Goya learned from these sources, and from Rembrandt, some of whose prints he owned.|$|E
500|$|Queen Elizabeth {{had been}} widowed for {{only three years}} when Gilliat entered her service at her London {{residence}} of Clarence House, his obituary in The Independent credited him with helping her carve out a new role for herself and described his attitude: Like her, he took a genuine interest in the lives and doings of all with whom he came into contact and made them feel that they were important to him. He made no distinction between <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>young,</b> rich and poor, high and low, white and coloured. He thought the best of everyone [...] someone said of him, 'All Martin's geese are swans' [...] and treated them all alike. Gilliat was an expert at 'breaking the ice' between nervous guests and the Queen at her parties. Gilliat once deployed his skills at a party for the young Bhumibol Adulyadej, the King of Thailand, by asking the king to demonstrate his skill of standing on his head, which the King did.|$|E
