5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> and the elevation of the center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E

5|$|More generally, in {{a closed}} system of particles, all {{internal}} forces are balanced. The particles may accelerate with {{respect to each other}} but the center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> of the system will not accelerate.

5|$|The {{combined}} center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> does move {{slightly to}} the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual lean angle of the rear frame from the ideal lean angle {{described}} above. The actual lean angle between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> height. Bikes with fat tires and low center <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Masses in {{the breast}} can be located in digital mammogram images by {{computationally}} analysing various feature statistics from the image. Any algorithm used to analyse digital mammogram images can be both time-consuming and errorprone because many areas of these images appear to have features that are mass-like but not masses. Thus false positives are produced which detract from {{the effectiveness of the}} algorithm. In this paper an efficient-straightforward algorithm to locate and record suspicious areas in a mammogram image is presented. Mammography is at present one of the available method for early detection <b>of</b> <b>masses</b> or abnormalities which is related to breast cancer. The most common said abnormalities that may indicate breast cancer are masses and calcifications. The challenge is to early and accurately detect to overcome the development of breast cancer, which affects more and more women throughout the world. Masses appear in a mammogram as fine, granular clusters, which are often difficult to identify in a raw mammogram. Digital mammogram {{is one of the best}} technologies currently being used for diagnosing breast cancer. Breast cancer is diagnosed at advanced stages with the help of the digital mammogram image. In the paper a method is proposed to make a supporting tool to easy and less time consuming of identification <b>of</b> abnormal <b>masses</b> in digital mammography images. The technique uses a form of template matching at multiple scales to locate pixels in the image, which may be part <b>of</b> a <b>mass.</b> The resulting image is adaptively thresholded to a predetermined level of accuracy and then the remaining pixels are grouped together and extracted.
