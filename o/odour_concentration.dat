50|$|Wallraff’s {{gradient}} theory overcomes {{the problem}} of distance limitation via different means. It proposes the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. The foundation for this navigational map is a spatial representation in which two or more environmental odours have a particular intensity. Odour gradient differs along dissimilar directional axes and, therefore, the pigeon can compare {{the intensity of the}} scent at a particular location to its concentration at the home loft. This mechanism in principle could operate over vast distances, but would require the detection and interpretation of minute differences in <b>odour</b> <b>concentration.</b> However, a more poignant question is the existence of predictable odour gradients.

The specific objectives were to determine which compounds contributed most to the overall odour emanating from pharmaceutical industry, and develop equations for predicting <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> based on compound odour activity value (OAV). OAV is defined as the concentration of a single compound divided by the odour threshold for that compound. The larger the OAV, the more likely that compound would contribute to the overall odour of a complex odour mixture. According to the OAV and regression analyses, we concluded that acetaldehyde, acetone, ethanol and NH 3 were the most likely contributors to the odour in Western pharmaceutical sites. While for the traditional Chinese pharmaceutical site, acetaldehyde, acetone, H 2 S, methanal and ethanol were the most likely contributors to the overall odor.

40|$|Livestock odour {{has been}} an {{obstacle}} {{for the development of}} livestock industry. Air dispersion models have been applied to predict odour concentrations downwind from the livestock operations. However, most of the air dispersion models were designed for industry pollutants and can only predict hourly average concentrations of pollutants. Currently, a livestock odour dispersion model that can consider the difference between livestock odour and traditional air pollutants and can account for the short time fluctuations is not available. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a dispersion model that is designed specifically for livestock odour and is able to consider the short time <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> fluctuations. A livestock odour dispersion model (LODM) was developed based on Gaussian fluctuating plume theory to account for odour instantaneous fluctuations. The model has the capability to predict mean <b>odour</b> <b>concentration,</b> instantaneous <b>odour</b> <b>concentration,</b> peak <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> and the frequency of <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> that is equal to or above a certain level with the input of hourly routine meteorological data. LODM predicts odour frequency by a weighted odour exceeding half width method. A simple and effective method is created to estimate the odour frequency from multiple sources. Both Pasquill-Gifford and Hogstr¨¯m dispersion coefficients are applied in this model. The atmospheric condition is characterized by some derived parameters including friction velocity, sensible heat flux, M-O length, and mixing height. An advanced method adapted from AERMOD model is applied to derive these parameters. An easy to use procedure is generated and utilized to deal with the typical meteorological data input as ISC met file. LODM accepts and only requires routine meteorological data. It has the ability to process individual or multiple sources which could be elevated point sources, ground level sources, livestock buildings, manure storages, and manure land applications. It can also deal with constant and varied emission rates. Moreover, the model considers the relationships between odour intensity and odour concentrations in the model. Finally, the model is very easy to use with a friendly interface. Model evaluations and validations against field plume measurement data and ISCST 3 and CALPUFF models indicate that LODM can achieve fairly good <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> and odour frequency predictions. The sensitivity analyses demonstrate a medium sensitivity of LODM to the controllable odour source parameters, such as stack height, diameter, exit velocity, exit temperature, and emission rate. This shows that the model has a great potential for application on resolving odour issues from livestock operations. From that perspective, {{the most effective way to}} reduce odour problems from livestock buildings is to lessen the odour emission rate (e. g. biofiltration of exhaust air, diet changes) ...|$|E

40|$|Odour {{emission}} of livestock buildings {{is of interest}} for the residents {{in the vicinity of}} animal husbandry due to its annoying potential. To apply a Gauss dispersion model to odour emissions, the emission parameters have to be known. The emission parameters of a mechanically ventilated livestock building, the odour flow and the volume flow of the outlet air, are calculated by combining a steady-state balance model to assess the outlet air temperature and the volume flow with a simple model for the odour release inside the livestock building. In the following, these emission parameters are used as input to a Gauss dispersion model adapted for odour, calculating the separation distance necessary to avoid annoyance. The calculations were done for a two-year period based on half hour values of the emission and meteorological parameters. The results show a distinct diurnal and annual variation of the <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> due to the variability of the volume flow. The mean <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> during daytime in the summer months lies in a very narrow range close to the overall minimum. <b>Odour</b> <b>concentration</b> derived from odour emission and the maximum volume flow of the animal house is useful for model calculations. During a clear-sky summer period, the model predicts a night-time <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> of about 4. 6 times the daytime concentration due to the reduced volume flow at night. To improve the calculation of odour concentrations by dispersion models, the annual and diurnal variation of the odour release has to be taken into account.

Microorganisms commonly found in wastewater can degrade sulphurous compounds. Therefore, the use of activated sludge (AS) for odour control offers an alternative to traditional waste gas treatment processes, such as biofilters, bioscrubbers and biotrickling filters, both in practical terms (use of existing facilities) and economically (minimal capital cost). The performance of AS diffusion as a bioscrubber for removing H 2 S at concentrations at 25, 75 and 150 ppmv was evaluated.

40|$|Odour {{emission}} from landfill areas has a {{high potential}} to cause significant annoyance to people living in their surroundings. In order to avoid odour nuisance, {{it is crucial to}} select the best location in the project phase of these facilities. In the present work, two different atmospheric dispersion models were employed to predict odour impact from a projected landfill area and a waste treatment facility. The first model used was a simplified Gaussian Atmospheric Dispersion model developed by the authors. Calculated <b>odour</b> <b>concentrations</b> were represented using GIS tools (Esri ®ArcMapTM software). Regarding to the second model, it was a commercial bi-Gaussian Atmospheric Dispersion one. The odour impact of the waste treatment facility is expected to be low, because of the high efficiency of air biofiltration treatments and the dispersion effect of the stack. The shape and the reach of odour percentile contours were quite similar, providing coherent results between two models. Concerning the landfill installation, <b>odour</b> <b>concentrations</b> were modelled for the prevailing winds. The results obtained with both models differ in the reach of odour. The maximum distance obtained by the simple dispersion model was 1. 5 km, compared with the almost 5 km modelled by the commercial bi-Gaussian one. The reasons of this disparity could be caused by the difference in the dispersion coefficients employed in the two models and also an error related to ground level emission. In addition, the meteorological conditions in the Mediterranean typically present a high proportion of calm winds, which provided worse dispersion results and did not reflect the real odour dispersion. Odour emission rate seems to be overestimated, and this could explain the high distance reached by odour. Field measurements are required when landfill installation becomes operational, {{in order to determine the}} real impact of odour.

Odour Emission Factors (OEFs) {{can be developed}} in analogy with the emission factors defined for other chemical compounds, which relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the atmosphere to a given associated activity. Landfills typically represent a common source of odour complaint; for this reason, the development of specific OEFs allowing the estimation of odour emissions from this kind of source would be of great interest both for the landfill design and management. This study proposes an up-to-date methodology {{for the development of}} an OEF for the estimation of odour emissions from landfills, thereby focusing on the odour emissions related to the emissions of landfill gas (LFG) from the exhausted landfill surface. The proposed approach is an “indirect” approach based on the quantification of the LFG emissions from methane concentration measurements carried out on an Italian landfill. The Odour Emission Rate (OER) is then obtained by multiplying the emitted gas flow rate by the LFG <b>odour</b> <b>concentration.</b> The <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> of the LFG emitted through the landfill surface was estimated by means of an ad hoc correlation investigated between methane concentration and <b>odour</b> <b>concentration.</b> The OEF for the estimation of odour emissions from landfill surfaces was computed, considering the landfill surface as the activity index, as the product between the mean specific LFG flux emitted through the surface resulting from the experimental campaigns, equal to 0. 39  l/m 2 /h, and its <b>odour</b> <b>concentration,</b> which was estimated to be equal to 105 ′ 000 eq. ouE/m 3, thus giving an OEF of 0. 011 ouE/m 2 /s.

Activated carbon adsorbents were prepared from millet and sorghum straws by chemical activation with phosphoric acid and used for the removal of aqueous phenol. The abilities of the carbon adsorbents to remove phenol from contaminated water were determined by aqueous phase phenol adsorption. Equilibrium concentrations of phenol were monitored, using Cole UV 7504 Spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 269 nm. The adsorption data fitted the Freundlich isotherm and indicated multilayer adsorption of aqueous phenol on the carbon beds. The maximum adsorption capacities of the granular activated carbon from the cellulosic precursors were 80. 36 and 82. 34 mg/g of carbon from millet and sorghum straws respectively. The results suggest the suitability of the carbon adsorbents in community water detoxification protocols to remove phenol...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} odour {{responses}} of insect olfactory (or odorant) receptor neurons (ORN) of blowfly (Calliphora vicina), mosquito (Aedes communis), fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis) and large pine weevil (Hylobius abietis). A power-law dependence (similar to Stevens' law in psychophysics) was obtained for the action potential rate of ORN responses vs. <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> in measurements with metal microelectrodes from blowfly ORNs and an analysis system was developed for the extracellularily recorded action potentials (or nerve pulses). Odour exposure sequences were used to study action potential rates quantitatively as a function of <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> in air exposure. For an odour exposure sequence, a known initial amount of the odour compound in a filter paper inside a Pasteur pipette at the beginning of repeated exposures caused a gradual dilution of the <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> in the exposure sequence. The concentration at each exposure was calculated according to the discrete multiple headspace extraction and dilution (DMHED) method. The estimated <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> was assumed to obey in the method an exponential law with respect to the exposure number in the sequence. Despite that many uncontrollable parameters remain for measuring quantitatively the characteristics of the ORNs, the results obtained, e. g., sensitivity, specificity, adaptability, and the power-law realation are both biologically and technically very interesting. A time-to-voltage converter (TVC) was utilized for the response analysis in determining action potential intervals originating from a single ORN. A precision analysis of TVC was also performed. With the mosquito (Aedes communis), fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis) and large pine weevil (Hylobius abietis) antennae were tested for inhibitory and excitatory effects to find out repellents and attractants. Human sweat was found to cause strong stimulus exposure in the responses of the mosquito ORNs and Neutroil® caused inhibitory responses in pine weevil ORNs, respectively. The power-law exponents for blowfly ORNs were about 0. 19 in the case of 1 -hexanol (HX), 0. 065 in the case of 1, 4 -diaminobutane (14 DAB) and 0. 32 in the case of butyric acid (BA). The corresponding Stevens' law exponent values 0. 39 and 0. 33 have been reported for HX and BA, respectively, by Patte et al. (1975) ...|$|E
40|$|Odour from {{agricultural}} activities, such as {{the spreading}} of manure and the housing of animals, is increasingly being considered a nuisance in densely populated countries like the Netherlands. The objective {{of this research was}} to study the odour removal from pig house exhaust air by a biotrickling filter that had been implemented for ammonia abatement. At a regular pig production farm, the performance of a running full-scale biotrickling filter was studied for 72 days. Ammonia and odour removal efficiency were on average 79 % and 49 % respectively. Ammonia removal appeared to be based on an unintended accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in the system, instead of on production and discharge of nitrate. The odour removal efficiency showed a large variation that, for a major part, about 80 %, could be attributed to actual changes in the performance of the biotrickling filter. These changes were probably caused by variations in the composition of the air that were not completely reflected by the olfactometrically measured <b>odour</b> <b>concentration,</b> as the many different components that make up the odour each have different removal characteristics. It seemed that the biotrickling filter was operated below its maximum absolute odour removal capacity [OUE/(m(3) filter) /s], which means that the absolute odour removal will probably rise at increasing load. It was, however, not possible to distinguish between the influence of either the odour load or the <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> on the odour removal, because of a positive correlation between the <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> and the air flow. To increase the odour removal efficiency (%), the design of the filter probably needs to be optimised for both well and poorly water-soluble odour components...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} to assess health risks and odour annoyance {{was commissioned by}} the Province of Drenthe in response to concern of residents about possible health effects due to emissions from a planned asphalt plant near Meppel. Data from emission measurements on other asphalt plants were {{used to calculate the}} concentrations and deposition of hazardous compounds (including fine particles and PAHs) {{in the area of the}} planned plant using an air dispersion model. <b>Odour</b> <b>concentration</b> levels were calculated as well. Levels of hazardous compound were calculated for both the average situation and worst-case conditions. The exposure of residents to compounds emitted from the asphalt plant was quantified and compared to toxicological limits. The results showed that the concentrations and deposition of emitted compounds scarcely exceed background levels in rural and urban areas. The exposure of residents and employees of companies in the surrounding area is below the toxicological guidelines. Also, the expected <b>odour</b> <b>concentration</b> levels do not exceed the limits for odour annoyance. Hence, no unacceptable odour annoyance is expected...|$|E
40|$|Replicable {{experimental}} studies using a novel experimental facility and a machine-based odour quantification technique {{were conducted to}} demonstrate the relationship between odour emission rates and pond loading rates. The odour quantification technique consisted of an electronic nose, AromaScan A 32 S, and an artificial neural network. <b>Odour</b> <b>concentrations</b> determined by olfactometry were used along with the AromaScan responses to train the artificial neural network. The trained network was able to predict the odour emission rates for the test data with a correlation coefficient of 0. 98. Time averaged odour emission rates predicted by the machine-based odour quantification technique, were strongly correlated with volatile solids loading rate, demonstrating the increased magnitude of emissions from a heavily loaded effluent pond. However, {{it was not possible}} to obtain the same relationship between volatile solids loading rates and odour emission rates from the individual data. It is concluded that taking a limited number of odour samples over a short period is unlikely to provide a representative rate of odour emissions from an effluent pond. A continuous odour monitoring instrument will be required for that more demanding task...|$|R
40|$|Rice’s {{theory for}} the {{statistical}} properties of random noise currents has been {{employed in the}} context of concentration fluctuations in dispersing plumes. Within this context, the theory has been extended to calculate the distribution of excursion times above a small threshold for arbitrary spacings between an up-crossing and the successive down-crossing. This approach has then been applied to a second-order stochastic model for the evolution of <b>odour</b> <b>concentrations</b> and their time derivative (simple model), and to the superstatistics extension of this model [Reynolds (2007) Phys. Fluids]. In agreement with the measurements of Yee and coworkers [Yee et al. (1993) Boundary-Layer Meteorol. 65, Yee et al. (1994) J. Appl. Meteorol. 33], both formulations predict a distribution of excursion times that can be well approximated by a power-law profile with exponent close to − 3 / 2. For the superstatistical model the power-law profile extends over approximately three or more decades, for the simple model this range is smaller. Compared to the simple model, predictions for the superstatistical model are in a better agreement with the measurements...|$|R
40|$|Geosmin and 2 -methylisoborneol (MIB) {{are two of}} the causative {{compounds}} {{responsible for}} the earthy/musty odour prob-lem in drinking water. They are a major concern for the water treatment industry because they are difficult to remove by conventional water treatment practices and are fairly resistant to chemical oxidation. Various studies have been conducted at both bench and full scale to examine the removal of these compounds by adsorption and/or biological filtration. Lack of study at realistic <b>odour</b> compound <b>concentrations</b> and disregard for losses of these compounds by other means (i. e., volatilization or adsorption) represent some of the limitations of such studies. The bench-scale investigation reported herein focussed on system design and minimization of system losses. The results indicated that the preferred system design included the use of Teflon feed bottles, Teflon tubing, and a glass filter column in which the influent feed line descended close to the media surface. Such a design minimized system losses of both geosmin and MIB to 42 and 30 %, respectively, based on target influent concentrations of 200 ng/L.
