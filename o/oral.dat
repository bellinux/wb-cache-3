5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of <b>oral</b> ulceration, recurrent <b>oral</b> ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent <b>oral</b> ulceration with no prior history.|$|E

5|$|On 23 January 2007, Fijación <b>Oral,</b> Vol. 1 and <b>Oral</b> Fixation, Vol. 2 were {{released}} as a three-disc box set, titled <b>Oral</b> Fixation, Vol. 1 & 2. Each record {{was on a}} separate disc, and was packaged with a DVD featuring music videos and live recordings of album tracks. The compilation peaked at numbers 13 and 27 on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums and Top Latin Albums charts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oral</b> {{medications}} and mechanical devices {{are the first}} choice in treatment because they are less invasive, are often effective, and are well tolerated. <b>Oral</b> medications include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E
5|$|Sodium lauryl {{sulphate}} (SLS), a detergent {{present in}} some brands of toothpaste and other <b>oral</b> healthcare products, may produce <b>oral</b> ulceration in some individuals. It {{has been shown}} that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a SLS-free toothpaste is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in <b>oral</b> hygiene products, there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E
5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of <b>oral</b> ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent <b>oral</b> ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from <b>oral</b> ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated <b>oral</b> ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause <b>oral</b> ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E

5|$|Because the <b>oral</b> {{polio vaccine}} is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus {{in areas where}} it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the <b>oral</b> polio vaccine reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with <b>oral</b> polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin {{preparations}} for <b>oral</b> administration include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and <b>oral</b> suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). <b>Oral</b> suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, {{due to its}} extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment.|$|E

5|$|Globally, as of 2009, {{approximately}} 60% {{of those}} who are married and able to have children use birth control. How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries. The most common method in the developed world is condoms and <b>oral</b> contraceptives, while in Africa it is <b>oral</b> contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization. In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via <b>oral</b> contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.|$|E

5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} the budding of new polyps. There {{are two types of}} budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp {{develops}} on the <b>oral</b> disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate <b>oral</b> disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated <b>oral</b> disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E

5|$|The central {{themes of}} the mythology of Chhinnamasta are her self-sacrifice– with a {{maternal}} aspect (in the Pranatoshini Tantra versions) or {{for the welfare of}} the world (in the Samudra manthan <b>oral</b> version described above)– her sexual dominance (second Pranatoshini Tantra version), and her self-destructive fury (in the first <b>oral</b> legend).|$|E
5|$|WCSP-FM is {{the first}} radio station to {{broadcast}} audiotape of historical U.S. Supreme Court <b>oral</b> arguments, with announcers explaining the court decision {{at the end of}} the recording. The broadcasts of the Supreme Court arguments have provided listeners in the U.S. and Canada with the opportunity to hear spoken words during <b>oral</b> arguments for several of the Court's most influential cases, including the Texas v. Johnson argument over flag-burning in 1989, and the Miranda v. Arizona argument in 1966. In September 2010 the Supreme Court began releasing audio recordings of the week's <b>oral</b> arguments each Friday, thereby allowing C-SPAN Radio to broadcast a selection of current arguments. Prior to this arrangement, recordings of <b>oral</b> arguments were occasionally made available on a same-day basis, which C-SPAN would request in cases of high public interest.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oral</b> sex, {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>oral</b> intercourse, is sexual activity involving the stimulation of the genitalia of a person by another person using the mouth (including the lips, tongue or teeth) or throat. Cunnilingus is <b>oral</b> sex performed on a female, while fellatio is <b>oral</b> sex performed on a male. Anilingus, another form of <b>oral</b> sex, is <b>oral</b> stimulation of a person's anus. <b>Oral</b> stimulation of {{other parts of the body}} (as in kissing and licking) is usually not considered <b>oral</b> sex.|$|E
25|$|Tanzania's {{literary}} {{culture is}} primarily <b>oral.</b> Major <b>oral</b> literary forms include folktales, poems, riddles, proverbs, and songs. The greatest part of Tanzania's recorded <b>oral</b> literature is in Swahili, even though {{each of the}} country's languages has its own <b>oral</b> tradition. The country's <b>oral</b> literature has been declining because of {{the breakdown of the}} multigenerational social structure, making transmission of <b>oral</b> literature more difficult, and because increasing modernisation has been accompanied by the devaluation of <b>oral</b> literature.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{antibiotic}} therapy for less-severe Clostridium difficile colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) consists of <b>oral</b> metronidazole or <b>oral</b> vancomycin.

25|$|During the opposition, <b>oral</b> {{proceedings}} {{may take}} place {{at the request of the}} EPO or at the request of any party to the proceedings, i.e. the patentee or an opponent. The <b>oral</b> proceedings are held before the Opposition Division itself. They are held in Munich, the Hague or Berlin, and are public unless very particular circumstances apply. This contrasts with <b>oral</b> proceedings held before an Examining Division, which are not public. The list of public <b>oral</b> proceedings in opposition before the EPO is available on its web site. The right to <b>oral</b> proceedings is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard. A decision is often taken at the end of the <b>oral</b> proceedings.|$|E
