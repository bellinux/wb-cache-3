The cathedral was closed for four years while President Plutarco Elías Calles attempted to enforce Mexico's anti-religious laws. Pope Pius XI closed the church, ordering priests to cease their public religious duties in all Mexican churches. After the Mexican government and the papacy came to terms and major renovations were performed on the cathedral, it reopened in 1930.|$|E

The population tripled; many new palaces, monasteries, mansions, and streets were built, and the city was the centre <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> life of the region. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart gave a concert in 1762 in the Pálffy Palace. Joseph Haydn performed in 1784 in the Grassalkovich Palace. Ludwig van Beethoven was a guest in 1796 in the Keglević Palace.|$|E

The Limburg Principles have been extensively used in national legal systems as an interpretive tool for establishing violations <b>of</b> economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights. The Maastricht Guidelines {{build on the}} Limburg Principles and identify the legal implications of acts and omissions which are violations <b>of</b> economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights. Various United Nations Special Rapporteurs have influenced the normative development <b>of</b> economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights. Appointed by the Commission on Human Rights and its sub-commissions, key rapporteurs include the Special Rapporteur on the Realization <b>of</b> Economic, <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cultural</b> Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women.|$|R

40|$|Is {{the neglect}} <b>of</b> economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> abuses in {{international}} criminal law a problem of positive international law or the result of choices made by lawyers involved in mechanisms such as criminal prosecutions or truth commissions? Evelyne Schmid explores this question via {{an assessment of the}} relationship between violations <b>of</b> economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights <b>and</b> international crimes. Based on a thorough examination of the elements of international crimes, she demonstrates how a situation can simultaneously be described as a violation <b>of</b> economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights <b>and</b> as an international crime. Against the background of the emerging debates on selectivity in {{international criminal law}} and the role of socio-economic <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> abuses in transitional justice, she argues that international crimes overlapping with violations <b>of</b> economic, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights deserve to be taken seriously, for much the same reasons as other international crimes...|$|R

25|$|In 1930 (1309 AH), {{after months}} of {{cultural}} stagnation, a group of writers founded the Herat Literary Circle. A year later, another group calling itself the Kabul Literary Circle was founded in the capital. Both groups published regular magazines dedicated to culture and Persian literature. Both, especially the Kabul publication, had little success in becoming venues for modern Persian poetry and writing. In time, the Kabul publication turned into a stronghold for traditional writers and poets, and modernism in Dari literature was pushed to the fringes <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> life.|$|E

During the numerous years of Dutch economic growth the average GDP per capita increased by 0.18 per cent per annum; at about 1810 the growth rate was about 1 per cent annually. Amsterdam became the hub of world trade, the center into which staples such as rye and luxuries flowed for sorting, processing, and distribution, and then were reexported around Europe and the world.|$|E

Even though individuals in the United States are legally capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals have the ability to connect, but have nonfunctioning capabilities in {{that they do not have}} the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them.|$|E

25|$|Hobart's {{first major}} {{problems}} {{came with the}} combination of a general economic downturn in the 1840s, followed by the Victorian gold rush of the early 1850s. Large-scale migration to the Victorian goldfields occurred, creating a shortfall in local labour resources. As a response, the once booming economy of Hobart began to decline. Despite the economic and population declines of the early 1850s, the decade proved to be one <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> advancement for the young city. Transportation of convicts to Van Diemen's Land was abolished in 1853, and calls for responsible self-government were successful, with a new constitution drafted, and Van Diemen's Land became an independent British Colony in 1856. The new colony immediately changed its name to Tasmania, to disassociate itself with its past as a penal colony.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{cannot be}} defined only by {{statistics}} and reports, {{such as the}} poverty line, {{to see whether or}} not people are impoverished in their respective countries. The concept <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational gender segregation and widening of the gender wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty.|$|E
25|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, Bourdieu employs some {{terminology used}} in economics {{to analyze the}} processes <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> reproduction, of how {{the various forms of}} capital tend to transfer {{from one generation to the}} next. For Bourdieu, formal education represents the key example of this process. Educational success, according to Bourdieu, entails a whole range of cultural behaviour, extending to ostensibly non-academic features like gait, dress, or accent. Privileged children have learned this behaviour, as have their teachers. Children of unprivileged backgrounds have not. The children of privilege therefore fit the pattern of their teachers' expectations with apparent 'ease'; they are 'docile'. The unprivileged are found to be 'difficult', to present 'challenges'. Yet both behave as their upbringing dictates. Bourdieu regards this 'ease', or 'natural' ability—distinction—as in fact the product of a great social labour, largely on the part of the parents. It equips their children with the dispositions of manner as well as thought which ensure they are able to succeed within the educational system and can then reproduce their parents' class position in the wider social system.|$|E
