25|$|Although CSX {{no longer}} was interested, the state has plans to restore the {{remainder}} of the line for freight service. This would include rehabilitation of the Running Track and Terminal Yard from Bay Junction to Summer Street, as well as restoring {{the end of the line}} through the Boston Marine Industrial Park. Possibilities initially raised in mid-2009 included service to Conley Terminal or the Massport Marine Terminal via new spurs from Track 61. The City of Boston applied for $84M in TIGER funds in 2009, including $14M for expansion of Track 61. The existing <b>out-of-service</b> <b>track</b> paralleling Dry Dock Avenue through Black Falcon Cruise Terminal and the International Cargo Port Boston (totalling 2,860 linear feet) would have been rehabilitated, and 5,910 linear feet of new track constructed along Tide Street and Fid Kennedy Avenue into the Massport Marine Terminal. The application was unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|Before its {{abandonment}} in 1970, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad's Hastings & Dakota Subdivision {{went through}} the center of Lakeville and served various industries. Short-line railroad Progressive Rail is based in Lakeville, and owns the right-of-way of the MN&S Subdivision between Lakeville and Northfield. Between Lakeville and Savage the MN&S Subdivision is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway, but has been out of service since the 1990s. In 2009 Progressive Rail began using a segment of the <b>out-of-service</b> <b>tracks</b> for railcar storage, causing local controversy. The Dan Patch Corridor would go through Lakeville, but has been banned from discussion and funding by the Minnesota State Legislature since 2002. The City of Lakeville opposes public funding of a passenger rail line on the MN&S Subdivision through the community.|$|R
50|$|McHenry station {{consists}} of one platform and two tracks. One track {{is used by}} revenue trains while the other is used as siding for <b>out-of-service</b> trains. The <b>tracks</b> continue to Barnard Mill Road in Ringwood, Illinois, where the Union Pacific McHenry Subdivision ends. The tracks were pulled up between Richmond, Illinois and McHenry in 1980 when service was cut back, however, UP left trackage for local freight trains that served industries in and around McHenry. The final local on this line ran in 2006 and the line has been Metra-only ever since.|$|R
