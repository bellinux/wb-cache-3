5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel.

5|$|After winning 15 {{games again}} in 1927, Aldridge {{expected}} a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss traded {{him to the}} New York Giants on February 11, 1928, for Burleigh Grimes, citing Aldridge's 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a reason not {{to give him a}} raise. He held out for much of the year; by the time he returned, he was out <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> and pitched poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead. His final game was on August 29, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Although out <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> {{and with}} arthritic knees, Nash {{announced}} that he was making a football comeback in 1945. He sought to return to South Melbourne, rather than Camberwell, but Camberwell declined Nash's transfer application and both clubs stated that they would be naming Nash in their respective sides for Round 1. An impediment to Nash's return to South Melbourne arose as a result of Nash having played two games for his old boy scout troop, the 6th Melbourne Scouts, while on leave in mid-1942; these games were considered competitive, and playing in them meant that Nash had not sat out of football for the three years required to serve the suspension he had received for crossing to Camberwell without a clearance. After an appeal by South Melbourne, a special meeting of the VFL was held to amend the rules so ex-servicemen would not be penalised for playing in minor matches. The amendment was made the day before the commencement of the 1945 season, allowing Nash to take his place for South Melbourne in their Round 1.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{mathematical}} morphology {{the tree}} <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> a gray level {{image is a}} versatile representation that allows for multiple powerful applications. That structure is highly interest-ing {{because it is a}} self-dual representation invariant by contrast changes and since many authors state that object contours are well described by level lines. Such a representation has not yet been defined (thus used) on color images because a priori a total order on colors is required that really make sense on data. In this paper we propose a solution to obtain a tree <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> on color images without resorting to an ordering of colors. To that aim we relax the definition <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> and we show that relevant applications follow from our proposal.

5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover <b>of</b> <b>Shape</b> Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. On one hand the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E

40|$|Shape evolutions, {{as well as}} shape {{matchings}} or {{image segmentation}} with shape prior, involve the preliminary choice of a suitable metric in the space <b>of</b> <b>shapes.</b> Instead <b>of</b> choosing a particular one, we propose a framework to learn shape metrics from a set <b>of</b> examples <b>of</b> <b>shapes,</b> designed {{to be able to}} handle sparse sets <b>of</b> highly varying <b>shapes,</b> since typical shape datasets, like human silhouettes, are intrinsically high-dimensional and non-dense. We formulate the task of finding the optimal metrics on an empirical manifold <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> as a classical minimization problem ensuring smoothness, and compute its global optimum fast. First, we design a criterion to compute point-to-point matching between shapes which deals with topological changes. Then, given a training set <b>of</b> <b>shapes,</b> we use these matchings to transport deformations observed on any shape to any other one. Finally, we estimate the metric in the tangent space <b>of</b> any <b>shape,</b> based on transported deformations, weighted by their reliability.

5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Past {{hypotheses}} {{have suggested}} mistakenly that the Golondrina was a descendant or {{variant of the}} Plainview type. Although the two points exhibit similarities, particularly in terms <b>of</b> <b>shape,</b> they are now recognized as separate types. Identification is made {{from a lack of}} an auriculated, fishtail base on the Plainview and a deeper basal concavity on the Golondrina. Plainview points may have served to bring down large bison, while Golondrina points may have been used for killing smaller game such as deer, as well as doubling as a butchering knife. Compared to the split-stem hafting style of the Golondrina point without a deep setting, the shape of the Plainview points would necessitate them being set relatively deeply into a socketed haft that once bound would leave less of the cutting edge exposed. Stratigraphic evidence from the St. Mary's Hall site in southern, central Texas implies that Golondrina may have superseded Plainview on the southern Plains.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E
