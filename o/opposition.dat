5|$|This {{is a list}} of Australian Leaders of the <b>Op{{position}}.</b> The Leader of the <b>Opposition</b> in Australian Federal Politics is a Member of Parliament in the House of Representatives. The {{position is}} held by the leader of the party not in government that has the most seats in the House. When in parliament, the Leader of the <b>Opposition</b> sits on the left-hand side of the centre table, in front of the <b>Opposition</b> and opposite the Prime Minister. The <b>Opposition</b> Leader is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new <b>Opposition</b> Leader may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership.|$|E
40|$|The article {{embraces the}} study of {{structural}} syntactic features of undetached appositions in Modern English. The main aim of the investigation is to study role and place of <b>oppositions</b> in the English linguistics. The thoughts of the scholars in {{the study of}} <b>oppositions,</b> the determination of <b>oppositions</b> as to their types and functions, terms related to the <b>oppositions</b> are differently used by scholars. Having mentioned all these varieties in the determination of appositions, we have offered the terms undetached and detached <b>oppositions,</b> instead of other terms offered by other scholars. In the scope of the study consideration of the problem among the Azerbaijani-English studying scholars has taken place as well. Investigations show {{that there is not a}} unanimous determination of <b>oppositions</b> and usage of terminology related to the <b>oppositions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recently, musicologists Linda Austern and Suzanne Cusick have {{examined}} the socio-cultural implications of gender issues in Renaissance music. Drawing on Cusick's research on gender-based binary <b>oppositions</b> in Italy and Austern's studies of women and music in England, I propose a related set of gender binary <b>oppositions</b> in English society. I apply these <b>oppositions</b> in detail to two specific works from the Elizabethan madrigal and lute song repertoire, then examine the remaining pieces from these collections {{as a whole and}} find that an overlap of four particular <b>oppositions</b> better captures the contradictory nature of the music. Examining pieces that fall into each category, I observe how the composer manipulates each to complicate the piece's gender character. I conclude that while binary <b>oppositions</b> grasp the artistic and political trends of an era, {{a closer look at the}} tensions at work between them provides a more nuanced view of the music's gender character...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} binary <b>oppositions</b> underlying the mechanisms of natural computation understood as dynamical processes on natural information morphologies. Of special interest are the <b>oppositions</b> of discrete vs. continuous, structure vs. process, and differentiation vs. integration. The framework used is that of computing nature, where all natural processes {{at different levels of}} organisation are computations over informational structures. The interactions at different levels of granularity/organisation in nature, and the character of the phenomena that unfold through those interactions, are modeled from the perspective of an observing agent. This brings us to the movement from binary <b>oppositions</b> to dynamic networks built upon mutually related binary <b>oppositions,</b> where each node has several properties...|$|R

Therefore, the voters in the <b>opposition</b> ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

We say that segregation of <b>oppositions</b> is a basic component {{of the structure of}} dialectical thinking, the one that is extremely important at the pre-school age. This ability appears to be essential for the formation and implementation of dialectical actions. With that, once formed and rigidly fixed, for example, through some specifics of the educational environment, representation of <b>oppositions</b> might result in development of formal logical constructions...|$|R
