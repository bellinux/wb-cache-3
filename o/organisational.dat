5|$|Apocryphal and semi-legendary anecdotal stories {{surround}} {{the creation of}} Levski's Internal Revolutionary Organisation. Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 Turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture, Levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels. For example, he {{is known to have}} dyed his hair and to have worn a variety of national costumes. In the autumn of 1871, Levski and Angel Kanchev published the Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People, a BRCC draft statute containing ideological, <b>organisational</b> and penal sections. It was sent out to the local committees and to the diasporic community for discussion. The political and <b>organisational</b> experience that Levski amassed is evident in his correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872; at the time, his views on the revolution had clearly matured.|$|E
5|$|Berger had {{achieved}} {{the rank of}} Major der Reserve in the Wehrmacht by 1938, but his initial rank upon joining the Allgemeine SS was SS-Standartenführer, based upon his SA service.

5|$|During the 1964 ouster {{to remove}} Khrushchev as First Secretary and Premier, Podgorny and Brezhnev {{appealed to the}} Central Committee, blaming Khrushchev for {{economic}} failures and accusing him of voluntarism and immodest behavior. Influenced by Brezhnev and his allies, Politburo members voted to remove Khrushchev from office. In the aftermath of Khrushchev's removal, a collective leadership was formed, headed by Brezhnev as First Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as head of government, and Anastas Mikoyan as head of state. Before becoming head of state, Podgorny served as the party's Second Secretary, and was therefore {{in charge of the}} Party's <b>Organisational</b> Division. In this capacity, Podgorny threatened Brezhnev's position as First Secretary because the <b>Organisational</b> Division, if Podgorny chose so, could easily be turned into his own power base within the party. Brezhnev allied himself with Alexander Shelepin, the KGB chairman, to oppose both Podgorny and Kosygin.|$|E
