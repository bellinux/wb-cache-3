We present <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> measurements for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams with the square field sizes ranging from 0. 5 to 10 cm 2. The size of the air gap above the MP 512 detector was changed from 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 2, 2. 0 and 2. 6 mm. We compare the output factors measurements of the MP 512 with EBT 3 film and the MOSkin dosimeter. For the two photon energies investigated, {{we find that the}} <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> measured by the MP 512 reduce with increasing air gap and reducing of field size. The reduction in <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> is most pronounced for the 0. 5 and 1 cm 2 field sizes. The air gap of 0. 5 mm and 1. 2 mm showed good agreement with the EBT 3 film and MOSkin <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> for 6 and 10 MV photon fields, respectively. The negligible effect on dosimetry for the field sizes larger than 4 x 4 cm 2 demonstrates that the electronic disequilibrium caused by small air gap only influences the dosimetry measurements for small fields.

Methods - Relative output factors were measured for Brainlab SRS cones ranging in diameters from 4 to 30 mm 2 on a Novalis Trilogy linear accelerator with 6 MV SRS x-rays. The relative <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> was determined from an experimental reducing circular region of interest (ROI) extrapolation technique developed to remove the effects of volume averaging. This was achieved by scanning EBT 3 film measurements with high scanning resolution of 1200 DPI. From the high resolution scans, the size of the circular regions of interest was varied to produce a plot of relative output factors versus area of analysis. The plot was then extrapolated to zero to determine the relative <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> corresponding to zero volume.

40|$|Introduction The {{consistency}} of measuring small field output factors is greatly increased by reporting the measured dosimetric field size of each factor, {{as opposed to}} simply stating the nominal field size [1] and therefore requires the measurement of cross-axis profiles in a water tank. However, this makes <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> measurements time consuming. This project establishes at which field size the accuracy of output factors are not affected {{by the use of}} potentially inaccurate nominal field sizes, which we believe establishes a practical working definition of a ‘small’ field. The physical components of the radiation beam that contribute to the rapid change in <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> at small field sizes are examined in detail. The physical interaction that dominates the cause of the rapid dose reduction is quantified, and leads to the establishment of a theoretical definition of a ‘small’ field.

40|$|Introduction Due {{to their}} high spatial {{resolution}} diodes {{are often used}} for small field relative <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> measurements. However, a field size specific correction factor [1] is required and corrects for diode detector over-response at small field sizes. A recent Monte Carlo based study has shown {{that it is possible}} to design a diode detector that produces measured relative output factors that are equivalent to those in water. This is accomplished by introducing an air gap at the upstream end of the diode [2]. The aim of this study was to physically construct this diode by placing an ‘air cap’ on the end of a commercially available diode (the PTW 60016 electron diode). The output factors subsequently measured with the new diode design were compared to current benchmark small field <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> measurements. Methods A water-tight ‘cap’ was constructed so that it could be placed over the upstream end of the diode. The cap was able to be offset from the end of the diode, thus creating an air gap. The air gap width was the same as the diode width (7 mm) and the thickness of the air gap could be varied. <b>Output</b> <b>factor</b> measurements were made using square field sizes of side length from 5 to 50 mm, using a 6 MV photon beam. The set of <b>output</b> <b>factor</b> measurements were repeated with the air gap thickness set to 0, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 mm. The optimal air gap thickness was found in a similar manner to that proposed by Charles et al. [2]. An IBA stereotactic field diode, corrected using Monte Carlo calculated kq,clin,kq,msr values [3] was used as the gold standard. Results The optimal air thickness required for the PTW 60016 electron diode was 1. 0 mm. This was close to the Monte Carlo predicted value of 1. 15 mm 2.

40|$|Degraded {{electron}} beams, as {{used for}} intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) or similar complicated dosimetric situations, have different characteristics compared to conventional electron therapy beams. If international dosimetry protocols are applied {{in a direct}} manner to such degraded beams, uncertainties will be introduced in the absorbed dose determination. The Monte Carlo method {{has been used to}} verify experimentally determined relative absorbed dose distributions and <b>output</b> <b>factors</b> in an IORT geometry. Monte Carlo generated dose distributions are mostly within +/- 2 % or +/- 2 mm of measured data. The simulated output variation between the IORT cones (relative <b>output</b> <b>factors)</b> are mostly within 2 % of measured values. By comparing IORT and conventional electron beam characteristics (e. g. energy spectra, angular distributions and the contributions of different system components to these quantities) limitations and uncertainties of commonly used dosimetric techniques in IORT electron fields are quantified. The intraoperative treatment field contains a larger amount of scattered electrons, which leads to a broader energy spectrum as well as a wider angular distribution of electrons at the phantom surface. The dose from the scattered electrons can contribute up to 40 % of the total dose at a depth of dose maximum, compared to approximately 10 % for standard beams. A study of the energy spectra at the reference depth reveals that an uncertainty of the order of 1 % can be introduced if ionization chamber based dosimetry is used to determine <b>output</b> <b>factors</b> for the investigated IORT system. We recommend that relative absorbed dose distributions and <b>output</b> <b>factors</b> in IORT electron beams and for similar complicated dosimetric situations should be determined with detectors having a small energy and angular dependence (e. g. diamond detectors or p-Si diodes) ...|$|R

This paper provides the first published EDWOF for 20 MV photon energy. In addition, we have provided the first compendium of EDWOFs for different Varian linac models. The consistency of value across models and institution provide further support that a standard dataset of basic photon and electron dosimetry could be established as a guide for future commissioning, beam modeling, and quality assurance purposes.

Three main steps were undertaken in achieving this objective. Firstly, Monte Carlo commissioning of the linear accelerator was accomplished by simulating the 101 ̆d 46510 cm and 5 cm electron applicators for 6, 12 and 18 MeV electron beams in the BEAMnrc simulation code. The phase-space files generated were used as sources for a phantom constructed in DOSXYZnrc. Percentage Depth Doses and profiles at various depths are extracted from the 3 -dimensional dose distributions produced by the DOSXYZnrc simulations. These are then compared with equivalent measured data using the Gamma Index evaluation method. Absolute dosimetry results utilising the TRS 398 protocol were performed. MC-calculated <b>output</b> <b>factors</b> for the 5 1 ̆d 4501 ̆d 45 a applicator relative to the reference 101 ̆d 46510 1 ̆d 4501 ̆d 45 a applicator are compared to measurements. Successful Monte-Carlo commissioning justified the use of the source and component module parameters for the ensuing simulations performed for the open cones and cut-outs. Secondly, separate linear accelerators were 'built' for 6 MeV, 12 MeV and 18 MeV beams by replacing the standard applicators with Intra-Operative Radiotherapy cones of diameters 19 mm, 45 mm and 64 mm in BEAMnrc. The resulting percentage depth doses and profiles were compared with measured data using the Gamma Index evaluation method. Measured <b>output</b> <b>factors</b> for each energy/cone combination were compared to that produced from the Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, custom-made alloy cut-outs for each cone were then 'built' and 'inserted' into the last 2 cm {{at the end of the}} cone for each energy. The percentage depth doses and profiles produced from the simulations were compared to measured data using the Gamma Index evaluation method. The resulting measured <b>output</b> <b>factors</b> were compared to that produced from Monte Carlo simulations. A patient case is also presented. It was concluded that Monte Carlo calculations, being the most accurate method of obtaining dose distributions and <b>output</b> <b>factors</b> for small irregularly shaped intra-operative radiotherapy electron beams, may be implemented at the author's institution for Intra-Operative Radiation Therapy...|$|R
