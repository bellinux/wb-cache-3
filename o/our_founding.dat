5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. was the {{conscience}} of his generation. He gazed upon {{the great wall of}} segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E
500|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{reminded}} the government, [...] "What motivated the Fourth Amendment historically was the disapproval, the outrage, that <b>our</b> <b>Founding</b> Fathers experienced with general warrants that permitted police indiscriminately to investigate {{just on the}} basis of suspicion, not probable cause, and to invade every possession that the individual had in search of a crime." [...] She then asked, [...] "How is this different?" ...|$|E
500|$|Obama {{concluded}} the second paragraph of his address by saying, [...] "we {{the people have}} remained faithfultothe ideals of our forebears and true to <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> documents." [...] The speech reinforced words such as [...] "legacy" [...] and [...] "heritage", as well as values such as [...] "honesty", [...] "courage" [...] and [...] "patriotism", which [...] "are old" [...] values. Near {{the end of the}} speech, Obama referred to words written by Thomas Paine in The American Crisis, which were ordered by George Washington to be read to his troops: [...] "Let it be told to the future world... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [...]" [...] Because Obama's campaign message focused on the need for change, Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as President within the margins of the nation's traditions.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{perceived}} an anti-American {{message in}} the film, equating RDA's private security force to American soldiers. Commentator Glenn Beck on his radio show said that Avatar was [...] "an anti‑U.S. human thing". Russell D. Moore in The Christian Post stated that, [...] "If {{you can get a}} theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects" [...] and criticized Cameron for what he saw as an unnuanced depiction of the American military as [...] "pure evil". John Podhoretz of The Weekly Standard argued that Avatar revealed [...] "hatred of the military and American institutions and the notion that to be human is just way uncool." [...] One review called Avatar the [...] "liberal tell" [...] of [...] "a thinly disguised, heavy-handed and simplistic sci-fi fantasy/allegory critical of America from <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> straight through to the Iraq War." [...] Charles Mudede of The Stranger commented that with the release of the film [...] "the American culture industry exports an anti-American spectacle to an anti-American world." [...] Debbie Schlussel likewise dismissed [...] Avatar as [...] "cinema for the hate America crowd".|$|E

2500|$|As part of {{his effort}} to gain Congressional support for the Nicaraguan contras, Reagan labeled the contras [...] "the moral {{equivalent}} of <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> fathers", which was controversial because the contras had shown a disregard for human rights. There also were allegations that {{some members of the}} contra leadership were involved in cocaine trafficking.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson had {{concerns}} about federal judges deciding social {{policy in this}} area: [...] "Many federal judges seem intent on eliminating God from the public schools and the public square {{in ways that would}} astound <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> fathers. We never know when a five to four Supreme Court decision will uphold them. They ignore the fact that the founders were protecting the church from the state and not the other way around." ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{recounting the}} casting process, Bredeweg explained, [...] "We spent tireless hours {{trying to find}} the right person for each role.

2500|$|In {{a speech}} given at a {{campaign}} event for Colorado Senate candidate Ken Buck on July 8, 2010, Tancredo said of President Barack Obama, [...] "... {{the greatest threat}} to the United States today, {{the greatest threat to}} our liberty, the greatest threat to the Constitution of the United States, the greatest threat to our way of life; everything we believe in. The greatest threat to the country that <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> fathers put together is the man that's sitting in the White House today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also {{according}} to Scalia, Thomas is {{more willing to}} overrule constitutional cases than he was: [...] "If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say let's get it right. I wouldn't do that." [...] Law professor Michael Gerhardt, however, says that Scalia's characterization of Thomas may be incorrect, given that Thomas has supported leaving {{a broad spectrum of}} constitutional decisions intact. Thomas's belief in originalism is strong; he has said, [...] "When faced with a clash of constitutional principle and a line of unreasoned cases wholly divorced from the text, history, and structure of <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> document, we should not hesitate to resolve the tension in favor of the Constitution's original meaning." [...] Thomas believes that an erroneous decision can and should be overturned, no matter how old it is.|$|E

2500|$|American Patriots tells {{stories of}} lesser-known Americans from the American Revolution.

However, most know little about the day-to-day battles fought by Americans of all backgrounds that {{paved the way for the}} high ideals of our founders to be put into practice." [...] He also writes, [...] "Today we are facing a threat to the very foundation our founders laid. That threat does not come from an alien force but from those who are willing and determined to abandon the concept of God-given rights. Like the royalty during the Revolution, today's elites wish to return to the pre-Revolutionary paradigm in which they, through governmental force, allocate rights and responsibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{election}} of Ronald Reagan in 1980, relations between the United States and the Sandinista regime became an active front in the Cold War. The Reagan administration insisted on the [...] "Communist threat" [...] posed by the Sandinistas—reacting particularly to the support provided to the Sandinistas by Cuban president Fidel Castro, by the Sandinistas' close military relations with the Soviets and Cubans, but also furthering the Reagan administration's desire to protect U.S. interests in the region, which were threatened by {{the policies of the}} Sandinista government. The United States quickly suspended aid to Nicaragua and expanded the supply of arms and training to the Contra in neighbouring Honduras, as well as allied groups based to the south in Costa Rica. President Reagan called the Contras [...] "the moral equivalent of <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> fathers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints commented: [...] "this {{decision}} {{represents only}} {{the opening of}} a vigorous debate over the rights of the people to define and protect this most fundamental institution – marriage..." [...] The Roman Catholic bishops of California stated: [...] "...the courts do {{not have the right to}} distort the meaning of marriage". National Organization for Marriage (NOM) chairman Maggie Gallagher also disagreed with the ruling. She targeted the judge's sexuality and accused Walker of [...] "substituting his views for those of the American people and of <b>our</b> <b>Founding</b> Fathers who I promise you would be shocked by courts that imagine they have the right to put gay marriage in our Constitution". Brian Brown, President of NOM, complained of the [...] "biased way [...] conducted the trial." [...] Some critics have characterized the ruling as judicial activism. The American Family Association called for Walker's impeachment.|$|E

2500|$|On August 26, 2006, Harris's {{campaign}} {{released a}} [...] "Statement of Clarification", that stated, “In the interview, Harris {{was speaking to}} a Christian audience, addressing a common misperception that people of faith should not be actively involved in government. Addressing this Christian publication, Harris provided a statement that explains her deep grounding in Judeo-Christian values." [...] The press release went on to mention her past support of Israel and quoted her Jewish campaign manager Bryan G. Rudnick, who stated “As the grandson of Holocaust survivors, I know that she encourages people of all faiths to engage in government so that our country can continue to thrive on the principles set forth by <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> fathers, without malice towards anyone.” At an appearance at an Orlando gun show that same day, she said [...] "it breaks my heart" [...] to think people understood her comments as bigoted.

2500|$|When {{interviewed in}} 2007 by Beliefnet, a website that covers {{religious}} affairs, McCain {{was asked if}} he thought a non-Christian should be president of the United States. He answered, [...] "I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles, personally, I prefer someone who has a grounding in my faith." [...] McCain also stated his agreement with the belief that the U.S. is a [...] "Christian nation." [...] On September 30, 2007, he clarified his remarks by saying [...] "What I do mean to say is the United States of America was founded on the values of Judeo-Christian values, which were translated by <b>our</b> <b>founding</b> fathers which is basically the rights of human dignity and human rights." [...] McCain also stated, “I would vote for a Muslim if he or she was the candidate best able to lead the country and defend our political values.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 3, 2011, NOM {{unveiled}} a pledge for 2012 Republican presidential candidates.

[...] This pledge was signed by candidates Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, and Newt Gingrich (who initially declined), along with Tim Pawlenty; Ron Paul and Herman Cain chose not to sign. During the Iowa primary campaign, NOM aired a TV ad targeting Paul, contrasting his failure to pledge with the activities of [...] "the major presidential candidates", thus implying that Paul was not truly in contention in the primary campaign.|$|E
