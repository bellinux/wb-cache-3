But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word.

500|$|The final {{track of}} the DVD, [...] "Raining Blood", culminates with the band drenched by stage blood. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman {{came up with the}} idea of the blood two years after Reign in Bloods release, but the band lacked the funding to do so. The {{beginning}} of the film Blade (released in 1998) features a [...] "bloodbath" [...] with vampires dancing in a club with blood coming from the roof via a sprinkler system. The scene revived Jeff Hanneman and guitarist Kerry King's interest, and since the band released a DVD the previous year [...] War at the Warfield [...] they decided to add something different for the new DVD [...] raining blood. King asserted that since Lombardo was not on the previous DVD, this <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be important. Due to the short length of the DVD, director Dean Karr chose an additional bonus six songs from the same show as he thought certain members excelled in the performances.|$|E
500|$|Although Safran {{initially}} {{intended the}} series {{to be an}} ensemble, with Alex the lead protagonist, this changed after Chopra was cast. As the show's [...] "face" [...] and featuring in its publicity campaign, Alex dominated the storyline and became the main character of the series. Although the character was initially written as Caucasian, Safran completely rewrote her character with Chopra in his mind, tweaking her background as she became half-Indian and spent ten years in Mumbai. Her casting also helped change Alex's personality; in one change, the [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] Alex became [...] "fun and warm". Safran initially focused on the character's dark side, {{saying that he had}} never imagined a positive side: [...] "Priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always in control. And still warm and vibrant because she knew no <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get through her walls. From that point on, Alex was the kind of character who can have humor, who can have heart".|$|E

500|$|Following Chopra's casting, {{the series}} {{underwent}} a significant change. Safran had initially {{intended to make}} the show as an ensemble drama with no obvious lead, but after Chopra's casting, Alex became the main character and the show was re-structured around her. The character was initially written to be white, which was also re-written, keeping Chopra in mind. The background of the character was tweaked by making her half-Indian, with an additional backstory of Alex having spent ten years in Mumbai, India. Apart from changing her ethnicity, Safran completely re-envisioned the character. For example, Alex was initially written as [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] but was re-written as [...] "fun and warm". Earlier, the series was supposed {{to focus on the}} character's dark side because Safran had never imagined Alex having a positive side, which changed after Chopra stepped in the role. Safran said, [...] "Priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always in control. And still warm and vibrant because she knew no <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get through her walls. From that point on, Alex was the kind of character who can have humor, who can have heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E
500|$|Prompted {{in part by}} Salinger's letter, Bakshi briefly {{retired to}} focus on painting. During this time he {{completed}} the screenplay for If I Catch Her, I'll Kill Her, a live-action feature he had been developing since the late 1960s. United Artists and Paramount Pictures each paid Bakshi to develop the film in the 1970s, but were unwilling to produce it, as were the studios he pitched the film to in the 1980s. According to Bakshi, [...] "They thought that no <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> admit that women can—and do—cheat on their husbands. They thought it was too hot, which made no sense." [...] In 1985, he {{received a phone call}} from The Rolling Stones' manager, Tony King, who told Bakshi that the band had recorded a cover of Bob & Earl's [...] "Harlem Shuffle", and wanted Bakshi to direct the music video. He was told that the live-action shoot needed to be completed within one day (January 28, 1986) for it to be shown at the Grammy Awards. Production designer Wolf Kroeger was forced to drastically compact his sets, and animation director and designer John Kricfalusi had to push his team, including Lynne Naylor, Jim Smith and Bob Jaques, to complete the animation within a few weeks. The band's arrival at the set was delayed by a snowstorm and several takes were ruined when the cameras crossed paths. Bakshi was forced to pay the union wages out of his own fees, and the continuity between Kricfalusi's animation and the live-action footage did not match; however, the video was completed on time.|$|E

500|$|The {{third season}} was {{initially}} planned to include three separate mysteries {{that would be}} introduced and resolved {{in a series of}} non-overlapping story arcs. Thomas realized by talking to CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff that viewers got too confused by his original format, and the new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in the season. Inspired by the improvised thriller Bubble, Thomas started laying [...] "subtle" [...] motives for the second mystery during the first one, so that fans would have [...] "a theory on whodunit" [...] when it occurred. The first mystery took place over the first nine episodes. Originally, the second mystery was to be seven episodes long and the third mystery was to occur over the last six episodes of the season. This was changed when The CW ordered a 20 episode season instead of the usual 22 episodes. The second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six, and the third mystery was first changed from a six episode arc to a five episode arc. After an eight-week hiatus for the series was announced, the final mystery was changed to five stand-alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers. The final mystery was originally going to be [...] "unlike any of the others we've done before". Previously, [...] "nice characters" [...] like Wallace and Mac had always been absent from the big mystery because no <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> believe them as a suspect. For the third mystery, Thomas had wanted to present a situation where Wallace and Mac could be fully involved, [...] "key players [...] really interesting stuff to do".|$|E

She even {{went as far as}} spending two years as a pre-med student at the University of Southern California. During World War I, she left school to work overseas in the ambulance corps. By the time the war ended, she decided against returning to her medical studies and, after a visit to a movie studio, decided to pursue a career as a film director.

2500|$|After facing several club-level opponents, the International Boxing Club {{guaranteed}} Louis $300,000 to face undefeated heavyweight contender Rocky Marciano on October 26, 1951. Despite {{his being}} a 6-to-5 favorite, few boxing insiders believed Louis had a chance. Marciano himself {{was reluctant to}} participate in the bout, but was understanding of Louis's position: [...] "This is the last guy on earth I want to fight." [...] It was feared, particularly among those who had witnessed Marciano's punching power first-hand, that Louis's unwillingness to quit would result in serious injury. Fighting back tears, Ferdie Pacheco said in the SportsCentury documentary about his bout with Marciano, [...] "He [...] wasn't just going to lose. He was going to take a vicious, savage beating. Before the eyes of the nation, Joe Louis, an American hero if ever there was <b>one,</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get beaten up." [...] Louis was dropped in the eighth round by a Marciano left and knocked through the ropes and out of the ring less than thirty seconds later.|$|E
2500|$|The series' {{stunt man}} and stunt {{arranger}} Ray Austin expressed {{the opinion that}} the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There The Avengers was given a late timeslot due to its violence. [...] "They did that with the first Avengers here , with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS , {{because it was too}} violent." [...] Austin goes on to explain that U.S. television follows a [...] "different code". Austin said that on The Avengers [...] "we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York—you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it." [...] In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC. The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC.|$|E
