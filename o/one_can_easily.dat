Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

25|$|That the {{integral}} is positive {{follows from the}} fact that the integrand is non-negative, being a quotient involving only sums and products of powers of non-negative real numbers. In addition, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> check that the integrand is strictly positive for at least one point in the range of integration, say at 1/2. Since the integrand is continuous at that point and non-negative elsewhere, {{the integral}} from 0 to 1 must be strictly positive.|$|E
25|$|Top-down approach: This is {{the direct}} {{fall-out}} of the recursive formulation of any problem.

25|$|Optimal {{substructure}} {{means that}} the solution to a given optimization problem {{can be obtained by}} the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of recursion. For example, given a graph G=(V,E), the shortest path p from a vertex u to a vertex v exhibits optimal substructure: take any intermediate vertex w on this shortest path p. If p is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths p1 from u to w and p2 from w to v such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in Introduction to Algorithms). Hence, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the Bellman–Ford algorithm or the Floyd–Warshall algorithm does.|$|E
25|$|The new {{poetry in}} Tajikistan is mostly {{concerned}} with {{the way of life}} of people and is revolutionary. From the 1950s until the advent of new poetry in France, Asia and Latin America, the impact of the modernization drive was strong. In the 1960s, modern Iranian poetry and that of Mohammad Iqbal Lahouri made a profound impression in Tajik poetry. This period is probably the richest and most prolific period for the development of themes and forms in Persian poetry in Tajikistan. Some Tajik poets were mere imitators, and <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> see the traits of foreign poets in their work. Only two or three poets were able to digest the foreign poetry and compose original poetry. In Tajikistan, the format and pictorial aspects of short stories and novels were taken from Russian and other European literature. Some of Tajikistan's prominent names in Persian literature are Golrokhsar Safi Eva, Mo'men Ghena'at, Farzaneh Khojandi and Layeq Shir-Ali.|$|E
25|$|While <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> graze one's {{way through}} the Market food stalls and shops, the Pike Place Market offers {{numerous}} other eating (and drinking) options. The once endemic workingmen's and sailors' taverns are gone; at roughly opposite corners of the Market, the Virginia Inn (founded as Virginia Bar, approximately 1908; operated as a cardroom during Prohibition, then Virginia Inn; passed into current management 1980 and slowly gentrified) and Place Pigalle (originally Lotus Inn, name dates from 1950s, remodeled 1982) retain their names, but both have gone upmarket. The Athenian Inn in the Main Market traces its history back to a 1909 bakery and is a relatively ungentrified bar and restaurant. Three Girls Bakery dates back to 1912 {{and may have been}} the first Seattle business started by women. While it is not in its original Corner Market location, no longer bakes on premises, and its current owner Jack Levy is a man, it still sells a vast variety of baked goods, does a brisk business in takeaway sandwiches, and has an old-style lunch counter.|$|E

25|$|The {{bowling ball}} speed is {{affected}} primarily by three factors: gravitational forces, forward momentum, and downswing acceleration. The {{speed of the}} ball as generated by gravitational forces during the swing depends primarily on the total arc of the swing. This arc is further affected by {{the length of the}} bowler’s arm and by the height at which the swing begins. Assuming a longer arm and higher swing peak will maximize the speed that the gravitational forces produce. Forward momentum is manifested in the walking approach of the bowler prior to the throw. The “four-step” approach is most commonly applied, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left at starting position (for right handed bowlers). Longer legs and a faster approach during the third step and downswing will increase the ball speed. Finally, the deliberate acceleration of the arm during downswing is of critical focus. This particular factor is difficult to master, however, because <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> force the armswing and thus accelerate too quickly or cause the arm to deviate from the natural path.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} between {{interior and exterior}} - and between structure and image - was to be developed very purposefully in the Renaissance and beyond, especially once the dome became reinstated in the Western tradition as {{a key element in}} church design. Michelangelo's dome for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, as redesigned between 1585 and 1590 by Giacomo della Porta, for example, consists of two domes of which, however, only the inner is structural. Baltasar Neumann, in his baroque churches, perfected light-weight plaster vaults supported by wooden frames. These vaults, which exerted no lateral pressures, were perfectly suited for elaborate ceiling frescoes. In St Paul's Cathedral in London there is a highly complex system of vaults and faux-vaults. The dome that one sees from the outside is not a vault, but a relatively light-weight wooden-framed structure resting on an invisible - and for its age highly original - catenary vault of brick, below which is another dome, (the dome that one sees from the inside), but of plaster supported by a wood frame. From the inside, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> assume that one is looking at the same vault that one sees from the outside.|$|E

500|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{delivered}} by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC), and {{were applied to}} the 1,000 or so shots in the film, {{though most of the}} effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements—groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements. Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: [...] "The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans.
