5|$|The {{operational}} {{capabilities of}} the SBS and the SAS are broadly similar. However, the SBS (being the principal Royal Navy contribution to UKSF) has the additional training and equipment required to lead in the maritime, amphibious and riverine environments. Both units come under the <b>operational</b> <b>command</b> of HQ Directorate of Special Forces (DSF) and undergo an identical selection process. They enjoy significant interoperability in training and on operations.|$|E

Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks <b>Operational</b> <b>Command</b> Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded <b>operational</b> <b>command</b> to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, {{but he was still}} unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 {{there was}} an {{increased}} U-boat threat in the Caribbean against oil shipments. After Halifax and the UK started experiencing oil shortages, tanker convoys were organized between Caribbean ports and Halifax and New York City. In July, Fredericton was assigned to escort convoy HA002/AH002 from Halifax to Aruba and back. Since the U.S. Navy had insufficient ships for these convoys, Fredericton along with six other Canadian corvettes was temporarily transferred to American naval <b>operational</b> <b>command</b> for convoy escort between Guantánamo Bay and New York City. She participated in these oil convoy escorts from September until February 1943.|$|E

He returned home in January 1808, and was promoted to vice-admiral on 25 October 1809. A nomination to be a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath followed on 2 January 1815 and later the same year he was elected Mayor of Chichester.|$|E

5|$|The Dallachy Wing was {{on alert}} to attack any ships {{found by the}} {{reconnaissance}} patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the <b>operational</b> <b>command</b> of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against Z33 even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and {{in a difficult position}} for aircraft to attack.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF <b>operational</b> <b>command</b> and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E
