5|$|While Yellowstone {{was under}} army management, the activities, {{policies}} and procedures developed served as precedents for other national parks and subsequent actions by the National Park Service after its formation in 1916. The army solved a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> developed procedures covering a multitude of administrative issues. The military superintendents continued the evolution of park policies and conservation measures initiated by the first civilian administrators. They implemented backcountry patrols, access improvement, wildlife protection and management, protection of natural features, law enforcement and development of a ranger force. The army set precedents for future headquarters area development designs, visitor services such as educational outreach and interpretive tours. Their diligence in dealing with poachers led to legislation that provided for prosecution and punishment of illegal activity. That most of the precedents that the army established were incorporated later by the National Park Service is a lasting legacy of the important role the army played in U.S. national park history. Modern Park Ranger uniforms are legacies of army management of the park. Most iconically, the campaign hat, a flat-brow peaked hat worn by the cavalry {{in the last years}} of army management is nearly identical to the modern hats worn into the 21stcentury.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present a}} {{meta-analysis}} of current {{research on the}} prevalence, identification, <b>and</b> treatment <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gamblers. QUALITY <b>OF</b> EVIDENCE: <b>Problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gambling was not a socio-scientific concern until the last two decades. Hence research on this topic is limited. The summary and analysis for this paper relied on computer searches of journal and news abstracts in addition to direct contact with organizations addressing the identification and treatment of compulsive gamblers. MAIN MESSAGE: An estimated 5 % of those who gamble run into problems. About 1 % of those who gamble are predicted to experience serious <b>problems.</b> Successful treatment <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gambling {{continues to be a}} challenge. Although cognitive therapy has been the favoured approach, a combination of several therapeutic approaches is advocated. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gambling can present a real health threat. As with other addictions, treatment strategies continue to be a baffling social <b>problem.</b> Aware <b>and</b> informed physicians can have a pivotal role in the difficult process of identifying, acknowledging, <b>and</b> remediating <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gambling...|$|R

However, the LTTE created a lot <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> complications and the then Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi was forced to send the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in 1987 to restore normalcy in the region. The disastrous mission of the IPKF was blamed by many {{on the lack of}} co-ordination between the IPKF and RAW. Its most disastrous manifestation was the Heliborne assault on LTTE HQ in the Jaffna University campus in the opening stages of Operation Pawan. The site was chosen without any consultation with the RAW. The dropping paratroopers became easy targets for the LTTE. A number of soldiers were killed. The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi is also blamed as a fallout of the failed RAW operation in Sri Lanka.|$|E

As a result, almost the entire TELO leadership and at least 400 TELO militants were killed by the LTTE. The LTTE attacked training camps of the EPRLF a few months later, forcing it to withdraw from the Jaffna peninsula. Notices were issued to the effect that all remaining Tamil insurgents join the LTTE in Jaffna and in Madras, where the Tamil groups were headquartered. With the major groups including the TELO and EPRLF eliminated, the remaining twenty or so Tamil insurgent group were then absorbed into the LTTE, making Jaffna an LTTE-dominated city.|$|E
