A baseball official familiar with the decision confirmed to The Associated Press that the call was not being reversed. For his efforts in this game, Galarraga was named the American League Player of the Week on June 7. Also, first base, a ball used in the game, and Galarraga's spikes were sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
40|$|This article {{constructs}} a {{model of}} Time, using Walker’s definition <b>of</b> <b>instants</b> by events. It follows from the proposed system of axioms on the events, that the instants, constructed by events after Walker’s definition, compose an open-ended linear contin-uum with a ”dense ” sequence <b>of</b> <b>instants,</b> i. e. Time continuum has the properties, characterizing the real line. Here the exposition is based only on Walker’s definition <b>of</b> <b>instants</b> without using Russell’s definition <b>of</b> <b>instants.</b> The used here system of axioms is simpler than those preceding it in the literature and it treats only events. The attemp of mathematical contructions <b>of</b> the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> Time by events follow Russell and Whitehead [1, 2]. Such constructions of Time are elaborated also by Robbs [3], N. Wiener [4], Walker [5], Whitrow [6], Thomason [7]. Two models of Time, based on Russell’s definition <b>of</b> the <b>instants</b> by events were constructed in papers [8 - 10]. Physiologists, psychologists and philosophers agree that the conception of the events is more primary and fundamental whereas the instants are intuitive-mental constructions. Russell and Whitehead have posed the problem so as to obtain the construction <b>of</b> the <b>instants</b> from the events in a logical-mathematical way ([1, 2, 6]) ...|$|R

5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull <b>of</b> <b>instant</b> gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E

Instant coffee is dried into soluble powder or freeze-dried into granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water.

Many consumers determined that the convenience in preparing a cup <b>of</b> <b>instant</b> coffee more than made up for a perceived inferior taste, although, since the late 1970s, instant coffee has been produced differently in such a way that is similar to the taste of freshly brewed coffee.

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{proposes a}} time-effective method for {{determining}} the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation in speech signals. The <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation correspond to the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> glottal closure (epochs) {{in the case of}} voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. The proposed method consists of two phases: the first phase determines the approximate epoch locations using the Hilbert envelope of the linear prediction residual of the speech signal. The second phase determines the accurate locations <b>of</b> the <b>instants</b> <b>of</b> significant excitation by computing the group delay around the approximate epoch locations derived from the first phase.

25|$|When Strom {{started his}} career in the NBA, he felt the most {{important}} aspect was to get the play right. Instead of selling a bad call, he felt that officials should admit their mistake, and get the call right. To get plays called correctly, he brought up the idea of limited use <b>of</b> <b>instant</b> replay for shots made {{at the end of a}} period ("buzzer beaters") and three-point attempts. The NBA eventually adopted the use <b>of</b> <b>instant</b> replay for end of the period field goal attempts and fouls at the start of the 2002–03 NBA season. Strom believed that referee's job was to ensure the game is played correctly, which will allow players to play their particular style. As the NBA began to evolve, Strom opposed the addition of the third official in NBA game for one season, the 1977–78 NBA season, and later in its present form since the 1988–89 NBA season. Strom felt that well-conditioned officials who are able to stay on top of the play would be able to make calls that a third official would be responsible for.|$|E
