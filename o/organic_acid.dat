40|$|Approvals {{for the use}} of nontherapeutic {{antibiotics}} {{in animal}} feed are fast disappearing worldwide. The primary effect of antibiotics is antimicrobial; all of the digestibility and performance effects can by explained by their impact on the gastrointestinal microflora. Among the candidate replacements for antibiotics are <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> both individual acids and blends of several acids. Like antibiotics, short-chain <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> also have a specific antimicrobial activity. Unlike antibiotics, the antimicrobial activity of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is pH dependent. <b>Organic</b> <b>acids</b> have a clear and significant benefit in weanling piglets and have been observed to benefit poultry performance. <b>Organic</b> <b>acids</b> have antimicrobial activity; however, there appear to be effects of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> beyond those attributed to antimicrobial activity. Reductions in bacteria are associated with feeding <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> which are particularly effective against acid-intolerant species such as E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter. Both antibiotics and <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> improve protein and energy digestibilities by reducing microbial competition with the host for nutrients and endogenous nitrogen losses, by lowering the incidence of subclinical infections and secretion of immune mediators, and by reducing production of ammonia and other growth-depressing microbial metabolites. <b>Organic</b> <b>acids</b> have several additional effects that go beyond those of antibiotics.

40|$|The {{theme of}} the bachelors thesis was "The Analysis of <b>Organic</b> <b>Acids</b> by New Extractive Derivatization Process in Blood Plasma and Serum Using the GC/MS Technique. The {{objective}} of the thesis {{was to develop a}} method for fast determination of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> by a new process of extractive derivatization, to identify and determine <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in body fluids, to compare their abundance and to evaluate the possibility of implementation of this method in clinical diagnostics. Body fluids contain hundreds of <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> which co-create a clinical picture of a patients health condition. The current research focuses on implementation of methods providing for comprehensive, metabolism-based analysis of these metabolites important {{from the point of view}} of diagnostics. Nowadays, an analyst can select from a wide range of methods and several effective analytical and separation techniques for separation, determination and identification of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in complex biological matrices. In the introductory, theoretical part of the bachelors thesis, the knowledge of properties of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> and possibilities of their determination are summarized. In the practical part, the method of fast determination of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in body fluids by the GC/MS techniques was developed. By means of this technique, it is possible to analyze large quantities of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in minimum volume of body fluid. Derivatization of a set of several tens of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> with ethyl chloroformate in aqueous medium was carried out. The reaction proceeds very fast and at laboratory temperature. The applicability of the developed method was verified through analysis of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in biological samples. In samples of blood serum and plasma, tens of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> were identified by means of the above-mentioned method, retention data and EI mass spectra. Experiments performed for the purpose of this thesis proved that derivatization with chloroformates in aqueous medium is a relatively simple, fast and promising method for analysis of <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> Follow-up experimental research is necessary to make the methodology applicable in clinical diagnostics and to define advantages and limitations of this new methodological procedure...|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} {{factor is the}} mobile phase pH since it can change the hydrophobic character of the analyte. For this reason most methods use a buffering agent, such as sodium phosphate, to control the pH. Buffers serve multiple purposes: control of pH, neutralize the charge on the silica surface of the stationary phase and act as ion pairing agents to neutralize analyte charge. Ammonium formate is commonly added in mass spectrometry to improve detection of certain analytes by the formation of analyte-ammonium adducts. A volatile <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> such as acetic acid, or most commonly formic acid, is often added to the mobile phase if mass spectrometry is {{used to analyze the}} column effluent. Trifluoroacetic acid is used infrequently in mass spectrometry applications due to its persistence in the detector and solvent delivery system, but can be effective in improving retention of analytes such as carboxylic acids in applications utilizing other detectors, as it is a fairly strong <b>organic</b> <b>acid.</b> The effects of acids and buffers vary by application but generally improve chromatographic resolution.|$|E
25|$|Creatine is an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> {{naturally}} {{occurring in the}} body that supplies energy to muscle cells for short bursts of energy (as required in lifting weights) via creatine phosphate replenishment of ATP.

25|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which mycorrhizae increase absorption include some that are physical and some that are chemical. Physically, most mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root or root hair, and thus can explore soil material that roots and root hairs cannot reach, and provide a larger surface area for absorption. Chemically, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi {{differs from that of}} plants. For example, they may secrete <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> that dissolve or chelate many ions, or release them from minerals by ion exchange.

Bacterial solubilization of {{insoluble inorganic}} phosphate has been studied {{as a means of}} providing available phosphorus for crop production. Bacterial abilities to solubilize calcium phosphate and rock phosphate have been identified to be related with their abilities to produce gluconic acid and ketogluconic acid. However, there is no information regarding the relationship between bacterial ability to solubilize aluminum phosphate and their ability to produce <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between bacterial ability to solubilize calcium and aluminum phosphates with their ability to produce <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> Bacterial ability to solubilize calcium and aluminum phosphates were determined as the concentration of soluble phosphate in the filtrate of bacterial cultivation media, while bacterial ability to produce <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> were assessed from the accumulated <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in its. The results showed that bacterial abilities to solubilize calcium and aluminum phosphates well related to their abilities to produce <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>acids</b> related with the solubilization of calcium phosphate differ from the ones related with the solubilization of aluminum phosphate.

25|$|During its evolution, S. mutans {{acquired}} {{the ability to}} increase the amount of carbohydrates it could metabolize, and consequently more <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> was produced as a byproduct. This is significant in the formation of dental caries because increased acidity in the oral cavity amplifies the rate of demineralization of the tooth, which leads to carious lesions. It is thought that the trait evolved in S. mutans via lateral gene transfer with another bacterial species present in the oral cavity. There are several genes, SMU.438 and SMU.1561, involved in carbohydrate metabolism that are up-regulated in S. mutans. These genes possibly originated from Lactococcus lactis and S. gallolyticus, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Acidithiobacillus caldus is a {{thermophilic}} acidophile {{found in}} commercial biomining, acid mine drainage systems, and natural environments. Previous work has characterized A. caldus as a chemolithotrophic autotroph capable of utilizing reduced sulfur compounds under aerobic conditions. <b>Organic</b> <b>acids</b> are especially toxic to chemolithotrophs in low-pH environments, where they diffuse more readily {{into the cell}} and deprotonate within the cytoplasm. In the present study, the toxic effects of oxaloacetate, pyruvate, 2 -ketoglutarate, acetate, malate, succinate, and fumarate on A. caldus strain BC 13 were examined under batch conditions. All tested <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> exhibited some inhibitory effect. Oxaloacetate was observed to inhibit growth completely at a concentration of 250 M, whereas other <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> were completely inhibitory at concentrations of between 1, 000 and 5, 000 M. In these experiments, the measured concentrations of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> decreased with time, indicating uptake or assimilation by the cells.

25|$|A {{classic example}} of {{mutualism}} is the interaction between rhizobia soil bacteria and legumes (Fabaceae). In this interaction, rhizobia bacteria induce root nodule formation in legume plants via an exchange of molecular signals. Within the root nodules, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the nitrogenase enzyme. The legume benefits from a new supply of usable nitrogen from the rhizobia, and the rhizobia benefits from <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> energy sources from the plant {{as well as the}} protection provided by the root nodule. Since the rhizobia live within the legume, {{this is an example of}} endosymbiosis, and since both the bacteria and the plant can survive independently, it is also an example of facultative symbiosis.|$|E
25|$|Acetic acid is a two-carbon <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> {{produced}} in wine {{during or after}} the fermentation period. It is the most volatile of the primary acids associated with wine and {{is responsible for the}} sour taste of vinegar. During fermentation, activity by yeast cells naturally produces a small amount of acetic acid. If the wine is exposed to oxygen, Acetobacter bacteria will convert the ethanol into acetic acid. This process is known as the “acetification” of wine and is the primary process behind wine degradation into vinegar. An excessive amount of acetic acid is also considered a wine fault. A taster's sensitivity to acetic acid will vary, but most people can detect excessive amounts at around 600mg/l.|$|E

25|$|Diagnostic {{testing for}} OTC deficiency, or any {{individual}} with hyperammonemia involves plasma and urine amino acid analysis, urine <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> analysis (to identify {{the presence or}} absence of orotic acid, as well as rule out an organic acidemia) and plasma acylcarnitines (will be normal in OTC deficiency, but can identify some other causes of hyperammonemia). An individual with untreated OTC deficiency will show decreased citrulline and arginine concentrations (because the enzyme block is proximal to these intermediates) and increased orotic acid. The increased orotic acid concentrations result from the buildup of carbamoyl phosphate. This biochemical phenotype (increased ammonia, low citrulline and increased orotic acid) is classic for OTC deficiency, but can also be seen in neonatal presentations of ornithine aminotransferase deficiency. Only severely affected males consistently demonstrate this classic biochemical phenotype.|$|E
25|$|In a solid, {{only those}} {{particles}} {{that are at}} the surface can be involved in a reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. For example, Sherbet (powder) is a mixture of very fine powder of malic acid (a weak <b>organic</b> <b>acid)</b> and sodium hydrogen carbonate. On contact with the saliva in the mouth, these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing carbon dioxide and providing for the fizzy sensation. Also, fireworks manufacturers modify the surface area of solid reactants to control {{the rate at which the}} fuels in fireworks are oxidised, using this to create different effects. For example, finely divided aluminium confined in a shell explodes violently. If larger pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and sparks are seen as pieces of burning metal are ejected.|$|E
25|$|Tartaric acid is, from a {{winemaking}} perspective, {{the most}} important in wine due to the prominent role it plays in maintaining the chemical stability of the wine and its color and finally in influencing {{the taste of the}} finished wine. In most plants, this <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> is rare, but it is found in significant concentrations in grape vines. Along with malic acid, {{and to a lesser extent}} citric acid, tartaric is one of the fixed acids found in wine grapes. The concentration varies depending on grape variety and the soil content of the vineyard. Some varieties, such as Palomino, are naturally disposed to having high levels of tartaric acids, while Malbec and Pinot noir generally have lower levels. During flowering, high levels of tartaric acid are concentrated in the grape flowers and then young berries. As the vine progresses through ripening, tartaric does not get metabolized through respiration like malic acid, so the levels of tartaric acid in the grape vines remain relatively consistent throughout the ripening process.|$|E
