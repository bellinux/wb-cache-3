5|$|In Norse mythology, Iðunn is {{a goddess}} {{associated}} with apples and youth.

5|$|Penicillium moulds cause {{soft rot}} such as <b>of</b> <b>apples,</b> while Aspergillus moulds create patches {{on the surface}} of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as plums and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol.

5|$|The seeds <b>of</b> <b>apples</b> contain {{small amounts}} of amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide {{compound}} known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting {{small amounts of}} apple seeds will cause no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released. The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{quantification}} {{model of}} transient heat conduction {{was provided to}} simulate apple fruit temperature distribution in the cooling process. The model {{was based on the}} energy variation <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> fruit <b>of</b> different points. It took into account, heat exchange of representative elemental volume, metabolism heat and external heat. The following conclusions could be obtained: first, the quantification model can satisfactorily describe the tendency <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> fruit temperature distribution in the cooling process. Then there was obvious difference between apple fruit temperature and environment temperature. Compared to the change of environment temperature, a long hysteresis phenomenon happened to the temperature <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> fruit body. That is to say, there was a significant temperature change <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> fruit body in a period of time after environment temperature dropping. And then the change <b>of</b> temerature <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> fruit body in the cooling process became slower and slower. This can explain the time delay phenomenon of biology. After that, the temperature differences of every layer increased from centre to surface <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> fruit gradually. That is to say, the minimum temperature differences closed to centre <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> fruit body and the maximum temperature differences closed to the surface <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> fruit body. Finally, the temperature of every part <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> fruit body will tend to consistent and be near to the environment temperature in the cooling process. It was related to the metabolism heat of plant body at any time...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} wild {{ancestor of}} Malus pumila was Malus sieversii, found growing wild {{in the mountains}} of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed {{over a long period of}} time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations <b>of</b> <b>apples</b> being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.|$|E

Joining the Australian Army Cadets in 1908, Cherry soon became a sergeant and later a second lieutenant, where he used to drill cadets in four different districts.
