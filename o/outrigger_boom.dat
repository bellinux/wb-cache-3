50|$|The {{beam trawl}} {{is one where}} a beam, up to 12 metres in length, is {{attached}} to a skid at each end. The beam is situated on top of the skids effectively keeping the top of the net open and the fish are channelled between the skids. Two beam trawls are deployed alongside each other from <b>outrigger</b> <b>booms</b> {{on each side of the}} boat. This method is primarily for taking flatfish but these vessels can be used also for scallop dredging.|$|R
40|$|MAXIMUM 200 WORDS) This report {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} {{a new piece of}} oil pollution equipment called the Boom Vane TM in Martha's Vineyard and New York harbor. The equipment is designed to hold boom out in fast currents to recover oil without the use of heavy anchoring equipment. It was shown to be effective in a previous test on the Columbia River. This was the first attempt at using the Boom Vane TM in tidal estuaries. It was also deployed from two vessels as a possible replacement for the outriggers needed to hold boom away {{from the side of the}} vessel in Vessel of Opportunity Skimming Systems (VOSS). The Boom Vane TM does not appear to be useful in tidal estuaries when currents are not steady and uniform. The equipment can be used for parts of a tidal cycle but eddies and interrupted flow caused by changing tides prevent the equipment from being effective throughout the cycle. It still could be used on vessels larger than 50 feet, although a small <b>outrigger</b> <b>boom</b> may still [...] ...|$|E

50|$|The M816 Medium Wrecker {{is part of}} the M809 {{series of}} 5-ton 6x6 {{military}} trucks. It was made by AM General starting in 1970. It has a revolving hydraulic crane with an extending boom that can extend from 10-18 ft with a maximum lift capacity of 20,000 lb with <b>outriggers</b> and <b>boom</b> jacks to the ground. The boom capacity depends on boom extension and placements of truck <b>outriggers</b> and <b>boom</b> jacks. With boom full out and no outriggers, the capacity is only 3000 lb. The boom elevates to 45 degrees, swings 270.|$|R
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} – use sturdy <b>outrigger</b> <b>booms</b> for towing a beam trawl, one warp {{on each side}}. Double-rig beam trawlers can tow {{a separate}} trawl {{on each side of}} the trawler. Beam trawling is used in the flatfish and shrimp fisheries in the North Sea. They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is also restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} pusher biplanes was the Farman III, developed by Henri Farman following a falling-out with Gabriel Voisin: he retained the basic layout of the Voisin, but incorporated ailerons (as added to his Voisin), modified the undercarriage by adding skids to prevent the aircraft nosing-over on landing and modified the structure, eliminating the nacelle in which the pilot sat and mounting the forward elevator on <b>outrigger</b> <b>booms.</b> This design was copied by many constructors, and was so influential that when Mervyn O'Gorman created a scheme for classifying the products of the Royal Aircraft Factory according to their configuration such aircraft were classified as [...] "F.E" [...] for [...] "Farman Experimental. All tractor aircraft were designated [...] "B.E" [...] for [...] "Blériot Experimental", although all the B.E. designs produced were biplanes, unlike the designs for which Blériot was known.|$|R
25|$|Outrigger {{trawlers}} use <b>outriggers,</b> or <b>booms,</b> to tow the trawl. These outriggers {{are usually}} fastened to, {{or at the}} foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. Outrigger trawlers may have the superstructure forward or aft. Warp winches with capstans are installed on the deck to haul the catch.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Longhorn" [...] was a three bay biplane with {{a forward}} {{elevator}} mounted on upcurved {{extensions of the}} landing skids and an empennage carried on four booms consisting of biplane horizontal stabilisers with an elevator attached to {{the trailing edge of}} the upper surface and twin rudders. The airframe was constructed using a combination of ash and silver spruce, and many of the members including the outer interplane struts and the <b>outrigger</b> <b>booms</b> carrying the tail surfaces were hollow. It was powered by a Renault air-cooled V8 engine driving a pusher propeller mounted at the back of a fabric-covered nacelle. The propellor was mounted on the engine's camshaft, and therefore revolved at half the engine speed. Its name derived from the distinctive front-mounted elevator and elongated skids.The design originated with Maurice Farman's second aircraft, which was built in 1910. This was 12.75 m long and had upper and lower wings both spanning 11 m. The wings had rounded ends and the outer pair of interplane struts were fabric covered to form voisin-style side curtains. The undercarriage was also of Voisin pattern, with a pair of mainwheels mounted on trailing arms below the skids. Lateral control was effected by ailerons mounted on the lower wings only. Pitch control was effected solely by a front-mounted elevator, the tail surfaces consisting of biplane fixed stabilising surfaces and twin rudders. The gap between the wings was 1.5 m (5 ft).|$|R
40|$|Outrigger canoes have {{outriggers}} {{on one or}} {{both sides}} to increase their seaworthiness. The canoes with one outrigger float, single riggers, are often found around the Tropical Pacific area, while double riggers with outriggers on both sides are mainly ranged in areas from the Philippines to Indonesia. A series of measuremental surveys of 14 single riggers, was undertaken at Ulithi Atoll, Yap of Micronesia and Rabaul, New Britain I. of Papua New Guinea {{in the month of}} November, 1986. Some statistic considerations, applied with 8 dimentional ratios of the hulls and outriggers of the 14 canoes, was made and their local variations in shape and size are well acertained in comparison with 145 outriggers in Philippine and Indonesia: 1) The canoes in Ulithi and Rabaul have an outrigger float of a tropical wood, "breadfruit tree", while Indonesian and Philippine canoes generally have two outrigger floats of bamboo. The Ulithi canoes with a short float, have symmetry hulls in profile and replace the foremost points of their two boomed triangle sails, knitted of "pandanus leaves", from one end to other end of the canoes as to keep wind on their float side, whenever the canoes greatly change their sailing directions. 2) The canoes have remarkable localities on their hulls and outriggers in shape and size by each location and these results are supported from some statistic considerations, including cluster analysis. One of the most distinct difference between single and double rigger canoes is found in shape and relative size of the <b>outrigger</b> <b>booms</b> held the floats and the length of the booms are relatively long on the single riggers. ﻿ 1) アウトリガーカヌーは,地域毎にそれぞれ異なった船型を持っている。このことは,クラスター分析の結果からも支持される。 2) シングルリガーとダブルリガーとは,特に浮体支持長の長さにおいて,明らかな相違があり,シングルリガーの方が長い。 3) ウルシーのカヌーは,幅の割に深さが深く,ラバウルのカヌーは,浅いが,いずれもアウトリガーカヌーの平均的な船型を持っている。 4) ウルシーとラバウルの浮体は,木製であり,他の地域は,竹製である。また,ウルシーのカヌーの浮体は,全 14 の地域の中で最も短く太い...|$|R

5000|$|The Boxkite was a two-bay biplane with an {{elevator}} carried on booms {{in front of}} the wings and an empennage consisting of a pair of fixed horizontal stabilisers, the upper bearing {{an elevator}}, and a pair of rudders carried on booms behind the wing. There were no fixed vertical surfaces. Lateral control was effected by ailerons on both upper and lower wings. These were single-acting, the control cables arranged to pull them down only, relying on the airflow to return them to the neutral position. The wings and fixed rear horizontal surfaces were covered by a single layer of fabric: the other surfaces were covered on both sides. Power was usually provided by a [...] Gnome rotary engine, although other engines were also used. This was mounted on a pair of substantial wooden beams mounted above the lower wing: these continued forward to carry the seats, which were arranged in tandem, with the pilot sitting over {{the leading edge of the}} wing. The undercarriage consisted of a pair of long skids, each bearing a pair of wheels sprung by bungee cords, and a single sprung tailskid mounted below the leading edge of the lower tailplane.The first two Boxkites, assigned works numbers 7 and 8, differed in detail from the later production aircraft; the front <b>outrigger</b> <b>booms</b> were braced by a pair of vertical struts and were attached to the ends of the interplane struts.
