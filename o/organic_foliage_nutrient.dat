40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} some {{correlation}} analysis results between in situ hyperspectral {{data in the}} spectral range of approximately 350 - 900 nm and three <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> constituents. Two hundred and forty hyperspectral measurements were taken using a PSD 1000 spectrometer at a giant sequoia plantation site in 1997. <b>Foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> constituents (expressed in concentration, percentage of dry weight) -total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium (TK) -were measured from the same site. The potential of hyperspectral data for estimating <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> status was evaluated using univariate correlation and multivariate regression analysis methods with different types of predictors: original and the first-order derivative spectra, vegetation index (VI) -based, spectral position-based, area-based and principal component analysis (PCA) -based predictors. The eight VIs were constructed from the blue, green, red and near-infrared spectra bands; spectral position-based predictors consisted of parameters extracted from the blue, yellow and red edges, the green peak and the red well; area-based variables were calculated as {{the sum of the}} first derivative values at each of the three edges; and the PCA-based predictors were obtained from principal component transformation applied to the first derivative spectra of the three edges. Results showed that the best <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> prediction was obtained with the PCA-based predictors in four-term prediction models for all three nutrient constituents. In univariate correlation analysis, it seems that only two VIs RB (R 760 - 850 / R 350 - 400) and NRB ((R 760 - 850 - R 350 - 400) /(R 760 - 850 + R 350 - 400)) may be employed to predict all three nutrient constituents (p = 0. 01), and better R 2 values were obtained from the maximum first derivative spectra of blue edge and yellow edge and the spectral reflectance difference between green peak and red well for TN, TP and TK. The results obtained from the univariate analysis, however, indicate that the level of correlation between <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations and hyperspectral data is low. In fact for TN there existed rather low correlations with different types of variables. In general, the best univariate correlation results were obtained for TK, then TP, with TN the worst. For multiple regression with PCA-based predictors, the best results came from TN, then TK, while the worst was associated with TP...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} was to determine the short-term effects of forest management practices (precommercial thinning and fertilization) on carbon efflux of a young black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) plantation in southern Iceland. Changes in leaf area index, tree growth, soil and air temperature were also monitored. Traditional precommercial thinning (50 %) had little effect on soil temperature, but heavy thinning (80 %) led to higher soil temperatures in spring and summer, but not much difference in winter. Thinning did not change <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> content or tree growth in the first treatment year. Effects on soil respiration were surprising; even if soil temperature was slightly higher and all organic material was left at site after precommercial thinning, soil respiration in the thinned stands was significantly lowered.

It did however significantly increase soil respiration rate in the first treatment year. These results may be important when the effects of early forest management on carbon fluxes are modeled...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} and examine a controlled field experiment near Thunder Bay, Ontario using industrially produced ash and biochar as a soil amendment. This study monitors the change in physical, chemical, and biological properties to the field soil, as well as, the growth of black and white spruce seedlings. Biochar and ash were applied to split plots (black spruce on one half and white spruce on the other) at the levels of 0, 1, and 10 tonnes ha- 1. Ash application at 10 tonnes ha- 1 caused the most significant changes to the soil?s chemical properties including: increasing pH, electrical conductivity, Ca, K, Na, estimated cation exchange capacity, S, and Zn; while decreasing Mg, and available/mineralizable NH 4. The only significant change to the soil from biochar application was a decrease in extractable Cu concentrations after the application of 10 tonnes ha- 1. There were no significant differences between treatments in tree growth after two growing seasons. However, seedling <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations increased significantly for some nutrients with the application of ash. Black spruce and white spruce both increased in <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrients</b> B, K, and S. However, only black spruce seedling increased in foliar Ca, and Mg, which was likely due to a difference in rooting patterns. It is possible that since the plots were located on an old nursery site that most nutrient deficiencies have been amended in the past and the effects of the treatment on the soil were not as great as they could be on poorer soil. The increase in <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations in black and white spruce points to possible changes to seedling growth in the future. Therefore, a more long term study must be done to determine if seedling performance will be affected by these treatments. " [...] from abstract...|$|R

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1963, the effects of added {{nutrients}} on the growth of dense stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. under varying levels of soil moisture were studied. Measurements of tree circumference growth, <b>foliage</b> moisture, <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> content, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature were made on six one-twenty-fifth acre split plots located near McNary, Arizona. The findings can be summarized as follows: 1. Growth in circumference did not start in the summer until soil moisture was sufficient. This was indicated {{by the beginning of}} growth on the watered plots before that of the unwatered plots. Growth on the unwatered plots did not start until after summer rains increased the soil moisture level. 2. Although a statistical analysis showed that the addition of nutrients did not significantly increase growth the first season after application, a graph showing the accumulative growth in circumference suggested that the nutrients with additional water would give larger increases in circumference growth in future growing seasons. 3. Growth in tree circumference was related to increases in the water added to the soil beyond that supplied by precipitation. 4. The <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> contents of both nitrogen and phosphorus were higher for the fertilized plots than for the unfertilized plots. This indicated that the added nutrients were absorbed by the trees. 5. Foliage moisture was not related to the soil moisture levels used in the experiment. A different time of sampling as indicated by foliage moisture data collected over a period of 24 hours might be a better indicator of soil moisture levels. 6. Foliage moisture was related to relative humidity changes. A more detailed study on foliage moisture changes in relation to relative humidity could be used to further verify this. 7.

We then compare these measures of vigor with characteristics of tree defense such as density of resin ducts, monoterpenes and size of phloem lesions after inoculation with Grossmania clavigera (a blue stain fungus associated with MPB). In a field experiment we tested the suggested relationship between vigor and defense by thinning and fertilization in ten pure lodgepole pine stands in central Alberta. In the third summer after the fertilization and thinning treatment we inoculated trees with the blue stain fungus. The combination of fertilization and thinning increased GE and resin duct density but negatively impacted starch reserves. Lesion size increased with tree size in control plots, however, this relationship was lost when trees were fertilized and thinned.

Differences between year means were highly significant for all elements analysed but there was no indication that a decline occurred over the years.

This report describes an application of the nutrient cycling and soil acidification model NuCSAM and the integrated water, carbon and nutrient cycling models SoilVeg and ForGro to the Speuld site, a Douglas fir stand on a Cambic podzol. This site was monitored between 1987 and 1991. The models were parameterized and calibrated for this site. Simulated soil water contents, soil solution chemistry, <b>foliage</b> biomass and <b>nutrient</b> status and stem growth between 1987 and 1991 were comparable with observations. However, the models showed large differences with respect to quantities {{that could not be}} measured, such as transpiration, leaching fluxes, root uptake fluxes and mineralization fluxes. The generality of the integrated models was further tested by an approximate simulation of a site irrigation and fertigation experiment at a nearby Douglas fir stand between 1987 and 1991. The direction and magnitude of simulated effects of irrigation and fertigation on stem growth, litter fall and needle nutrient status were generally right, but the observed enhanced nitrogen mineralization could not be simulated. Simulation of site response to three Dutch deposition scenarios between 1994 and 2050 showed large differences between the three models, particularly for nitrogen cycling and <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> status.

The effect of site on soil chemical parameters; soil pH, oxidizable carbon, available phosphorus, available nitrogen, total soil nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen ratio and soil nitrate, was highly significant (p < 0. 001). Similarly, the effect of site on foliar phosphorus and potassium was highly significant (p < 0 001). Site did not significantly (p < 0. 05) influence foliar nitrogen concentration. Height, diameter and basal area were significantly (p < 0. 001) influenced by site. Fertilizer addition significantly (p < 0. 05) increased available phosphorus in the topsoil of gradational clay loam soils but not in coarse sandy soils. N and P fertilizer addition significantly (p< 0. 001) increased foliar nitrogen at all the three sites.

Seedling biomass, plant moisture status, bud phenology, and allocation patterns of phenolics, carbohydrates, and key nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur) are reported. Hypotheses are developed and tested on the impacts of water-stress, defoliation, and root inoculation, on western spruce budworm growth and development, and Armillaria ostoyae-caused mortality and infection. Western spruce budworm larvae fed on water-stressed seedlings had higher survival rates, grew faster, and produced larger pupae than those fed on well-watered seedlings. There is no clear reason for the positive insect response, but changes in <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> patterns and phenolic chemistry are indicated. Insect caused defoliation has been earlier reported to enhance successful colonization of Armillaria spp. on deciduous trees in the forests of the northeastern United States. The positive response of the fungus was attributed to a weakened tree condition. Conversely, although this study conclusively found water-limited trees to have increased susceptibility to A. ostoyae, defoliation significantly lowered Armillaria-caused infection and mortality. The decline in infection success is attributed to defoliation-caused reduction in plant water stress and an alteration of root carbohydrate chemistry. One and/or two years of defoliation {{did not appear to}} weaken the physiological condition of seedlings. Conversely, water-stressed seedlings that were also defoliated produced more buds, had an earlier bud phenology, contained higher total reserve carbohydrates, and had little Armillaria-caused mortality.

Also, the additive effects of simultaneously occurring A. ostoyae and western spruce budworm may not be as severe as conventionally believed.

40|$|Using {{chemical}} knockdown procedures, canopy arthropod {{communities on}} eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) {{were found to}} be extraordinarily rich in species. Four seasonal samples from four species of eucalypts, two in eastern Australia and two in Western Australia, yielded 976 species of canopy arthropods from the eastern site and 683 species from the west. The richest and most abundant faunas occurred on the site with the greatest soil fertility and on the tree species with highest levels of <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrients</b> (i. e. nitrogen and phosphorous). High nutrient concentrations are taken as a measure of overall productivity. Seasonal and annual differences in arthropod abundances, biomass, and species richness are correlated with temporal changes in rainfall affecting tree phenological events (e. g. growth of new leaves) and productivity. Species of insectivorous birds that are dependent on energy-rich source carbohydrates (e. g. lerp, manna) select between plant species as foraging substrates {{on the basis of the}} kinds of arthropods available and their abundance on each kind of plant. On the basis of our results from studies of avian and canopy arthropod communities, we propose a general model to explain patterns of species richness in eucalypt forest communities. In eucalypt forests, site productivity appears to shape faunal richness in two ways. First, productive forests tend to be structurally and floristically complex. This provides opportunities for a high degree of specialisation among animal species. Secondly, these levels of specialisation are possible only where there are high levels of productivity and resources that are abundant and equitable in their temporal distribution. The richness of eucalypt communities, the rarity of many arthropod species, and the association of the richest communities with temperate, moist forests on the most productive soils suggests that eucalypt forest biodiversity will be sensitive to changes in forest structure, floristic composition, and changed levels of productivity associated with logging and broad area fuel reduction fires...|$|R

40|$|Ectomycorrhizal fungi {{underpin}} critical ecosystem processes which affect tree health. Eucalypt {{decline is}} widespread throughout Australia, and its cause has {{been attributed to}} a variety of factors, including forest management. In Tasmania, dieback in Eucalyptus delegatensis R. T. Baker has been linked to altered fire regimes and associated changes in mycorrhizal communities. This thesis presents a study that explores ectomycorrhizal species richness and community composition in relation to eucalypt health, understorey vegetation and soil chemistry in the context of fire history. The results further our understanding of ectomycorrhizal ecology and elucidate factors important to the maintenance of a healthy forest ecosystem. Study sites were established in E. delegatensis forest with either sclerophyll understorey (six plots) or rainforest understorey (six plots). Eight of the plots, located in north-east Tasmania, had been established for a study of fire ecology and had known fire histories ranging from 42 years since the last fire to long unburnt (> 120 years). Four plots located in north-western Tasmania were long unburnt but had been disturbed by logging 22 - 25 years previously. Ectomycorrhizal fungal sporocarps, root tips and soil samples were collected during a three-year period from all 12 plots. Samples from soil, root tips and sporocarps gave rise to different but complementary information about ectomycorrhizal communities. Fungal operational taxonomic units were identified through DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. At each site, understorey vegetation was characterised, soil and eucalypt foliage chemistry was analysed, and eucalypt crown condition was assessed. Primary crown dieback was identified as the most effective method for the measurement of eucalypt health. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to explore the relationships among ectomycorrhizal communities, eucalypt health, vegetation and abiotic variables. E. delegatensis forest with rainforest understorey was more than likely to be affected by severe eucalypt decline, had higher concentrations of soil inorganic nitrogen (nitrate and ammonium) and eucalypt foliar nitrogen, and had lower concentrations of soil and eucalypt foliar phosphorus, than forest with sclerophyll understorey. As forest declined in health the ecosystem moved from being nitrogen limiting to phosphorus limiting due to reduced phosphorus availability and plant uptake, potentially due to altered mycorrhizal activity. Ectomycorrhizal communities differed between moderately and severely declining forest and were correlated to crown health and altered soil chemistry associated with the two levels of decline. The Cortinariaceae had high species richness in healthiest sites while the Russulaceae and Thelephoraceae were rich in forest affected by severe decline. In northwestern and north-eastern Tasmania unique and distinctly different ectomycorrhizal fungal communities were found to occur in E. delegatensis forest with rainforest understorey versus those with sclerophyll understorey. Irrespective of understorey type and health status, the Cortinariaceae were highly diverse, and were the most species-rich family within the ectomycorrhizal community of E. delegatensis forest. The Cortinariaceae also was the most abundant family in the root tip community. The Helotiales, Russulaceae and Thelephoraceae also were important components. The importance of the Cortinariaceae in E. delegatensis forest is similar to other Australian eucalypt forests but distinctly different from northern hemisphere forests, which tend to be dominated by the Russulaceae, Thelephoraceae and Corticeaceae.

40|$|A survey {{pertaining}} to the topic as such has been conducted in three particular locations, where the sugar industries that consume fuel wood were situated, i. e. Jasinga (West Java), Gombong (East Java). and Karangasem (Bali). The inherent data were collected using the cluster-plot method {{to figure out the}} potential of available firewood in the community land. The main data covered the amount of <b>organic</b> <b>foliage</b> debris (i. e. twigs, small branches, etc.) which fall off the tree stands naturally, the potential volume of stands, and their regeneration rate to provide a reserve fuel wood which can be available whenever ii is needed. Meanwhile, the supplementary data were the firewood consumption, cooking stove efficiency, palm-sugar production, and palm-sugar yield and qualities, which in all were obtained through a trial observation in the field. The results revealed that the availabilities of foliage debris (biomass wastes) that fell-off to thetree base (ground) and of firewood from the branch-free portions of the upper tree stands, in percentage of the amount required by the industries, were consecutively 0. 20 - and 0. 61 -%ha (Karangasem), 0. 02 - and 0. 63 -%/ha (Gombong), and 4. 78 - and 1. 17 -%/ha (Jasinga). With respect to the area, Karang asam and Jasinga showed adequate availability of biomass wastes, but lack of firewood occurred in Gombong since the available stock was only around 70 %. Such high consumption of firewood was {{due to the fact that}} there were about 7160 palm-sugar industries in Gombong, while in Karangasem and Jasinga were only 550 and 65 industries. respectively. The highest consumption offirewood-derived energy was in Jasinga (219. 33 GJ/m 3), followed in decreasing order, i. e. 198. 00 GJ/m 3 in Gombong and l 44. 44 GJ/m 3 (as the lowest) in Karangasem. The high-energy consumption in Jasinga was brought about by the use of low-efficiency stove (i. e. 15. 07 %). Meanwhile, the efficiencies of the ones in Combong and Karangasem were significantly higher, i. e. 18. 62 and 30. 12 percent, respectively. The consumptions of firewood per household per year in such three locations were 2100 kg (Karangasem), 3924 kg (Gombong). and Jasinga (3456 kg). The highest yield (recovery) of palm sugar was obtained from the cooking of arenga juice (55. 56 %), while the lowest from palm juice (8. 77 %). About the qualities, based on the results of chemical analysis which covered the carbohydrate, water, ash, P. Ca, and Fe, and calorific values, the palm sugar from lontar juice was regarded as the best. followed by the ones from palm and arenga juices. One way to cope with the continual consumption of firewood was through the planting of tree species which are able to produce high-energy firewood and take short-rotation growth periods, such as kaliandra, lamtoro, and sengon. As such, the minimum area of the planting sites, as an example. for lamtoro should be 178 ha (in Karangasem), 4494 ha (Gombong), and 37 ha (Jasinga) ...|$|R

Rotations {{of trees and}} crops on farms are considered as a potential technology to overcome the shortage of wood, reverse deforestation of natural forests and improve soil fertility for food security enhancement in western Tanzania, sub-Saharan Africa. However, over-exploitation of soil water resources and depletion of soil nutrients have been suggested as possible negative effects of growing trees on farms in the semi-arid tropics. Such possible pitfalls undermine and even threaten a successful implementation of the woodlot technology at larger scale. Evidently, without proper understanding of the interactions and possible competition between trees and crops, {{the potential benefits of}} this agroforestry technology will not be realized. Therefore, this study was focused on improving the understanding of tree-soil-crop interactions by examining water and nutrient dynamics of various trees planted in rotational woodlots with a 5 -year cycle. Field trials were established with five-year rotational woodlots. Five tree species were compared with natural fallow and continuous maize. Inter-cropping of maize between trees was possible for {{the first two years of}} tree establishment without sacrificing maize yield. There was no evidence that trees were over-exploiting the water reserves after three years. Transpiration was greatest in A. crassicarpa and was related to stem diameter, size of the tree canopy and soil water availability. Trees depleted relatively more water than continuous maize and natural fallow, but were able to store more water after rains. Acacia trees had high litter fall but the leaves were low in P and N, which led to N and P immobilization during decomposition. Trees retrieved leached inorganic N and made better use of it than natural fallow and continuous maize. Wood production at the end of the five-year growing period ranged from 30 to 90 Mg ha - 1 while C sequestered in the aboveground biomass during the same period ranged between 13 to 30 Mg ha - 1. The rate of biomass production was highest for Acacia species while the <b>foliage</b> <b>nutrient</b> accumulation was highest for Leucaena species. The wood component varied greatly among species, ranging from 32 to 85 % of the total tree biomass. Maize yields were higher after growing trees than after natural fallow and continuous maize when no fertilizers were applied. The benefits of tree fallows compared to natural fallows were modest, in terms of maize yield increases. The increase in crop yields after woodlots was attributed in part to higher soil inorganic N. Maize responded to fertiliser N and P. The agronomic efficiency was about 30 kg grain per kg N applied at a rate of 50 kg fertilizer N, and 15 kg kg - 1 between 50 and 100 kg N applied. Application of more than 20 kg ha - 1 of P or K did not significantly increase maize yields. The benefit of woodlots expressed in terms of maize yield was more pronounced at mid and lower slope positions than at upper slopes. The significance of rotational woodlots in improving soil fertility is limited by substantial accumulation of nutrients in wood. Nutrient mining by wood exportation is therefore a major threat for the sustainability of woodlots, when the exported nutrients are not supplemented via external sources. Medium-term rotational woodlots have the potential to meet the domestic and industrial wood needs and at the same time to reduce deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
30|$|At Usutu forest, a trial {{comparing}} slash removal {{to slash}} retention and fertiliser application {{in the first}} and second rotations showed that slash removal at establishment resulted in unsustainable growth (Germishuizen 1979). Other studies have shown that this growth decline was caused by the loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrients (especially N) (Woods 1990), soil erosion and displacement (Titshall et al. 2013) and export of aboveground biomass (du Toit et al. 1999). Furthermore, removal of slash resulted in reduced soil moisture retention potential, low pH (Eisenbies et al. 2009), increased both soil temperature and bulk density (Smaill 2008) when compared with slash-retained plots (Sayer 2006). Short rotations also affect the mechanisms of nutrient supply and uptake balance because of changes in organic matter turnover (Mälkönen 1976; Raison 1982; Chen et al. 2000; Laclau et al. 2003). This occurs as a result of modified organic matter distribution and quality (Mälkönen 1976; Crous et al. 2011 b). Hence, managing tree felling debris or slash during compartment reestablishment is considered important for maintenance of the nutrient cycle of the soil surface though mineralisation of harvest residue (Weber 1985; Perez-Batallon et al. 2001; Saarsalmi et al. 2010; Titshall et al. 2013). Therefore, retaining slash is considered beneficial in maintaining site productivity on nutrient-poor sites (Wall 2012), by promoting long-term maintenance of soil productivity (Carter and Foster 2004; Laclau et al. 2010). Crous et al. (2011 b) suggested that larger quantities of K are exported from the site through stem bark and stem wood at P. patula harvest than at any other stage of the rotation. Retention of branches and <b>foliage</b> prevents <b>nutrient</b> export at about 37 % of the total N, 13 % of total Ca and Mg and 25 % of total P and K of the aboveground biomass is in foliage (Hernández et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Just over three-quarters (78 %) of the {{atmosphere}} comprises inert nitrogen which has very limited availability for biological use. All terrestrial ecosystems need reactive nitrogen and historically this has been in short supply. Artificial nitrogenous fertilizers and fossil fuel combustion are both sources of reactive nitrogen and their use has dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle. 1. ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION Nitrogen deposition largely originates from fossil fuel combustion and animal husbandry. Deposition is highest in central Europe. Only a minor decrease in deposition has been measured on intensive monitoring plots over the past decade. 2. LICHENS Lichens are very sensitive indicators of nitrogen deposition. Deposition is high on 75 % of the European forest plots and this {{is reflected in the}} change in lichen species composition over time. 3. MOSSES Mosses absorb most of their nutrients and water across their surface. As a result, they are directly affected by atmospheric deposition. In a study carried out in Austria, Croatia, Italy, and Slovenia the nitrogen content in mosses significantly increased with increasing nitrogen deposition (see p. 10). 4. FUNGI Fungal species diversity and structure significantly decrease with increasing nitrogen deposition. On a European transect through nine countries, 393 mycorrhizal species were determined. These fungal types live in symbiosis with tree roots and {{play a major role in}} nutrient uptake by trees (see p. 12). 5. SOIL SOLUTION An analysis of trends on the Level II plots showed exceedances of critical limits for nitrogen in the subsoil on 50 % of the plots. Leaching is mainly dependent on nitrogen deposition with other factors playing a relatively minor role. 6. LITTERFALL Litterfall and its decomposition are critical processes for transferring nutrients from above-ground forest biomass to soils. Tree species composition (and thus foliar litter chemistry) affects nitrogen cycling rates at the scale of entire forest stands; for example, the scale of the nitrogen transfer in litterfall determines the amount of nitrogen available for tree growth. 7. SOIL SOLID PHASE Soils play a key role in nitrogen cycling and storage within ecosystems. They host nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, as well as those that release nitrogen back into the air. Mineralization of organically-bound nitrogen takes place within soils and converts nitrogen to a form available for tree growth. Loss of nitrogen from the soil is mainly through harvesting and leaching. One of the key questions concerns the saturation status of European forest soils. 8. GROUNDWATER QUALITY Rain water containing dissolved nitrogen is pulled downwards through the soil by gravity, this is known as leaching. Leaching may affect the quality of drinking water pumped up from groundwater. In forests on sandy soils in the Netherlands nitrogenleaching has decreased by 55 % over the past 20 years, showing the success of emission reduction policies. 9. EFFECTS ON TREES 9 A <b>FOLIAGE</b> <b>NUTRIENT</b> BALANCE Soil nitrogen generally stimulates plant growth. However, excess nitrogen can cause other nutrients such as magnesium to become deficient. This can affect forest health and enhance the effects of additional stress factors. Nutrient im balances were detected in leaves and needles on 10 % of the nitrogen-saturated plots. 9 B CROWN CONDITION (TREE HEALTH) Effects of nitrogen deposition on leaf and needle loss can be detected at a local level for some tree species. These impacts are compounded by the effects of weather, insects and diseases, and soil condition. 9 C STEM GROWTH Nitrogen acts as fertilizer for trees. At sites with low nitrogen soil levels, atmospheric nitrogen inputs increase growth. But on nitrogen-saturated plots, even high atmospheric nitrogen inputs have no impact on tree growth. 10. CONCLUSIONS Assessing the input of nitrogen to forests and the direct and indirect responses of forest trees are core activities of the large-scale and intensive monitoring of forest ecosystems in Europe.

40|$|The N-fixing shrub Alnus sinuata (Sitka alder) dominates {{recently}} deglaciated sites along Glacier Bay but {{is replaced}} by Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) after c 80 yr. While Alnus dominated, soil organic matter and N increased very rapidly. Above-ground biomass {{was accompanied by a}} decline in soil N. In maturing Picea stands (100 - 160 yr old), N in above-ground biomass, especially current-year foliage, declined, perhaps because N began to accumulate in poorly decomposable organic (O) and podzolic (Bh) soil horizons. The O horizon of the Alnus site contained greater concentrations of most extractable macro- and micro-nutrients than that of Picea sites, suggesting rapid soil weathering, vegetative uptake, and cycling back to the O horizon. Soils under Picea experienced rapid podzolization. Associated with soil changes, above-ground net primary productivity of Picea decreased 50 % over the 160 -yr Picea-dominated portion of the chronosequence. Decreased net primary productivity could not be accounted for by increased respiratory cost of sapwood or <b>foliage,</b> suggesting a <b>nutrient</b> limitation to growth. Increase or decrease in productivity of these ecosystems appeared related to the effects of individual species on soil characteristics. -from Author...|$|R
40|$|Summary Variations in fine root biomass {{of trees}} and {{understory}} in 16 stands throughout Finland were examined and relationships to site and stand characteristics determined. Nor-way spruce fine root biomass varied between 184 and 370 g m– 2, and that of Scots pine ranged between 149 and 386 g m– 2. In northern Finland, understory roots and rhizomes (< 2 mm di-ameter) accounted for up to 50 % of the stand total fine root bio-mass. Therefore, the fine root biomass of trees plus understory was larger in northern Finland in stands of both tree species, re-sulting in a negative relationship between fine root biomass and the temperature sum and {{a positive relationship between}} fine root biomass and the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the soil organic layer. The foliage:fine root ratio varied between 2. 1 and 6. 4 for Norway spruce and between 0. 8 and 2. 2 for Scots pine. The ra-tio decreased for both Norway spruce and Scots pine from south to north, as well as from fertile to more infertile site types. The foliage:fine root ratio of Norway spruce was related to basal area and stem surface area. The strong positive correla-tions of these three parameters with fine root nitrogen concen-tration implies that more fine roots are needed to maintain a certain amount of <b>foliage</b> when <b>nutrient</b> availability is low. No significant relationships were found between stand parameters and fine root biomass at the stand level, but the relationships considerably improved when both fine root biomass and stand parameters were calculated for the mean tree in the stand. When the northern and southern sites were analyzed sepa-rately, fine root biomass per tree of both species was signifi-cantly correlated with basal area and stem surface area per tree. Basal area, stem surface area and stand density can be esti-mated accurately and easily. Thus, our results may have value in predicting fine root biomass at the tree and stand level in bo-real Norway spruce and Scots pine forests...|$|R
40|$|An {{aspect of}} each of three factors {{relating}} to efficiency of fertilizer use were studied in glasshouse experiments using beans Phaseolus vulgaris var. Gallatin 50. These three factors were: the quantities that can be applied; physiological aspects of nutrient utilization following foliar uptake; and interactions with other sources of nutrient supply. Distribution patterns of S 35, P 32 and Zn 65 were examined following application to soil and foliage of beans. It was found that {{a greater proportion of}} P 32 and Zn 65 was present in the fruit following foliar uptake than was the case following root uptake. This difference was not evident for S 35. Retention of a commercial nutrient spray on the foliage of bean plants was measured and found to correlate well with both leaf area and leaf fresh weight. The effect of sprays on leaf chlorophyll was also examined. Environmental effects were found to have more influence on leaf chlorophyll than nutrient sprays.

Samples were taken to look for differences between plots in soil, <b>foliage</b> and litter <b>nutrient</b> concentrations arid ratios. Changes in canopy leaf area and wood production efficiency. were calculated from estimates of stemwood diameter and sapwood area. Wood production efficiency, an index of stemwood production per unit of leaf area, remained steady or increased under all treatments, despite shading from higher canopy leaf areas. On the less fertile Washington and Vancouver Island sites, the alder/conifer plots, with higher concentration up to a certain 'threshold level', above which higher nitrogen concentrations did not increase wood production as significantly. Stemwood production also tended to increase with higher N:P ratios and then leveled off above a ratio of twelve. A nitrogen use efficiency was calculated as the amount of stemwood produced per unit of N in the foliage. Although higher foliar nitrogen values correlated with higher wood production/m 2 on the poorer quality sites, the nutrient use efficiency tended to be lower when the nitrogen concentration per m 2 was more than about three grams per m 2. Stemwood production per m 2 of foliage tended to increase with higher foliar N:P ratios, but the correlation coefficient was low.

40|$|Catastrophic wildfires, {{such as the}} 1990 Painted Cave Fire in Santa Barbara or Oakland fire of 1991, {{attest to}} the {{destructive}} potential of fire in the wildland/urban interface. For example, during the Painted Cave Fire, 673 structures were consumed {{over a period of}} only six hours at an estimated cost of 250 million dollars (Gomes et al., 1993). One of the primary sources of fuels is chaparral, which consists of plant species that are adapted to frequent fires and may actually promote its ignition and spread of through volatile <b>organic</b> compounds in <b>foliage.</b> As {{one of the most widely}} distributed plant communities in Southern California, and one of the most common vegetation types along the wildland urban interface, chaparral represents one of the greatest sources of wildfire hazard in the region. An ongoing NASA funded research project was initiated in 1994 to study the potential of AVIRIS for mapping wildfire fuel properties in Southern California chaparral. The project was initiated in the Santa Monica Mountains, an east-west trending range in western Los Angeles County that has experienced extremely high fire frequencies over the past 70 years. The Santa Monica Mountains were selected because they exemplify many of the problems facing the southwest, forming a complex mosaic of land ownership intermixed with a diversity of chaparral age classes and fuel loads. Furthermore, the area has a wide diversity of chaparral community types and a rich background in supporting geographic information including fire history, soils and topography. Recent fires in the Santa Monica Mountains, including several in 1993 and the Calabasas fire of 1996 attest to the active fire regime present in the area. The long term objectives of this project are to improve existing maps of wildland fuel properties in the area, link AVIRIS derived products to fuel models under development for the region, then predict fire hazard through models that simulate fire spread.
