5|$|Because Israel's {{victory was}} {{largely due to}} U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> the U.S., {{resulting}} in the 1973 oil crisis. The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.|$|E

In June 1973, the Liberian oil tanker Napier ran aground on Guamblin Island, accidentally releasing 30,000 tons of oil. After the rescue of the crew, the vessel was fired upon and set on fire by Chilean Hunters {{in an effort to}} burn the <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> avoid further environmental contamination.|$|E

5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|Angola {{agreed to}} trade <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> Slovakia {{in return for}} arms, buying six Sukhoi Su-17 attack {{aircraft}} on 3 April 2000. The Spanish government in the Canary Islands prevented a Ukrainian freighter from delivering 636tons of military equipment to Angola on 24 February 2001. The captain of the ship had inaccurately reported his cargo, falsely claiming the ship carried automobile parts. The Angolan government admitted Simportex had purchased arms from Rosvooruzhenie, the Russian state-owned arms company, and acknowledged the captain might have violated Spanish law by misreporting his cargo, a common practice in arms smuggling to Angola.|$|E

5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> the outside world was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of {{a few months in}} Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E

5|$|Maintenance problems. The {{chain-driven}} {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> splash onto the boiler lagging. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash, which provided combustible material, and sparks from heavy braking would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary, to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming {{into contact with the}} hot boiler causing stress to the casings. Many photographs show an un-rebuilt locomotive with warped casings, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

After receiving the request, W. J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal.

Children can accidentally place their hands {{on top of the}} stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury.

5|$|The 1880s {{also saw}} the {{beginnings}} of the Asian oil trade. The idea that led to moving Russian <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> the Far East via the Suez Canal was the brainchild of two men: importer Marcus Samuel and shipowner/broker Fred Lane. Prior bids to move oil through the canal had been rejected by the Suez Canal Company as being too risky. Samuel approached the problem a different way: asking the company for the specifications of a tanker it would allow through the canal.|$|E

This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute.
