For the low-quality direction of asymmetric links, we observe based on testbed experiments that {{the reliability of}} synchronous acknowledgments is considerably {{higher than that of}} asynchronous messages.

This leads us to investigate how to exploit asymmetric links in order to improve network functions such as convergecast routing in sensor networks via <b>one-way</b> <b>link</b> estimation. We propose a new <b>one-way</b> <b>link</b> metric ETF (for the expected number of transmissions over forward links) and present a local procedure for its estimation.

We also study the comparative performance improvement of ETF over ETX when no special mechanism is employed to discover asymmetric links...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Energy-efficient routing {{is a very}} {{important}} issue in wireless sensor networks. An efficient routing method can avoid unnecessary data transmission and thus saves more power to extend the life of a network. The Connected Dominating Set (CDS) is a commonly used routing method which serves as a virtual backbone for a sensor network to achieve better transmission performance. The primary advantage of a CDS is its ability to adapt to the rapidly changed network topology. The construction of the CDS is a well-studied problem in an undirected unit disk graph, in which sensors are assumed to have the same transmission range. However, in practice, the sensors could have different transmission ranges due to their residual power or energy-saving mechanisms. The difference of transmission radius may form a <b>one-way</b> <b>link</b> between two nodes. Therefore, in this paper, we model the network as a directed graph and consider the CDS construction problem in such environment. We propose algorithms to construct a Strongly Connected Dominating Set (SCDS) which is a routing backbone that provides the service of efficient bidirectional data transmission between any two sensor nodes in the network...|$|E
40|$|Link {{asymmetry}} {{is one of}} {{the characteristic}} challenges that wireless sensor networks pose in the design of network protocols. We observe, based on testbed experiments, that a substantial percentage of links are asymmetric, many are even unidirectional. We also find that the reliability of synchronous acknowledgments is considerably higher than that of asynchronous messages. Thus the norm of estimating link quality bidirectionally via asynchronous beacons underestimates the link reliability of asymmetric links. This leads us to investigate how to exploit asymmetric links in order to improve network functions such as convergecast routing in sensor networks via oneway link estimation. We propose a new <b>one-way</b> <b>link</b> metric ETF (for the expected number of transmissions over forward links) and present a local procedure for its estimation. We use ETF to identify reliable forward links, and we use dynamic retransmission thresholding for error control. Via experiments on testbeds of CC 1000 radios and CC 2420 radios (an IEEE 802. 15. 4 -compliant radio), we quantify the performance improvement in ETF as compared with ETX. We also study the performance improvement of ETF over ETX when no special mechanism is employed to discover asymmetric links or to control retransmissions...|$|E
