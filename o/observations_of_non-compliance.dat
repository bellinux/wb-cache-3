40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of a pilot study of <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> {{behaviour}} by tourists to a voluntary code of conduct based on marine turtles attempting to nest in the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. The study used focal-animal sampling to record the response of marine turtles to non-compliance behaviour of tourist groups. Results of observations indicated that 77 % of tourist groups breached the code of conduct, with 51 % of these breaches resulting in a disturbance to marine turtles attempting to nest. The key aspects of the code of conduct that were breached included: shining light on the turtle; being closer than three metres from a turtle; and not staying behind the turtle at all times. The greatest disturbance to marine turtles was from tourists groups shining their torches on the turtles. This work demonstrates the need for further research into disturbance of turtles by tourists and the effectiveness of voluntary codes of conduct...|$|E
40|$|The Mornington Peninsula National Park {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{priority}} areas for Hooded Plover conservation and population recovery in Eastern Australia. • Beach and dune habitat within the Mornington Peninsula National Park is extremely resource productive and of high habitat value. • With ~ 30 breeding pairs, it has potential to significantly contribute to population viability. However this is not the case: the Mornington Peninsula has one of the lowest breeding success rates of any monitored region in Victoria and South Australia. Last breeding season, only three chicks fledged (0. 10 fledglings per pair). This is nearly five times lower than the state average. • Visitation rates to the park are the highest of any in the state and only increasing. Coupled with this are <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with dog regulations with 78. 9 % of all dogs observed being off-leash and dog owners being compliant with signage in only 2. 9 % of all observations. Some regulation breaches are particularly serious with nesting birds being directly attacked. • Twenty years of educational efforts have not resulted in improved compliance with dog leashing in the park. Most noteworthy is that compliance with dog regulations is usually high in areas where dogs are prohibited. • Prohibition of dogs within the National Park would reinforce the significance of this region and be a critical step to recovering this threatened species. It would remove any ambiguity about dog regulations within the park which are currently quite complex, and would be consistent with the prohibition of pets across the majority of National Parks across Australia. • There are abundant areas on the Mornington Peninsula for off-leash dog walking, but there is no other habitat like this for the Hooded Plover...|$|E
40|$|In this PhD thesis, {{we study}} the {{enforcement}} of environmental law using an economic perspective. Environmental law enforcement is an important topic for two reasons. Firstly, regulatory initiatives are important drivers for demand for environmental goods and services, for producing in a more environmentally-friendly way and for internalizing possible external costsof economic activities. Thus, enforcement of environmental regulation is a tool for going to a more sustainable economy. Secondly, setting up a regulatory framework without taking sufficient enforcement measures gives non-compliant firms a competitive edge over firms that do invest in regulatory compliance. In a competitive environment, {{this can lead to}} complying firms going out of business or, alternatively, reducing their compliance efforts. Thus, it is clear that regulation without enforcement leads to undesirable outcomes. The enforcement process consists of an interaction between firms and regulatory enforcement authorities. In our case, these are environmental enforcement administrations and/or judges in court. The use of an economic perspective consists in the way that we analyze the interests of different parties and their interactions. We make use of micro-economic modeling and econometric methods, such as discrete choice theory and matching methods, to analyze how decision-making occurs in theory and in practice. Some of the results that we obtain are the following. Firstly, we find that judges take the economic costs of penalties (=possible loss in employment) into account when they take environmental enforcement decisions. This is the economic equivalent of the application of the proportionality principle. However, we do find that different judges in Belgium make differentdecisions in the trade-off between compliance promotion and proportionality. Secondly, we find that penalties for environmental law non-compliance (imposed by judges or administrative enforcement officials) do not increase explicitly with intentionality, but that they do increase with repeat offenses. This is equivalent to a decision process in which judges/enforcement officials learn about intent through repeated <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> Thirdly, we find that judges in court impose higher penalties for similar decisions compared to administrative enforcement. We develop a methodology for statistically analyzing enforcement treatment differences which could be applied in a variety of empirical legal settings or in the area of law & economics. Finally, we develop a model to understand why settlement proposals are often very low forenvironmental cases. We also explain why the institution of legal boundaries on allowable settlement proposals would only have superficial effects. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false" <w:lsdexception=""  Acknowledgements	I Table of Contents	III List of figures	VII List of tables	VIII Propositions	XI Chapter 1 : Introduction 1.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDigoxin {{is highly}} potent and efficacious for {{treatment}} of heart failure (HF) and/or atrial fibrillation (AF) yet compliance is often poor. AimsTo examine prevalence rates <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin; variations between clinical settings, types <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and methods <b>of</b> detection; and potential factors influencing non-compliance with digoxin. MethodsThis was a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin in patients with HF and/or AF, published in English. The studies were identified through these bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, IPA and Cochrane CENTRAL. Subgroup analysis examined the influence of clinical settings, types <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and methods <b>of</b> detection. ResultsTen studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1841 patients with HF and/or AF. The corresponding prevalence rates <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> for outpatients, after hospital discharge and inpatients were 43. 1 % (interquartile range [IQR] 29 – 48 %), 25 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 12 – 37 %) and 4. 5 %, respectively. In patients with HF and AF co-morbidities, the prevalence rate <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin was 38. 7 % (IQR 27 – 46 %); the corresponding prevalence rates of overdosing and underdosing were 33. 04 % (IQR 22 – 49 %) and 33. 8 % (95 % CI 25 – 42 %), respectively. Rates varied depending on the methods <b>of</b> detecting <b>non-compliance.</b> Regularity <b>of</b> prescribed dose, diuretic use, coronary artery bypass, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, number of office visits and pill boxes demonstrated strong associations with non-compliance with digoxin. ConclusionsNon-compliance with digoxin is prevalent among patients with HF and/or AF.

30|$|The paper {{begins by}} {{developing}} a simple theoretical model in which the obvious benefits <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> for an employer are to be set against the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> We model these as composed of the probability of getting caught, and the fine imposed if caught. However, alternative interpretations of the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> are possible, including peer effects. We model the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> {{as a function of}} the total short fall of the wage bill compared to full compliance, allowing for the possibility that employers adjust partially towards the minimum wage. The model predicts that employment will fall as the result of a minimum wage, but that a spread of wages below the minimum wage should be observed in response to the law. Employer responses to a minimum wage law depend on the level at which the minimum wage is set, relative to the existing wage. Wages will rise towards the minimum wage, and under certain conditions, the lowest wages will rise proportionately more than those close to the stipulated minimum.|$|R
