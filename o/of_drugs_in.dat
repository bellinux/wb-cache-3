5|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> the {{management}} of cancer pain have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others. Healthcare professionals have an ethical obligation to ensure that, whenever possible, the patient or patient's guardian is well-informed about {{the risks and benefits}} associated with their pain management options.

5|$|This naming {{scheme is}} used for both the World Health Organization’s International Nonproprietary Names (INN) and the United States Adopted Names (USAN) for pharmaceuticals. In general, word stems are used to {{identify}} classes <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> <b>in</b> most cases placed word-finally. All monoclonal antibody names end with the stem -mab. Unlike most other pharmaceuticals, monoclonal antibody nomenclature uses different preceding word parts (morphemes) depending on structure and function. These are officially called substems and sometimes erroneously infixes, even by the USAN Council itself.|$|E
5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E

40|$|Lactobacillus {{preparations}} {{have been}} demonstrated to be beneficial {{in the prevention of}} antibiotic-associated diarrhea resulting from ampicillin. Since the bioavailability of oral ampicillin is known to be affected by food and fluid volume, a study to evaluate the influence of a lactobacillus product on ampicillin bioavailability was performed. Twelve healthy volunteers, male and female, were studied in a randomized three-way cross-over study. Each received ampicillin alone, ampicillin with a lactobacillus preparation, and ampicillin followed 1 h later by the lactobacillus preparation. Blood was sampled over a 6 -h time period. Ampicillin content was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Area under the concentration-time curve, area under the first moment of the concentration-time curve, maximum concentration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> plasma, time to maximum concentration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> plasma, and mean residence time were determined for each study interval.

In Northern Ireland in cases where drugs were detected in samples from impaired drivers who were not impaired by alcohol, benzodiazepines were found in 87% of cases. Diazepam was the most commonly detected benzodiazepine.|$|E

40|$|Cefaclor is an oral {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic {{which has}} a broad antibacterial spectrum. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of food on the absorption of cefaclor and to analyze kinetically the absorption process <b>of</b> this <b>drug.</b> Cefaclor was given to eight volunteers at five test times: after overnight fasting, after two rice meals (350 and 700 cal [1 cal = 4. 184 J]), and after two bread meals (500 and 1, 000 cal). Urinary recoveries of cefaclor and concentrations <b>of</b> the <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> plasma were determined for each administration. Areas under the concentration-time curves and urinary recoveries were not affected by food intake, but the maximum concentration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> serum was reduced and the time to maximum concentration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> serum was prolonged depending on the type and the quantity of the meal. The larger the quantity of the meal, the more the maximum concentration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> serum and the time to maximum concentration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>in</b> serum were affected. The rice meals affected the absorption process of cefaclor more than the bread meals. The concentrations of cefaclor in plasma following administration after overnight fasting were well fitted to a conventional one-compartment model with a first-order absorption process, but those after the other administrations were not fitted to the model. For the pharmacokinetic analysis of those data, it was necessary to introduce a transfer process from administration site to absorption site to the conventional model. The concentrations in plasma after rice and bread meals were best fitted to the model with a zero-order transfer process than to that with a first-order process. The velocity of the transfer process depended on the type and volume of the meal...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} differences between the two countries is the much higher cost <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> the United States. In the U.S., $728 per capita is spent each year on drugs, while in Canada it is $509. At the same time, consumption is higher in Canada, with about 12 prescriptions being filled per person each year in Canada and 10.6 in the United States. The main difference is that patented drug prices in Canada average between 35% and 45% lower than in the United States, though generic prices are higher. The price differential for brand-name drugs between the two countries has led Americans to purchase upward of $1 billion US in drugs per year from Canadian pharmacies.|$|E
