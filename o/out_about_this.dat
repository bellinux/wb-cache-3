5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that readers will connect with.|$|E
5|$|As Coach begins putting {{together}} his new Lion team, he realizes he's in {{for more than}} he bargained for. The players who try out are less than desirable, but Coach gets a lucky break {{with a couple of}} new faces. The first is Vince Howard (Michael B. Jordan), a student who has gotten {{in trouble with the law}} too many times. He is given one last chance if he plays football for the East Dillon Lions. Although he has no prior football experience, he has natural talent and becomes the team's first star quarterback. The second break comes to the Lions when Buddy Garrity reveals to Eric that the address on file for the Panthers new prodigy running back, Luke Cafferty, is nothing more than a mailbox in front of an empty lot, and Luke is really zoned for East Dillon. Tami is faced with a struggle as the principal of West Dillon. A new character on the show, Becky, is introduced when Tim Riggins rents a trailer on her mother's property. Although she is in love with Tim, she and Luke are both shopping at a convenience store and she allows Luke to drive her home. The two have sex and Becky becomes pregnant. Even though she is a student at East Dillon, she seeks out Tami's help with the situation. Tami discusses all of the options with her and Becky decides to get an abortion.

25|$|Jin {{bought two}} biplanes from the Soviet Union in September 1931 at 40,000 Mexican silver dollars each. They were {{equipped}} {{with machine guns}} and bombs and flown by Russian pilots. He signed a secret treaty with the Soviet Union in October 1931 that quickly led to suppression of the Kumul Rebellion and the deblockading of Kumul by provincial troops on November 30, 1931. Jin Shuren received large gold credits from the Soviet government for acquiring arms and weapons from the Soviet army and opening Soviet trade agencies in eight provincial towns: Ghulja, Chuguchak, Altai, Urumqi, Karashahr, Kucha, Aksu, Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan. The Kuomintang found <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> the following year and decided to openly back Ma Zhongying in his war against Jin Shuren.|$|E
25|$|Umar's {{political}} genius first manifested as {{the architect}} of the caliphate after Muhammad died on 8 June 632. While the funeral of Muhammad was being arranged a group of Muhammad's followers who were natives of Medina, the Ansar (helpers), organised a meeting {{on the outskirts of the}} city, effectively locking out those companions known as Muhajirs (The Emigrants) including Umar. Umar found <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> meeting at Saqifah Bani Saadah, and taking with him two other Muhajirs, Abu Bakr and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, proceeded to the meeting, presumably to head off the Ansar's plans for political separatism. Arriving at the meeting Umar was faced with a unified community of tribes from the Ansar who refused to accept the leadership of the Muhajirs. However Umar was undeterred in his belief the caliphate should be under the control of the Muhajirs. Though the Khazraj were in disagreement, Umar after strained negotiations lasting up to one or two days, brilliantly divided the Ansar into their old warring factions of Aws and Khazraj tribes. Umar resolved the divisions by placing his hand on that of Abu Bakr as a unity candidate for those gathered in the Saqifah. Others gathered at the Saqifah meeting followed suit with the exception of the Khazraj tribe and their leader, Sa'd ibn 'Ubada, whose tribe was ostracized. The Khazraj tribe is said to have posed no significant threat as there were sufficient men of war from the Medinan tribes such as the Banu Aws to immediately organize them into a military bodyguard for Abu Bakr.|$|E

500|$|Soon, Major-Generals Bruce and Bergholtz {{turned to}} Apraksin with a {{proposal}} to assault the fort, not waiting for [...] "the production of an opening".

Peter, having found <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> from a letter by Apraksin, decided it to be [...] "very significant, but also very dangerous."

500|$|Alexander {{began his}} reign by having his {{potential}} rivals {{to the throne}} murdered.

Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and her daughter by Philip, Europa, burned alive. When Alexander found <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> he was furious with his mother. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was {{in command of the}} advance guard of the army in Asia Minor. Attalus was at the time in correspondence with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Regardless of whether Attalus actually intended to defect, he had already severely insulted Alexander, and having just had Attalus's daughter and grandchildren murdered, Alexander probably felt Attalus was too dangerous to leave alive. [...] Alexander spared the life of his half-brother Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts somewhat mentally [...] disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.|$|E

500|$|After the Australian forces {{moved to}} the Western Front in 1916, Blamey {{returned}} to the 1st Division as GSO1. At the Battle of Pozières, he developed the plan of attack which captured the town, for which he received another mention in despatches, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1917 New Year Honours. He was considered as a possible brigade commander, {{but he had never}} commanded a battalion, which was usually regarded as a prerequisite for brigade command. He was therefore appointed to command the 2nd Infantry Battalion on 3 December 1916. On 28 December, Blamey, as senior ranking battalion commander, took over as acting commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade. On 9 January 1917, he went on leave, handing over command to Lieutenant Colonel Iven Mackay. However, when General Headquarters (GHQ) BEF found <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> use of a staff college graduate, it reminded I ANZAC Corps that [...] "it is inadvisable to release such officers for command of battalions unless they have proved to be unequal to their duties on staff".|$|E
500|$|John Baldwin {{was born}} in Branford, Connecticut on 13 October 1799 to Joseph Baldwin and Rosanna Malley. His mother was a well-educated woman, as well as {{intensely}} religious. She attempted to become a student at Yale University, but was not allowed {{because she was a}} woman. Due to this, John resolved to make no distinction between races or sexes should he ever found a school. His father enlisted in the Continental Army during the American Revolution as a private and left as a captain. When John turned eighteen, he joined the Methodist Church. As a student at a private school, he paid his way by chopping firewood, ringing the bell, and building fires. Afterwards, he became a teacher in Fishkill, New York, Maryland, and Litchfield, Connecticut. As a teacher in Maryland, his stance on slavery, as well as black people as a whole, was revealed. A mulatto boy was sent to his school daily as a servant for his master's son. Baldwin began to teach them in common. When the student's father found <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> he demanded Baldwin not teach him any more, to which he replied, [...] "I do not charge anything for teaching him" [...] and continued to teach him.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "We Want the Airwaves", which has {{instrumentation}} that strays from traditional punk rock and more so towards hard rock. Music journalist Chuck Eddy described the song as [...] "a sort of Black Sabbath punk rock." [...] Though rumors of the album's third track, [...] "The KKK Took My Baby Away", being about Johnny stealing Joey's girlfriend have circulated {{in the music}} business, the song was actually written some time before Joey had reportedly found <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> Joey's brother Mickey Leigh relates: [...] "The fluky connection between Johnny and the KKK raised a specter that keeps friends and fans speculating to this day. At the time, though, {{it had to be}} an unusual situation for him being that, as often happens with song lyrics, his words now took on a whole new meaning." [...] The following track, [...] "Don't Go", was described in Musician, Player, and Listener as [...] "Spector-ish", referring to the song's high production value through Phil Spector, the infamous producer of the band's previous record, End of the Century. According to the book, the lyrics detail [...] "an archivist's sense of young love by the book and how innocent rock 'n' roll is supposed to sound." [...] Everett True, author of Hey Ho Let's Go: The Story of the Ramones (2005), explains that the album's fifth track, [...] "You Sound Like You're Sick", is very bass incorporated, saying that it [...] "returns to the bassist's traditional institutionalised theme." [...] Side A ends with [...] "It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)", which was described by music critic David Fricke to be [...] "driven home" [...] by drummer Marky's [...] "feisty, Bo Diddley-style" [...] drum beat, and noted that it borrows the middle eight (of thirty-two-bar form) from The Who song [...] "Whiskey Man".|$|E

500|$|As the {{conflict}} in Columbia tilts in favour of the son, Hamilton goes outside of the normal chain of command to plan the execution of Barranco {{and the elimination of}} the local Shorn representative in a gladiatorial duel. Faulkner finds <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> and barges into a video conference Hamilton is having with Francisco, telling him that he in fact killed his father with his bare hands. He then beats Hamilton and breaks his neck. He is duly captured and placed in a Corporation operated jail. In jail, Chris is offered a choice: be convicted of murder and have his organs harvested after being subject to capital punishment or participate in face-saving (for Shorn) farce by saying he had legally issued a challenge to Hamilton for his position in the firm. [...] Conditions of this agreement are steep however as he must drive against Mike Bryant, who he had grown to be truly close with, but who is now completely done with him with revelation of Chris' affair with Liz Linshaw and Chris' brutal killings outside of the bounds of the challenge process. [...] The night prior to the challenge, the UN representative returns with the chance for Chris to escape and reunite with his estranged wife, who has left the country. [...] He declines. [...] Mike is the superior driver but using a creative interpretation of challenge rules, Chris forces Mike to drive off a bridge and into the Zones. Chris finds the badly injured Mike and kills him just before a gang, who had watched the duel on television, finds them. The gang beats Chris but he survives when the gang is gunned down by Driver Control authorities, the sanctioning body for duels. The story ends with Chris, as the new senior executive, giving the new dictator Francisco Echevarria 48 hours to flee his country in favour of installing Barranco.|$|E
