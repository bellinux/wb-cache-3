5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought <b>occasional</b> <b>light</b> snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|Hindfoot {{length is}} 37mm (1.5in). The upper {{sides of the}} feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is {{relatively}} short at 6mm (0.2in); the hallux (first digit) is 8mm (0.3in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12mm (0.4 to 0.5in). The tail is 238mm (9.4in) long and naked in part. At the base, it is dark brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55mm (2.2in) from the tip and then whitish at about 65mm (2.6in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and <b>occasional</b> <b>light</b> brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130mm (5.1in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180mm (7.1in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, dark brown tuft.|$|E

500|$|The Rhinemaidens {{have been}} {{described}} as the drama's [...] "most seductive but most elusive characters", and in one analysis as representatives of [...] "seduction by infantile fantasy". They [...] act essentially as a unity, with a composite yet elusive personality. Apart from Flosshilde’s implied seniority, demonstrated by <b>occasional</b> <b>light</b> rebukes and illustrated musically by awarding the role to a deeper-voiced contralto or mezzo, their characters are undifferentiated. In The Perfect Wagnerite, his 1886 analysis of the Ring drama as political allegory, George Bernard Shaw describes the Rhinemaidens as [...] "thoughtless, elemental, only half-real things, very much like modern young ladies". The attributes most apparent initially are charm and playfulness, combined with a natural innocence; their joy in the gold they guard derives from its beauty alone, even though they know its latent power. However, this veneer of childlike simplicity is misleading; aside from proving themselves irresponsible as guardians, they are also provocative, sarcastic and cruel in their interaction with Alberich. When the demigod Loge reports that the Rhinemaidens need Wotan's help to regain the gold, Fricka, the goddess of marriage, calls them a [...] "watery brood" [...] (Wassergezücht) and complains about the many men they have lured away with their [...] "treacherous bathing". They are beguiling and flirtatious with Siegfried, but finally wise as revealed by the undisclosed counsel which they give to Brünnhilde. Sabor sees the personality of the Rhinemaidens as a blend of the [...] "good hearted nature" [...] of the Oceanids and the [...] "austerity" [...] (including the willingness to drown people) of the daughters of Ægir.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{account of}} the Battle of Mulege {{provides}} a different perspective. [...] USS Dale commanded by Selfridge on way to Guaymas learned of enemy forces in Mulege with an estimated force of 150 men. [...] Four boats from Dale commanded by Lt Craven, under the protective cover of Dale commandeered a Mexican schooner without resistance. [...] The Following day, 1 October 1847, Lt Craven with 50 sailors plus marines landed. [...] Under barrage of round shell and shot from Dale the Mexican forces abandoned the village and were pursued up the valley by Lt Craven's forces. [...] Craven's forces scoured the valley for {{a distance of about}} three miles coming under <b>occasional</b> <b>light</b> assault from ambush. [...] Lt Craven, fearing the possibility than his men were being led into an ambush, returned with his men to Dale. [...] Lt Craven when patrolling later off Mulege on the Liberta gathered intelligence that actually only 100 fighters were in the Mulege area on 2 Oct.|$|E

2500|$|Ridgefield {{consists}} of hilly, rocky terrain, ranging from [...] {{above sea level}} (at Pine Mountain) to [...] at Branchville. Its average village elevation is [...] above sea level. The landscape is strewn with countless rocks deposited by glaciers, and among the town's bodies of water is Round Pond, formed in a kettle left by the last glacier 20,000 years ago. A particularly interesting feature is Cameron's Line, named for Eugene N. Cameron, who discovered that rocks west of the line differed greatly from those east of it. This fault line was formed some 250 million {{years ago by the}} collision of [...] "Proto North America" [...] and [...] "Proto Africa", and there are still <b>occasional</b> <b>light</b> earthquakes felt along its length. The line bisects the southern half of the town, running generally north of West Lane, across {{the north end of the}} village, past the south end of Great Swamp and generally easterly into Redding in the Topstone area. North of Cameron's Line, the town is rich in limestone. The mineral was extensively mined, and remnants of several limekilns exist today. Also mined here in the 19th century was mica, pegmatite, and quartz. Gold, as well as gemstones such as garnet and beryl, have been found here, and dozens of minerals have been unearthed at the old Branchville Mica Quarry. Uraninite, a source of uranium, is found here, too.|$|E

This so much resembled his idea of the motions of an apparition, that Hobbie Elliot, making a dead pause, while his hair erected itself upon his scalp, whispered to his companion, [...] "It's Auld Ailie hersell!

60|$|It {{was a dark}} evening, and it {{was only}} when Tito crossed the <b>occasional</b> <b>light</b> of a lamp {{suspended}} before an image of the Virgin, that the outline of his figure was discernible enough for recognition. At such moments any one caring to watch his passage from one of these lights to another might have observed that the tall and graceful personage with the mantle folded round him was followed constantly by a very different form, thickset and elderly, in a serge tunic and felt hat. The conjunction might have been taken for mere chance, since there were many passengers along the streets at this hour. But when Tito stopped at the gate of the Rucellai gardens, the figure behind stopped too. The sportello, or smaller door of the gate, was already being held open by the servant, who, in the distraction of attending to some question, had not yet closed it since the last arrival, and Tito turned in rapidly, giving his name to the servant, and passing on between the evergreen bushes that shone like metal in the torchlight. The follower turned in too.|$|E
60|$|All day I rode {{through this}} {{beautiful}} country, meeting few folk, for I {{kept away from}} the main roads. A few shepherds and farmers, a long-legged clergyman, a packman with his mule, and a horseman with a great bag, whom I took to be a buyer of hair, are all that I can recall. A black jack of ale and the heel of a loaf at a wayside inn were all my refreshments. Near Combwich, Covenant cast a shoe, and two hours were wasted before I found a smithy in the town and had the matter set right. It was not until evening that I at last came out upon {{the banks of the}} Bristol Channel, at a place called Shurton Bars, where the muddy Parret makes its way into the sea. At this point the channel is so broad that the Welsh mountains can scarcely be distinguished. The shore is flat and black and oozy, flecked over with white patches of sea-birds, but further to the east there rises a line of hills, very wild and rugged, rising in places into steep precipices. These cliffs run out into the sea, and numerous little harbours and bays are formed in their broken surface, which are dry half the day, but can float a good-sized boat at half-tide. The road wound over these bleak and rocky hills, which are sparsely inhabited by a wild race of fishermen, or shepherds, who came to their cabin doors on hearing the clatter of my horse's hoofs, and shot some rough West-country jest at me as I passed. As the night drew in the country became bleaker and more deserted. An <b>occasional</b> <b>light</b> twinkling in the distance from some lonely hillside cottage was the only sign of the presence of man. The rough track still skirted the sea, and high as it was, the spray from the breakers drifted across it. The salt prinkled on my lips, and the air was filled with the hoarse roar of the surge and the thin piping of curlews, who flitted past in the darkness like white, shadowy, sad-voiced creatures from some other world. The wind blew in short, quick, angry puffs from the westward, and far out on the black waters a single glimmer of light rising and falling, tossing up, and then sinking out of sight, showed how fierce a sea had risen in the channel.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} sought to {{identify}} classes of growth trajectories of adolescent alcohol use and to examine the predictors and outcomes associated with the classes. Alcohol use was assessed from Grades 7 to 12 in a school-based sample. Latent growth mixture modeling was used, and results indicated 5 discrete longitudinal drinking patterns. The 2 most common drinking patterns included <b>occasional</b> very <b>light</b> drinking from Grades 7 to 12 and moderate escalation in both quantity and frequency of alcohol use. One group drank infrequently but at high levels throughout the study period. Another group exhibited rapid escalation in both quantity and frequency.

Emotional distress and risk taking distinguished the classes, and all classes, particularly rapid escalators, showed elevated levels of alcohol-related problems relative to <b>occasional</b> very <b>light</b> drinkers. Considerable data suggest heterogeneity in how alcohol use changes during adolescence (e. g., Stice, Myers, & Brown, 1998; Wills, McNamara, Vaccaro, & Hirky, 1996).
