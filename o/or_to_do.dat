It is usually {{one of the}} first institutions to issue bonds <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> swaps in emerging markets denominated in those markets' local currencies. The IFC's new international borrowings amounted to $8.8 billion in 2010 and $9.8 billion in 2011. The IFC Treasury actively engages in liquidity management in an effort to maximize returns and assure that funding for its investments is readily available while managing risks to the IFC.|$|E

25|$|In the Healing of the {{man with}} a {{withered}} hand miracle, the Synoptics state that Jesus entered a synagogue on Sabbath, and found {{a man with a}} withered hand there, whom Jesus healed, having first challenged the people present to decide what was lawful for Sabbath—to do good <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> evil, to save life or to kill. The Gospel of Mark adds that this angered the Pharisees so much that they started to contemplate killing Jesus.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, In Flames became {{tired of}} using session musicians to record an album <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> live shows, so the trio asked Björn Gelotte {{to join the}} band as the {{full-time}} drummer, and 6 months later asked Anders Fridén to join the band as the full-time vocalist. That same year, the new line up recorded the band's second studio album, The Jester Race (Released in 1996). This album was recorded once again in Studio Fredman, but unlike previous albums, it was co-produced by the studio's owner, Fredrik Nordström. Gelotte also provided some lead and acoustic guitars for the album. Afterwards, In Flames toured with Samael, Grip Inc., and Kreator.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} many {{operating}} systems that were significant in their day but are no longer so, such as AmigaOS; OS/2 from IBM and Microsoft; classic Mac OS, the non-Unix precursor to Apple's macOS; BeOS; XTS-300; RISC OS; MorphOS; Haiku; BareMetal and FreeMint. Some are still used in niche markets {{and continue to be}} developed as minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist applications. OpenVMS, formerly from DEC, is still under active development by Hewlett-Packard. Yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively in academia, for operating systems education <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> research on operating system concepts. A typical example of a system that fulfills both roles is MINIX, while for example Singularity is used purely for research.|$|E
25|$|Until 1834, the Bank of England {{observed}} about 33 saints' {{days and}} religious festivals as holidays, {{but in that}} year this was reduced to four: 1 May (May Day), 1 November (All Saints' Day), Good Friday and Christmas Day. In 1871, the first legislation relating to bank holidays was passed when Liberal politician and banker Sir John Lubbock introduced the Bank Holidays Act 1871, which specified the days in the table below. Under the Act, no person was compelled to make any payment <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> any act upon a bank holiday which {{he would not be}} compelled to do or make on Christmas Day or Good Friday, and the making of a payment or the doing of an act on the following day was equivalent to doing it on the holiday. People were so grateful that some called the first Bank Holidays St Lubbock's Days for a while. Scotland was treated separately because of its separate traditions: for example, New Year is a more important holiday there.|$|E
