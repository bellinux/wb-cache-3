2500|$|In the {{earliest}} Buddhist texts, the nikāyas and āgamas, the Buddha is not depicted as possessing omniscience (sabbaññu) {{nor is he}} depicted as being an eternal transcendent (lokottara) being. According to Bhikkhu Analayo, ideas of the Buddha's omniscience (along with an increasing tendency to deify him and his biography) are found only later, in the Mahayana sutras and later Pali commentaries or texts such as the Mahāvastu.

2500|$|All {{students}} and faculty, regardless of religion, {{are required to}} agree to adhere to an honor code. Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found {{as far back as}} the days of the Brigham Young Academy and educator Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the [...] "Domestic Organization", which was a group <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the school's moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Honor Code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. Ernest L. Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards (at the time, Wilkinson, as president of BYU, and the director of what was then the Unified Church School System, had some authority over all of the church's schools). This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs and alcohol in addition to academic honesty. A signed commitment to live the Honor Code is part of the application process for all LDS-affiliated schools, and must be adhered to by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In rare cases, {{students and}} faculty can be expelled from the school for excessive misbehavior. In addition to the general Honor Code common at all LDS schools, the BYU–Idaho Honor Code prohibits bib overalls, baseball caps (worn inside classrooms), shorts or capri pants, flip-flops (sandals), and also any worn, faded, or patched clothing on campus.|$|E

The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners.

In the same room as the teacher, there was a [...] "confederate" [...] that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, [...] "I advise you to continue with this experiment" [...] or [...] "I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks" [...] and the one that caught most teachers was [...] "You must continue with the shocks." [...] Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.|$|E
