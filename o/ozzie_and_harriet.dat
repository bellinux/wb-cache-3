5|$|The divorce {{meant that}} Skelton {{had lost his}} married man's deferment; he was once again {{classified}} as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the army in early 1944; both MGM and his radio sponsor tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail. His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, {{the day before he}} was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to Special Services at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented itself for the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet.</b>|$|E
25|$|The show also {{featured}} {{many of the}} nation's most familiar radio stars, {{some of whom were}} beginning to shine on the medium the show was intended to help hold at bay: Gertrude Berg (The Goldbergs), Milton Berle, Bob Cummings, Joan Davis, Ed Gardner (Archie from Duffy's Tavern), Phil Harris, Garry Moore, Jan Murray, <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> Nelson (The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet),</b> Phil Silvers, Danny Thomas, Paul Winchell and more.|$|E

25|$|Leave It to Beaver faced stiff {{competition}} in its time slots. During its {{next to last}} season, for example, the show ran against The Defenders, a program examining highly charged courtroom cases about abortion and the death penalty.

25|$|At {{the same}} time he made {{attempts}} to help grow ABC, Goldenson had been trying since mid-1953 to provide content for the network by contacting his old acquaintances in Hollywood, with whom he had worked when UPT was a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. ABC's merger with UPT {{led to the creation of}} relationships with Hollywood's film production studios, breaking a quarantine that had existed at that time between film and television, the latter of which had previously been more connected to radio. ABC's flagship productions at the time were The Lone Ranger, based on the radio program of the same title, and The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet,</b> the latter of which (at 14 seasons, running from 1952 to 1966) held the record for the longest-running prime time comedy in U.S. television history, until it was surpassed by The Simpsons in 2003.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to other popular comedies {{of the era}} (such as Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, and The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet),</b> which depicted their characters in comfortable, middle class suburban environments, the set design for The Honeymooners reflected the blue collar existence of its characters. The Kramdens lived in a small, painfully sparsely furnished two-room apartment (the main set) in a tenement building at least four stories high (the Kramdens were {{on the third floor}} and the Nortons' were one floor above them), badly aired and with insufficient lighting. They used the single main room as the kitchen, dining and living room. It consisted of a functional table and chairs, a plain chest of drawers, a curtainless window with a view of a fire escape, a noisy sink, and an outdated icebox. The Kramdens' bedroom never was seen, although in the episode about Ed Norton's sleepwalking the Nortons' bedroom is. One of the few other sitcoms about a blue collar family was The Life of Riley, whose first season (1949–50) had featured Jackie Gleason in the lead role, although veteran movie actor William Bendix, who had originated the role of Chester A. Riley on the radio show, thereafter took over the role on television.|$|E
500|$|Now {{living in}} Los Angeles, Cher's mother began acting {{while working as}} a waitress. She changed her name to Georgia Holt and played minor roles in films and on {{television}}. Holt also secured acting parts for her daughters as extras on television shows like The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet.</b> Her mother's relationship with Southall ended when Cher was nine years old, but she considers him her father and remembers him as a [...] "good-natured man who turned belligerent when he drank too much". Holt remarried and divorced several more times, and she moved her family around the country (including New York, Texas, and California). They often had little money, and Cher recounted having had to use rubber bands to hold her shoes together. At one point, her mother left Cher at an orphanage for several weeks. Although they met every day, both found the experience traumatic.|$|E
500|$|On February 9, 1997, The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones {{with the}} episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] as the longest-running prime-time {{animated}} {{series in the}} United States. In 2004, The Simpsons replaced The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> (1952 to 1966) as the longest-running sitcom (animated or live action) in the United States. In 2009, The Simpsons surpassed The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriets record of 435 episodes and is now recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's longest running sitcom (in terms of episode count). In October 2004, Scooby-Doo briefly overtook The Simpsons as the American animated show with {{the highest number of}} episodes. However, network executives in April 2005 again cancelled Scooby-Doo, which finished with 371 episodes, and The Simpsons reclaimed the title with 378 episodes {{at the end of their}} seventeenth season. In May 2007, The Simpsons reached their 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth season. While The Simpsons has the record for the number of episodes by an American animated show, other animated series have surpassed The Simpsons. For example, the Japanese anime series Sazae-san has over 7,000 episodes to its credit.|$|E

5000|$|After college, Harmon {{considered}} {{pursuing a}} career in advertising or law. [...] Harmon started his career in business as a merchandising director, but soon decided to switch to acting. He {{spent much of his}} career portraying law enforcement and medical personnel. One of his first national TV appearances (other than as an athlete) was in a commercial for Kellogg's Product 19 cereal with his father, Tom Harmon, its longstanding TV spokesman. Thanks to his sister, Kristen's in-laws, <b>Ozzie</b> Nelson <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> Nelson, he landed his first job as an actor in an episode of Ozzie's Girls. This was followed by guest roles in episodes of Adam-12, Police Woman, and Emergency! in mid-1975. He also performed in [...] "905-Wild", a backdoor pilot episode for a series about two L.A. County Animal Control Officers which did not sell. Producer/creator Jack Webb, who was the packager of both series, later cast Harmon in Sam, a short-lived 1978 series about an LAPD officer and his K-9 partner. Before this, Harmon received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance as Robert Dunlap in the TV movie Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years. In 1978, he appeared in three episodes of the mini-series, Centennial, as Captain John MacIntosh, an honorable Union cavalry officer.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Lorrie was the girlfriend of {{television}} star and teen idol Ricky Nelson, {{on both the}} Nelson family's top-rated show The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> & <b>Harriet</b> <b>and</b> in private life. She made her debut on January 22, 1958 in an episode entitled [...] "The Picture in Rick's Notebook" [...] in which she played the dual role of twin sisters (one being David Nelson's girlfriend and the other Ricky's potential paramour). In this first episode, Nelson and Lorrie duetted on [...] "Just Because" [...] which {{had been one of}} the Collins Kids' signature songs (Lorrie played her own guitar and covered the name [...] "Collins" [...] on the neck with her left hand).

2500|$|Early {{national}} attention to trick-or-treating {{was given in}} October 1947 issues of the children's magazines Jack and Jill and Children's Activities, and by Halloween episodes of the network radio programs The Baby Snooks Show in 1946 and The Jack Benny Show and The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> in 1948. Trick-or-treating was depicted in the Peanuts comic strip in 1951. [...] The custom had become firmly established in popular culture by 1952, when Walt Disney portrayed it in the cartoon Trick or Treat, and <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> were besieged by trick-or-treaters on an episode of their television show. In 1953 UNICEF first conducted a national campaign for children {{to raise funds for}} the charity while trick-or-treating.|$|E

The station also airs some Christian-oriented children's programming as well as a few programs (such as Praise the Lord) sourced from the Trinity Broadcasting Network—which does not have a full-time affiliate nor an owned-and-operated station in the Greenville/Spartanburg/Asheville market. Like many religious independents of its format, WGGS does not carry secular programming on Sundays, opting to air bible instruction programs, church services and televangelist programs.|$|R

2500|$|On January 12, 1966, ABC {{replaced}} The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> with Batman, {{an action}} series {{based on the}} DC Comics series starring Adam West that was known for its kitschy style. In 1967, WLS radio CEO Ralph Beaudin was appointed {{as the president of}} ABC Radio.

2500|$|In 1955, many {{television}} shows (including The Jackie Gleason Show) were performed live and recorded using kinescope technology, though sitcoms already largely were recorded done on film, e.g., The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet,</b> My Little Margie, and I Married Joan. I Love Lucy, which was recorded directly onto 35mm film, had influenced television production companies to produce directly on film. For The Honeymooners, Gleason utilized the Electronicam TV-film system, developed by DuMont {{in the early}} 1950s, which allowed for a live performance to be directly captured on film. As {{a result of the}} superior picture and sound quality afforded by the system called Electronicam, episodes of The Honeymooners were much more suitable for rebroadcast than were most other [...] "live" [...] shows of the era.|$|E
2500|$|After Billingsley {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Universal Studios in 1957, she made her mark on TV as everyday mother June Cleaver on Leave It to Beaver, alongside other 1950s family sitcoms such as Father Knows Best, The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet,</b> Make Room For Daddy, and The Donna Reed Show. It debuted on CBS in 1957, to mediocre ratings. The show was picked up by ABC the following year and became a hit, airing for the next five seasons. The show was broadcast in over 100 countries.

While later seasons {{would focus on}} Homer, Bart was the lead {{character}} {{in most of the}} first three seasons. In 1990, Bart quickly {{became one of the most}} popular characters on television in what was termed [...] "Bartmania". On February 9, 1997, The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones with the episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] as the longest-running prime-time animated series in the United States.

Hallmarks of the show include the opening sequence; its theme song, composed by Danny Elfman in 1989; Treehouse of Horror episodes, which have themselves inspired an offshoot of merchandise; its use of cultural references; sight gags; and the use of catchphrases, such as Homer's annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!".|$|E
2500|$|In {{its early}} days, Rutgers athletes were known informally as [...] "The Scarlet" [...] in {{reference}} to the school color, or as [...] "Queensmen" [...] {{in reference to}} the institution's first name, Queen's College. In 1925, the mascot was changed to Chanticleer, a fighting rooster from the medieval fable Reynard the Fox (Le Roman de Renart) which was used by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales. At the time, the student humour magazine at Rutgers was called Chanticleer, and one of its early arts editors, Ozzie Nelson (later of The Adventures of <b>Ozzie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> fame) was quarterback of the Rutgers team from 1924 to 1926. The Chanticleer mascot was unveiled at a football game against Lafayette College, in which Lafayette was also introducing a new mascot, a leopard. However, the choice of Chanticleer as a mascot was often the subject of ridicule because of its association with [...] "being chicken." [...] In 1955, the mascot was changed to the Scarlet Knight after a campus-wide election, beating out other contenders such as [...] "Queensmen", the [...] "Scarlet", the [...] "Red Lions", the [...] "Redmen" [...] and the [...] "Flying Dutchmen." [...] Earlier proposed nicknames included [...] "Pioneers" [...] and [...] "Cannoneers". When Harvey Harman, then coach of the football team, was asked why he supported changing the Rutgers mascot, he was quoted as saying, [...] "You can call it the Chanticleer, you can call it a fighting cock, you can call it any damn thing you want, but everybody knows it's a chicken." [...] Harman later is said to have bought the first [...] "Scarlet Knight" [...] mascot costume for the 1955 season, which was to be his final season as football coach at Rutgers.|$|E

5000|$|Despite hit filmed {{programs}} such as I Love Lucy, both William Paley of CBS and David Sarnoff of NBC {{were said to be}} determined to keep most programming on their networks live. Filmed programs were said to be inferior to the spontaneous nature of live television. Thus, NBC and CBS continued to schedule many live programs, including two new 1953 fall NBC series The Dave Garroway Show and Bonino. According to Brooks and Marsh (2007), Garroway's show [...] "was faced with overwhelming competition from Mama <b>and</b> <b>Ozzie</b> & <b>Harriet,</b> which were running opposite on CBS and ABC, and it only lasted a single season". Bonino did not even last the full season. CBS had more luck with new live programs Person to Person and My Favorite Husband (which would later make the switch to film). ABC, perennially in third or fourth place among the four U.S. television networks, had been on the verge of bankruptcy, but the February 1953 merger of United Paramount Theaters with ABC had given ABC a $30 million cash infusion. ABC revamped its schedule for Fall 1953 with big-budget programs. New ABC programs included Make Room for Daddy, and an ABC version of NBC's popular Kraft Television Theatre; the strategy was designed to [...] "take on CBS and NBC with a strong schedule".|$|R
