500|$|In {{northern}} Europe, agriculture including {{animal husbandry}} went into decline when the Roman empire collapsed. Some aspects {{such as the}} herding of animals continued throughout the period. By the 11th century, the economy had recovered and the countryside was again productive. The Domesday Book recorded every parcel of land and every animal in Britain: [...] "there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover ... not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in [...] writ." [...] For example, the royal manor of Earley in Berkshire, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> villages recorded in the book, had in 1086 [...] "2 fisheries worth [...] 7s and 6d [...] and 20 acres of meadow [...] Woodland for [...] 70 pigs." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the Dutch {{surrender}} to the invading Japanese forces in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform {{and went back to}} Wurjantoro.

In October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the PETA (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve with the rank of shodancho (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese bushido, or [...] "way of the warrior", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.|$|E
