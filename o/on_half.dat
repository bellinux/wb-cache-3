5|$|On 17 October 1761, {{while holding}} {{the rank of}} major, Hamilton became major commandant (colonel) of the 113th Regiment of Foot.

5|$|Australia {{elected to}} bat first and Brown made 106, while Bradman (65) and Harvey (60) both scored half-centuries. Kent {{collapsed}} {{to the lowest}} score of the tour in the first innings, succumbing in only 23 overs. Johnston and Loxton both took 3/10, and six local batsmen made ducks. Forced to follow <b>on,</b> <b>half</b> the Kent side were out for 45 in the second innings. Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71, but the match, held in front of record crowds for the ground, ended inside two days, soon after Evans was run out. It took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets. Lindwall took 4/37 in the second innings; all his wickets were top-order batsmen.|$|E
5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh <b>on</b> <b>half</b> his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E

5|$|Rahl {{installed}} decking <b>on</b> <b>half</b> of the trestle between 1989 and 1991, {{attempting to}} open it as a bungee jumping platform. A court ruling found that such a venture violated zoning laws, and the town denied Rahl a variance. In 2009 the county seized the trestle, and it was sold to an environmental group. The trestle was closed in 2010 for repairs, {{and is expected to}} be opened as part of the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Roquebert's {{squadron}} sailed westwards towards Bourbon, initially {{planning to}} raid the eastern coast of island for food supplies, {{as his own}} were running low. Although the British garrison {{in the eastern part}} of the island was weak, the plan was thwarted by heavy surf on the landing beaches and Roquebert continued eastwards <b>on</b> <b>half</b> rations, reaching Tamatave in Madagascar on 19 May. The British garrison at Tamatave, 100 men of the 22nd Regiment of Foot, were afflicted with malaria and surrendered without contesting the town, where the French squadron gathered water and food supplies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We cannot {{perform the}} {{projective}} measurement of a momentum <b>on</b> a <b>half</b> line {{since it is}} not an observable. Nevertheless, we would like to obtain some physical information of the momentum <b>on</b> a <b>half</b> line. We define an optimality for measurement as minimizing the variance between an inferred outcome of the measured system before a measuring process and a measurement outcome of the probe system after the measuring process, restricting our attention to the covariant measurement studied by Holevo. Extending the domain of the momentum operator <b>on</b> a <b>half</b> line by introducing a two dimensional Hilbert space to be tensored, we make it self-adjoint and explicitly construct a model Hamiltonian for the measured and probe systems. By taking the partial trace over the newly introduced Hilbert space, the optimal covariant positive operator valued measure (POVM) of a momentum <b>on</b> a <b>half</b> line is reproduced.
