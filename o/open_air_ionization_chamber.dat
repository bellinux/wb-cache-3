The detector specific correction factors determined in this study may be potentially useful as a reference data set for small beam dosimetry measurements. Methods: Dose response of passive and real time detectors was investigated for small field sizes shaped with a micromultileaf collimator ranging from 0. 6 Ã— 0. 6 cm 2 to 4. 2 Ã— 4. 2 cm 2 and the measurements were extended to larger fields of up to 10 Ã— 10 cm 2. Measurements were performed at 5 cm depth, in a 6 MV photon beam. Detectors used included alanine, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), stereotactic diode, electron diode, photon diode, radiophotoluminescent dosimeters (RPLDs), radioluminescence detector based on carbon-doped aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 :C), organic plastic scintillators, diamond detectors, liquid filled ion chamber, and a range of small volume <b>air</b> filled <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> (volumes ranging from 0. 002 cm 3 to 0. 3 cm 3).

40|$|This paper uses Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{to calculate}} the Spencer-Attix water/medium stopping-power ratios (sw, med) for the dosimetry of scanned proton pencil beams. It includes proton energies from 30 to 350 MeV and typical detection materials such as <b>air</b> (<b>ionization</b> <b>chambers),</b> radiochromic film, gadolinium oxysulfide (scintillating screens), silicon and lithium fluoride. Track-ends and particles heavier than protons {{were found to have}} a negligible effect on the water/air stopping-power ratios (sw, air), whereas the mean excitation energy values were found to carry the largest source of uncertainty. The initial energy spread of the beam was found to have a minor influence on the sw, air values in depth. The water/medium stopping-power ratios as a function of depth in water were found to be quite constant for air and radiochromic film - within 2. 5 %. Also, the sw, med values were found to have no clinically relevant dependence on the radial distance - except for the case of gadolinium oxysulfide and proton radiography beams. In conclusion, the most suitable detection materials for depth-dose measurements in water were found to be air and radiochromic film active layer, although a small correction is still needed to compensate for the different sw, med values between the plateau and the Bragg peak region. Also, all the detection materials studied in this work - except for gadolinium oxysulfide - were found to be suitable for lateral dose profiles and field-specific dose distribution measurements in waterPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} detector-specific output correction factors, k fclin,fmsr Qclin,Qmsr, in 6 MV small photon beams for <b>air</b> {{and liquid}} <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers,</b> silicon diodes, and diamond detectors from two manufacturers. Methods: Field output factors, defined {{according to the}} international formalism published by Alfonso et al. [Med. Phys. 35, 5179 - 5186 (2008) ], relate the dosimetry of small photon beams to that of the machine-specific reference field; they include a correction to measured ratios of detector readings, conventionally used as output factors in broad beams. Output correction factors were calculated with the PENELOPE Monte Carlo (MC) system with a statistical uncertainty (type-A) of 0. 15 % or lower. The geometries of the detectors were coded using blueprints provided by the manufacturers, and phase-space files for field sizes between 0. 5 × 0. 5 cm 2 and 10 × 10 cm 2 from a Varian Clinac iX 6 MV linac used as sources. The output correction factors were determined scoring the absorbed dose within a detector and to a small water volume {{in the absence of the}} detector, both at a depth of 10 cm, for each small field and for the reference beam of 10 × 10 cm 2. Results: The Monte Carlo calculated output correction factors for the liquid <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> and the diamond detector were within about ± 1 % of unity even for the smallest field sizes. Corrections were found to be significant for small <b>air</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> due to their cavity dimensions, as expected. The correction factors for silicon diodes varied with the detector type (shielded or unshielded), confirming the findings by other authors; different corrections for the detectors from the two manufacturers were obtained. The differences in the calculated factors for the various detectors were analyzed thoroughly and whenever possible the results were compared to published data, often calculated for different accelerators and using the EGSnrc MC system. The differences were used to estimate a type-B uncertainty for the correction factors. Together with the type-A uncertainty from theMonte Carlo calculations, an estimation of the combined standard uncertainty was made, assigned to the mean correction factors from various estimates. Conclusions: The present work provides a consistent and specific set of data for the output correction factors of a broad set of detectors in a Varian Clinac iX 6 MV accelerator and contributes to improving the understanding of the physics of small photon beams. The correction factors cannot in general be neglected for any detector and, as expected, their magnitude increases with decreasing field size. Due to the reduced number of clinical accelerator types currently available, it is suggested that detector output correction factors be given specifically for linac models and field sizes, rather than for a beam quality specifier that necessarily varies with the accelerator type and field size due to the different electron spot dimensions and photon collimation systems used by each accelerator modelPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{publication}} was to present and evaluate the methods for reference dosimetry in the epithermal neutron beam at the neutron capture therapy facility at Studsvik.

Appropriate beam-dependant calibration factors were determined using Monte Carlo methods for the detectors {{used in the present}} publication. Using the presented methodology, the photon, neutron and total absorbed dose to PMMA was determined with an estimated uncertainty of +/- 5. 0 %, +/- 25 %, and +/- 5. 5 % (2 SD), respectively. The uncertainty of the determination of the photon absorbed dose was comparable to the case in conventional radiotherapy, while the uncertainty of the neutron absorbed dose is much higher using the present methods.

As a method, we measured output factors using several cylindrical <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> and calculated with mathematical method similar to deconvolution in which we modeled non-constant and inhomogeneous exposure function in the cavity of chamber. The parameters in exposure function and correction factors were determined by solving a system of equations we developed with measurement data and geometry of the given chamber. Correction factors (CFs) we had found {{are very similar to}} that from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. For example, CFs in this study were computed as 1. 116 for PTW 31010, and 1. 0225 for PTW 31016, while CFs from MC were reported as approximately between 1. 17 and 1. 20 for PTW 31010, and between 1. 02 and 1. 06 for PTW 31016 in of 6 MV photon beam. Furthermore, the result from the method of deconvolution combined with MC for chamber response function, also showed similar CF for PTW 30013, which was reported as 2. 29 and 1. 54 in and filed size respectively. The CFs from our method provided similarly as 2. 42 and 1. 54. In addition, we reported CFs for PTW 30013, PTW 31010, PTW 31016, IBA FC 23 -C, and IBA CC 13.
