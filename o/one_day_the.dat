5|$|England {{hosted the}} first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the {{resources}} required to organising the inaugural event. India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in <b>one</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.|$|E

30|$|The {{impact of}} wind {{velocity}} on the ion concentration, air-Earth current density, Maxwell current density and electric field varies. On group <b>one</b> <b>days,</b> <b>the</b> intermediate ions are barely negatively correlated (correlation coefficient = − 0.20) whereas the small ions show some positive correlation. The large ions {{do not show}} any meaningful correlation. On relatively colder days (group two), there is a negative correlation (correlation coefficient ~ − 0.31 to − 0.46) for all three categories of ions. The electric field, Maxwell current density and air-Earth current density decrease {{with the increase in}} wind speed, except that on group <b>one</b> <b>days</b> <b>the</b> air-Earth current density does not show any dependence.|$|R

His wife Sarbajaya (Karuna Banerjee) takes care of their children, Durga (Uma Dasgupta) and Apu (Subir Banerjee), and Harihar's elderly cousin, Indir Thakrun (Chunibala Devi). Because of their limited resources, Sarbajaya resents having to share her home with the old and {{helpless}} cripple Indir. At times, Sarbajaya's taunts become offensive, forcing Indir to take temporary refuge {{in the home of}} another relative. Durga is fond of Indir and often gives her fruit she has stolen from a wealthy neighbour's orchard. <b>One</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> neighbour's wife accuses Durga of stealing a bead necklace (which Durga denies) and blames Sarbajaya for encouraging her tendency to steal.|$|E

5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens.

5|$|The storm, {{combined}} with a high pressure system, produced a strong pressure gradient, resulting in strong rip currents {{off the coast of}} Florida. The currents prompted sirens, which are normally used for storm warnings, to be activated in Pensacola Beach. The rip currents killed 5 off the coast of Florida. Outer rain bands from the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the Florida Panhandle of over 11inches (280mm) in <b>one</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> Tallahassee Regional Airport recorded 10.13inches (257mm) in 24hours, breaking the old 24‑hour record set in 1969. Throughout the state, Allison destroyed 10homes and damaged 599, 196 severely, primarily in Leon County.
