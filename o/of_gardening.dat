5|$|Robert Stebbins {{was born}} on March 31, 1915, in Chico, California, to parents Cyril Adelbert and Louise Stebbins (née Beck). His father, born in Wisconsin of English descent, was an {{instructor}} at Chico State Normal School who had also published on birds and agriculture, stressing the importance <b>of</b> <b>gardening</b> in education. The oldest of seven children, young Robert grew up learning about local birds and exploring the wildlife of Northern California. His mother, born in Switzerland and educated at the Normal School, instilled a sense of artistry in Robert, painting pictures for Robert and his siblings in her spare time. When Stebbins was seven, {{his family moved to}} the San Francisco Bay Area, where his father worked on agricultural curriculum for children and taught at the University of California, Berkeley. Around the age of nine, his family moved to Southern California, living first in Pomona, then in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles. Stebbins spent time hiking in the nearby Santa Monica Mountains, exploring the wildlife and amassing a collection of bird and mammal specimens which he prepared and mounted himself. Stebbins attended North Hollywood High School, where his father taught hygiene and agriculture. Robert graduated in 1933. He discovered his artistic talents around sixteen years old. His early work consisted of cartoons: he drew illustrations on classmates' clothing and contributed cartoons to youth magazines, winning several awards.|$|E

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 765 on 07. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) Garden visiting {{has become a}} popular leisure pursuit in recent years. Within a tourism and recreation context, scant research exists on the subject <b>of</b> <b>gardens</b> as recreational resources {{and the manner in}} which they are presented to and consumed by the public. This thesis explores the scope and nature <b>of</b> <b>gardens</b> as tourism and recreation resources in the UK. The thesis examines the conceptual foundations <b>of</b> the <b>garden,</b> in order to establish what reasons explain predisposition towards garden visiting, and why gardens provide a desirable environment in which people want to spend leisure time. The activity <b>of</b> <b>garden</b> visiting is analysed using a two-dimensional approach, which takes into account the supply <b>of</b> <b>gardens</b> open to the public and the demand for garden visits. In this respect, the supply-side relates to the perceptions <b>of</b> <b>garden</b> owners/mangers, while the demand aspect is linked with the outlook <b>of</b> <b>garden</b> visitors. Uniting these two perspectives yields an intriguing area of research, that of the visitor experience, how that experience is perceived and managed, and which elements are crucial in its formation. Understanding the visitor experience is a critical for operators <b>of</b> <b>garden</b> attractions, in line with all attractions. This thesis presents the results of two surveys, one <b>of</b> <b>garden</b> owners/managers (n= 546) and one <b>of</b> <b>garden</b> visitors (n= 593). Data analysis provides a source of information on the range and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>gardens</b> open to the public, approaches to managing the visitor experience and issues for owners/managers in relation, to operating a garden visitor attraction as well as visitors characteristics, motivations; behaviour and perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>garden</b> experience. The data generated allows the identification of a range of themes and implications for the operators <b>of</b> <b>garden</b> attractions, in particular those issues that will influence future development...|$|R

25|$|A 2010 {{analysis}} of a local stalagmite revealed that Native Americans were burning forests to clear land as early as 100BC. Some regional late-prehistoric Eastern Woodland tribes were more involved in hunting and fishing, practicing the slash-and-burn Eastern Agricultural Complex gardening method, which used fire to clear out underbrush from certain area. Another group progressed to the more time-consuming, advanced companion crop fields method <b>of</b> <b>gardening.</b> Also continuing from ancient indigenous people of the state, they cultivated tobacco through to early historic times. It was used in numerous social and religious rituals.|$|E
25|$|A plan of George Loddiges' {{arboretum}} {{was included}} in The Encyclopaedia <b>of</b> <b>Gardening</b> 1834 edition, and the interest this aroused helped inspire Loudon to write his encyclopaedic book Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum, first published in 1838. Although this incorporated drawings from several early botanic gardens and parklands throughout the UK, it relied greatly upon, {{and would not have}} been possible without, George Loddiges' well labeled arboretum. It was on the collection maintained by this firm more than any other that J.C.Loudon relied for living material in the preparation of his great work W.J.Bean notes in Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles, today's standard reference work.|$|E
50|$|For each finite pattern, {{the set of}} {{configurations}} {{that contain}} the pattern is an open set in this topology, called a cylinder. The cylinders form {{a basis for the}} topology.As Kari observes, the collection of configurations that are not <b>Gardens</b> <b>of</b> Eden is just the image of the transition function, so by the closed map lemma for compact spaces it is a closed set. The set <b>of</b> <b>Gardens</b> <b>of</b> Eden, correspondingly, is an open set. Because it is open and the cylinders form a basis, the set <b>of</b> <b>Gardens</b> <b>of</b> Eden can be represented as a union of cylinders.Each of the cylinders in this union consists only <b>of</b> <b>Gardens</b> <b>of</b> Eden, so the pattern that determines each cylinder must be an orphan. If the set <b>of</b> <b>Gardens</b> <b>of</b> Eden is non-empty, there must be at least one cylinder in this union, so there must be at least one orphan. And any particular <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden must belong to one of these cylinders, and therefore must contain the orphan for that cylinder.|$|R

25|$|Around 1000 BCE, the {{implements}} of the Native Americans utilizing Russell Cave {{underwent a}} dramatic change. Pottery appears {{for the first}} time. Smaller weapon points indicate that the bow and arrow had replaced the atlatl. Tools fashioned from bone were more refined. Other domestic implements provide the first evidence <b>of</b> <b>gardening</b> at the site. Additionally, bone and shell appear in ornamental artifacts. Evident throughout the Woodland period {{is an increase in}} the amount of hunting {{at the expense of other}} activities. During this period, it is clear that the cave had become simply a hunting camp. In the seasons away from the cave, the natives probably joined other groups at summer villages larger than those of the Archaic period.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of medicine in medieval Europe was longstanding. A classical pagan view of medicine in which the main focus was on treating and curing disease survived as the {{practice of}} medicine evolved through the Middle Ages. People in medieval Europe had long been practicing folk medicine as evidenced by the tradition of the herb garden. The continued practice <b>of</b> <b>gardening</b> in monasteries later on and the practicality and accessibility of the works of Hildegard of Bingen and others, as mentioned previously, illustrated a longstanding precedent of medical practice. The roots of medieval medicine in the pagan and folk medicine that preceded it illustrate a development of medical practice that took place in Europe {{over a long period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{medicine}} of the Middle Ages ostensibly {{dealt with}} the use of herbal remedies for ailments. The practice of keeping physic gardens teeming with various herbs with medicinal properties was a traditional practice influenced in medieval Europe by the gardens of Roman antiquity. Many early medieval manuscripts have been noted for containing practical descriptions for the use of herbal remedies. These texts, such as the Pseudo-Apuleius, included illustrations of various plants that would have been easily identifiable and familiar to Europeans at the time. Monasteries later became centers of medical practice in the Middle Ages, and carried on the tradition of maintaining medicinal gardens. These gardens became specialized and capable of maintaining plants from Southern Hemispheres as well as maintaining plants during winter. The practice <b>of</b> <b>gardening</b> for the purpose of supplying the ingredients necessary in medieval herbal medicinals was influenced by a rural folk tradition.|$|E

25|$|Hertzog {{decided to}} retire {{as leader of}} the HNP in 1977, and gave his {{farewell}} address on 27 May of that year. He officially retired on 28 May 1977, and was followed by Jaap Marais as party leader. During his retirement, Hertzog could devote more time to his numerous business endeavors and his hobby <b>of</b> <b>gardening.</b> In a press interview in 1979 he opined as follows: “In my view our political landscape is developing {{in the direction of a}} large, new conservative party which will consist of different people who are still currently trying to tread their own path. It can be a party consisting of the Treurnicht people in the NP, the Connie Mulder people, the HNP and definitely also conservative English speakers.” This proved to be prophetic, as in 1982 a massive split occurred within the ruling National Party, and the Conservative Party came into being, with Andries Treurnicht as leader.|$|E
25|$|Environmentalism is {{prominent}} {{throughout the}} region, especially {{west of the}} Cascades. Environmentally conscious services such as recycling and public transportation are widespread, most notably in the more populous areas. A 2007 statistical analysis ranked the 50 Greenest Cities in the United States, placing Portland, Oregon first, Eugene, Oregon fifth, and Seattle, Washington eighth. The region {{as a whole is}} also known for its bicycle culture as an alternative form of transportation; Portland is considered by Forbes Traveler to be the second most bicycle-friendly city in the world. Portland is also the hub of American bicycle manufacturing; as a whole it generated over $68 million in revenue in 2007 alone. Seattle, Washington has also garnered a reputation for its contributions to public transportation with the Puget Sound Transit system, including an underground light rail system and a 38.9% worker commute rate as of 2011. Politically, the Pacific Northwest is actively involved in environmental efforts. The international organization Greenpeace was born in Vancouver in 1970 as part of a large public opposition movement in British Columbia to US nuclear weapons testing on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Liberal and Conservative Northwesterners, such as former U.S. Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) and moderate Democrats like former Speaker of the House Tom Foley (D-WA), have been prominent in the development of conservative approaches to environmental protection. Seattle in particular is also home to a large number of publications and institutions concerned with the environment and sustainability, including both Worldchanging and Grist.org, the U.S.'s two largest online green magazines. The Pacific Northwest is also noted for a large number <b>of</b> <b>gardening</b> clubs, with Victoria having an annual flower count in February.|$|E
