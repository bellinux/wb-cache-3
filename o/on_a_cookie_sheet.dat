50|$|Depending on {{the ratio}} of {{ingredients}} and mixing and cooking times, some recipes are optimized to produce a softer, chewy style cookie while others will produce a crunchy/crispy style. Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cookie is fairly consistent in all recipes: First, the sugars and fat are creamed, usually {{with a wooden spoon}} or electric mixer. Next, the eggs and vanilla extract are added followed by the flour and leavening agent. Depending on the additional flavoring, its addition to the mix will be determined by the type used: peanut butter will be added with the wet ingredients while cocoa powder would be added with the dry ingredients. The titular ingredient, chocolate chips, as well as nuts are typically mixed in {{towards the end of the}} process to minimize breakage, just before the cookies are scooped and positioned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet.</b> Most cookie dough is baked, although some eat the dough as is, or use it as an addition to vanilla ice cream to make chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.|$|E

[...] "Mrs. Jessamine Shumate... is perhaps the only local artist to use a burned cookie sheet and a blow torch to do some of her painting." [...] And another writer from Roanoke said: [...] "When it come to experimental material {{it is quite possible that}} Jessamine Shumate takes some kind of cake for painting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet.</b> For me this is actually one of the most delightful items in the show. No one would guess that her bright, “Pebbly Abstract No. 3” is the result of a near kitchen disaster. Jim Yeatts, gallery owner, tells us that the artist left the cookie tin in the oven too long one day and tried desperately to get it clean. When it didn’t begin to shine properly, she decided to paint it and frame it. “Cookie Sheet”, done in “mixed media”, is a delightful addition to the show. It may also be some sort of inspiration to other kitchen artists, who prefer paint brushes to scouring pads." [...] The art piece is an example of “Found art”, in that it is presented by the artist as a work of art, but the object was originally designed for a non-art function. Jessamine Shumate had taken something that was “found” and made it into another, more artistic, representation.|$|E

40|$|According to Clark’s (1996) {{joint action}} hypothesis, {{language}} use fundamentally involves {{the coordination of}} individual linguistic acts and broader joint actions between participants of a usage event. Although this view on language as resonating on both psychological and social processes may seem uncontroversial to usage-based models such as cognitive linguistics (CL), the social-interactional dimension of language use is traditionally relegated to the periphery in cognitive research (Kemmer & Barlow 2000 : ix; Deppermann 2002; Tummers et al. 2005). Only recently, {{a number of studies}} in cognitive-functional linguistics have started to explore the cognitive structure and interpersonal dynamics of interactional discourse in response to a growing appeal within CL to extend its scope of investigation towards authentic, multi-agent discourse (Langacker 2001; Dirven 2005; Deppermann 2007). One of the key features of multi-agent discourse that provides a valuable gateway to the cognitive-social underpinnings of joint actions is the establishment of structural mapping relations across turns in a conversational setting, as described in the model of ‘dialogic syntax’ (Du Bois 2001, 2003; Sakita 2006). Whereas traditional linear syntax describes structural relations within single sentences, dialogic syntax deals with structural similarities between immediately co-present segments in a broader conversational context. A key concept of this model is resonance, which is defined as the ‘activation of intrinsic potential affinity across instances of dialogic language use’ (Du Bois 2001 : 8). In the present paper, we zoom in on two dimensions of resonance activation that have not been fully developed in dialogic syntax: (i) the creative cognitive processes involved in establishing cross-turn mapping relations, and (ii) the interpersonal aims and effects of resonance activation in multi-agent discourse. The example in (1) illustrates the potential of resonating structure for communicative, creative and interpersonal purposes (acknowledgment, disagreement, irony, etc.) : (1) Marci: [(TSK) Don’t forget] to buy yourself <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet,</b> [...] before you go to make cookies Kevin: [And don’t forget] to take the Tupperware out of the oven, Wendy: you] [...] Kevin: before you turn it on (Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English, Pt I, Appease the Monster) (Sakita 2006 : 470) In order to systematically analyze the impact of creative and humorous resonance activation, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative corpus study, {{on the basis of the}} Corinth Corpus (Corpus Interactional Humor), a newly compiled Dutch corpus of spontaneous interactions. First, we show how the technique of lexical chaining can be used to automatically retrieve cross-turn resonance patterns in multi-agent discourse settings. Second, on the basis of the output of the corpus retrieval technique we propose a typology of creative resonance phenomena. We show how speakers opportunistically reframe linguistic input at different levels of linguistic representation, exploring the vast potential of language in its semantic and sociocommunicative function. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) risk {{assessment}} is {{hampered by the}} difficulty of determining the extent of internal exposure in the human fetus and uncertainties regarding BPA toxicokinetics (TK) in the maternal-fetal unit.

Validation of the model predictions included the assessed dose proportionality of BPA and BPAG disposition and the similarity between the simulated and measured time courses of BPA and BPAG in fetal rhesus monkeys after BPA maternal dosing. The model predicted fluctuations in fetal BPA concentrations associated with typical maternal exposure to BPA through the diet, with similar trough (0. 011 ng/L vs 0. 014 ng/L) and lower peak BPA concentrations (0. 023 ng/L vs 0. 14 ng/L) in fetal than in maternal plasma. BPAG concentrations in fetal plasma were predicted to increase over time to reach a steady value (29 ng/L) reflecting the cumulative BPA dose received by the fetus.

If they were chosen by a player, then they had to randomly choose a gun and shoot themselves. If the guest shoots itself with fake blood, he/she is eliminated from the test and the guest who made the selection gets to choose again. Last two guests had to choose between five new guns and the last person standing wins the test. Val then released a fact about every guest, and asked each player based on that fact, if the guest should be rewarded or punished. If they got more votes for a reward, then they got a slice of pizza.
