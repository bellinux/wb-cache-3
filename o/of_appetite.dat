5|$|Nirjarā is {{possible}} through tapas, austerities and penances. Tapas {{can be either}} external or internal. Six forms of external tapas are—fasting, control <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> accepting food under certain conditions, renunciation of delicious food, sitting and sleeping in lonely place and renunciation of comforts. Six forms of internal tapas are—atonement, reverence, rendering of service to worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, but it can also occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite.</b> Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children are loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, anemia, kidney failure, irritability, lethargy, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Slow development of normal childhood behaviors, such as talking and use of words, and permanent intellectual disability are both commonly seen. Although less common, {{it is possible for}} fingernails to develop leukonychia striata if exposed to abnormally high lead concentrations.|$|E

5|$|The {{early signs}} of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be {{similar to those of}} {{influenza}} or other common illnesses. Some generalized symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss or loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> shortness of breath, anemia, easy bruising or bleeding, petechiae (flat, pin-head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding), bone and joint pain, and persistent or frequent infections.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of neuroblastoma are often vague making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> fever, and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present: Germline mutations in the PHOX2A or KIF1B gene have {{been implicated in}} familial neuroblastoma as well. Neuroblastoma is also a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite.</b> There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, {{and symptoms}} that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite.</b> A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E

5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite.</b> The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{understand}} the concept <b>of</b> risk <b>appetite</b> in terms <b>of</b> what it is, what institutional pressures influence it, {{and how it is}} institutionalized in an organization. We try to understand what risk appetite is by examining the most influential enterprise risk management frameworks, reports from practitioners, and scholarly research on the topic. Through a case study of a large and complex Norwegian organization, we seek to explain what influences and institutionalizes risk appetite. First, we find that there is a consensus in the literature that risk appetite is a top-down element of enterprise risk management, but that there is disagreement as to how quantitatively it is understood and practiced. Second, we find that one cannot decouple risk appetite from its organizational context, as both external and internal institutional pressures influence risk appetite in the organization. Third, we find that risk appetite is not a singular concept in the organization. Risk appetites varies across risk categories, and the institutionalization <b>of</b> risk <b>appetite</b> relies on cultural elements in the organization. Our thesis adds to the understanding <b>of</b> the risk <b>appetite</b> concept, and adds to the scholarly argument that the evolution <b>of</b> risk <b>appetite</b> should go in the direction of addressing human and social behavior. Further, we contribute with a model to analyze institutionalization <b>of</b> risk <b>appetite</b> in organizations...|$|R

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} of mild reductions in growth rate with prolonged stimulant treatment in children, but no causal relationship has been established and reductions {{do not appear to}} persist long-term. Weight loss almost always corresponds with loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> which may result from the medication. Severe weight loss is very uncommon though. Loss <b>of</b> <b>appetite</b> is very temporary and typically comes back as daily effects of stimulates wear off. Nausea, dizziness, and headaches, other side effect, can also indirectly affect appetite and result in weight loss.|$|E
