500|$|The game's {{reception}} from critics {{was extremely}} negative. David Leonard of PopMatters described the game's graphics and [...] "playability". While not approving of the game's message, {{he argued that}} it was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> {{in a long line of}} racist video games that included the likes of Grand Theft Auto III, NFL Street, and Freedom Fighters. In January 2003, Stuff named Ethnic Cleansing the 40th most controversial video game of all time. The staff opined that only [...] "very stupid children" [...] would be susceptible to its message and that it would make players feel like [...] "small-minded assholes". Complex and UGO ranked it as the single most racist video game in history. UGO staff writer K. Thor Jensen called it [...] "profoundly stupid".|$|E
500|$|Still, by {{that time}} the Batavians had already had a bad press in Dutch history writing. This may be {{explained}} by the fact that the ages-old ideological struggle between the monarchically oriented Orangist party and its successive opponents of a more [...] "republican" [...] bent (going back to at least the conflict between Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Prince Maurice), of which the Patriots were <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> incarnation, was being refought in the standard works of 19th-century Dutch historians like Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, who saw plenty to despise in the [...] "popular-sovereignty" [...] philosophy of the Patriot radicals. In his turn Groen was very influential on the way John Lothrop Motley depicted the old Dutch Republic for an American audience. Motley did not get to deal explicitly with the Batavian Republic, but the way his collaborator William Elliot Griffis dismissed the Patriots speaks for itself: [...] "...whether under the name of the 'Batavian Republic', the Kingdom of Holland, or the provinces of the French empire, the French occupation was virtually a French conquest that had little permanent influence on Dutch history or character." ...|$|E

500|$|Mauna Loa is {{a typical}} shield volcano in form, taking {{the shape of a}} long, broad dome {{extending}} down to the ocean floor whose slopes are about 12° at their steepest, a consequence of its extremely fluid lava. The shield-stage lavas that built the enormous main mass of the mountain are tholeiitic basalts, like those of Mauna Kea, created through the mixing of primary magma and subducted oceanic crust. Mauna Loa's summit hosts three overlapping pit craters arranged northeast-southwest, the first and last roughly [...] in diameter and the second an oblong [...] feature; together these three craters make up the [...] summit caldera Mokuʻāweoweo, so named for the Hawaiian ʻāweoweo fish (Priacanthus meeki), purportedly due to the resemblance of its eruptive fires to the coloration of the fish. Mokuʻāweoweo's caldera floor lies between [...] beneath its rim and it is <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> of several calderas that have formed and reformed over the volcano's life. It was created between 1,000 and 1,500 years ago by a large eruption from Mauna Loa's northeast rift zone, which emptied out a shallow magma chamber beneath the summit and collapsed it into its present form. Additionally, two smaller pit craters lie southwest of the caldera, named Lua Hou (New Pit) and Lua Hohonu (Deep Pit).|$|E
500|$|Gellibrand then {{ordered the}} 48th Battalion, and the 47th Battalion on its right, to {{immediately}} take up {{positions on the}} forward slope of the high ground and push posts forward to the railway embankment below. The forward slope was {{in full view of}} the approaching Germans. The 47th moved forward immediately, came under heavy German shelling, and suffered casualties in moving as far as an old half-completed trench some [...] short of the railway line by 17:00. Leane took the view that Gellibrand did not know the full situation on the ground, and that he had the discretion to follow a course of action that would achieve the objective without unnecessary casualties. He decided not to move his troops forward until dark. Bean remarks on Leane again disobeying orders, but notes that the dangers of such action are mitigated when such subordinates, like Leane, have [...] "outstanding qualities of courage and judgement". He concludes, [...] "ut Leane was Leane, and Gellibrand had the sense to know it". Deayton criticises Leane's decision, describing his failure to advise the 47th Battalion of his intentions as [...] "inexcusable", and stating that the serious risk created by Leane's decision could have resulted in a disaster had there been a German attack that afternoon. Deayton also reflects that this was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> in a series of clashes between Leane and Gellibrand since the latter had taken over the brigade in November of the previous year.|$|E

2500|$|Greek {{organizations}} both {{nationally and}} locally sponsor many risk avoidance {{programs for the}} real benefits of student safety and well-being, {{as well as to}} avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban [...] "pledging" [...] nationwide is <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities. While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples. [...] In this area too, active and alumni Greek leaders have responded to such negative publicity and the resulting criticism with programs that seek to reduce alcohol abuse and eliminate underage or binge drinking, with risk management training, by self-policing their own chapters, and with more stringent procedures to discipline offenders. All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the NIC and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors. Hence, individual chapters are not alone in addressing these problems. Inter-chapter governing boards at Minnesota (listed below by chapter groupings) provide event monitoring services and local risk management training, culminating in the introduction in 2012 of Arkeo, which serves as an inter-Greek cooperative monitoring program to help chapters avoid risk.|$|E
2500|$|Growing up in Barbados, she wasn't {{exposed to}} a lot of music, mainly reggae, hip-hop, and soca music. When she moved to the United States, she became {{exposed to a}} lot of American music [...] "rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [...] I love rock music." [...] At the time of her debut, she {{recorded}} songs that were inspired by her Caribbean roots and described her early sound as [...] "a fusion of reggae, hip-hop and R, with a little something different thrown in". Her early dancehall roots can be found on her debut album, Music of the Sun (2005), and its follow-up, A Girl like Me (2006). Music of the Sun demonstrates the influence of Rihanna’s musical heritage of the Caribbean. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times complimented its combination of dancehall and reggae, who said, [...] "Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be". Her debut single, [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while [...] "If It's Lovin' that You Want" [...] talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend. Aiming for artistic growth, A Girl like Me expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature. After her sophomore album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots.|$|E

60|$|Central in the chiefest square, and yet {{preserving}} its old lordly {{isolation in}} a wooded garden, the homestead of Enoch Lane stood {{with all its}} modern additions and improvements. Already these included not <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> phases of decoration, but various treasures brought by the second generation from Europe, which they were wont to visit, but from which they always contentedly returned to their little provincial town. Whether there was some instinctive yearning, like the stirred sap of great forests, in their wholesome pioneer blood, or whether there was some occult fascination in the pretty town-crested hill itself, it was still certain that the richest inhabitants always preferred to live in Lakeville. Even the young, who left it to seek their fortune elsewhere, came back to enjoy their success under the sylvan vaults of this vast ancestral roof. And that was why, this 22d of December, 1870, the whole household of Gabriel Lane was awaiting the arrival from California of his brother, Sylvester Lane, at the old homestead which he had left twenty years ago.|$|E

6000|$|The strike made a {{good deal}} of talk in it he office of 'Every Other Week' that is, it made Fulkerson talk a good deal. He congratulated himself that he was not {{personally}} incommoded by it, like some of the fellows who lived uptown, and had not everything under one roof, as it were. He enjoyed the excitement of it, and he kept the office boy running out to buy the extras which the newsmen came crying through the street almost every hour with a lamentable, unintelligible noise. He read not <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> intelligence of the strike, but the editorial comments on it, which praised the firm attitude of both parties, and the admirable measures taken by the police to preserve order. Fulkerson enjoyed the interviews with the police captains and the leaders of the strike; he equally enjoyed the attempts of the reporters to interview the road managers, which were so graphically detailed, and with such a fine feeling for the right use of scare-heads as to have almost the value of direct expression from them, though it seemed that they had resolutely refused to speak. He said, at second-hand from the papers, that if the men behaved themselves and respected the rights of property, they would have public sympathy with them every time; but just as soon as they began to interfere with the roads' right to manage their own affairs in their own way, they must be put down with an iron hand; the phrase [...] "iron hand" [...] did Fulkerson almost as much good as if it had never been used before. News began to come of fighting between the police and the strikers when the roads tried to move their cars with men imported from Philadelphia, and then Fulkerson rejoiced at the splendid courage of the police. At the same time, he believed what the strikers said, and that the trouble was not made by them, but by gangs of roughs acting without their approval. In this juncture he was relieved by the arrival of the State Board of Arbitration, which took up its quarters, with a great many scare-heads, at one of the principal hotels, and invited the roads and the strikers to lay the matter in dispute before them; he said that now we should see the working of the greatest piece of social machinery in modern times. But it appeared to work only in the alacrity of the strikers to submit their grievance. The road; were as one road in declaring that there was nothing to arbitrate, and that they were merely asserting their right to manage their own affairs in their own way. One of the presidents was reported to have told a member of the Board, who personally summoned him, to get out and to go about his business. Then, to Fulkerson's extreme disappointment, the august tribunal, acting on behalf of the sovereign people in the interest of peace, declared itself powerless, and got out, and would, no doubt, have gone about its business if it had had any. Fulkerson {{did not know what to}} say, perhaps because the extras did not; but March laughed at this result.|$|E
