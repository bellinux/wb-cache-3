5|$|After 9 days, {{approximately}} 3,000 buildings (out of a {{total of}} 127,947 initially damaged) were still waiting for assistance and temporary fixes to shattered roofs and windows, while a similar number still required assistance a further week later (as a number of tarpaulins became detached or otherwise ineffective). One month after the disaster, the main priority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> services was ensuring that temporary fixes remained in place, as Sydney suffered further adverse weather in the period immediately following the storm.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, {{the main}} and {{emergency}} spillways failed, leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people living near the dam.

5|$|The {{formation}} of the Rüstungsstab allowed Speer, for the first time, to consolidate key arms manufacturing projects for the three branches of the Wehrmacht {{under the authority of}} his ministry, further marginalising the Reich Ministry of Aviation. Several departments, including the once powerful Technical Office, were disbanded or transferred to the new task force.

5|$|A second Legislative Council {{election}} {{was held in}} 1951 {{with the number of}} elected seats increased to nine. This {{election was}} again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. While this contributed to the formation of a distinct local government of Singapore, the colonial administration was still dominant. In 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emergency</b> over, a British Commission, headed by Sir George Rendel, proposed a limited form of self-government for Singapore. A new Legislative Assembly with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a Chief Minister as head of government and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a parliamentary system. The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.|$|E
5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D.

Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency.</b> It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E

5|$|Formed as {{a fighter}} wing in November 1943, No.78 Wing {{comprised}} three flying units, Nos.75, 78 and 80 Squadrons, operating P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre of World WarII. After the war, it re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs at Williamtown. During the early 1950s, the wing was based at Malta on garrison duties with the Royal Air Force, operating two squadrons of DeHavilland Vampire jet fighters. Re-equipped with CAC Sabres, it deployed with Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons to Malaya in 1958–59, flying sorties against communist insurgents in the final years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emergency.</b> In the 1960s, it was tasked with providing regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia, and supplied the equipment and personnel for the RAAF contingent operating from Ubon Air Base in Thailand. No.78 Wing was disbanded in November 1967, and re-formed for its present role as an operational training wing in February 2000.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{widespread}} damage, 1,000personnel from the Canadian military were brought in for recovery efforts. The military operation, known as Operation Lama, was to last for the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> phase in the immediate aftermath. An initial deployment of 120soldiers and 40vehicles arrived on September25 from the Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in Oromocto, New Brunswick arrived in Newfoundland. Three ships and a fleet of helicopters were called in for the distribution of emergency aid and the military set up temporary bridges while long-term plans for reconstruction were made. Operation Lama also enabled partial repairs of several buildings, and simultaneously, emergency personnel surveyed roughly 500mi (900km) of roads in Newfoundland. On September27, government officials stated {{that it would take}} months for cleanup efforts to finish. Ten days after the storm, six towns were still isolated as progress on temporary road reconstruction was being made only slowly. Allocation of military aid continued through October6, though the number of on-scene personnel began to decrease two days earlier.|$|E

In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.|$|E

5|$|On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf Air Force Base crashed, {{killing the}} pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were {{restricted}} to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation. The crash {{was attributed to}} a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly and did not engage the emergency oxygen system. Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects. She later reached a settlement. After the ruling, the engagement handle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> oxygen system was redesigned; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure. On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.|$|E

5|$|Power outages {{began in}} some neighborhoods at 6:30p.m. AST (2230 UTC) August 16, over 12hours {{before the storm}} arrived, and quickly spread over the entire island.

The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the corrugated metal roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was also damaged when part of the roof blew off its medical ward and fell through the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> room.

5|$|The Depression {{began in}} the United States in October 1929 and grew {{steadily}} worse to its nadir in early 1933. President Herbert Hoover feared that too much intervention or coercion by the government would destroy individuality and self-reliance, which he considered to be important American values. His laissez-faire views appeared to be shared by the Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon. To combat with the growing economic decline, Hoover organized a number of voluntary measures with businesses, encouraged {{state and local government}} responses, and accelerated federal building projects. However his policies had little or no effect on economic recovery. Toward the end of his term, however, Hoover supported several legislative solutions which he felt might lift the country out of the depression. The final attempt of the Hoover administration to rescue the economy was the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emergency</b> Relief and Construction Act (which provided funds for public works programs) and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) (which provided low-interest loans to businesses).|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} re-equipped with CAC Sabres at Williamtown in November 1956. Two {{years later}} it transferred to RAAF Butterworth in Malaya {{to join the}} air campaign against communist guerrillas in the last stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emergency.</b> The squadron remained at Butterworth during the 1960s, providing regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia. It returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageIII supersonic jet fighters. No.77 Squadron began converting to Hornets in June 1987. It supplied a detachment of four aircraft to the American base on Diego Garcia in 2001–02, supporting the war in Afghanistan, and deployed to the Middle East {{as part of the}} military intervention against ISIL in 2015–16. Along with its Hornets, the squadron briefly operated Pilatus PC-9s in the forward air control role in the early 2000s. The RAAF plans to replace its Hornets with Lockheed Martin F-35 LightningII fighters commencing in 2018, and No.77 Squadron is scheduled to convert to the new type in 2021.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, it was nature, not {{political}} maneuvering, {{that led to}} the filling of New Melones Lake. The winter and spring rainy season of 1982 was one of the wettest recorded in the 20th century. The Stanislaus River swelled to such high levels that it exceeded what could be safely released through the dam's outlets, and the reservoir rapidly surpassed the temporary limit. The winter of 1983 was even wetter and pushed water so high that it reached the lip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> spillway (but did not flow over it), a level that has not been surpassed since. With the lake full, the state of California lifted the temporary limit in March, 1983. A deciding factor in the rescinding of the water-level limit was the prevention of $50 million in damages by New Melones Dam in 1982 and 1983, which demonstrated the dam's value for flood control.|$|E
