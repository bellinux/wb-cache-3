The data werethree television advertisements from A Mild Go Ahead entitled “Satu Aksi = Segalanya, We Are One and Free, and Orang Pemimpi. The researchwas conducted by using descriptive qualitative research. The findings show that there were three elements of semiotic used, such as representamen (qualisign, sinsign, legisign), <b>object</b> (<b>icon,</b> index, symbol), and interpretant (rheme, decisign, argument),which then devided into 9 types of semiotic;Qualisign (0),Legisign (9), Sinsign (34), Icon (12), Index (27), Symbol (4), Rheme (9), Decisign (19) and Argument (16). The most dominant type of semiotic in the advertisements is sinsign, and it means that A Mild Go Aheadpersuade their audiences by showing the real example of their products...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the Provis ("Programming visually") tool for object-oriented visual programming {{and some of}} the ideas behind it.

The tool generates [...] - and eventually will also parse [...] - C++ source code, and it has been designed to provide some degree of freedom with respect to sourcecode language. Work on Provis has been motivated by several concurring trends in the software engineering field, including the need to eliminate phase gaps in software development work, the availability of powerful, high-level target platform software, the gradual merging of design and implementation tasks, as well as the increasing interest for object-oriented programming (OOP) a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to investigate the effects of a computer screen interface design and its related geometrical characteristics of 36 graphical objects on a user's task efficiency. A total of 490 subjects took part in laboratory experiments that focused on the direct manipulation of a visual dialogue between a user and a computer. The subjects were asked to select an object from among a group of items randomly placed on the computer screen that were visible exclusively during the visual search process. A model expressing the mean object acquisition time as a function of graphical object size and the configuration was developed and statistically validated. The model showed an influence of geometrical design characteristics of the graphical <b>objects</b> (<b>icons)</b> and their groupings (icon structures) on the observed task efficiency. The reported results can be used at those stages of a software lifecycle that concentrate on prototyping, designing, and implementing graphical solutions for the efficient graphical user-computer interface...|$|R

It {{was so successful}} that {{it was followed by}} a limited edition of hand-painted items. She also produced a few unique ones enhanced with some gold for an exhibition in Dubai at Dubai Mall : « Dream <b>Objects,</b> <b>Icons</b> of French Style » in 2010. A new collection was born in 2014, « Horses of the Sun », dedicated to Portuguese horses. A limited edition of hand-painted items is under way. Marine Oussedik, who confesses that she has remained a child at heart, makes toys too. She has signed the « Horse » figurines of the French brand Papo and has designed original items like games of « petits chevaux », a French alternative of Parcheesi and Ludo, with terracotta figurines, and an Arabian horse on wheels. Original items were on display during the « Variations Équines » exhibition in 2012 centered on « Le cheval amusant » (fun with horses) at the museum-castle in Nogent-le-Rotrou.|$|R

40|$|Human {{evolution}} unfolded {{through a}} rather distinctive, dynamically constructed ecological niche. The human niche {{is not only}} generally terrestrial in habitat, while being flexibly and extensively heterotrophic in food-web connections. It is also defined by semiotically structured and structuring embodied cognitive interfaces, connecting the individual organism with the wider environment. The embodied dimensions of niche-population co-evolution have long involved semiotic system construction, which I hypothesize to be an evolutionarily primitive aspect of learning and higher-level cognitive integration and attention in the great apes and humans alike. A clearly pre-linguistic form of semiotic cognitive structuration is suggested to involve recursively learned and constructed <b>object</b> <b>icons.</b> Higher-level cognitive iconic representation of visually, auditorily, or haptically perceived extrasomatic objects would be learned and evoked through indexical connections to proprioceptive and affective somatic states. Thus, private cognitive signs would be defined, not only by their learned and perceived extrasomatic referents, but also by their associations to iconically represented somatic states. This evolutionary modification of animal associative learning is suggested to be adaptive in ecological niches occupied by long-lived, large-bodied ape species, facilitating memory construction and recall in highly varied foraging and social contexts, while sustaining selective attention during goal-directed behavioral sequences. The embodied niche construction (ENC) hypothesis of human evolution posits {{that in the early}} hominin lineage, natural selection further modified the ancestral ape semiotic adaptations, favoring the recursive structuration of concise iconic narratives of embodied interaction with the environment...|$|R
5000|$|An icon (also called {{likeness}} and semblance) is a {{sign that}} denotes its object by virtue of a quality which is shared by them but which the icon has irrespectively of the <b>object.</b> The <b>icon</b> (for instance, a portrait or a diagram) resembles or imitates its <b>object.</b> The <b>icon</b> has, of itself, a certain character or aspect, one which the object also has (or is supposed to have) and which lets the icon be interpreted as a sign even if the object does not exist. The icon signifies essentially {{on the basis of its}} [...] "ground." [...] (Peirce defined the ground as the pure abstraction of a quality, and the sign's ground as the pure abstraction of the quality in respect of which the sign refers to its object, whether by resemblance or, as a symbol, by imputing the quality to the object.). Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a [...] "hypoicon", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the image, which depends on a simple quality; (b) the diagram, whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the metaphor, which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else. A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form [...] "All __ is ___" [...] which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations. Peirce held that mathematics is done by diagrammatic thinking — observation of, and experimentation on, diagrams.|$|R

40|$|International audienceInternational law's rich {{existence}} {{in the world can}} be illuminated by its objects. International law is often developed, conveyed and authorized through its objects and/or their representation. From the symbolic (the regalia of the head of state and the symbols of sovereignty), to the mundane (a can of dolphin-safe tuna certified as complying with international trade standards), international legal authority {{can be found in the}} objects around us. Similarly, the practice of international law often relies on material objects or their image, both as evidence (satellite images, bones of the victims of mass atrocities) and to found authority (for instance, maps and charts). This volume considers these questions; firstly what might the study of international law through objects reveal? What might objects, rather than texts, tell us about sources, recognition of states, construction of territory, law of the sea, or international human rights law? Secondly, what might this scholarly undertaking reveal about the objects - as aims or projects - of international law? 0 How do objects reveal, or perhaps mask, these aims, and what does this tell us about the reasons some (physical or material) objects are foregrounded, and others hidden or ignored. Thirdly what <b>objects,</b> <b>icons</b> and symbols preoccupy the profession and academy? The personal selection of these objects by leading and emerging scholars worldwide, will illuminate the contemporary and historical fascinations of international lawyers. As a result, the volume will be an important artefact (itself an object) in its own right, capturing the mood of international law in a given moment and providing opportunity for reflection on these preoccupations. By considering international law in the context of its material culture the authors offer a new theoretical perspective on the subject...|$|R
