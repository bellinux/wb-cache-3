This rate equation compares favorably with experimental ly determined deve lopment rates. Typical values of the rate constants involved are given. Empirical mode ls are given for the surface induction and substrate adhe-sion effects.

Currently, accounting is considered to be a measurement discipline with complete measurement objectives, even in the absence of a measurement theory that incorporates the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the measurement process. In this study the principles of the representational theory of measurement (a theory that establishes measurement in the social sciences) are used to emphasise that the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the financial statements are not measurement objectives unless they are supported by a theory of measurement. Hence the financial statements cannot contain measurement information until a theory of measurement is established that incorporates the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the accounting measurement processes.
