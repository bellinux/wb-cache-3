5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century all of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of drug metabolism had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the vitamins, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and Carl and Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, glycogenesis and glycolysis, and the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>steroids</b> and porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} <b>of</b> <b>steroid</b> induced rise in intraocular pressure following cataract surgery using non contact tonometer.

The results indicate a dynamic equilibrium between adsorption and desorption <b>of</b> <b>steroid</b> hormone with regard to the membrane. This equilibrium can be pH dependent and there is a possibility for release <b>of</b> <b>steroid</b> hormones at high pH during membrane cleaning procedures or erratic pH variations.

40|$|The fate of steroid-receptor {{complexes}} {{after their}} nuclear retention in target cells is not firmly established. Nuclear glucocorticoid- and androgen-receptor complexes could be recycled {{back to the}} cytosol in their responsive tissues, whereas {{this has not been}} clearly established for the case of progesterone and estrogen receptors. The models <b>of</b> <b>steroid</b> receptor recycling proposed so far involve release of chromatin-bound complexes into the cytosol, loss <b>of</b> <b>steroid,</b> and receptor inactivation. These receptors, however, can eventually be reactivated to a steroid binding form to reinitiate a cycle <b>of</b> <b>steroid</b> binding and further nuclear translocation. We propose that this model can represent a general aspect <b>of</b> <b>steroid</b> hormone action, provided that inactivation/reactivation processes occur in every steroid responsive system. A process involving a reversible receptor inactivation could {{play a major role in}} the control <b>of</b> <b>steroid</b> receptor recycling. It is proposed that a control on the extent of receptor available to steroid binding could result in a modulation of cellular responses to steroid hormones...|$|R
