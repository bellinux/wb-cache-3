50|$|A Statute <b>of</b> <b>Frauds</b> defense {{may also}} be {{affected}} by a showing of part performance by proving the existence of one of two different conditions. If the parties have taken action in reliance on the agreement, {{as in the case}} Riley v. Capital Airlines, Inc., the court held that part performance does not take an executory portion of a contract out of the Statute <b>of</b> <b>Frauds.</b> Each performance constitutes a contract that falls outside the Statute <b>of</b> <b>Frauds</b> and was enforceable to the extent it is executed. However, the unexecuted portion of the contract falls within the Statute <b>of</b> <b>Frauds</b> and is unenforceable. As a result, only the executed portion of the contract can be recovered, and the doctrine of part performance does not remove the contract from the Statute. On the other hand, the court, in Schwedes v. Romain, held that partial performance and grounds for estoppel can make the contract effective.|$|R
