6000|$|It was {{a melancholy}} sight {{to see him}} seated, his battle-axe and shield by his side, his chin upon his mailed breast, with but one old crone for companion, and {{notwithstanding}} his crimes and misdeeds, a pang of compassion shot through me as I looked upon Twala thus [...] "fallen from his high estate." [...] Not a soldier of all his armies, not a courtier out of the hundreds who had cringed round him, not even a solitary wife, remained to share his fate or halve the bitterness of his fall. Poor savage! he was learning the lesson which Fate teaches to most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> long enough, that the eyes of mankind are blind to the discredited, and that he who is defenceless and fallen finds few friends and little mercy. Nor, indeed, in this case did he deserve any.|$|E
6000|$|On {{this day}} the Lord Jesus was first {{shown to the}} Gentiles. The word Epiphany means [...] "showing." [...] The Wise Men were worshippers of the true God, though in a dim {{confused}} way; and they had learnt enough of what true faith, true greatness was, not to be staggered and fall into unbelief {{when they saw the}} King of the Jews laid, not in a palace, but in a manger, tended by a poor village maiden. And therefore God bestowed on them the great honour that they first of all--Gentiles--should see the glory and the love of God in the face of Jesus Christ. God grant that they may not rise up against us in the Day of Judgment and condemn us! They had but a small spark, a dim ray, of the Light which lighteth every man who cometh into the world; but they were more faithful to that little than many <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in the full sunshine of the Gospel, with Christ's Spirit, Christ's Sacraments, Christ's Churches,--means of grace and hopes of glory of which they never dreamed.|$|E
6000|$|Nor {{was he a}} {{fighting}} dog; but once attacked, he lacked a sense of values, being unable to distinguish between dogs that he could beat and dogs {{with whom he had}} [...] "no earthly." [...] It was, in fact, as well to interfere at once, especially in the matter of retrievers, for he never forgot having in his youth been attacked by a retriever from behind. No, he never forgot, and never forgave, an enemy. Only a month before that day of which I cannot speak, being very old and ill, he engaged an Irish terrier on whose impudence he had long had his eye, and routed him. And how a battle cheered his spirit! He was certainly no Christian; but, allowing for essential dog, he was very much a gentleman. And I do think that most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> on this earth these days would rather leave it with that label on us than the other. For to be a Christian, as Tolstoy understood the word--and no one else in our time has had logic and love of truth enough to give it coherent meaning--is (to be quite sincere) not suited to men of Western blood. Whereas--to be a gentleman! It is a far cry, but perhaps it can be done. In him, at all events, there was no pettiness, no meanness, and no cruelty, and though he fell below his ideal at times, this never altered the true look of his eyes, nor the simple loyalty in his soul.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the novel}} became popular, the reviews became {{positive}}; Crawford Woods, also in The New York Times, wrote a positive review countering Lehmann-Haupt's negative review: {{the novel is}} [...] "a custom-crafted study of paranoia, a spew from the 1960s and — in all its hysteria, insolence, insult and rot — a desperate and important book, a wired nightmare, the funniest piece of American prose"; and [...] "this book is such a mind storm that we may need {{a little time to}} know that it is also literature[...] [...] it unfolds a parable of the nineteen-sixties to those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in them in a mood — perhaps more melodramatic than astute — of social strife, surreal politics and the chemical feast." [...] About Thompson, Woods said he [...] "trusts the authority of his senses, and the clarity of a brain poised between brilliance and burnout".|$|R

[...] Dan Milliken of Country Universe rated the song number 7 on his list of the 201 Greatest Singles of the Decade.

The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as [...] "devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country", political commentator Rachel Maddow summarized Jindal's Katrina remark as follows: [...] " [...] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government {{should not be allowed to}} fail again, but that government...never works.

[...] David Johnson, a Republican political strategist criticized Jindal's mention of Hurricane Katrina, stating [...] "The one thing Republicans want to forget is Katrina."

The 134-home, 40-acre subdivision is a microcosm of the new economy, a site where issues of race and gender, immigration and exploitation, hopes and dreams animate a classic California landscape. Susan Brenneman, writing in the Los Angeles Times, called Dream Street “a classic tale, recast for Southern California: the American dream, tied to the almighty dollar and abundant cheap labor, dependent, equally, on self-deception and inextinguishable hope.” “For those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> on one of California’s streets of dreams,” writes author D.J.
