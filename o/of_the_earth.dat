5|$|Most of {{the atoms}} {{that make up}} the Earth and its {{inhabitants}} were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System.

5|$|Near {{the surface}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by {{the field of}} a magnetic dipole positioned at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> and tilted at an angle of about 11° {{with respect to the}} rotational axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
