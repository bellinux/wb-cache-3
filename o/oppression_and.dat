5|$|Abūʾl Nasr Manṣūr ibn Luʾluʾ, {{also known}} by his laqab (honorific epithet) of Murtaḍā al-Dawla ("Approved of the Dynasty"), was {{the ruler of}} the Emirate of Aleppo between 1008 and 1016. He succeeded his father Lu'lu' al-Kabir, {{with whom he had}} shared power. Unlike Lu'lu', however, Mansur's rule was opposed by Aleppo's notables, who chafed at his <b>oppression</b> <b>and</b> monopolization of power. Both Mansur and his father harassed the {{remaining}} members of the Hamdanid dynasty, in whose name they ostensibly ruled. On the diplomatic front, Mansur balanced ties with both the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate, and maintained the emirate's Shia Muslim orientation.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism.

His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{theory is}} the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work {{in a variety of}} disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), <b>oppression,</b> <b>and</b> patriarchy.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious: Merchant of Souls is a 2011 American {{documentary}} film about modern human trafficking, specifically sexual slavery.

Victims of trafficking talk about having been {{the objects of}} physical abuse and attempted murder. Several former prostitutes talk about their conversion to Christianity, escape from sexual <b>oppression,</b> <b>and</b> subsequent education or marriage. The film ends with the assertion that only Jesus can completely heal people from the horrors of sexual slavery.|$|E

5|$|Radical {{feminism}} {{considers the}} male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's <b>oppression</b> <b>and</b> the total uprooting and reconstruction {{of society as}} necessary. Conservative feminism is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. Libertarian feminism conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference. Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist. Ecofeminists see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment; ecofeminism {{has been criticized for}} focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.|$|E
5|$|The last tenet, '{{socialism}}', did {{not mean}} socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from <b>oppression</b> <b>and</b> enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E
5|$|Carol Vernallis, {{author of}} Experiencing Music Video, found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the mermen. The mermen {{in the video}} exist in a {{self-contained}} world of their own, where they procreate with their own kind, both biologically and socially. The fact that the mermen {{did not seem to}} possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that the video associated them with other works by Ritts – namely homoerotic sculptural images without penises. Their tails drew different meanings, including sexual ones and Christian symbolism. Since in contemporary art, images of mermen are rare while mermaids are common, they are sometimes called fairies partly because it is not known how they came to be. Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen in the video played a crucial role. They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view. Vernallis believed that since invisibility was a central theme in the homosexual community, this actually portrayed <b>oppression</b> <b>and</b> the desire to watch but never be seen.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1720s, Zahir {{and his brother}} Yusuf, backed by the Bani Saqr, {{captured}} Tiberias and its multazim. Concurrently, Zahir issued a letter to Köprülü Abdullah Pasha, governor of Sidon Eyalet, accusing the multazim of <b>oppression</b> <b>and</b> of imposing illegal taxes on the population. Zahir insisted that if Abdullah Pasha appointed him multazim of Tiberias and Arraba, he would guarantee the timely payment of taxes and rule justly. Abdullah Pasha consented to Zahir's rule and sent him an honorary robe. This {{was the first time}} a Zaydani multazim was directly appointed by the governor of Sidon rather than the semi-autonomous rural chiefs of Mount Lebanon. Zahir made Tiberias his principal base and was joined by his Zaydani kinsmen. He appointed his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali, the multazim of al-Damun, as commander of the family militia.|$|E
5|$|Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham {{say that}} materialist forms of {{feminism}} {{grew out of}} Western Marxist thought and have inspired {{a number of different}} (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's <b>oppression,</b> <b>and</b> that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{persecution}} of Sunni Muslim Circassians and Chechens {{led to their}} immigration into the region in 1867, where today they form {{a small part of}} the country's ethnic fabric. Overall population however declined due to <b>oppression</b> <b>and</b> neglect. Urban settlements with small populations included: Al-Salt, Irbid, Jerash and Al-Karak. The under-development of urban life in Jordan was exacerbated by the settlements being sometimes raided. Ottoman oppression provoked the region's both non-Bedouin and Bedouin tribes to revolt, Bedouin tribes like: Adwan, Bani Hassan, Bani Sakhr and the Howeitat. The most notable revolts were the Shoubak Revolt (1905) and the Karak Revolt (1910), which were brutally suppressed. Jordan's location lies on a pilgrimage route taken by Muslims going to Mecca, which helped the population economically when the Ottomans constructed the Hejaz Railway linking Mecca with Istanbul in 1908. Before the construction of the railway, the Ottomans built fortresses along the Hajj route to secure pilgrims' caravans.|$|E

5|$|Thus {{from its}} outset, the Yalta {{decision}} favored the communists, who enjoyed {{the advantages of}} Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe securely {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union, as well as control over crucial government departments such as the security services (this activity was initially dominated by Lavrentiy Beria's Soviet NKVD). Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the populist program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's delegation was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its political-military organizations became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of <b>oppression</b> <b>and</b> conflict and the ideas expressed in the PKWN Manifesto and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support. From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established workers' councils, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of <b>oppression</b> <b>and</b> isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E

5000|$|Prominent queer theorist Judith Butler penned a harsh {{critique}} of MacKinnon's work, writing, [...] "MacKinnon insists that feminism {{does not require}} prioritizing of <b>oppressions,</b> <b>and</b> that 'male domination' or 'patriarchy' must be construed as the systemic and founding source of <b>oppression</b> for women. <b>And</b> though this may appear true for some economically advantaged white women, to universalize this presumption is to effect a set of erasures, to cover over or 'subordinate' women who 'are' sites of competing <b>oppressions,</b> <b>and</b> to legislate through a kind of theoretical imperialism feminist priorities that have produced resistances and factionalizations of various kinds." [...] Hence, Butler logically concludes that MacKinnon as a [...] "theological, imperializing Subject." [...] Similarly, Linda Nicholson rejects the homogenizing simplification of [...] "women as a single entity", effectively erasing women who are not [...] "white, Western, and middle-class." [...] Carrie Menkel-Meadow accuses MacKinnon of holding [...] "tenaciously to an essentialist position", and of undertaking a [...] "remarkably heterosexist analysis." [...] Kathryn Abrams echoes this critique, arguing that MacKinnon assimilates Native American women into a [...] "cross-cultural constant" [...] that is [...] "solipsistic and even manipulative." [...] In addition, Abrams calls MacKinnon's dominance theory [...] "relentlessly removed from practical concerns." [...] Neil MacCormick detects [...] "cultural imperialism" [...] in MacKinnon's account of the law, wherein a [...] "flat universality" [...] of the United States occludes all other perspectives.|$|R
