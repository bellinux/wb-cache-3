40|$|The pet-turtle {{market has}} grown {{in recent years and}} become an {{important}} pathway for the introduction of alien species in Europe. The import of Trachemys scripta elegans has been banned by European Commission Regulation due to its species’ expanding territory and negative impact on native species. Since the demand from hobby breeders persists, however, blocking imports of this popular subspecies opens up the possibility for the introduction of other potentially invasive turtles. We determined those turtle species most common in the pet trade within the Czech Republic, which is the most important producer, importer and exporter of <b>ornamental</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> in the EU. The determination of establishment risk for the EU as a whole was then individually evaluated for turtle species based on known establishment models. Chelydra serpentina, Apalone spinifera, Apalone mutica, and Sternotherus odoratus were considered most problematic, because these species have serious establishment risk and are imported to the EU in substantial numbers. Also localities in the EU were identified where probability is highest for establishment of non-native turtles...|$|E
40|$|The {{import of}} <b>ornamental</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> in Italy takes place mainly from third {{countries}} or from territories outside the European Community, as South-East Asia and Japan. One aspect that {{should be taken into}} account is the possible health risk related to the import and breeding of ornamental fish species. For this purpose, this work was conducted on imported species, in order to characterize the main pathogens causes of morbidity and mortality. During 2015, 232 freshwater ornamental fish have been analyzed. All samples were performed with an anatomical, pathological, parasitological and bacteriological analyses. The anatomical and pathological features showed lesions in 140 specimens referable to gill disease, often associated with parasitic infestations by ectoparasite of the Monogenea class. The bacteriological exam was positive in 65. 09 % of fish and through the use of selective medium, phenotypical and biochemical tests, we have classified bacterial strains. In more than 50 % of cases we have isolated bacteria belonging to mobile Aeromonas spp. It is important to underline that these imported species can harbor pathogens with possible consequences for the health of domestic aquaria. For this reason, the continuous health monitoring of imported ornamental fish is the most effective system to control or prevent the entry of new pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Free {{chlorine}} (FC) {{and free}} bromine (FB) produced during ozonation treatment of aquarium seawater pose {{a serious threat}} to the health of <b>ornamental</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> but {{little is known about the}} concentration levels of these chemicals in aquarium facilities. In this study, a highly selective and sensitive analytical method based on the derivatization of FC and FB to corresponding 4 -halo- 2, 6 -dimethylphenols by 2, 6 -dimethylphenol was developed. The formed halo-derivatives were extracted by hexane and subsequently quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The calibration curves showed good linearity (r(2) > 0. 999) in a broad concentration range of 2. 1 - 4200 mu g L- 1 for FC and 3. 3 - 1700 mu g L- 1 for FB. The method detection limits (S/N = 3) were determined to be 62. 7 and 71. 6 ng L- 1 for FC and FB, respectively. The developed method exhibited good recovery, selectivity, precision and was successfully applied to monitor the formation and decay of FC and FB in ozonated seawater. During the ozonation process, the formation of FB dominated, while much less chloride was oxidized to FC; FB decayed much faster than FC. The concentrations of FC and FB in various animal tanks of Beijing Aquarium were also monitored. The results show that 30. 1 - 56. 4 mu g L- 1 FC and 26. 5 - 730. 7 mu g L- 1 FB were present in aquarium tanks, revealing that the health of aquatic animals (particularly fish, jellyfish, and coral) was under severe threat...|$|E

40|$|The {{import of}} {{aquarium}} animals {{has been increasing}} worldwide in recent years. Despite its contribution to world trade and the economy, this trade also comprises {{one of the main}} pathways for the introduction of non-indigenous animals. In the past decade, crayfish has become a popular pet as well as a potential threat to the environment upon its escape or release. Since the Czech Republic is one of the world’s leading importer, exporter, and producer of <b>aquatic</b> <b>ornamental</b> <b>animals,</b> we prepared a detailed analysis of crayfish imports. The present paper provides a complete list of countries supplying ornamental crayfish and examines trends of their prices and imported quantities during the past decade (2003 – 2012). Indonesia has been identified as the leading supplier in recent years. The annual average price of imported crayfish has varied over the evaluated period within the range of € 0. 76 – 4. 72 per individual and it is rising annually by € 0. 15. The quantity of live crayfish imported for aquarium purposes has not been affected significantly by the price per individual and it has grown rapidly. Therefore a constant monitoring of this pet trade sector is strongly recommended for the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} aquaculture, at present, is undoubtedly recognized. The sector {{is expected to}} effectively contribute to food security, nutritional well-being, poverty reduction and economic development. However, biosecurity lapses and transboundary <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> diseases pose significant constraints to aquaculture sustainability. This paper discusses how aquaculture development brings new chal-lenges to <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> health. These challenges include compliance to international treaties, practical implementation of regional guidelines and national strategies, in-creasing biosecurity and biosecurity awareness at all levels, empowering farmers to manage disease and other risks through better management practices, and conduct-ing targeted research that will support biosecurity assessments. A short brief on emerg-ing and re-emerging issues such as chemical usage, climate change and disease ecol-ogy, fish welfare and fish health, fish-vet cooperation and certification scheme for <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> health service providers is included.

40|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of AhR pathway genes and their evolutionary rate variations were studied on <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals.</b> The gene sequences for the proteins {{involved in this}} pathway were obtained from four major phylogenetic groups, including bivalvia, amphibian, teleostei and mammalia. These genes were distributed under four major steps of toxicology regulation: formation of cytosolic complex, translocation of AhR, heterodimerization of AhR and induction of CYP 1 A. The NJ, MP, and ML algorithm were used on protein coding DNA sequences to deduce the evolutionary relationship for the respective AhR pathway gene among different <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals.</b> The rate of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions per non-synonymous site (d(N)) and synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site (d(S)) were calculated for different clade of the respective phylogenetic tree for each AhR pathway gene. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that evolutionary pattern of AhR pathway genes in <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> is characterized mainly through gene duplication events or alterative splicing. The d(N) values indicate that all AhR pathway genes are well conserved in <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> except for CYP 1 A gene.
