5|$|A {{binary search}} tree is a binary tree data {{structure}} that works based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in {{binary search tree}}s. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Reynolds v. Sims that state {{legislative}} seats must be apportioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of one man, one vote. A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, {{and the court}} rules that this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{foreign policy}} is officially based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of {{neutrality}} and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their political system. The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with {{other countries in the}} region. Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E

5|$|Of the 234 {{members of}} the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 that were {{returned}} to their seats for the Thirty-third Congress. Due to his increased seniority, {{he was assigned to}} the more prestigious Ways and Means Committee, but he was not given a committee chairmanship as many had expected. Although he supported Pierce's pro-slavery agenda <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of states' rights and believed that secession was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country's immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the gaseous {{diffusion}} process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Principle</b> of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E
5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than the pioneering machines on display. Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a hydraulic ram and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle starter motor. This was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of the brake press, a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal through progressive force.|$|E
5|$|Some {{algorithms}} become simpler {{when used}} on DAGs instead of general graphs, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of topological ordering. For example, {{it is possible}} to find shortest paths and longest paths from a given starting vertex in DAGs in linear time by processing the vertices in a topological order, and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or maximum length obtained via any of its incoming edges. In contrast, for arbitrary graphs the shortest path may require slower algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman–Ford algorithm, and longest paths in arbitrary graphs are NP-hard to find.|$|E

5|$|Some tile {{types that}} retain the Holliday junction's native 60° angle have been demonstrated. One such array uses tiles {{containing}} four Holliday junctions in a parallelogram arrangement. This structure {{had the benefit}} of allowing the junction angle to be directly visualized via atomic force microscopy. Tiles of three Holliday junctions in a triangular fashion have been used to make periodic three-dimensional arrays for use in X-ray crystallography of biomolecules. These structures are named for their similarity to structural units based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of tensegrity, which utilizes members both in tension and compression.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{received}} worldwide attention, {{and it had}} immediate {{effects on}} navies around the world. The preeminent naval powers, Great Britain and France, halted further construction of wooden-hulled ships, and others followed suit. A new type of warship, monitor, was produced based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of the original. The use of {{a small number of}} very heavy guns, mounted so that they could fire in all directions was first demonstrated by Monitor but soon became standard in warships of all types. Shipbuilders also incorporated rams into the designs of warship hulls {{for the rest of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of infinitesimal calculus {{was at the}} forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.|$|E

5|$|After a {{brief period}} of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in Leicester to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read An Essay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Principle</b> of Population by Thomas Malthus, and one evening he met the {{entomologist}} Henry Bates. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal Zoologist. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects. William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the Vale of Neath.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{recognized}} {{the independence of}} the United States following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781. In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.|$|E
5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E
