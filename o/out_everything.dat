The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is actually the front of the suit. The poster caused some furore—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited <b>out</b> <b>everything</b> above the knee, whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.|$|E

25|$|The Salic Law {{outlines}} {{a unique}} way of securing the payment of money owed. It is called the Chrenecruda (or crenecruda, chren ceude, crinnecruda). In cases where the debtor could not pay back a loan in full {{they were forced to}} clear <b>out</b> <b>everything</b> from their home. If the debt still could not be paid off the owner could collect dust from all four corners of the house and cross the threshold.
