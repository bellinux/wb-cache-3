However, it is possible on a per-call basis to specify a different Closed User Group (of which the user is a member) for the call. It is also possible on a per-call basis to suppress the use of the Preferred CUG i.e. act as if the user is {{not a member of the}} Closed User Group, and to suppress the <b>Outgoing</b> <b>Access</b> permission i.e. to insist that the call only go through if the destination {{is a member of}} the CUG.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Many {{enterprises}} install {{multiple access}} links for fault tolerance or bandwidth enlargement. Dispatching connections through good links {{is the ultimate}} goal in utilizing multiple access links. The traditional dispatching method is only based {{on the condition of}} the access links to ISPs. It may achieve fair utilization on the access links but poor performance on connection throughput. In this work, we propose a new approach to maximize the per-connection end-to-end throughput by the on-the-fly round trip time (RTT) probing mechanism. The RTTs through all possible links are probed by duplicating the SYN packet during the three way handshaking stage of a TCP connection. Combined with the statistical packet loss ratio and the passively collected link metrics, our algorithm can real-time select a link which provides the maximum throughput for the TCP connection. The experiment results show that the accuracy to choose the best <b>outgoing</b> <b>access</b> link is over 71 %. If the second best link is chosen, it is usually very close to the best, thus achieving over 89 % of the maximum possible throughput. The average per-connection throughput for our algorithm and the traditional round-robin algorithm is 94 % vs. 69 %. Keywords [...] Load balancing; RTT; TCP three-way handshaking I...|$|E
40|$|Many Internet Service Providers tune the {{configuration}} of the Border Gateway Protocol on their routers to control their traffic. Content providers often need to control their <b>outgoing</b> traffic while <b>access</b> providers need to control their incoming traffic. We show, by means of measurements and simulations, that controlling the flow of the incoming interdomain traffic is a difficult problem. For this purpose, we first rely on detailed measurements to show the limitations of AS-Path prepending. Then, we show by using large-scale simulations that the difficulty of controlling the flow of the incoming traffic lies in the difficulty of predicting which BGP route will be selected by distant ASes...|$|R
40|$|We study {{property}} testing algorithms in directed graphs (digraphs) with maximum indegree {{and maximum}} outdegree upper bounded by d. For directed graphs with bounded degree, {{there are two}} different models in property testing introduced by Bender and Ron (2002). In the bidirectional model, one can access both incoming and outgoing edges while in the unidirectional model one can only <b>access</b> <b>outgoing</b> edges. In our paper we provide a new relation between the two models: we prove that if a property can be tested with constant query complexity in the bidirectional model, then it can be tested with sublinear query complexity in the unidirectional model. A corollary of this result is that in the unidirectional model (the model allowing only queries to the outgoing neighbors), every property in hyperfinite digraphs is testable with sublinear query complexity. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on ‘distributed’ and ‘open’ innovation {{emphasizes the need}} for enterprises to exchange external knowledge in order to perform R&D and to innovate. This paper focuses on research partnerships {{as a way to}} do so. More particularly, a distinction is made between the development and the exchange of in house knowledge in formal research cooperation agreements. Learning efficiency in absorbing external knowledge, reduction of <b>outgoing</b> spillovers, and <b>access</b> to tacit knowledge and know-how are main drivers for research cooperation and are largely related to capabilities in terms of internal R&D employment. Using micro-level data provided by the OECD business R&D survey for Belgium, insights are offered in the way R&D personnel qualifications and occupations are related to knowledge generation in R&D collaboration. More specifically, it is demonstrated that both the occupational positions and the level of education of R&D managers and researchers are positively related to knowledge development and knowledge exchange in formal R&D collaboration agreements. Moreover, in terms of absorptive capacity it is found that patent registration and innovative outputs are positively related to the propensity to engage in knowledge development in R&D collaboration, but not to the engagement of knowledge exchange in R&D collaboration. status: publishe...|$|R
