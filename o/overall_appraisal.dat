40|$|Background. Presently, no {{comprehensive}} and validated questionnaire to measure patient {{experiences of the}} preoperative assessment clinic (PAC) is available. We developed and vali-dated the Patient Experiences with the Preoperative Assessment Clinic (PEPAC) questionnaire, {{which can be used}} for quantitative measurements of patient experiences of the PAC. Methods. We adapted the National Health Service outpatient questionnaire, incorporating questions specific for anaesthesiology. To make the PEPAC appropriate for quantitative measurements, dimensions and single items suitable for statistical analysis were constructed. Each dimension consists of multiple items measuring the same aspect of care. Reliability was established by computing Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. Construct validity was assessed by cor-relating the dimensions with the patient’s <b>overall</b> <b>appraisal</b> (Pearson’s r). These dimensions should explain a substantial level of variance of the patients ’ overall appraisal; therefore, regression analysis was performed. Results. After a pilot phase, the questionnaire was sent to 700 consecutive patients (response 74 %). Five scales measuring five dimensions of patient experiences were constructed. Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0. 56 to 0. 84, supporting reliability of the PEPAC. Correlations between the dimensions and patients ’ <b>overall</b> <b>appraisal</b> ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 56. Collectively, the five scales explained 51 % of patients ’ <b>overall</b> <b>appraisal.</b> Conclusions. The PEPAC is a comprehensive, reliable, and validated questionnaire to measure patient experiences with the PAC.

40|$|Providing and {{deploying}} effective {{strategies to}} support knowledge-sharing activities is imperative, {{yet it is}} achievable by understanding the factors that facilitate the knowledge transfer process (Chaudhary, 2005). Knowledge sharing is considered the central key {{to the success of}} all knowledge management strategies (Chaudhary, 2005). For an organization, knowledge sharing is the act of capturing, organizing, reusing, and transferring experience-based knowledge that reside within the organizational and making that knowledge available to others in the business (Hsiu-Fen & Gwo-Gaung, 2006). Once knowledge sharing becomes integrated in the organizational culture and incorporated into performance appraisal processes, the foundations for a real knowledge culture will be built which is important for organizational success. Moreover, communication and management are important factors in building a good business and they are enhanced by the adoption of a good performance appraisal system. Effective appraisal systems act as a primary vehicle for the measurement of management change in this rapidly changing world marketplace (longenecker, 1997). Appraisal systems occupy a core role in human resource management and remain an essential topic to be invested among organizational researchers. Many different appraisal techniques exist; the most important are: Self-Review appraisal, Immediate supervisor appraisal, Peer group <b>appraisal,</b> Team <b>appraisal,</b> <b>overall</b> assessment <b>appraisal,</b> Upward appraisal, and the 360 degree appraisal. Each appraisal process has its own advantages and disadvantages. The best anyone can hope to do is to match the appropriate appraisal method in order to enhance knowledge sharing in an organization. According to the researchers knowledge, no literature review exists on performance appraisal and knowledge sharing, thus this research will provide an empirical investigation about the relationship between performance appraisal and knowledge sharing. It will examine thoroughly the effectiveness of the different performance appraisal systems on knowledge sharing within Lebanese organizations. It further suggests some means for adopting better performance appraisal system that may incorporate criteria for knowledge sharing. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{simulating}} the internal, incompressible, turbulent flow of a catenary riser and evaluating the flow effects on its structural response. Firstly, the static equilibrium problem {{is considered to}} obtain the static geometrical configuration of the structure which is described by nodal coordinates in a local Lagrangian coordinate system. The nodal coordinates are accordingly used for {{the representation of the}} flow field within the pipe along its complete suspended length. The flow field is discretized by applying an appropriate Finite Volume Scheme while a Realizable k-ε turbulence model associated with an appropriate Near-Wall Treatment is used for the numerical simulation of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS), with the use of ANSYS Fluent commercial code. The investigated flow parameters are collected at discrete locations of the flow field, corresponding to the structural discretization. Especially the varying dynamic pressure values are integrated on the crosssectional area for producing local axial forces. Accordingly, these flowinduced forces along with averaged velocities are imported as local tension loads within an in-house linear dynamics structural model which is solved numerically using a Finite Differences scheme. <b>Overall,</b> an <b>appraisal</b> of the turbulence modeling approximation compared with the plug-flow approximation, regarding the contribution of the flow on structural response, is accomplished.

40|$|The {{development}} of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has been hotly debated, with rhetoric often being posited as evidence either {{for or against}} the technique. This paper aims to provide {{a brief overview of}} the procedure, a critical review of the studies completed to date, a meta-analytic review of the available data, and a chronology of the evolution of EMDR over the past 10 years. Treatment-outcome studies were of such disparate quality-even studies meeting similar broad criteria-that combining their results in a meta-analysis was of very questionable value. <b>Overall,</b> an <b>appraisal</b> of the published research supported the following conclusions: (1) There is overwhelming evidence that eye movements are neither a necessary nor a useful addition to the procedure; (2) there is strong and consistent evidence that EMDR is better than no treatment, yet only as good as any other treatment that utilizes some aspect of exposure therapy; and (3) there is strong evidence that a full-exposure-based intervention package is superior to EMDR. There is also some evidence that "reprocessing" is likewise superfluous to EMDR and that the effects of EMDR dissipate over time. It is also concluded that the current debate cannot be entirely settled through scientific investigation due to the rapid and constant reshaping of what constitutes EMDR, the similarity to extant alternative methods, and the lack of a falsifiable theory underpinning the procedure...|$|R
40|$|I n the past, {{research}} on human–technology interaction has almost exclusively concentrated on aspects ofusefulness and usability. Despite {{the success of}} this line of research, its narrow perspective has recently become a target for criticism. To explain why people prefer some systems over others, factors such as aesthetic qualities and emotional experiences {{play an important role in}} addition to instrumental aspects. In the following, we report three experiments that illustrate the importance of such factors. In the first experiment, we study the role of emotions in human–technology interaction by using Scherer’s (1984) component theory of emotions as a theoretical foundation. A combination of methods is derived from that theory and employed to measure subjective feelings, motor expressions, physiological reactions, cognitive appraisals, and behaviour. The results demonstrate that the manipulation of selected system properties may lead to differences in usability that affect emotional user reactions. The second experiment investigates the interplay of instrumental and non-instrumental system qualities. The results show that users ’ <b>overall</b> <b>appraisal</b> of a technical device is influenced by both groups of qualities. In the third experiment, we join the approaches of the first two studies to analyse the influence of usability and aesthetics within a common design. The results indicate that systems differing in these aspects affect the perception of instrumental and non-instrumental qualities as well as the users ’ emotional experience and their <b>overall</b> <b>appraisal</b> of the system. Summarizing our results, we present a model specifying three central components of user experience and their interrelations (CUE-Model). The model integrates the most important aspects o...|$|E

However, to date, {{there have been no}} studies investigating the effects of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure on psychological, endocrine, and autonomic responses to a standardized psychosocial stress test in children. Methods: A sample of 115 healthy, ten-year-old children was examined. The Glucocorticoids+Tocolytics group was characterized by tocolytic treatment of the mothers due to preterm labor (n= 43). In addition, the pregnant women received glucocorticoid treatment in order to accelerate fetal lung maturation in case of preterm birth. The first control group (Tocolytics) consisted of children whose mothers also experienced preterm labor, but did not receive glucocorticoid treatment (n= 35). In the second control group (CONTROL), children whose mothers had a complication-free pregnancy were assessed (n= 37). Psychological parameters (stress appraisal and mood) using self-report questionnaires as well as salivary cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase and heart rate were measured during a standardized psychosocial stress test (TSST-C). Results: Group comparisons revealed that a subscale of stress appraisal, control expectancies, significantly differed in children who were prenatally exposed to glucocorticoids as compared to both control groups (F= 4. 889, p =. 009). Furthermore, significant differences between the groups were revealed for salivary cortisol.
