5|$|At {{its first}} landfall, {{the bulk of}} Hurricane Dean's damage was to agriculture. 12,000producers {{suffered}} losses, mostly in the states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán. 30,000ha (74,000acre) of habanero peppers were destroyed, along with 150,000ha (370,000acre) <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> 60,000ha (150,000acre) of citrus.

5|$|The {{species has}} {{been implicated in}} the spread of weeds by {{consuming}} and dispersing fruit and seed. In {{the first half of}} the twentieth century, pied currawongs were shot as they were considered pests <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> strawberry crops, as well as assisting in the spread of the prickly pear. They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as they consume phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the codling moth.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> wheat, {{and the use}} of farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E
5|$|In 1805 or 1806 {{the last}} bull-baiting {{in the town}} took place. On 7 July 1839, a severe fire {{destroyed}} many houses in Cullompton.

A subscription for rebuilding was set and donations of £5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to the high price of wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a maltster. He was accused of speculatively buying 2000 bushels <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> when his house was attacked, almost all the windows were broken and his furniture was also damaged.|$|E

5|$|Irene {{also caused}} severe {{agricultural}} damage in southeastern Florida totalling to $338million Floodwaters killed 30cattle at one farm, though the owners protected {{the rest of}} their 1700cattle by raising the feeding areas above the flood plain. According to an initial estimate, the flooding destroyed between 5% and 15% of fruit groves along its path. The flooding delayed the winter planting <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> bell peppers and damaged tomato plants, forcing Miami-Dade County growers to replant damaged crops. The hurricane also damaged sugar cane, vegetables, and citrus crops, with citrus canker spreading after the storm passed through the area. Due to the crop damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared Broward, Collier, Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties as disaster areas. This qualified eligible farmers for low-interest emergency loans.|$|E

Noul knocked down trees and damaged houses, resulting in power outages to seven communities; the power was restored within one day. The storm's rains were beneficial to local farmers after an extended dry spell. In Santa Ana where the storm moved ashore, the storm caused minor damage to seven schools. Across Cagayan, the storm damaged ₱2.7million (US$60,000) worth <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> rice crops, {{as well as}} minor damage to fisheries.

5|$|While {{over the}} western Atlantic Ocean, Ginger became the last target of Project Stormfury, {{which sought to}} weaken hurricanes by {{depositing}} silver iodide into tropical cyclone rainbands. Ginger ultimately struck North Carolina on September30 as a minimal hurricane, lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region. Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left severe crop damage, with 3million bushels <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> 1million bushels of soybean lost. Damage in the state was estimated at $10million (1971US dollars, $ USD). Further north, moderate precipitation and winds spread through the Mid-Atlantic states, although no significant damage was reported outside North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, the {{combination}} of strong winds and rains left heavy crop damage, destroying 3million bushels <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> another million bushels of soybeans; losses to the corn crop were mitigated due to {{about half of the}} crop having been harvested before the storm's arrival. Heavy damage was also reported to the peanut crop as well as to various fruits and vegetables. In some locations, up to 15% of the cotton crop was lost, particularly in the northeastern portion of the state. In 45 counties in the eastern portion of the state, farmers affected by the hurricane were eligible for loans from the Farmers Home Administration, following federal approval from United States President Richard Nixon. Governor Robert W. Scott requested federal disaster aid for 24counties, which was denied. Damage in North Carolina was estimated at $10million (1971USD, $ USD), of which about $1million (1971USD, $ USD) was from coastal flooding. One death occurred in Washington when a vehicle accident was possibly caused by a wind gust; however, it was not conclusively linked to Ginger.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer <b>of</b> <b>corn</b> <b>and</b> soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E
