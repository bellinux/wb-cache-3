The task is not solvable in general, and thus we restrict ourselves to exercises whose solutions are represented through data structures that can be automatically analyzed. Example of such data structures are: undirected and directed graphs; finite state automata; truth tables, programmable logic arrays (PLAs), and Boolean functions; and stacks, trees and lists. Restricting the task to such data-structures has the added advantage that the answers can be encoded through web-forms or through cheaper paper-forms to be read through <b>optical</b> <b>mark</b> <b>readers.</b> This allows the delivery of such exercises both as a self-assessment tool through the web and as formal exams...|$|R

40|$|The {{histological}} {{changes in}} 95 jejunal biopsy specimens from {{children have been}} analyzed by a new mporphometric technique. The microscope image of the specimen is traced directly onto computer data cards. A simple sketch records accurate quantitative data in a matrix of 840 points, retaining the spatial arrangement of the tissue components. The data are fed via an <b>optical</b> <b>mark</b> data card <b>reader,</b> into a mini-computer.

Jejunal biopsies from 37 controls and 26 untreated coeliac patients were clearly distinguished morphometrically. Sixteen pairs of biopsies from coeliac patients on long-term gluten-free diets before, and 12 weeks after, the reintroduction of dietary gluten significantly reflected the effects of gluten challenge. Comparison of control and abnormal biopsies showed a spatial redistribution of the components, more than a change in their absolute amounts.

40|$|The {{development}} of the teaching evaluation has been a longitudinal action research approach. Step-by-step measures and strategies were taken by the Medical Education Unit (MEU) {{to improve the quality}} of teaching and validate the evaluation documentation. These measures formed part of the accreditation of the medical curriculum. The main objectives of the teaching evaluation are to provide a forum for students to provide feedback on the quality of the teaching provided within the School of Medicine and enable tutors to receive feedback on their performance. Evaluation also provides a medium for tutors to identify areas of need regarding their Continuing Professional Development (CPD). In 2007, the MEU looked at all aspects of course evaluation and student experiences by using Pendleton&# 039;s feedback tool and a Likert-scale. In 2009, evaluation questionnaires were created in <b>Optical</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Reader</b> (OMR) format through Form and Label Integrated Printing System (FLIPS) software.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} acquiring on-job performance evaluation marks for enlisted personnel is deficient in two important respects: (1) the scales do not adequately differentiate among actual levels of ratee performance, and (2) the manual forms and procedures do not per-mit timely processing {{and application of}} the data for important indi-vidual personnel actions (e. g., advancement, assignment, and quality retention). In 1968 the Navy began its transition from a manual to an auto-mated system, starting with {{the development and implementation}} of an <b>Optical</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Reader</b> (OMR) document for the top three enlisted Pay Grades, E- 7 / 8 / 9. This report describes the development of new marking scales for two other Pay Grade groups, 5 - 6 and 1 - 4.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper {{describes}} the development context {{and the main}} features of an XML-based Question-Bank (QB) application being created at the University of Manchester {{as part of a}} CBA project that uses Microsoft Office as both the authoring tool and the storage system. The use of MS office significantly reduces the workload of question authors because QB items are created, stored and automatically extracted within the familiar format of MS Word documents. This approach facilitates the easy inclusion of diagrams, images and other types of multimedia components within questions as the elements of the question are marked-up with either HTML or XML tags using an authoring toolbar that is added to the standard MS Word toolbar. When a Word document, containing one or more marked-up questions, is loaded into the QB the tagged question meta-data is extracted by the application parser and stored in a Microsoft Access database. By making use of the stored meta-data the assessor has a wide range of methods by which to select questions. This includes, for example, the use of specified or random questions and selections based on keywords or topics. The CBA system uses the Assessment Transformation Tool (ATT), which was developed as part of the project, to deliver MS Word based assessments, marked-up in either HTML or XML, directly to Question Mark Perception (QMP) for delivery via the web. Assessments produced using the XML QB can also be output to paper for a traditional form of assessment or for use with an <b>Optical</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Reader</b> (OMR). The XML Question Bank already offers the potential to export to the IMS QTI standards through its interface to QMP. If the system is adopted it will be further developed to directly support the QTI standards for both import and export with other question banks...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjective: To describe oral health in the Anangu Pitjantjatjaraku lands in South Australia and to compare with earlier surveys and national data. Design: Descriptive. Setting: Data were collected {{at the time of}} dental care service provision, according to World Health Organization protocols, {{at the request of the}} Nganampa Health Council on <b>optical</b> <b>mark</b> <b>reader</b> forms. Participants: There were 356 Anangu adults and 317 children surveyed. Results: The mean number of teeth affected by dental caries in the deciduous dentition in young children, aged 5 – 6 years, was double (mean 3. 20) that of the overall Australian child population aged 5 – 6 years (mean 1. 44). In contrast to the decline in deciduous caries in Australian children generally, Anangu children aged 5 – 9 years had a 42 % increase in the mean number of teeth affected since 1987. Adults experienced low levels of dental caries, but severe periodontal disease was more prevalent among diabetics (79 %) compared with-non-diabetics (13. 8 %). Tooth loss was found more frequently among adults with diabetes (mean 5. 51) than non-diabetics (mean 1. 53). Conclusions: Oral health promotion strategies, in association with general health strategies, need to be developed to improve oral health in this remote Aboriginal population. What this paper adds: Recent studies have shown that oral health of Indigenous children is worsening, but there has been little documentation of the changing oral health status of Indigenous adults. This study notes the deterioration of oral health in both children and adults since 1987 / 88. The relationship between glycaemic control, periodontal diseases and tooth loss in Indigenous adult populations needs to be further investigated.
