5|$|In late 1923, having {{decided not}} to return to Cambridge, Allen took {{a job in the}} City (London's {{financial}} district) working for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation as an underwriter. Not particularly well-off financially, he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not afford to take too much time away from business. He played cricket as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Wales – {{the future}} Edward VIII – was keen to {{participate}} in the war but the government refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured. Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare at first hand and attempted to visit the front line as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Hedwig Potthast, Himmler's young {{secretary}} {{starting in}} 1936, became his mistress by 1939. She left {{her job in}} 1941. He arranged accommodation for her, first in Mecklenburg and later at Berchtesgaden. He fathered two children with her: a son, Helge (born 15 February 1942) and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 20 July 1944, Berchtesgaden). Margarete, by then living in Gmund with her daughter, learned of the relationship sometime in 1941; she and Himmler were already separated, and she decided to tolerate the relationship {{for the sake of}} her daughter. Working as a nurse for the German Red Cross during the war, Margarete was appointed supervisor in Military District III (Berlin-Brandenburg). Himmler was close to his first daughter, Gudrun, whom he nicknamed Püppi ("dolly"); he phoned her every few days and visited as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|E
5|$|While {{based at}} Crosby-on-Eden with 59 OTU MacLachlan spent time flying {{other types of}} {{aircraft}} including the Bristol Beaufighter. On 20 August 1942 he was posted to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Duxford for a short time. MacLachlan flew as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could regardless of the activity. He flew as a co-pilot in a Short Stirling heavy bomber and practiced fighter evasion techniques and then proceeded to fly 15 types of aircraft in 11 days. MacLachaln also flew Supermarine Spitfires, acting as an attacking fighter {{as well as the}} American-made Bell P-39 Airacobra. MacLachlan also flew with the No. 1426 Flight RAF which operated captured German aircraft. He flew a Ju 88, M2+MK formerly of Küsten Flieger Gruppe 106 which force-landed at RAF Chivenor in November 1941. Hew flew in a passenger on Heinkel He111 (AW177) 1H+EN of 5./KG 26 which force-landed in Scotland in February 1940. At this time he provided escort to the resident Messerschmitt Bf 110 at the unit as it moved around airfields, although it is unknown if he flew it. By 4 October 1942 he had received notice that he had been selected as an RAF representative to tour the United States lecturing British and American trainee's in United States Army Air Force facilities. MacLachlan left 59 OTU with immediate effect.|$|E
25|$|Hay {{was back}} with Derbyshire in the 1878 season, still beating Hickton to {{the mantle of}} second-choice bowler, though now he had to shake {{competition}} off from John Platts, in the same position. Though he never played as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did during the 1878 season on any further occasions, Hay's round-arm bowling was at times preferred to John Platts' occasional deceptively-layered pace. In the 1879 season Hay put in fewer games for Derbyshire as he was playing for Keighley.|$|E

25|$|In all, Michael Di Venuto {{represented}} Australia in nine One Day Internationals, scoring 241 runs at {{an average}} of 26.77. He had a high-score of 89 scored against South Africa at New Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, and his only other score of note was 77 against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval. Although a talented batsman, his aggressive, attacking style of play which was shown by his strike-rate of 85.76, led him to give his wicket away cheaply too <b>often,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sought to go on the offensive early on in his innings.|$|E
25|$|Not long {{content with}} life in London, Fraser {{soon began to}} quit the mercantile counter as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could to watch the gardeners at work. He befriended William Forsyth who at that time had charge of the Apothecaries' Garden; through that {{acquaintance}} he would have become familiar with his predecessor Mark Catesby's travels, as some of Catesby's specimens from his travels were housed at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and Catesby's writings and engravings on the flora of the Americas were also published by the time Fraser moved to London.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{remainder}} of the 1930s Gerard continued to compete in trials and sprint races, and after purchasing a 1½ litre Riley Sprite he also began to participate in circuit racing. Early club races at his East Midlands home circuit Donington Park continued his success, with Gerard taking two victories over cars with much larger engines, as well as ninth in the prestigious Donington TT race. In between running the family business, Gerard continued to compete at Donington as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, driving in the Nuffield Trophy in 1938 and 1939, although without success. With war looming, in 1939 he also took the little Riley down to the Brooklands circuit in Surrey. At that year's Opening Meeting he took a highly creditable third place, and won a Campbell circuit handicap race later in the year.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Loung {{entered the}} ADL Intermediate School, and {{continued}} with English language {{learning and teaching}} (ESL) sessions. Meng and Eang both found employment with IBM on the evening shift, and Loung, now thirteen years old, cared for Maria after school until they returned home late at night. Meng sent money and packages, via the Asian community in Montreal, Canada, to his family in Cambodia as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could throughout the 1980s; some packages either did not arrive, or arrived {{with some of the}} contents missing. In 1985, Eang gave birth to her second daughter, Victoria, and Loung entered Essex Junction High School as a freshman. A few months later, Meng and Eang were sworn in as naturalized citizens of the United States. In early 1986, the Ungs moved, with the help of their sponsors, into their own modest two-story home in a nearby neighborhood, and Loung, now nearly sixteen years old, delighted in having her own personal room.|$|E
25|$|In June 2012, Henry joined Conference Premier side Luton Town on a free transfer, {{signing a}} two-year {{contract}} with the club. He was announced as club captain for the 2012–13 season. Henry made his Luton debut in the club's opening day 2–2 draw against Gateshead at Kenilworth Road on 11 August 2012, playing the whole match as Luton came from two goals down to salvage a point. He played in 43 games during the 2012–13 campaign, but missed {{the last part of}} the season due to a double hernia. Henry underwent an operation in April 2013 in order to be fit for pre-season training before the 2013–14 season. He later stated he had been carrying the injury for a large part of the season, which inhibited his ability to attack up the right wing as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did at Stevenage. New Luton manager John Still retained Henry as club captain for the 2013–14 season. Henry captained Luton to the Conference Premier title, and was part of a defence that kept a club-record 23 clean sheets.|$|E
500|$|Walters and Segev both noted {{inconsistencies}} between Wiesenthal's {{stories and}} his actual achievements. Segev concluded that Wiesenthal [...] "lied as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did" [...] {{because of his}} storytelling nature and survivor guilt. Daniel Finkelstein described Walters' research in Hunting Evil as impeccable and quoted Ben Barkow: [...] "Accepting that Wiesenthal was a showman and a braggart and, yes, even a liar, can live alongside acknowledging the contribution he made".|$|E

500|$|Edward the Confessor is {{depicted}} on a throne {{and wearing a}} crown and holding a sceptre in the first scene of the Bayeux Tapestry. In 1066, Edward died without an heir, and William the Conqueror emerged as the first Norman king of England following his victory over the English at the Battle of Hastings. Wearing a crown became {{an important part of}} WilliamI's efforts to cement his authority over his new territory and subjects. At his death in 1087, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported: [...] " [...] kept great state … He wore his crown three times a year as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was in England … He was so stern and relentless … we must not forget the good order he kept in the land".|$|E
500|$|Making {{its first}} {{appearance}} in Halo 2, the Gravemind was introduced to dispel {{the idea that the}} Flood is a mindless virus. The character was designed by a Bungie team, including artists Robert McLees and Juan Ramirez, and slowly developed into a massive creature with tentacles and a frightening level of intelligence. Driven by a desire to spread, the Gravemind is cunning and manipulative; he forges alliances as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> tries to consume his allies, tricking the Master Chief into aiding him while infecting the Chief's compatriots at the same time. The character has had a mixed reception by many critics upon his appearance in Halo 2, and reviewers including 1UP.com found his role in Halo 3 confusing and without clear motive. More positively, critic Aaron Sagers used Gravemind {{as an example of a}} [...] "frenemy" [...] — the creature's appearance made the Master Chief's fight against the Flood more personal and more dramatic.|$|E
50|$|Polanski {{appeared}} for Germany {{in various}} youth levels, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> captain. <b>He</b> {{was a key}} member of under-21s at the 2006 UEFA European Championship, scoring a magnificent long-range goal in the fixture against Serbia and Montenegro; his form during the tournament made AS Monaco FC enquire about his services, but Mönchengladbach promptly rejected the offer.|$|R

500|$|Sprigg {{was raised}} on his father's [...] "Swan Ponds" [...] farm in Hampshire County, {{where his father}} {{provided}} a private tutor for his son's primary education. His father owned farms {{on both sides of}} the North Branch Potomac River in Hampshire County, Virginia, and Allegany County, Maryland. On March 7, 1844, the Maryland General Assembly passed an act authorizing Sprigg's father to freely move his slaves across state lines between his farms as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> deemed necessary. His father relocated the family from the Hampshire County farm to Cumberland in 1852. Sprigg continued his education in Cumberland, and, following the completion of his studies there, he moved to Baltimore to study jurisprudence under his uncle John Van Lear McMahon. He studied under his uncle until 1858, when he was admitted to the Maryland bar. Sprigg's practice of law underwent a hiatus during the American Civil War. He was a proponent of states' rights and sympathized with the cause of the Confederate States of America during the war; however, he did not take up arms during the conflict. During the war, his father died in Cumberland in 1864.|$|E
500|$|Walter {{was not a}} holy man, {{although}} he was, as John Gillingham, a historian and biographer of Richard I, says, [...] "one of the most outstanding government ministers in English History". Hugh of Lincoln, a contemporary and later canonised, {{is said to have}} asked forgiveness of God for not having rebuked Walter as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> probably should have. Modern historians tend not to share the older view that Walter was {{the driving force behind the}} administrative changes during Richard's reign, that Richard was uninterested in government, and that he left all decisions in the hands of his ministers, especially Longchamp and Walter. The studies of James Holt and others have shown that Richard was highly involved in government decisions, and that it was more a partnership between the king and his ministers. Walter was, however, very innovative in his approach to government. Walter continued to enjoy the support of Richard's brother John, and it was during John's reign that a number of Walter's administrative reforms took place, although how much royal initiative was behind the innovations is unknown, given John's interest in government and administration.|$|E

A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus and that the previous announcement had been a ruse. The album was released in May 2001 to positive reviews. Known for his [...] "dark, intelligent, compelling, and unexpected lyrical twists", Keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album, in which he [...] "doesn't cross the line from darkness to ugliness ... as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> has in the past". In an interview with [...] NY Rock, Keenan explained, [...] "Everything we release with Tool is inspired by our music. It doesn't matter if it is a video or if its lyrics. The lyrics for [...] "Schism" [...] are nothing more than my interpretation of the music." [...] The album became a worldwide success, reaching No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart in its debut week, and Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for [...] "Schism". In 2002, Keenan recorded a song called [...] "Fallen" [...] with Thirty Seconds to Mars that was released on the band's self-titled debut album.|$|E
