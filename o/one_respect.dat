25|$|Travel to Finland {{was very}} difficult, because the German Reich forbade transit of armaments and war {{equipment}} across its territory (including the occupied Polish territories). This was in <b>one</b> <b>respect</b> a simple honoring of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, {{but was also}} because Teleki had not given the Wehrmacht permission to use Hungarian railway lines for attacking Poland. The German government was also unhappy that Teleki's government had harbored thousands of Polish refugees after the German and Soviet invasion of Poland because of the Hungarian-Polish friendship.|$|E
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and he is right in his comment) is ”In <b>one</b> <b>respect,</b> and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E

By the early 1960s, he was {{on the board of the}} Salesmanship Club, and by 1965, he was president of the Salesmanship Club and a member of the Citizens Council. In 1968, he was entrusted with leadership of the Greater Dallas Council of Churches and then the Community Relations Commission, both of which pushed him into the center of local race relations.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the B. F. Saul Company {{undertook}} {{construction of}} the uncompleted south wing. Obtaining the necessary permits and approvals had taken five years. The architect was Hartman-Cox of Washington, D.C. The plans followed Joseph Younger’s 1931 design very closely for the exterior. The Belden Brick Company of Ohio made the variegated brick to match exactly the brick of the historic building. New carvings of Indiana limestone match those in the original building as well. The Boose Aluminum Foundry Company of Reamstown, Pennsylvania, cast the spandrels for the south wing. (ALCOA had cast the originals on the historic main building.) Hartman-Cox diverged from Younger’s plans for the exterior in <b>one</b> <b>respect,</b> by adding balconies {{to the south and}} east sides where the south wing faces the National Zoo.|$|E
25|$|Tolkien's {{publisher}} was George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London (A). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York {{arranged to}} publish Tolkien's {{books in the}} United States. Houghton Mifflin did not set their own type; rather they printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen & Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in <b>one</b> <b>respect</b> crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin's impressions did not identify which printing run {{they came out of}} or even a copyright date. This failure has led to intense confusion in the collectibles market. Very few people can identify the Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966. Hence people cannot be sure what they have or might be buying and therefore what it might be worth.|$|E
25|$|Ordered as a {{follow-on}} to the NA-57 as a two-seat advanced trainer, the NA-64 P-2/NAA-64 P-2 {{represented a}} major structural improvement, with a longer all-metal fuselage replacing the fabric covered fuselage of the NA-57. As well as metal skin replacing the fabric on the fuselage, the fin was changed {{from having a}} corrugated skin to being a smooth stressed skin structure and was moved slightly aft, lengthening the rear fuselage while the engine was moved forward to maintain the center of gravity. The rudder was also changed from the rounded shape used previously to one with a roughly triangular shape with the broadest part being at the bottom to improve handling at high angles of attack. In <b>one</b> <b>respect</b> however, it was a step backwards from its immediate predecessor, the BT-14, with which it is often confused, in that the earlier straight wings were used {{with the result that}} in RCAF service, when compared to the later and more powerful Harvard II it was flown alongside, it had different handling characteristics and lower performance.|$|E

500|$|Inclement weather {{continued}} {{to disrupt the}} Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed multiple times before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning. Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In <b>one</b> <b>respect,</b> maybe if we decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. But we wanted to get out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with whatever we do apart from running." ...|$|E
500|$|Monteverdi is lauded {{by modern}} critics as [...] "the most {{significant}} composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy"; [...] "one {{of the principal}} composers {{in the history of}} Western music"; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers that followed him for three centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the late 20th and 21st century that have identified with Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi's reputation as [...] "a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority" [...] – although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, [...] "showing what {{can only be described as}} an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose". In a letter dated 16 October 1633 Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a [...] "modern": [...] "I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary". However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but while at the same time protective of his status as a competent composer in the stile antico. Thus, says Chew, [...] "his achievement was both retrospective and progressive". Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. [...] "And in <b>one</b> <b>respect</b> in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music." ...|$|E
