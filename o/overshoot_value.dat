40|$|Abstract- System {{identification}} has {{an important}} role in control system design, particularly in auto-tuning and adaptive control applications. Recently, it has emerged as a significant research topic in power converter design. For this reason, this paper proposes a new on-line approach to identify the parameters of a dc-dc converter. The proposed method is capable of rapidly detecting and accounting for abrupt load changes during the transient period. In most situations the controller is blind to this change. However, the estimation algorithm is able to update the model parameters before the output reaches the peak <b>overshoot</b> <b>value.</b> As a result, the controller can minimize the effect of any parameter change. The proposed method depends on predication error variation during a rapid change of load and is designed around a simple fuzzy logic structure. An adaptive forgetting factor is used to optimize the identification process, and this varies very quickly and smoothly with the step load change. Simulation results show that the identification model matches the plant during the transient period. Importantly, the convergence rate and parameters error, the two factors use to validate the algorithm, are very good during system startup and after any abrupt load change.

We then apply the framework to archival Hubble Space Telescope observations of six stellar clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud that have reported ages between ~ 1 - 2. 5 Gyr. Assuming a canonical value of the strength of core convective overshooting, we recover the well-known age-metallicity correlation, and additional correlations between metallicity and extinction and metallicity and distance. If we allow the strength of core overshooting to vary, we find that for intermediate-aged stellar clusters, the measured values of distance and extinction are negligibly effected by uncertainties of core overshooting strength. However, cluster age and metallicity may have disconcertingly large systematic shifts when core overshooting strength is allowed to vary by more than +/- 0. 05 Hp.

Here there is a change of the load at t =  100  s and a linear {{decrease}} of the reference speed during the time interval [130  s, 200  s]. Figure  18 makes it clear that the controller under the new parameters has achieved better control of the gas turbine speed when it rejoins its reference value of 1 per unit at t =  100  s. At the same time the gas turbine develops excess torque to compensate for the drop in developed speed and to ensure stable operation at the reference speed, as shown in Fig.  20. However, due to this sudden perturbation the exhaust temperature rapidly increases as shown in Fig.  19. To clarify the main role of the controller used here, the exhaust temperature dynamics are presented both with and without the use of the controller. It can be seen that the difference is very clear when the exhaust temperature increases sharply. Indeed, the level exceeds the maximum allowed level of 960 F very rapidly to reach a huge <b>overshoot</b> <b>value</b> of 1160 F which can cause damage to the whole system.

40|$|The {{mobility}} impairment {{caused by}} a paralysis like a spinal cord injury or a stroke has, beside many other impacts, an influence on the transfer of signals between {{the muscles of the}} lower extremities and the brain. In a paraplegic person, this means that she or he can not stand without holding onto a support or standing in a standing frame while the impact on the ability to balance in a hemiplegic person can be less severe. Although the connection between the muscles and the brain is impaired by the injury, the muscles still retain the ability to contract if innervated. This thesis describes control approaches which combine the remaining voluntary control of the paraplegic and stroke patients with the artificially controlled stimulation of the muscles of the paralysed limbs to aid the subject in balancing. The aim was to develop new control approaches which would assist balance in paraplegic subjects and in stroke. To support standing in paraplegic subjects, the moment generated at the ankle using electrical stimulation of the shank muscles was integrated with the voluntary control of the upper body, resulting in the concept of Integrated Voluntary Control (IVC). In the outer loop the ankle moment produced by the paraplegic subject due to his voluntary upper body movement was estimated using a mathematical model based on the inclination angles of upper and lower body. This estimated ankle moment was then compared with the actual moment applied at the force plates the subject was standing on, and an appropriate stimulation signal was applied to the paralysed shank muscles. Experimental evaluation initially involved four able bodied volunteers in which base line results with stiffness and stiffness-viscosity controllers using a rotating standing platform were obtained. This was extended to the paraplegic subject, where electrical muscle stimulation was used to generate the required ankle moment. The IVC concept was then evaluated with the paraplegic subject and compared to the base line results. Due {{to the nature of the}} system and implied perturbation onto the control system controlling the posture of the paraplegic subject the known evaluation values (e. g. rise time, steady state value, <b>overshoot</b> <b>value</b> etc.) are not suitable. Therefore, the variance of a time signal around its mean value was used as an evaluation value which allowed to compare the achieved performance of the paraplegic subject employing the new control approach with the stiffness and stiffness-viscosity controllers directly. To assist balance in stroke patients, a new training approach was introduced based on the concept of integrating the voluntary abilities of the patient with mechanical balance support and sensory electrical stimulation. This concept was evaluated in a training program with one stroke subject which demonstrated the feasibility and potential balance improvement resulting from this approach.

These include the rise time (the time {{needed by the}} control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak <b>overshoot</b> (the highest <b>value</b> reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others (settling time, quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to robustness (see after).|$|R
50|$|For each 8 bit {{luminance}} sample, {{the nominal}} value to represent black is 16 {{and the value}} for white is 235. Eight-bit code values from 1 through 15 provide footroom, {{and can be used}} to accommodate transient signal content such as filter undershoots. Similarly, code values 236 through 254 provide headroom and can be used to accommodate transient signal content such as filter <b>overshoots.</b> The <b>values</b> 0 and 255 are used to encode the sync pulses and are forbidden within the visible picture area. The Cb and Cr samples are unsigned and use the value 128 to encode the neutral color difference value, as used when encoding a white, grey or black area.|$|R
