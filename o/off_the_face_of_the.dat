5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney, where Sitriuc {{convinced}} Sigurðr to ally {{himself against}} Brian {{on the condition}} that Sigurðr would gain Gormlaith in marriage. In April 1014, the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf. Although Brian's forces ultimately won the day, and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain, Brian lost his life as well. As for Gilli, he appears in a chapter of Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict. In one instance, a Caithnessman is said to have witnessed valkyrie-like apparitions singing songs for the slain, whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands. Priests in Iceland are stated to have encountered paranormal phenomena, whilst an Orcadian is said to have encountered the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. As for Gilli, the saga asserts that he dreamt of a song that foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr. There is reason to suspect that the aforesaid supernatural manifestationsarguably somewhat detached from the saga's general narrativeare actually interpolations of separate material. Elsewhere in the narrative, however, there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs. For example, the episode concerning Gilli's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man, the Icelander Flosi Þórðarson, is depicted dreaming of the burning of the saga's eponym, Njáll Þorgeirsson.|$|E

500|$|According to biographer David Buckley, the Los Angeles-based David Bowie, fuelled by an [...] "astronomic" [...] cocaine {{habit and}} {{subsisting}} {{on a diet}} of peppers and milk, spent much of 1975–76 [...] "in a state of psychic terror". Stories—mostly from one interview, pieces of which {{found their way into}} Playboy and Rolling Stone—circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his semen stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from The Rolling Stones, and living in morbid fear of fellow Aleister Crowley aficionado Jimmy Page. Bowie would later say of L.A., [...] "The fucking place should be wiped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth".|$|E
500|$|The tour used seven {{individual}} rigs for {{performers and}} props to become airborne. For dancers to be flown {{to the center}} of each upstage, a wench, which dropped 18inches <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panel, was placed in the rig. Cyrus' flying required two wenches, one for a vertical lift and one for a horizontal move that coursed the audience and back to the stage. Four elevators, or trap doors, were located throughout the stage, some of which had the option of a 4×4 or an 8×8 foot opening. All of the fly rigs and elevators were built and operated by Show Group Production Services (SGPS)/Showrig. The challenge that presented the most difficulty for SGPS was time constraint, as there were only three weeks of rehearsal. Brian White, co-owner of SGPS, explained, ...|$|E

500|$|The band's label, Island Records, {{underwent}} changes {{while the}} group prepared to record, which postponed the studio schedule for three weeks. Bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz asserted that [...] "We're definitely writing all the time, so we're {{not going to}} try to squeeze every last drop out of the stone. That's part of what's been wrong with the rock industry: they keep fans waiting far too long, and bands go away and disappear <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet. That's not the way it's going to be for Fall Out Boy." [...] During this time off, Fall Out Boy contributed a cover of the song [...] "What's This?" [...] for the 2006 rerelease of The Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack, as well as a remix of their song [...] "Of All the Gin Joints in All the World" [...] for the Snakes on a Plane soundtrack. Wentz also purchased a house in Los Angeles, where he spent much time writing lyrics to new songs.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
500|$|La Dispute {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} Wildlife in pieces to accommodate their intense tour schedule. The album was recorded at two different studios with recording engineers Andrew Everding and Joe Pedulla. They {{started with the}} instrumentation of six tracks at Drasik Studios in Chicago; this recording process took place over two weeks. The songwriting featured on the album is distinct from La Dispute's previous releases. Dreyer wrote the stories or the concepts behind each song, and then the band adapted these stories into lyrics and created music to revolve around them. In an interview, Dreyer was asked how the songwriting differs; {{he said that the}} lyrics were written before the music was composed. He was quoted as saying: [...] "This time around, we switched the process up entirely. Previous to Wildlife, we'd always start music first and add vocals later based on the way the song felt. This time around, because we had a more concrete concept going into it, and because we wanted to work even more as a single unit [...] " [...] Dreyer and the rest of La Dispute had expressed interest in writing a conceptual record, but with ambiguity so it would not limit the listener's experience. [...] "Oftentimes, I think records with a linear narrative narrow the ways in which a person can enjoy it, and not everyone wants to sit down and listen to something front to back." [...] When they returned from their touring in Australia in February 2011 they [...] "dropped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth" [...] for two months, during which their writing sessions lasted twelve to fourteen hours a day.|$|E

500|$|In early 2003, Nolan {{approached}} Warner Bros. {{with the}} idea {{to make a new}} Batman film. Fascinated by the character and story, he wanted to make a film grounded in a [...] "relatable" [...] world more reminiscent of a classical drama than a comic-book fantasy. Batman Begins, the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, premiered in June 2005 to both critical acclaim and commercial success. Starring Christian Bale in the title role, along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson, the film revived the franchise, heralding a trend towards darker films which rebooted (or retold) backstories. It tells the origin story of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham City. Praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance, Kyle Smith of The New York Post called it [...] "a wake-up call to the people who keep giving us cute capers about men in tights. It wipes the smirk <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superhero movie." [...] Batman Begins was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2005 in the United States and the year's ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards. On the film's 10th anniversary, Forbes published an article describing its influence: [...] "Reboot became part of our modern vocabulary, and superhero origin stories became increasingly en vogue for the genre. The phrase [...] "dark and gritty" [...] likewise joined the cinematic lexicon, influencing our perception of different approaches to storytelling not only in the comic book film genre but in all sorts of other genres as well." ...|$|E
