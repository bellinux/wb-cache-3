5|$|Catherine's father, Tom Miller (Ken Pogue), tells Black {{about two}} {{friends of his}} whose son was convicted of killing his wife. The father, C. R. Hunziger, is dying of {{pancreatic}} cancer, but maintains his distance from his son over the crime; his wife Adele, however, still believes her son to be innocent. Black visits the terminal Hunziger, hoping to change his mind, but the elderly man holds his position. Adele gives Black a folder full of documents relating to the case, which Black reviews. His knowledge of offender profiling leads him {{to believe that the}} convicted man, Malcom, is innocent; however the conviction was secured with a substantial level <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Testimony in {{the trial}} {{concluded}} on May 15, 1826; summations concluded four days later. Despite the lack <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence,</b> the jury deliberated only an hour before convicting Beauchamp of Sharp's murder. He {{was sentenced to death}} by hanging on June 26 of that year. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution to write a justification for his actions. The stay was granted, and the execution was rescheduled for July 7, 1826. Though Anna Beauchamp was questioned, a charge against her for being an accessory to the crime was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E

5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented {{witnesses who}} testified to bloodstains and {{strands of hair}} found on the lathe, to support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the machine room near Frank's office. The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> that suggested {{the place of the}} murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Project Sign wrote their Estimate of the Situation, which {{concluded}} that the remaining unidentified sightings were best explained by the ETH.

Ruppelt. Ruppelt also indicated that Vandenberg dismantled Project Sign after they wrote their ETH conclusion. With this official policy in place, all subsequent public Air Force reports {{concluded that}} there was either insufficient evidence to link UFOs and ETH, or that UFOs did not warrant investigation.|$|E

25|$|Two brothers, Ronald and Lance Madison, {{fled the}} scene, but were pursued down the bridge by Gisevius and Faulcon in an unmarked state police vehicle. Faulcon fired his shotgun {{from the back}} of the car at Ronald, a developmentally {{disabled}} man who would later die from his injuries. The autopsy found that Ronald Madison sustained seven gunshot wounds, five of them in his back. Bowen was later convicted of stomping him on the back before he died, though this conviction was overturned for lack <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence.</b> Lance Madison was then taken into custody and charged with eight counts of attempting to kill police officers. He was held in custody for three weeks before being released without indictment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{described}} Schmerber v. California as a landmark case and a [...] "watershed moment" [...] {{in the history}} of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Likewise, John D.

[...] Constitutional law scholar Akhil Reed Amar identified Schmerber as {{a turning point in the}} Fifth Amendment's [...] "distinction between words and physical evidence." [...] Anne Marie Schubert has also argued that Schmerber served as the genesis for a long line of Supreme Court cases ordering the compelled production <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence.</b> Because Schmerber foreclosed the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some scholars, including John A. Scanlan, argue that the Court's ruling was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol and urine analysis to test for controlled substances in criminal investigations.|$|E

500|$|A {{grand jury}} was empaneled in June 2005 to {{investigate}} the charges against Fletcher's administration. By August, the jury had returned indictments against nine administration officials, including state Republican Party chairman Darrell Brock Jr. and acting Transportation Secretary Bill Nighbert. All of the indictments were for misdemeanors such as conspiracy except those against Administrative Services Commissioner Dan Druen, who was charged with 22 felonies (20 counts <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> tampering and 2 counts of witness tampering) in addition to 13 misdemeanors. On August 29, Fletcher granted pardons to the nine indicted administration officials and issued a blanket pardon for [...] "any and all persons who have committed, or may be accused of committing, any offense" [...] {{with regard to the}} investigation. Fletcher exempted himself from the blanket pardon. The next day, Fletcher was called to testify before the grand jury, but refused to answer any questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.|$|E
