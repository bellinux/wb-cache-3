40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} is to develop and try out an {{approach}} for personalized nature activities for people with dementia. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study using focus group interviews with people with dementia was conducted. Based on the results of the focus groups and the relevant literature, the approach was developed. In a qualitative descriptive pilot study with a one-group design, we tried out the approach regarding acceptability and experience of the intervention among people with dementia, and satisfaction with the approach among healthcare professionals. Additionally, we investigated the <b>organizational</b> <b>feasibility.</b> RESULTS: From the focus groups, eight key aspects of experiencing nature were identified as being important for quality of life (e. g. relaxation, freedom), as well as six categories of preferred activities (e. g. active, passive, and social activities). Based on these themes and categories, an approach was developed to design nature activities according to the personal wishes, needs, and experiences of people with dementia. During the intervention, participants in the pilot study showed high levels of positive behaviors and low levels of negative behaviors. As regards, <b>organizational</b> <b>feasibility,</b> eight themes for successful implementation of nature activities were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study contributes to the knowledge regarding the development and implementation of person-centered nature activities for people with dementia. The implementation of the activities could be improved by training professionals in person-centered care. The effect of the person-centered nature activities approach should be investigated...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{concerns}} {{relative to}} California farm gate prices for wheat {{and a lack}} of profitability in wheat production has been expressed by a group of California wheat growers. Their dissatisfaction has resulted in their consideration to form a California wheat grower cooperative.

40|$|The {{multi-layer}} safety approach {{focuses on}} flood risk reduction through {{three types of}} measures: (1) prevention through dikes, levees and dams, (2) a flood resilient spatial planning and (3) an adequate crisis management. Whereas the official Dutch policy propagates the multi-level safety approach, the current Dutch water safety policy is still focused on prevention only (layer 1). The integration with the two other layers (i. e. a flood resilient spatial planning and an adequate disaster management) has still to be explored. In order to assess the technical and the <b>organizational</b> <b>feasibility</b> of the multi-layer safety approach in urban areas, the Province of North-Holland and the Waterboard Hollands Noorderkwartier have initiated a case study. In this case study various stakeholders of a pilot area were invited to discuss about the opportunities of the multi-level safety approach. The case study and accompanying workshop showed that an integration of the different policy layers (i. e. dike reinforcement, spatial planning and disaster management) adds much complexity to the decision environment of the stakeholders, both in technical and organizational terms. A first requirement of the stakeholders involved in such decisions was understandable information about flood risks and an integration of flood risk information with the different policy fields of spatial planning and flood disaster management.

40|$|Computer-based {{games and}} {{simulations}} provide {{the means for}} practicing essential elements of combat which in a realistic exercise setting would require substantial resources in terms of personnel, time, and investments. Another important aspect of such games and simulations is the possibility {{to make use of}} gameplay log data for conducting debriefings, etc. This paper presents a study where relatively simple computer simulations were developed to improve poorly supported training aspects, and support debriefing and measuring of training outcome. A previous feasibility study showed a lack of systematical implementation of tactical-level military training simulation support. In the feasibility study, three Swedish military units were chosen to illuminate a number of varying and currently undeveloped tactical-level training domains where games and simulations can make a difference, to evaluate the potential training benefits in terms of learning and <b>organizational</b> practices. The <b>feasibility</b> study showed and exemplified that there exist many tactical-level military training domains that are likely to benefit from using relatively simple computer simulations, and also that the same system can be a support for both the training audience and the exercise management. Based on the feasibility study, this paper presents a proof of concept agent based simulation system that has been implemented and validated within the scope of a military command post exercise. Through using a generic agent based simulation engine along with commonly accepted communication protocols, the potential to complement and provide an additional edge to today’s procedures can be achieved using comparatively small efforts. The paper is concluded by presenting a generic approach to easily implement agent based simulation support at undeveloped tactical domains, and best practices for doing so. QC 20161219 </p...|$|R
40|$|Between 2002 and 2006, the {{feasibility}} of a regional chain for sustainable production of poultry meat is studied. The study is initiated by a company, owned by a family of broiler growers (Kuijpers Kip) and is financed by the Ministry of agriculture, nature management and fisheries and the Ministry of transport, public works and water management. Representatives of the Dutch poultry business, non-governmental organizations and knowledge organizations engineered the study. The goal {{of this study was}} to design a concept for a regional and sustainable production chain for poultry meat and meat products, and to judge its feasibility. The study was divided in two phases. During the fist phase, alternative scenarios for poultry meat production are designed, and for all scenarios technical, economical, legal, <b>organizational</b> and commercial <b>feasibility,</b> social acceptation, animal welfare and environmental effects (with attention for transport effects) are explored. Four alternative scenarios for broiler production and three different slaughtering and processing scenarios are designed. In the alternative broiler production scenarios, the last three days of the incubation and the hatching don¿t take place at a hatchery but at the broiler plant. After 18 days of incubation, the eggs are placed in litter on the floor or on a battery. In the four different scenarios the time on the battery was 0, 10, 18 or 42 days, respectively. The slaughtering and processing and scenario¿s were: slaughtering and processing at the poultry farm; slaughtering at the farm (mobile slaughtering plant) and processing in a traditional processing company, and slaughtering and processing in a traditional poultry processing plant. During the second phase, the scenario `physical short chain¿ is studied in detail. In this physical short chain, the hatching process, broiling and slaughtering are concentrated at one large poultry plant. After slaughtering the carcasses are transported to a processing company, but the farmer directs the process. Therefore he is responsible for the total process and for the final product. Tests and calculations concerning production of the poultry, costs for slaughter, marketing, and reduction of transport costs indicate that the physical short chain is economical practicable. Reduction of transport for day-old chicks and matured chickens is about 400. 000 km/year for this company...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{phenomenon}} of competitors that use a common interorganizational system (IOS) raises challenging strategic and organizational issues. Sometimes organizations join IOS initia-tives although {{it seems to}} weaken their competitive position. This paper analyzes, in retrospect, the fully automated Tel-Aviv Continuous Trading system (TACT) implemented by the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) and its members, about a decade after its inauguration. It examines TACT's <b>organizational</b> <b>feasibility</b> and its critical success factors, using the Theory of Constraints (TOC) as a theoretical basis. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of one system, includ-ing {{the point of view}} of both the initiator (TASE) and the participants (TASE members). TACT's implementation complexity was further escalated since all users had to convert to it simultane-ously. Therefore, intensive cooperation was required, especially between Israel's five largest banks, which had seemingly faced a value paradox of IOS, since TACT was supposed to under-mine their competitive position by reducing customer lock-in. This study contributes to the in-forming science transdiscipline by extending its applicability to interorganizational contexts, and by introducing the Theory of Constraints as an effective analysis tool that can be integrated within the informing science framework. It emphasizes the importance of a neutral managing in-termediary, provides guidelines for successful IOS implementation, and suggests that the main critical success factor is information systems management skills...|$|E
40|$|Background: Improper {{information}} transmission {{can lead to}} compromised patient safety {{and quality of life}} when patients are transferred from one setting to another. Electronic instruments may improve this situation, however, they are rarely used. Objective: The aim of this study therefore was to investigate the technical and <b>organizational</b> <b>feasibility,</b> usability, usefulness and completeness of an electronic instrument that is based on the German HL 7 CDA standard for eNursing Summaries. Materials and methods: To this end, a test health telematics infrastructure, which included the German electronic health card, was established and nursing summary application was developed that allowed summary documents to be communicated between a hospital and a nursing home. The users were asked to evaluate the usability of the nursing summary application as well as to compare the usefulness and completeness of electronically and paper transmitted information. Results: This study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing an electronic nursing summary application that was based on the German HL 7 CDA standard eNursing Summary and that was integrated in a test health telematics infrastructure. It could also be shown that the users rated this application as usable and that electronically supported patient transfers were superior to paper based ones. The use of the German electronic health card was regarded as a barrier by the users. Discussion: This study emphasizes the feasibility, relevance and barriers of electronically supported transfers of patients with nursing needs. Nurses working in hospitals and long-term care can integrate an application based on the HL 7 CDA Standard ePfgebericht into their working processes and get better and more complete information. To ensure continuity of care in a sustainable manner in the future, the German HL 7 CDA based eNursing Summary standard should become part of the German telematics infrastructure...|$|E

This intervention study tests the yield, feasibility {{and cost of}} 4 different active case detection (ACD) strategies (camp, index case, incentive and blanket approach) in VL endemic districts of India, Nepal and Bangladesh. First, VL screening (fever more than 14 days, splenomegaly, rK 39 test) was performed in camps. This was followed by house to house screening (blanket approach). An analysis of secondary VL cases {{in the neighborhood of}} index cases was simulated (index case approach). A second screening round was repeated 4 - 6 months later. In another sub-district in India and Nepal, health workers received incentives for detecting new VL cases over a 4 month period (incentive approach). This was followed by house screening for undetected cases. A total of 28 new VL cases were identified by blanket approach in the 1 (st) screening round, and used as ACD gold standard. Of these, the camp approach identified 22 (sensitivity 78. 6 %), index case approach identified 12 (sensitivity [...] 42. 9 %), and incentive approach identified 23 new VL cases out of 29 cases detected by the house screening (sensitivity [...] 79. 3 %). The effort required to detect a new VL case varied (blanket approach [...] 1092 households, incentive approach [...] 978 households; index case approach [...] 788 households had to be screened). The cost per new case detected varied (camp approach $ 21 - $ 661; index case approach $ 149 - $ 200; incentive based approach $ 50 - $ 543; blanket screening $ 112 - $ 629). The 2 (nd) screening round yielded 20 new VL cases. Sixty and nine new PKDL cases were detected in the first and second round respectively.

40|$|The Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologyThis study primarily focuses on the feasibility of RFID in apparel sector and proposing a usage guideline {{in the case of}} implementation. The opportunities in these areas are revolutionary. Since, Sri Lankan textile and Apparel sector continues to be the number one foreign exchange earner for the country, analysis of the usage of RFID technology would be significant and timely. RFID feasibility in apparel sector Sri Lanka is analysed through following five sections covering technological <b>feasibility,</b> <b>organizational</b> capability, financial viability, Questionnaire analysis, Guideline to RFID implementation. Technology capability analysis performed for RFID technology in Sri Lankan apparel shows advanced level in converting, and acquiring capabilities while all the other capabilities remains in primary levels. Benefits and issues to the apparel sector by implementation of RFID are identified as an objective of this study. Hence {{it can be seen that}} from the benefits available in RFID, Reduction of claims, Improvement of customer service, are not attractive to the Sri Lankan apparel sector while Enhanced availability of information, reduce inventory are the best benefits to the apparel industry. In the issue analysis it is evident that privacy issues, training problems are given as the non concern issues while initial implementation cost is identified as a heavy obstacle in the path of RFID implementation. Further there are critical issues which have to be answered before implementation of RFID. Most of them are technical aspects such as integration, dead at arrival, data overload. etc. A proven technology like Bar code is still not penetrated in Sri Lankan market. 1 only 30 % entire sample of apparel sector is using bar codes. Hence it is questionable whether Sri Lanka is still ready for RFID? But to confront the challenges in the apparel industry at this juncture, it is worthwhile to leap frog to RFID from manual counting. Sri Lankan apparel sector is technologically feasible in RFID technology while operational capability and financial viability are still questionable. In the case of financial viability all three sub sectors came with a positive NPV and pay back period of ranging from 2 years 4 months to 3 years. Naturally apparel sector is driven through low pay back period projects to cover the investments ambitiously. But RFID would not be one of those eye catching low pay back projects but would be steady and reliable long term investment. Following table summarize the findings of NPV and Pay back calculations. NPV - sewing $ 139, 646 NPV - Washing $ 109, 449 NPV - finishing $ 267, 577 Above table indicate positive NPV meaning feasible) RFID technology to implement in Sri Lanka. Special emphasis can be given to Finishing compared to sewing and washing Hence it is recommended for apparel giants to start RFID implementation pilots now, where with in next two years they can implement to all garment sewing, washing and garment finishing plants. Initial trial can be start from sewing and washing and spread to finishing. Further costs of RFID implementation will be considerably lower in future due to mass scale production of tags. Hence,at the end of two to three years NPV and pay back will be favorable for implementation of RFID to all apparel sector garment sewing, washing and finishing. For one off factories it is time to wait. With neither attractive NPV nor lesser pay back period it is better to adjust to the role of early follower. In case of implementation of RFID technology as an auto ID method, Recommendations are given to guide the implementation of RFID in Sri Lankan apparel factories. These guide lines will help to reduce the issues pertaining with RFID implementation as well as give a structured manner for implementation. These recommendations are based on the detailed discussion with the industry experts. Further specifications given in chapter 4. 1. 1 0 specifications will help on implementation of RFID in Sri Lankan apparel sector...|$|R
