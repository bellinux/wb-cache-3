40|$|International audienceFor {{manufacturers}} and importers that generally have {{to comply with}} a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals for their products the principle "tested once, accepted everywhere" is a great expectancy. The Directive 2007 / 23 /EC [1] concerning the placing on the market and the use of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> could fulfil those dealing with automotive occupant restraint systems (mainly airbags and seat belts pretensioners). By introducing harmonised Essential Safety Requirements (ESR) this new Directive offers the possibilities to replace the National approval procedures concerned by a single legal framework throughout the European Union (EU) for these <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles.</b> Although this EU directive will reduce the administrative burden for everybody by introducing the CE marking and certification procedure, its substitution and application in replacement of the current National regulatory frameworks may create difficulties at the beginning. In this paper we present the different parts of the Directive specifically these concerning pyrotechnic devices for automotive safety and how to comply with it. As Notified Body and Official Laboratory in France INERIS has gained lot of experience in testing, certifying and approving explosives and pyrotechnic devices.

40|$|International audienceIn the European Union (EU) <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> are {{subjected}} to comply with national regulations {{in addition to a}} series of EU Directives. In order to harmonize regulations in the EU, the placing on the market of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> is going to fall under the scope of a new European Directive. Among these <b>articles,</b> one finds <b>pyrotechnic</b> components of automotive safety equipment such as gas generators or igniters. In the very fast growing market of automotive safety industry, regulations might be perceived as non-technical barriers to innovation in the field. Conversely, through innovation arguments, industries sometimes try to promote specific cases of exemptions to comply various regulations. In a broad approach, we examine both regulation and industrial recent repercussions in the field of pyrotechnic devices for automotive safety, as these points of view face each other too often. Considerations regarding design, transport classification, approvals, safety features, environmental issues and treatment of end-life waste disposal are provided along the life cycle of the products. We enlighten needs in term of harmonized standards and technical procedures to answer regulation requirements. Such needs bring new perspectives and make room to various stakeholders for possible and efficient developments...|$|R
50|$|The sore {{point of}} these {{restrictions}} is the Republic Act 7183 which regulates the sale, manufacture, sale, distribution {{and use of}} firecrackers and <b>other</b> <b>pyrotechnic</b> devices.

50|$|Calcium {{chlorate}} is occasionally used in pyrotechnics, as an oxidizer {{and pink}} flame colorant. Its hygroscopic nature and incompatibility with <b>other</b> common <b>pyrotechnic</b> materials (such as sulfur) limit its utility in these applications.|$|R
50|$|From 1930, Sander (with <b>other</b> <b>pyrotechnics</b> factories) began {{secretly}} manufacturing rockets {{for military}} purposes, {{at the direction}} of Walter Dornberger. In 1936 he signed a contract for the sale of some of these weapons to Italy but was denounced as a traitor by the Nazis and imprisoned. During this time, the company was bankrupted, but upon his release later the same year, Sander founded a new company, Comet GmbH, with the assistance of some of his previous suppliers. In 1938, the firm was nationalised and Sander, again imprisoned, was forced to sell his interests in it to the Nazi Party. He died while in custody.|$|R

40|$|In the {{fabrication}} of igniters, actuators, detonators, and <b>other</b> <b>pyrotechnic</b> devices to be activated by a laser beam, an integral optical glass window is formed {{by placing a}} preform in the structural member of the device and then melting the glass and sealing it in place by heating at a temperature between the ceramming temperature of the glass and the melting point of the metal, followed by rapid furnace cooling to avoid devitrification. No other sealing material is needed to achieve hermeticity. A preferred embodiment {{of this type of}} device is fabricated by allowing the molten glass to flow further and form a plano-convex lens integral with and {{at the bottom of the}} window. The lens functions to decrease the beam divergence caused by refraction of the laser light passing through the window when the device is fired by means of a laser beam...|$|R
40|$|Since no {{generally}} accepted guidelines exist on sizing booster charges to assure functional margins in pyrotechnically actuated devices, a {{study was conducted}} to provide an approach to meet this need. An existing pyrovalve was modified from a single cartridge input to a dual-cartridge input with a booster charge. The objectives of this effort were to demonstrate an energy-based functional margin approach for sizing booster charges, and to determine booster charge energy delivery characteristics in this valve. Functional margin was demonstrated by determining the energy required to actuate the valve through weight drop tests for comparison to the energy delivered by the cartridge and booster charge in firings in the modified valve. The results of this study indicated that this energy-based approach fully met the study objectives, showing its usefulness for this and possibly <b>other</b> <b>pyrotechnic</b> devices.

40|$|A basic {{characteristic}} of the supply chain of fireworks is that most manufacturers {{are located in the}} Far East. Considering control results on tests made by CERL and INERIS on fireworks coming from this area (mainly from China), and taking into account that a new Directive has been published in 2007 in Europe for the certification of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> (including fire-works), it seems clear {{that it is necessary to}} put in place an additional system for checking and certifying the fireworks, when importers of fireworks cannot check the imported batches by themselves according to the existing or newly arriving standards. This system could be applicable to manufacturers not belonging to the European Union or to control laboratories, and can be extended to any other country wishing to improve the safety of use of fireworks. We present in this paper our views concerning such a system;- a comparison between the checking procedure applied by the Canada (CERL) – i. e. on all imported batches- and those made by France (INERIS) – i. e. on samples taken on the spot in the importers warehouses on imported fireworks from the far east, and some results- some proposals on criteria of minimal competence (qualified or accredited testing laboratory, competent people, testing equipment, testing procedures, …) to put in place in order to qualify the manufacturers exporting into Europe, or local control bodies...|$|R

5000|$|Chemicals are {{regulated}} under various laws including the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In 2010, Congress was considering {{a new law}} entitled the Safe Chemicals Act. Over the following several years, the Senate considered a number of legislative texts to amend the TSCA. These included the Safer Chemicals Act, several versions of which were introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), with the latest in 2013, and the Chemical Safety Improvement Act (S. 1009, CSIA) introduced by Senators Lautenberg and David Vitter (R-LA) in 2013. Senator Lautenberg died shortly after CSIA's introduction, and over time his mantle {{was picked up by}} Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), who continued to work with Senator Vitter on revisions to the CSIA. The result of that effort was the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, passed by the Senate on December 17, 2015. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Modernization Act of 2015 (H.R. 2576), passed the House of Representatives on June 23, 2015. Revised legislation, which resolved differences between the House and Senate versions, was forwarded to the President on June 14, 2016. [...] President Obama signed the bill into law on June 22, 2016. The Senator's widow, Bonnie Lautenberg, was present at the White House signing ceremony.
