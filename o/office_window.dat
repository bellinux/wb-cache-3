5|$|At the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph {{discover}} that the penitentiary will once again {{be used by the}} town, and remember that they forgot to disable the power. Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' <b>office</b> <b>window.</b> Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his <b>office</b> <b>window</b> as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E
5|$|Wilkes wrote a History of Oregon, Geographical and Political in 1845, {{which was}} inaccurate. Notwithstanding this, an extract {{from the work}} was {{published}} as Project for a National Railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, also in 1845. It was popular and was in its fourth edition by 1847. In 1848 and 1849, Wilkes wrote a novel, loosely based on the life and murder of Helen Jewett, a New York prostitute. The novel was first serialized in the National Police Gazette before being published as a stand-alone work in 1849, titled The Lives of Helen Jewett and Richard P. Robinson. The novel was only based on Jewett's life and death, with much embellishment. It combined {{the facts of the}} case with elements from contemporary novels of murder mysteries and seduction in the growing cities of the time. Wilkes did have access to some of Jewett's letters, which had been held by the district attorney's office since Jewett's murder in 1836 and the subsequent trial. Wilkes, who obtained the letters in 1848, also acquired the hatchet which had murdered Jewett. The letters were eventually published in the Police Gazette and even were displayed, along with the murder weapon, in the newspaper's <b>office</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E

25|$|Flicky was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} one year and was designed by Yoji Ishii in collaboration with artist Yoshiki Kawasaki. The game evolved from a simple game that Kawasaki first envisioned where the player would catch dots in a maze. He took inspiration from a popular song about sparrows on power lines from a 1970s Japanese variety show, Migoro! Tabegoro! Waraigoro!, and so made the main character a sparrow and the platforms and walls wires. However, he found the power line theme boring, and thus changed the background to an apartment building after taking inspiration from one outside his <b>office</b> <b>window.</b> Kawasaki used a poorly calibrated graphics tablet to draw all the game graphics.|$|E

From her last letter to Grainger, dated 29 April, it seems that this confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the West Coast, she jumped to her death from an <b>office</b> <b>window</b> [...] on the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City.

2500|$|Harrison's son Dhani {{says that}} the two sleeve images {{were part of a}} single large painting, which he {{discussed}} with his father after discovering it in the family home, Friar Park, in the 1990s. In Dhani's description, the green man on the front is Krause, who is controlling the Moog and ensuring that sound emanates from the right of the device, {{in the manner of a}} meat grinder. Harrison appears as a small blue smiling face below this, [...] "making the tea", while the green shape along the bottom of the image represents Jostick, one of his and Pattie Boyd's Siamese cats. In the portion used on the back of the LP, Taylor is seen flying an [...] "angry kite", which represents the aggravation that was pervasive at Apple in 1969, hence the [...] "Grapple with it" [...] message. The faces on Taylor's large wicker chair are Mal Evans and Neil Aspinall, the Beatles' longtime assistants and former road managers. Both men were frequently torn in their loyalties towards the individual Beatles, due to the dysfunction within the band during the Apple era; the cover shows Evans smiling and Aspinall wearing a frown with, in Miles' words, [...] "all the cares of Apple on his shoulders". Harrison's friend Eric Clapton is pictured with a Hendrix-style afro and in psychedelic attire, and holding a guitar. As further examples of the inharmonious atmosphere at Apple, Miles notes that, unlike the four portraits of the Beatles hanging on the office wall, a picture of an Indian yogi with the Om symbol above him is upside down, and so too is the view through the <b>office</b> <b>window</b> in the top right corner of the image.|$|E
2500|$|Sonya {{supports}} {{the creation of}} bike lanes in Erinsborough, but she faces opposition from Clive West (David Bradshaw).

Someone vandalises Sonya's vehicle, a brick is thrown through Toadie's law <b>office</b> <b>window,</b> and snakes are let loose in the street, leading Sonya to think that she is being targeted by Clive. However, it turns out Steph is the target of a stalker. Sonya offers to be a surrogate for Steph and Mark, and they agree. The surrogacy is made public by Tim Collins in a bid to force Sonya to quit as mayor. When Steph is told that she has no viable eggs, Sonya offers to donate hers. The fertilisation goes ahead, but Steph changes her mind and asks Sonya to take the morning after pill, but Sonya refuses. Days later, she learns she is pregnant. Toadie's former wife, Dee Bliss (Madeleine West) turns up in Erinsborough to reconnect with Toadie. She also introduces him to their daughter Willow (Mieke Billing-Smith). Sonya and Toadie's marriage is strained while Toadie spends time with Dee and Willow. Steph ends her relationship with Mark, and he tells Sonya that he raise the baby by himself. Sonya worries about Mark's friendship with Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta), and she threatens to keep the baby. During her second ultrasound, Sonya and Mark learn the baby is a girl, but when a possible abnormality is detected, they are advised to have an amniocentesis, which comes back clear. Sonya becomes stressed about the amount of time Toadie is spending with Dee, while he becomes jealous of her closeness with Mark.|$|E
