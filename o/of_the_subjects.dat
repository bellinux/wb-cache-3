5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice.

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} how <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> and subjectivity, in its necessary relation to <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> infinity, is envisaged in <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Jaques Derrida. His idea of deconstruction has challenged accepted notions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> giving rise to new ways <b>of</b> describing <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> knowledge and meaning. Thus his interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> in its various forms, {{have been used to}} construct a representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> which cannot be reduced to its traditional conceptualisation. <b>The</b> thesis consists <b>of</b> a series of "deconstructive" readings based on Derrida's earlier, more theoretical essays on <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> and subjectivity. This set of readings is meant both to describe <b>the</b> logical possibilities <b>of</b> thinking <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> offered by deconstruction, and to trace <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> thought that Derrida's early writings instigate. <b>The</b> thesis consists <b>of</b> an introduction which outlines the theoretical problems and approaches to thinking <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> and subjectivity. <b>The</b> main body comprises four sections, the first being a short conceptual history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> from Descartes, Kant and Hegel. The second describes <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> establishing a relation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> to an objective world, and centres on Husserl's concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phenomenological <b>subject.</b> <b>The</b> third describes <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> establishing an objective sense in relation to subjective thought, and deals with Foucault's socio-historical account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cartesian Cogito. The fourth describes <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> providing a true description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> meaning in a reading <b>of</b> Lacan. <b>The</b> thesis concludes with a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> necessary relation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> to <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> a transcendent infinity, and how this relation makes possible, and is more "original" than, traditional conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject...</b>|$|R

Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E

40|$|ANALYSIS OF LATVIAN VERBS AS A SEMANTIC SYSTEM Summary The present paper {{suggests}} <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> describing <b>the</b> meanings <b>of</b> Latvian verbs as {{a semantic}} system. Separate meanings as concrete expressions of processual indication are stated in <b>the</b> first step <b>of</b> study. <b>The</b> second step deals with <b>the</b> interrelations <b>of</b> meanings. Three basic points should be clarified here: <b>the</b> dependence <b>of</b> meaning upon <b>the</b> mode <b>of</b> cognition <b>of</b> reality; <b>the</b> relation <b>of</b> meaning to <b>the</b> time axis; {{the meaning and}} <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> situation. <b>The</b> verb meaning tota­lity as <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> qualities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> united wholeness is discussed in the third step.

5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors.

5|$|Sorabji's fugues, {{the most}} atonal of his works, {{generally}} follow traditional methods. After a subject and {{between one and}} four countersubjects have been presented in an exposition, there follows a development section in which the subject (and countersubjects, particularly in the earlier fugues) are usually developed in their original form and in inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion. The movement continues with a stretto and concludes with a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. His multi-subject fugues repeat this pattern for each subject, and combine thematic material from all expositions in the last section. The fugues are more conservative than most of his output, in that they rarely use polyrhythms. They can contain up to six subjects, and it is these that mark Sorabji's fugues as different from most others. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> are among his most unconventional melodic creations, lacking the frequent changes of direction that characterise most melodies; other subjects are possibly the longest ever conceived. This has led some people either to treat them with suspicion or to criticise them.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E
