500|$|Thompson has {{heavily criticized}} {{a number of}} video games and campaigned against their {{producers}} and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as [...] "murder simulators" [...] to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games {{and a number of}} school massacres. According to Thompson, [...] "In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers." [...] Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, [...] "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing , <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> why he doesn't get a life, {{but when it comes to}} kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain." [...] Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as [...] "Pearl Harbor 2". According to Thompson, [...] "Many parents think that stores won’t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked." ...|$|E

30|$|Since manual {{tracking}} is a labour intensive activity, software that implements parental controls may help. But {{this needs to}} be installed and appropriately configured on all devices. Some software even claims to flag potential predators alongside cyber-bullies. For example, Net Nanny [27] claims <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an “anti-predator phrase list”, perhaps similar to that of ContentBarrier [28] which apparently flags on phrases such as: “are you alone”; “believe me”; “can i see you”; “can we meet”; “come alone”. Of course, such a detection approach will only work if predators use these phrases specifically. Also, not every parent is sufficiently technologically knowledgeable to use the right software to prevent predators from gaining access to their childj and <b>one</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> about responsibility and legal liability in the event that a predator is not detected despite such software being deployed.|$|R
2500|$|According to Alfred Kazin, {{who knew}} him, Weldon Kees’s {{ambition}} {{as a poet}} knew no bounds.

Arrogant, embittered and melancholic, he waited for acclaim to come to him, but none of the three books he published in his lifetime made much of a mark.

50|$|One {{can argue}} that one title is missing here. The 1995 National No.1 Pro, {{for the fact that}} Lévêque {{actually}} had won the title based on the points total alone. The controversy involved with the title is that it went to the points runner up Gary Ellis. The actual points winner, after soundly defeating the competition in the 1995 ABA Grand National was the Frenchman, Christophe Lévêque. However, he was not awarded the title nor the automobile prize that went with it due to an obscure rule in the ABA rule book that you must be an American citizen to win the ABA No.1 Pro title. <b>One</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> why did they let him race and collect points throughout the season in the first place if this was the set rule. Despite the flagrant violation of common sense, the rule stood since, according to another ABA rule, you cannot change the rules during a race season. Consequently, Lévêque was disqualified and Ellis was rewarded the title. This non-foreigner rule was revoked almost as soon as the 1995 season ended. Lévêque however did know about the rule in advance of the Grandnationals, as did his sponsor Sunn-Chipie but raced the ABA national circuit anyway. After his non-win, Sunn-Chipie treated him as if he did win the ABA National No.1 Pro title anyway and awarded him a bonus. The ABA in removing that regulation helped open the gate for a flood of non-Americans to win the title of No.1 Pro ever since. The title of ABA National #1 Pro has been held by non US citizens six times beginning with and since the 1996 season, including twice for Lévêque, in 1998 and 1999. Ironically given its much greater international connections, the NBL National #1 Pro title has been only been in foreign hands for four times in the same time period.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a slight}} lull in the gale at this time, and the clouds broke a little, {{allowing}} occasional glimpses of moonlight to break through and tinge the foaming crests of the waves. At last the light, that had at first looked like a bright star, soon increased, and appeared like a glorious sun in the stormy sky. For a few seconds it shone intensely white and strong, then it slowly died away and disappeared; but almost before <b>one</b> could <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what <b>had</b> become of it, it returned {{in the form of}} a brilliant red sun, which also shone for a few seconds, steadily, and then, like the former, slowly died out.

60|$|Seats were ranged on the lawn, {{and when}} every <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> time <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> at everything, from Lady Rotherwood's set of emeralds, {{down to the}} choirboys' carved bracket, the house-bell was rung, and all <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take their places on the lawn, fairly shaded by house, cloister, and cedar tree, and facing the conservatory, whose steps, with the terrace, formed a kind of platform.

And so they did, the Bishop pleading the cause of missions with his wonderful native eloquence, as he stood by the chair where his father sat listening to him, as to a strain of sweet music long out of reach. Then Leonard Ward simply and bluntly told facts about the Pacific islands and islanders, that set hearts throbbing, and impelled more than one young heart to long to tread in the like course.|$|R
5000|$|Upper Silesia {{was known}} to be a poor, but heavily industrialised and {{polluted}} area. This was one of the Areas that P. G.

50|$|<b>One</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> if {{politics}} {{played a}} significant role in this decision. The majority in the government (but minority of the Regia Marina) favored development of capital ships, so allocated resources went mainly into this area, including unnecessary rebuilding of old era heavy cruisers, or extending their service, but reducing financing to scientific and technical developments, and production of ammunition. In 1935 Albatros was reclassified as a second-line ship, and was assigned to Regia Marina's naval experimental unit at La Spezia.|$|E

40|$|Habría que preguntarse si la imagen completa de Jesús que transmite nuestro autor no tiene elementos suficientes como para obligar a repensar y matizar aquella estimación negativa. Así, por ejemplo, su teología de la conciencia unvordenklich, que desea dar cuenta del acompasamiento divino al ritmo humano en el desarrollo del hombre Jesús, nos muestra una percepción de la consistencia humana y su paulatino desarrollo como destino humano libre, bien diversa de las posibles derivaciones algo monofisitas de la teología neocalcedonense. El acento descendente de la cristología balthasariana se articula con una conciencia aguda del status exinanitionis de Jesús. Y aún su discutida teología de la "inversión trinitaria" pretende mostrar a un Jesús obediente que vive y cumple paso a paso su missio sin anticipar nada en el desarrollo de su propio destino, en relación con el juego de las libertades del hombre Dios frente al Padre y frente a los hombres. En Das Ganze im Fragment hay una teología del tiempo, de la paciencia y de las edades de Jesús, temas muy {{queridos}} por el autor, que nos muestran su mirada sobre la consistencia real del hombre Jesús. Balthasar subraya también por ello el mérito de la entera existencia redentora de Jesús. <b>One</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> {{whether the}} complete image of Jesus that our author transmits wouldn´t already have sufficient elements for forcing us to rethink and nuance that negative estimation. For example, his theology of conscience, or unvordenklich, {{with which he}} desires {{to account for the}} divine measuring of the human rhythm {{in the development of the}} man Jesus, shows us a perception of human consistency and its steady development as free human destiny, rather different from the possible, somewhat monophysite derivations of neo-Chalcedonian theology. The descendent accent of Balthasarian Christology is articulated with a sharp consciousness of the status exinanitionis of Jesus. Even his controversial theology of "trinitarian inversion" attempts to show us an obedient Jesus who lives and fulfills his mission step by step without anticipating anything in the development of his own destiny, in relation to the set of freedoms of the man-God with regard to the Father and to his fellow men. In Das Ganze im Fragment there is a theology of time, of patience and of the distinct ages of Jesus, themes close to the author´s heart, that show us his perspective on the real consistency of the man Jesus. Balthasar underlines in this way, as well, the merit of Jesus´ entire redeeming existence...|$|R
