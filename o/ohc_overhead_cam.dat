50|$|The SX line {{incorporates}} many of {{the same}} technology features as other Subaru industrial engines; most notable is <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> (<b>OHC)</b> technology. <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> technology has been proven to enhance engine performance. The technology allows the intake and exhaust valves being positioned for optimum engine performance, which offers lower resistance for the air/fuel mixture flow. <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> engines also have fewer moving parts and produce less mechanical noise than competitive technologies.|$|R

50|$|All the EJ series share {{compatibility}} {{and construction}} similarity and are 16 valved engines. The EJ series {{started with the}} EJ15, a 1.5-litre (SOHC) and makes ~90 hp, then the EJ16, a 1.6-litre single <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> (SOHC). Later followed by the EJ20, a 120 hp 2.0-litre single <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> and the EJ22, a 135 hp 2.2-litre single <b>overhead</b> <b>cam.</b> The EJ20 turbocharged version was developed with dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cams,</b> as well as non-turbo DOHC engines and DOHC twin-turbos. The EJ18 and EJ20 were most popular in Europe.|$|R

50|$|This line is Subaru’s {{first to}} utilize {{chain-driven}} <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> (<b>OHC)</b> technology, {{and the first}} to utilize OHC technology in the industrial air-cooled small engine market. The significance of <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> technology is that it’s been proven to enhance engine performance. The technology allows the intake and exhaust valves being positioned for optimum engine performance, which offers lower resistance for the air/fuel mixture flow. <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> engines also have fewer moving parts and produce less mechanical noise than competitive technologies. They also offer better cooling performance to combat overheating.|$|R

50|$|A cam/rocker {{assembly}} uses {{a normal}} cam, but the roller-tip-rocker has a wheel {{on the end}} of it like that of a measuring wheel, which rolls by the use of needle bearings. Others will add roller bearings for the main pivot also. Although roller rockers are used in both pushrod and <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> engines, roller rockers for pushrod and <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> engines are considerably different in design. For pushrod engines, roller rockers employ a roller where the rocker contacts the valve stem. On the other hand, roller rockers for <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> engines employ a roller where the rocker contacts the cam. This greatly reduces frictional losses and wear compared to slipper followers (where the cam simply slides on a surface on the rocker arm). The difference between a roller rocker and a standard rocker with slipper followers on an <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> engine is analogous to the difference between roller lifters and flat tappet lifters on a pushrod engine.|$|R

50|$|Some <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> engines employ short {{rocker arms}} {{in which the}} cam lobe pushes down (rather than up) on the rocker arm to open the valve. On this type of rocker arm, the fulcrum {{is at the end}} rather than the middle, while the cam acts on the middle of the arm. The {{opposite}} end opens the valve. These types of rocker arms are particularly common on dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> motors, and are often used instead of direct tappets.|$|R
