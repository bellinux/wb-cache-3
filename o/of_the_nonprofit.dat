50|$|According to Hansmann, the “non-distribution {{constraint}} - prohibits <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> residual {{earnings to}} individuals who exercise control over the firm”. It prohibits {{those who have a}} vested interest in the organization from receiving the organization’s profit for personal gain. This constraint is a common characteristic of nonprofits, which creates less of an incentive for the organization to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consumer’s lack <b>of</b> knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>nonprofit</b> has no reason to cheat <b>the</b> consumer out <b>of</b> quality or service delivery because the organization's individuals cannot benefit directly. Therefore, the consumer is more likely to trust a nonprofit organization providing services than to trust a for-profit organization because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nonprofit’s</b> non-distribution constraint. According to Easley and O'Hara, state law stipulates that the organizations day-to-day costs should be reasonable.|$|R

500|$|The Tennessee Aquarium was {{designed}} {{to serve as a}} cornerstone for redevelopment in downtown Chattanooga by reconnecting the city with the Tennessee River.

[...] Another Lyndhurst-funded venture, the Moccasin Bend Task Force, was impaneled in 1982 by the City of Chattanooga and Hamilton County to study options for the Moccasin Bend archaeological site immediately north of the Tennessee River, but expanded its scope to cover the city's entire 22-mile riverfront.
