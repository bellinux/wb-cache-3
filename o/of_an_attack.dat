5|$|In {{the acute}} phase <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack,</b> {{administration}} of potassium will quickly restore muscle strength and prevent complications. However, caution is advised {{as the total}} amount of potassium in the body is not decreased, and it is possible for potassium levels to overshoot ("rebound hyperkalemia"); slow infusions of potassium chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced.|$|E

5|$|Urate-lowering {{measures}} {{should be}} increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300–360µmol/l (5.0–6.0mg/dl) and continue indefinitely.

5|$|Belgian plans did {{not call}} for the {{garrison}} of the fort and the attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and the garrison ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would link up with other Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{importance}} to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru and Ocean islands had been allocated a low priority for the limited military assets which were available to protect the Australia Station and both islands were undefended in December 1940. Strategic stockpiles of phosphate had been built up in Australia, however, to lessen the impact <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on the islands.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the Jewish Resistance Movement was formed, {{comprising}} several pre-existing Jewish groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most Jewish males and some females were required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members. The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants into the country from Europe. It always attempted to give prior notice <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.|$|E

5|$|Fairbanks {{received}} {{word of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor via civilian shortwave radio operators who passed the news to the U.S. Army base. More than 200 civil defense volunteers immediately signed up for work that included orchestrating a town blackout, blocking town airfields, and making emergency plans to evacuate the town in the event <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack.</b> In June 1942, the invasion of the Aleutian Islands and the bombing of Dutch Harbor intensified the war's effect on Fairbanks. Ladd Field's cold-weather testing detachment was disbanded as its soldiers were used to bolster Alaska defenses at other locations.|$|E
5|$|Freight volumes {{remained}} high {{throughout the}} following decades. In the late 1950s, the Swedish Air Force built a 32 million kroner storage area for aviation fuel at Muruvik. The terminal {{would be a}} reserve in case <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on Sweden, and the Meråker Line was {{to be used to}} transport the fuel into Sweden.

5|$|Myers {{said that}} he was working on defense {{balloons}} that could stop them in case <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> against the United States through a company in Chicago, known as the Chicago Captive Balloon Company.

5|$|The {{motion was}} {{rejected}} by 5 votes to 7 after discussions. According to Benny Morris, the arguments that were advanced not to launch the attack were: the negative international repercussions for Israel already accentuated by the recent assassination of Count Bernadotte; the consequences <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on an agreement with Abdallah; the fact that defeating the Arab Legion could provoke a British military intervention because of Britain and Jordan's common defense pact and lastly because conquering this area would add {{hundreds of thousands of}} Arab citizens to Israel.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop lines and the {{anti-tank}} islands that followed was to hold up the enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack.</b> The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks later, on April 15, the 19-year-old Marine was {{a member}} of an eight-man forward {{observer}} team which was engaged in directing artillery fire in support <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> by the infantry on Japanese positions on Motobu Peninsula. When it finally became necessary for the team to advance to the actual front lines, the officer in charge took PFC Gonsalves and one other man with him. PFC Gonsalves was acting Scout Sergeant of the team. He and the other Marine were to lay telephone lines for communication with the artillery battalion.|$|E

At Riverrun, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) unsuccessfully negotiates Sansa's request for help from the Blackfish (Clive Russell), and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) returns Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) to the castle, with Edmure commanding they throw down their arms and surrender to the Lannisters. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) learns of her impending trial, and that she {{will not be able to}} demand a trial by combat by royal decree of King Tommen Baratheon (Dean-Charles Chapman). In Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) arrives, in the midst <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on the city by the wise masters of Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis.

5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came {{under pressure from}} the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits {{in the event of an}} attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold in the event <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> at a screening of The Interview.|$|E
