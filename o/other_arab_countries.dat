5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack against Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries</b> would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with his ideology, Arafat generally {{refused to accept}} donations to his organization from major Arab governments, in order to act independently of them. He {{did not want to}} alienate them, and sought their undivided support by avoiding ideological alliances. However, to establish the groundwork for Fatah's future financial support, he enlisted contributions from the many wealthy Palestinians working in Kuwait and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar (where he met Mahmoud Abbas in 1961). These businessmen and oil workers contributed generously to the Fatah organization. Arafat continued this process in <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries,</b> such as Libya and Syria.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{signed a}} {{military}} pact with Egypt just before Israel launched {{a preemptive strike}} on Egypt to begin the Six-Day War in June 1967, where Jordan and Syria joined the war. The Arab states were defeated and Jordan {{lost control of the}} West Bank to Israel. The War of Attrition with Israel followed, which included the 1968 Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of the Jordanian Armed Forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh camp on the Jordanian border with the West Bank. Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the Israeli forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world. As a result, the time period following the battle witnessed an upsurge of support for Palestinian paramilitary elements (the fedayeen) within Jordan from <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries.</b> The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to Jordan's rule of law. In September 1970, the Jordanian army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into Lebanon, in a civil war that became known as Black September.|$|E

50|$|In {{a report}} by the Arab League, it was assumed that the main goal of this attack was to test the {{efficiency}} of what was called the United Arab Command, and see if any <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>country</b> such as Egypt or Syria would {{come to the aid of}} Jordan. The report also assumes that this battle was in preparation for the Six-Day War.|$|R
50|$|Unlike any <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>country</b> {{to which}} they fled after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Palestinian {{refugees}} in the West Bank (and on the East Bank) were given Jordanian citizenship on the same basis as existing residents. However, many of the refugees continued to live in camps and relied on UNRWA assistance for sustenance. Palestinian refugees constituted {{more than a third}} of the kingdom's population of 1.5 million.|$|R
40|$|The {{short story}} is a {{comparatively}} modern phenomenon in Kuwait; the first appeared in 1929. There have been two distinct periods {{in the history of}} the short story in Kuwait. The first was from 1947 to 1959, the second was from 1962 to 1985. During the first period, it was more of a vehicle for didactic and predicative than for literary purposes. Characterisation was elementary, plot was negatory and structure was primitive. The second period witnessed a considerable development in the genre; the short story became, in all respects, more recognisable as such. Today, the art of short story writing is practised in Kuwait in a manner indistinguishable from that of any <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>country...</b>|$|R

In a normal year, Morocco produces two-thirds of the grains (chiefly wheat, barley, and corn [...] ) needed for domestic consumption.|$|R
25|$|Egypt was {{the first}} nation to abandon boycott, doing so in 1980 after signing a peace treaty with Israel the {{previous}} year. After more or less consistently adhering {{to the practice of}} seizing cargo bound for Israel since 1950, the Straights of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba were opened to Israeli trade and Israeli cargo went unmolested {{for the first time in}} decades. Afterwards, Egypt became a convenient destination to smuggle Israeli goods into the rest of the Arab world, as Israeli goods could be legally imported into Egypt and relabeled as Egyptian for trade with <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries,</b> although the treaty led to <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries</b> becoming more suspicious of Egyptian products. By the late 1980s, Israel's counter-measures against the boycott were proving a success, and the Boycott Office estimated that between $750 million to $1 billion worth of Israeli goods, or about 10% of Israel's exports at the time, were reaching Arab markets per year.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a {{contrast}} with other Class A Mandates. By 1932 Iraq was independent, and Syria, Lebanon and Transjordan had national parliaments, Arab government officials up {{to the rank of}} minister, and substantial power in Arabs hands. In <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries</b> there were also indigenous state structures, except in some countries like Libya and Algeria, which, like Palestine, were subject to settler colonialism.|$|E
25|$|Between 1922 and 1947, {{the annual}} growth rate of the Jewish {{sector of the economy}} was 13.2%, mainly due to {{immigration}} and foreign capital, while that of the Arab was 6.5%. Per capita, these figures were 4.8% and 3.6% respectively. By 1936, the Jewish sector earned 2.6 times as much as Arabs. Compared to <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries,</b> the Palestinian Arab individuals earned slightly more.|$|E
50|$|The early {{successes of}} the {{revolution}} encouraged numerous other nationalist movements in <b>other</b> <b>Arab,</b> and African <b>countries,</b> such as Algeria, and Kenya, where there were anti-colonial rebellions against European empires.

25|$|Following the U.S. {{invasion}} of Iraq {{as part of}} the George W. Bush administration's post 9/11 foreign policy, many foreign Mujahideen joined several Sunni militant groups resisting the U.S. occupation of Iraq. A considerable part of the insurgents did not come from Iraq but instead from many <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries,</b> notably Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Among these recruits was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian national who would go on to assume the leadership of Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).|$|E

The airline serves {{a number of}} gateway cities in North America and has expanded its service to cover central and southeast Asia (Bangkok, Mumbai) and the Far East (Beijing and Hong Kong). However, El Al's inability to overfly Saudi Arabian airspace, along with that of several <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries,</b> has reduced their ability to further expand their route network in Asia. It also offers services to Johannesburg in South Africa and Zanzibar.|$|E
25|$|There are {{substantial}} numbers of immigrants from <b>other</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>countries</b> (mainly Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Egypt) and non-Arab-speaking Muslim countries. Also, recent years have seen an influx of people from Ethiopia and South East Asian countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, as well as smaller numbers of other immigrant minorities, Colombians and Brazilians (of Lebanese descent themselves). Most of these are employed as guest workers {{in the same fashion}} as Syrians and Palestinians, and entered the country to search for employment in the post-war reconstruction of Lebanon. Apart from the Palestinians, there are approximately 180,000 stateless persons in Lebanon.|$|E
