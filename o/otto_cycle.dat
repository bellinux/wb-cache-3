25|$|In 1876, Nikolaus Otto {{patented}} the <b>Otto</b> <b>cycle</b> engine. It was a {{four-stroke cycle}} gas {{internal combustion engine}} with intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes. one of Otto's more than 25 patents on this engine was later challenged and overturned {{in order to allow}} Daimler and Maybach to produce their high speed engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Otto {{developed}} a gaseous fuel, compressed charge four-stroke cycle, (also {{known as the}} <b>Otto</b> <b>Cycle)</b> engine after 14 years of effort, a system characterized by four piston strokes (intake, compression, power, and exhaust). Otto intended that his invention would replace the steam engines predominant in those years, even though his engine was still primitive and inefficient.|$|E
25|$|In a Wankel engine, the {{fuel-air}} mixture {{cannot be}} pre-stored {{because there are}} consecutive intake cycles. The engine has a 50% longer stroke duration than a reciprocating piston engine. The four <b>Otto</b> <b>cycles</b> last 1080° for a Wankel engine (three revolutions of the output shaft) versus 720° for a four-stroke reciprocating engine, but the four strokes are still the same proportion of the total.|$|R
50|$|Pulsejet {{engines are}} {{characterized}} by simplicity, low cost of construction, and high noise levels. While the thrust-to-weight ratio is excellent, thrust specific fuel consumption is very poor. The pulsejet uses the Lenoir cycle which, lacking an external compressive driver such as the <b>Otto</b> <b>cycle's</b> piston, or the Brayton cycle's compression turbine, drives compression with acoustic resonance in a tube. This limits the maximum pre-combustion pressure ratio, to around 1.2 to 1.|$|R

25|$|In {{an article}} in Motor Cycle {{magazine}} in 1914, Alfred Scott wrote that {{he was drawn to}} the two-stroke engine because he was trained on high speed steam and marine engines, and when turning his attention to gas and petrol engines the regular power strokes of the two-stroke (or Day cycle as he sometimes called it), seemed preferable to the one power stroke in four of the <b>Otto</b> <b>cycle.</b> He said this attraction to the two stroke was further enhanced by the reliable and excellent service from a two stroke engine designed by his brother (A. F. Scott M.I.M.E) and used to drive machinery in his experimental workshop.|$|E
25|$|In the Wankel engine, {{the four}} strokes of an <b>Otto</b> <b>cycle</b> piston engine {{occur in the}} space between a three-sided {{symmetric}} rotor and the inside of a housing. In each rotor of the Wankel engine, the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing surrounds a rotor which is triangular with bow-shaped flanks (often confused with a Reuleaux triangle, a three-pointed curve of constant width, but with the bulge in the middle of each side a bit more flattened). The theoretical shape of the rotor between the fixed corners {{is the result of a}} minimization of the volume of the geometric combustion chamber and a maximization of the compression ratio, respectively. The symmetric curve connecting two arbitrary apexes of the rotor is maximized in the direction of the inner housing shape with the constraint that it not touch the housing at any angle of rotation (an arc is not a solution of this optimization problem).|$|E
25|$|Stirling engines {{have a high}} {{efficiency}} compared to steam engines, being able to reach 50% efficiency. They are also capable of quiet operation and can use almost any heat source. The heat energy source is generated external to the Stirling engine rather than by internal combustion as with the <b>Otto</b> <b>cycle</b> or Diesel cycle engines. Because the Stirling engine is compatible with alternative and renewable energy sources it could become increasingly significant {{as the price of}} conventional fuels rises, and also in light of concerns such as depletion of oil supplies and climate change. This type of engine is currently generating interest as the core component of micro combined heat and power (CHP) units, in which it is more efficient and safer than a comparable steam engine. However, it has a low power-to-weight ratio, rendering it more suitable for use in static installations where space and weight are not at a premium.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} role of quantum {{statistics}} {{in the performance of}} <b>Otto</b> <b>cycles.</b> First, we show analytically that the work distributions for bosonic and fermionic working fluids are identical for cycles driven by harmonic trapping potentials. Subsequently, in the case of non-harmonic potentials, we find that the interplay between different energy level spacings and particle statistics strongly affects the performances of the engine cycle. To demonstrate this, we examine three trapping potentials which induce different (single particle) energy level spacings: monotonically decreasing with the level number, monotonically increasing, and the case in which the level spacing does not vary monotonically.

Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used.

Over the winter of 18851886 the belt drive was upgraded to a two-stage, two-speed transmission with a belt primary drive and the final drive using a ring gear on the back wheel. By 1886 the Reitwagen had served its purpose and was abandoned in favor of further development on four wheeled vehicles.|$|E

The RX 450h features an upgraded 3.5L 2GR-FXE V6 engine (shared with the RX 350) which produces [...] at 6000 rpm, along with a new inverter which boosts total horsepower to [...] (with the electric motors providing an added [...] ). The new inverter is 8kg lighter, and more efficient. Up to three electric motors {{are used in the}} hybrid system, including two dual motors for the forward wheels (123kW output), and a third for the rear wheels on the AWD model (50kW; engages when slippage is detected or the throttle pressed firmly). The RX 450h's V6 engine now runs on the Atkinson cycle for added efficiency. Compared to the prior <b>Otto</b> <b>cycle</b> system, the Atkinson cycle has a lower compression ratio, along with higher expansion ratio inside engine cylinders. This system uses less energy to form fuel-air mixtures, and releases more energy. A lighter, more free-flowing oil (0W-20) is also used, reducing friction energy loss and oil pump power requirements. Two additional systems are added to the RX 450h's Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain, an exhaust heat recovery system to reduce engine warm-up periods (optimizing engine start-stop times, particularly in cold conditions), and a cooled exhaust gas-recirculation system to reduce fuel pumping loss. The electric motors use the first automotive application of liquid cooling {{on both sides of the}} high-current transistors, allowing greater contribution from the electric motors versus the gasoline engine.|$|E

The power output and efficiency of the cycle are derived and optimized with respect to the pressure ratio of the working substance. The maximum power output and efficiency are calculated. The influence of the various design parameters on the performance of the cycle is analyzed. The optimum criteria of some important parameters such as the power output, efficiency and pressure ratio are given. Several special interesting cases are discussed. The results obtained are general, so that the optimal performance of irreversible <b>Otto</b> and Diesel <b>cycles</b> are included in two special cases of the Dual cycle and may be directly derived from that of the Dual heat engine. Moreover, the performance characteristic curves of the three heat engines are presented by using numerical examples. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Four stroke <b>Otto</b> {{refrigerator}} <b>cycles</b> with no classical analogue are studied. Extremely short {{cycle times}} {{with respect to}} the internal time scale of the working medium characterize these refrigerators. Therefore these cycles are termed sudden. The sudden cycles are characterized by the stable limit cycle which is the invariant of the global cycle propagator. During their operation the state of the working medium possesses significant coherence which is not erased in the equilibration segments due to the very short time allocated. This characteristic is reflected in a difference between the energy entropy and the Von Neumann entropy of the working medium. A classification scheme for sudden refrigerators is developed allowing simple approximations for the cooling power and coefficient of performance. Comment: 20 pages, 12 figures.
