50|$|The stadium has a {{retractable}} roof, {{built in}} a unique fan-shaped style, with the roof <b>panels</b> <b>opening</b> and <b>closing</b> simultaneously in a sweeping manner from the first- and third-base sides toward center field. The complex and massive roof was {{a significant factor in}} the $392 million cost of the stadium. It allows the seating area to be heated 30 °F warmer than the outside temperature when closed, allowing games to be played in inclement weather and in more comfortable conditions than an open-air stadium. The idea of the stadium having a retractable roof had been considered right away in the initial design, as to help counter the unpredictable Wisconsin weather in the early spring and late autumn.|$|R
50|$|Stonekeep is a first-person RPG in {{the style}} of Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master. The game is set in a series of {{underground}} labyrinths, filled with monsters, treasures and traps. The player uses the directional keys on the keyboard for movement and typing in notes in the journal and uses the mouse pointer to interact with objects and characters. The mouse pointer is usually a target indicator for aiming attacks and weapons wherever it is clicked. When the mouse pointer is moved onto a particular something it changes to another icon to indicate a different action. For example, the mouse pointer changes to an eye when the player can examine things (often signs) or the mouse pointer changes into a spread-out hand when the player can pick up items. Other mouse pointers include opening and closing chests, <b>opening</b> and <b>closing</b> <b>panels,</b> pulling levers and switches, pressing buttons, drinking water and giving items.|$|R

50|$|Synthetic {{screen media}} is used where wear life is an issue. Large {{producers}} such as mines or huge quarries {{use them to}} reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact screen media material used on the top deck of a scalper screen. To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen <b>panels,</b> slotted <b>opening</b> <b>panels</b> and diamond <b>opening</b> <b>panels.</b> Due to the 7-degree demoulding angle, polyurethane screen media users can experience granulometry changes of product during the wear life of the panel.|$|R
