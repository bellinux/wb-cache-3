The theoretical frameworks that informed this study were Epstein’s theories of overlapping spheres and her typology <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> <b>involvement,</b> as well as Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model. These frameworks provided a meaningful lens for interpreting data and making recommendations in the final chapter. The researcher undertook an extensive literature study and conducted interviews with principals, SGB chairpersons, as well as selected SGB parent members and other active and inactive parents from the selected schools in the Zeerust district. The research shows, inter alia, that parent involvement has various benefits and that it faces several challenges which affect the management thereof. Benefits concern improvement in terms of academic performance of learners, provision of teaching and learning resources, relationships between parents and the school, learner motivation and school attendance. Challenges to parent involvement that were identified were time constraints of parents, poor communication between home and school, parents’ lack of interest and commitment, principals’ limitations in terms of the management <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> <b>involvement,</b> parents’ limited education, negative parental attitudes and negative teacher attitudes.

In-depth interviews were conducted with principals and focus-group interviews were held with three teachers as well as three members of the School Governing Bodies of each of the three selected schools. The overall impression was that the extent <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> <b>involvement</b> in the education of their children was very minimal due to the inability of the School Management Teams, especially school principals, to initiate, facilitate and sustain organisational structures and management processes which would ensure the effective involvement of parents in the education of their children.

The schools serve largely minority, low-income populations and score in the top third of the Illinois State Achievement Tests. Using Epstein’s framework <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> <b>involvement,</b> we found that participants indicated a stronger tendency to participate in two of Epstein’s typologies: Type I (Parenting) and Type IV (Learning at Home). Results suggest that schools struggling with unsatisfactory student achievement may benefit from focusing parent involve-ment efforts on building parenting capacity and encouraging learning-at-home activities...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} and influences <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> <b>involvement</b> were examined {{among a group}} of children with learning disabilities (LD). One aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether different types <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> <b>involvement</b> are associated with educational benefits in special education. A second aim was to apply an existing model <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> <b>involvement</b> to assess its influences in this population. One hundred and twenty-three children with and without LD from grades 1 to 8 and their parents participated in the study. Children's grades and their attitudes to school were used as educational outcomes to evaluate the impact of their parents' involvement. Mothers and fathers completed questionnaires regarding their school, cognitive-intellectual and personal involvement, as well as measures of stress, social support, and perception of their child's academic ability. Mothers were consistently more involved than fathers in all types of activities. Higher grades were significantly correlated with mothers' involvement in school-related activities and fathers' involvement in personal activities. Fathers who felt they received a greater amount of social support tended to be more involved in their children's cognitive and personal activities. Mothers who perceived a greater amount of social support were more personally involved with their children, and mothers who perceived their children as having more severe LDs were less personally involved. Overall results extend the literature on the {{benefits and}} the factors associated with parent involvement for children with LD and highlight the need for parents, educators and school psychologists to combine resources in order to increase awareness and levels <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> <b>involvement...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{quasi-experimental}} study (based on parent self-selection) {{examines the}} effects <b>of</b> a <b>parent</b> <b>involvement</b> program on kindergarten children’s English language skills. This program was implemented as {{one component of}} a Mi-grant Even Start Family Literacy Program. The study was conducted at a rural Midwestern elementary school with 14 kindergarten children of families par-ticipating in the <b>parent</b> <b>involvement</b> training program, and 15 kindergarten children from families not participating. This study followed these children {{through the end of}} first grade. Findings indicate {{that by the end of}} first grade, children from families participating in the <b>parent</b> <b>involvement</b> training pro-gram scored significantly higher on language measures than children in the control group. This suggests that equipping migrant families with new abilities to nurture their children’s language skills leads to positive language outcomes for their children.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{descriptive}} {{study was to examine}} the perspectives of first generation Asian American <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with disabilities regarding causes, meaning of disabilities, level of educational involvement and self-advocacy in their children’s special education school programs. Using convenience sampling, 18 Asian American parents from the San Francisco Bay area participated in this study. The major findings in this study were interesting ones in that some were similar and others different from those previously reported in the past for Asian American families. First, the majority <b>of</b> the <b>parents</b> did not believe their past wrong doings caused their child’s disability. Secondly, the majority <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> reported that they relied on the help and guidance of family members, friends, and family resource agencies over their religious or spiritual community. In addition, academic achievement was still held in high regard in their families and was the responsibility and obligation of the children with disabilities to achieve it and even pursue higher education degrees. Lastly, the levels <b>of</b> <b>parent’s</b> <b>involvement</b> and self- advocacy were higher compared to previous studies. Implications for professionals working with Asian-American families and their children with disabilities are discusse...|$|R
