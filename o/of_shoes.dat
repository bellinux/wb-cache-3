5|$|A {{more mundane}} {{example is the}} {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.|$|E

The teacher, initially reluctant, relents when Kiat Kun rushes to get his cough medicine, demonstrating his running ability. As the competition begins, Kiat Kun notices that Beng Soon is also participating.|$|E
5|$|Shoe {{manufacturing}} {{improvements in}} the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> made of leather, and later synthetic materials.

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Arbroath's economy {{expanded}} {{and the population}} of the town expanded, with new housing having to be constructed to house the influx of workers. Arbroath became moderately well known for jute and sailcloth production, with 34 mills employing 1,400 looms and producing over one million yards of osnaburg cloth and 450,000yards of sailcloth in 1875. Arbroath {{is believed to be the}} source of the sails used on the Cutty Sark. In 1867, the mills in Arbroath employed 4,620 people. Arbroath was also prominent in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> and lawnmowers; local firm Alexander Shanks supplied mowers to the Old Course at St Andrews and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.|$|E
5|$|Even before Carpathia {{arrived in}} New York, efforts were getting {{underway}} {{to retrieve the}} dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 of them were buried. Memorials were raised in various places– New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others– and ceremonies were held {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of Titanics victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.|$|E
5|$|For Pokiri, Mahesh {{sported a}} longer hair style {{than in his}} {{previous}} films and shed five kilograms of weight. He used a new wardrobe and the same pair <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> throughout the film. Jagannadh wanted to cast Ayesha Takia as the female lead. Due to a last minute change, the makers opted to replace Takia and considered several actresses including Deepika Padukone. Jagannadh approached Parvati Melton to play the female lead. She declined the offer because, at that time, her parents were against her decision to become an actress. He also approached Kangana Ranaut who could not accept the role because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of her scenes in Gangster (2006). After seeing stills of Ileana D'Cruz in her Telugu debut Devadasu (2006), Jagannadh signed her as the female lead since he needed a girl who looked like a teenager {{to play the role}} of the aerobics teacher.|$|E

The ship continued calling at Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, Argentina, as late as 1927, but by 1939, West Corum had been laid up in a reserve fleet at New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|The Garden of Words is {{considered}} a romance and drama film. It opens {{at the start of}} the rainy season in Tokyo with , a 15-year-old student and aspiring shoemaker, opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. There he encounters , a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work and enjoying beer and chocolate. When she notices the school crest on his uniform, Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. After Yukari expresses an interest in Takao's shoemaking, he decides to make a pair <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> in her size. With the end of the rainy season, Takao stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.|$|E

5|$|The family's {{problems}} are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang's only pair <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> after {{taking them to}} be repaired. The children conduct a frantic search but find nothing; a karung guni man had claimed the shoes as unwanted rubbish. The Chew siblings are frustrated and rendered helpless by the situation until their father inspires Kiat Kun to share his shoes with his sister, trading off between classes so they can both attend school. Unfortunately, this plan brings additional problems: Seow Fang is chastised for wearing oversized shoes to school, while Kiat Kun is repeatedly late as he must wait for his sister to exchange shoes with him.|$|E
5|$|While burghs {{acted as}} centres of basic crafts. These {{included}} the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>shoes,</b> clothes, dishes, pots, joinery, bread and ale, which {{would normally be}} sold to inhabitants and visitors on market days. However, there were relatively few developed manufacturing industries in Scotland {{for most of this}} period. By the late fifteenth century, there were the beginnings of a native iron-casting industry, which led to the production of cannon and of the silver and goldsmithing for which the country would later be known. As a result, the most important exports were unprocessed raw materials, including wool, hides, salt, fish, animals and coal, while Scotland remained frequently short of wood, iron and, in years of bad harvests, grain, which was imported in large quantities, particularly from the Baltic ports, through Berwick and Ayr.|$|E

5|$|After Game2 {{ended on}} October 3, the Yankees and Cardinals boarded trains to St. Louis, Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis, Victor J. Miller, ordered that the workday end by three the next {{afternoon}} so that the city could welcome the Cardinals at Union Station. The Cardinals players were treated like champions by fans and citizens alike. Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000 and {{paid for by the}} city's top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals' team received a new hat, a new pair <b>of</b> <b>shoes,</b> and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer's price of $100.

5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead <b>of</b> <b>shoes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs <b>of</b> <b>shoes</b> were observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E
