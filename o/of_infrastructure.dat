40|$|A lot <b>of</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> such as {{roads and}} bridges, have been {{constructed}} to ensure our safety life and economic activities. Maintenance <b>of</b> the <b>infrastructures</b> costs huge sum of money and is getting to be serious financial problems. It is therefore quite important to develop a method which realizes a strategic decision-making of the maintenance and new constructions. This study presents a framework of risk management <b>of</b> <b>infrastructures</b> on road network. Real slopes, bridges and pavements existing in Hida area are selected as target <b>infrastructures.</b> Risks <b>of</b> each <b>infrastructure</b> are evaluated, and the optimum maintenance timing <b>of</b> each <b>infrastructure</b> is analyzed using a dynamic programming method. Finally, a trial calculation is conducted using evaluated risks. As a result, it is found the proposed framework is efficient for risk management <b>of</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} and evaluation of the potential of the electric structure of Russian regions. The authors introduce the category of the “potential of electric infrastructure” understood as the integrated indicator characterizing the regional power infrastructure. The authors assess the potential <b>of</b> electric <b>infrastructure</b> {{on the basis of the}} proposed methodology and the developed indicators: “the ratio of electricity tariff”, “coefficient of technological connection”, “integral coefficient <b>of</b> electric <b>infrastructure</b> potential. ” The article presents the results of testing the developed method on the example of the analysis and evaluation of the characteristics <b>of</b> electric power <b>infrastructure</b> <b>of</b> Russian regions. The result of testing was the construction of a rating of regions by the level <b>of</b> electric <b>infrastructure</b> potential. On the basis of the calculated parameters <b>of</b> electric <b>infrastructure</b> potential, we developed a map and a matrix of indicators of the potential <b>of</b> electric <b>infrastructure</b> <b>of</b> Russian regions. This allowed to classify Russian regions to several groups. The practical value of the map and matrix of the potential <b>of</b> electric <b>infrastructure</b> <b>of</b> Russian regions is the possibility to conduct the comparative assessment of the characteristics <b>of</b> the electric <b>infrastructure</b> <b>of</b> the territorial units and enables more informed management and decision-making concerning the choice of the most effective industrial investment. In addition, based on the developed indicators <b>of</b> electric <b>infrastructure</b> potential, the authors propose the improvement of the existing methods for the evaluation of investment potential of Russian regions. Previous research on the investment potential of regions does not take in account the characteristics of the potential <b>of</b> elecrtic <b>infrastructure.</b> The obtained results are of a theoretical and practical importance and can be used for the energy efficiency management of territorial units as well as for the analysis of the potential <b>of</b> electric <b>infrastructure</b> <b>of</b> possible industrial investments with the aim of increasing it...|$|R
