40|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{have emerged}} as novel safe and biocompatible tools for manifold applications, including biological imaging, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutics. The understanding of the mechanisms governing their interaction with living systems may help the design and development of new platforms for nanomedicine. Here we characterized the dynamics and kinetics of the events underlying the interaction of gold nanoparticles with a living organism, from the first interaction nanoparticle/cell membrane, to the intracellular trafficking and final extracellular clearance. By treating a simple water invertebrate (the cnidarian Hydra polyp) with functionalized gold nanoparticles, multiple inward and <b>outward</b> <b>routes</b> were imaged by ultrastructural analyses, including exosomes as novel undescribed carriers to shuttle the nanoparticles in and out the cells. From the time course imaging a highly dynamic picture emerged in which nanoparticles are rapidly internalized (from 30 min onward), recruited into vacuoles/endosome (24 h onward), which then fuse, compact and sort out the internalized material either to storage vacuoles or to late-endosome/lysosomes, determining almost complete clearance within 48 h from challenging. Beside classical routes, new portals of entry/exit were captured, including exosome-like structures as novel undescribed nanoparticle shuttles. The conservation of the endocytic/secretory machinery through evolution extends the value of our finding to mammalian systems providing dynamics and kinetics clues {{to take into account}} when designing nanomaterials to interface with biological entities. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

25|$|A start {{was made}} in April on {{building}} the new depot at Carter Gate (Parliament Street), with accommodation for buses, trams and trolleybuses. Trams were given eight roads, all with pits, the capacity being 80 cars. A most complicated layout of track leading to the depot was put in at same time, the intention being to build a single line for one-way traffic inward to the Market Place along Lower Parliament Street and Hockley, via Victoria Street and South Parade, the <b>outward</b> <b>route,</b> also single line and one-way traffic via Long Row and Pelham Street to Hockley. Hockley was a narrow thoroughfare that had been widened towards its junction with Lower Parliament Street, but, owing to the Corporation being unable to obtain a property higher up the street at a reasonable price, the whole scheme was later abandoned, although not before much track and pointwork had been laid. The double turnout {{at the bottom of}} Hockley had been in position for approximately six months when it was removed together with the short length of track leading to it, no car ever having run over it. Lines built in connection with the depot were along Southwell Road, with a three-way junction at Manvers Street, another three-way junction at Lower Parliament Street, and then along Lower Parliament Street to within 30 yards of Pennyfoot Street. There were trailing points from both lines into Stanhope Street, where the depot entrances were. A single line ran along Stanhope Street, with trailing junctions both ways into Manvers Street.|$|E
500|$|They {{were faced}} with two {{possible}} routes back to Cape Denison.

Or, pushing slightly {{to the south of}} their <b>outward</b> <b>route,</b> they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs.

50|$|A {{problem with}} {{expanding}} <b>routes</b> <b>outward</b> {{to include more}} rural areas of Maricopa County is determining whether there is enough interest from residents in outlying areas to justify expansion. If too few {{people are willing to}} use the services they can be costly, deterring outward expansion. One solution is to gauge interest in public transportation in these areas and, if plausible, expand current routes. If there is interest in public transportation (but not enough to justify expanding current routes), it may be feasible to create areas on the edges of town for people in outlying areas to commute and park their vehicles. Such services only exist in the inner part of the valley.|$|R
50|$|One {{dilemma in}} Phoenix’s public-transport {{system is the}} {{start-up}} costs of outward expansion and the effect it has on municipalities. While Valley Metro states that its vision is to “enable people in Maricopa County to travel with ease using safe, accessible, efficient, dependable, and integrated public transportation services”, it only covers the major cities {{toward the center of}} the valley. Towns such as Buckeye, Cave Creek and Laveen are localities in Maricopa County which are omitted from Valley Metro’s routes; people living in these areas must commute miles to the nearest bus stops in surrounding cities. This leads to inconsistency between tax revenue and service provision. To obtain a better fit between the system and the people it serves, it must expand <b>routes</b> <b>outward</b> to make its services available to a larger percentage of the population it was created to serve.|$|R

40|$|The {{middle of}} the nineteenth century has long been a {{challenge}} to researchers of ocean freight rates. The data originating from the circulars of the London shipbroker firm of Angier Brothers have been the basis of much of the early work on pre-WWI freight rate movements, including the well-known Isserlis index published in 1938. These data only extend back to 1869, however. This paper presents new ocean freight rate indices for the 1850 s using a number of previously unexplored data sources, including contemporary Norwegian and British newspapers and freight rate circulars. Monthly indices of 14 homeward trade <b>routes</b> and 14 <b>outward</b> coal freight <b>routes</b> from Britain are presented, giving new information on the cyclical movements of ocean freight rates in the 1850 s. The application of a new method of index construction to the freight rate data is suggested. This method has previously been successfully applied to construct price indices for property markets, where it is known as a ‘repeat sales index’. It is argued that this method may be applied to ocean freight rate data as well, because the property markets and the tramp shipping markets share the basic characteristics of the price information flow: prices of specific objects are usually available only at infrequent and irregular intervals...|$|R
40|$|Background: Clathrin is a {{coat protein}} {{involved}} in intracellular membrane traffic. Results: Acute inhibition of clathrin-ligand association by Pitstop® compounds perturbs intracellular receptor sorting mediated by AP- 1 and GGA adaptors. Conclusion: Clathrin {{is required for}} intracellular receptor sorting by AP- 1 and GGA adaptor proteins. Significance: Pitstop® compounds are tools for the functional dissection of intracellular trafficking pathways. Clathrin plays important roles in intracellular membrane traffic including endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins and receptors and protein sorting between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. Whether clathrin serves additional roles in receptor recycling, degradative sorting, or constitutive secretion has remained somewhat controversial. Here we have used acute pharmacological perturbation of clathrin terminal domain (TD) function to dissect the role of clathrin in intracellular membrane traffic. We report that internalization of major histocompatibility complex I (MHCI) is inhibited in cells depleted of clathrin or its major clathrin adaptor complex 2 (AP- 2), a phenotype mimicked by application of Pitstop® inhibitors of clathrin TD function. Hence, MHCI endocytosis occurs via a clathrin/AP- 2 -dependent pathway. Acute perturbation of clathrin also impairs the dynamics of intracellular clathrin/adaptor complex 1 (AP- 1) - or GGA (Golgi-localized, γ-ear-containing, Arf-binding protein) -coated structures at the TGN/endosomal interface, resulting in the peripheral dispersion of mannose 6 -phosphate receptors. By contrast, secretory traffic of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, recycling of internalized transferrin from endosomes, or degradation of EGF receptor proceeds unperturbed in cells with impaired clathrin TD function. These data indicate that clathrin {{is required for the}} function of AP- 1 - and GGA-coated carriers at the TGN but may be dispensable for <b>outward</b> traffic en <b>route</b> to the plasma membrane...|$|R
