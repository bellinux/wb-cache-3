40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{forecasting}} performance of models {{that have been}} proposed for forecasting in the presence <b>of</b> structural <b>breaks.</b> They differ in their treatment <b>of</b> the <b>break</b> process, the model applied in each regime and the out-of-sample probability <b>of</b> a <b>break.</b> In an extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the presence <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> and their importance for forecasting. We find no single model that consistently works best in the presence <b>of</b> <b>breaks.</b> In many cases, the formal modeling <b>of</b> the <b>break</b> process is important in achieving a good forecast performance. However, there are also many cases where rolling window forecasts perform well...|$|R
40|$|Office {{workers are}} {{commonly}} targeted in interventions {{to modify their}} sitting behaviour, yet there is limited evidence of the correlates <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> in sitting to inform intervention development. This study identifies the individual, workplace and spatial configuration correlates of the frequency <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> in sitting (number/hour) in office workers (n = 5531) stratified by office type (private-enclosed, shared, open plan). All behaviours and potential correlates were measured via self-report using an online cross-sectional survey. Regression analyses revealed age was the only socio-demographic characteristic associated with frequency <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> in sitting in all office types. Greater job autonomy and local connectivity were positively associated with frequency <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> in sitting in shared and open-plan offices. In open-plan offices co-worker proximity was negatively associated with frequency <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> in sitting. Co-worker visibility was positively associated with frequency <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> in sitting in all office types. This study demonstrates that individual, workplace and spatial configuration factors are all associated with the frequency <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> in sitting and that these relationships differ by office type. These observations extend prior studies that have only examined correlates at a single level (e. g. the individual). This evidence could be useful to guide future interventions {{in the design of}} workplaces to increase breaks in sitting and workers physical activity...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurpose: To {{evaluate}} the incidence and characteristics <b>of</b> iatrogenic retinal <b>breaks</b> in 20 -gauge macular surgery with an intensified search strategy. Design: Retrospective, non-comparative interventional case series. Participants: 218 consecutive operations in 209 patients who underwent 20 -gauge vitrectomy vitrectomy for idiopathic macular pucker or idiopathic macular hole. Methods: Retrospective review of patient records undergoing 20 -gauge vitrectomy with intensified peripheral search for retinal defects. Main outcome measures: Incidence <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> {{related to the}} sclerotomies, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> occurring elsewhere, the incidence of lesions suspicious for traction, the location <b>of</b> identified <b>breaks</b> and intraoperative induction of posterior vitreous detachment. Results: Retinal breaks occurred in 24. 3 % of operations. In 17. 4 % breaks {{were related to the}} sclerotomies and in 9. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> were found elsewhere. In 6. 4 % of eyes, only lesions suspicious for traction were detected. Retinal detachment occurred in 1. 8 % of cases. The occurrence <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> was significantly related to induction of PVD. Conclusions: With intensified intraoperative search, a much higher incidence <b>of</b> retinal <b>breaks</b> was found than previously reported in the literature. Despite the high incidence <b>of</b> <b>breaks,</b> the incidence <b>of</b> postoperative rhegmatogenous retinal detachment was low. These findings support the rationale that intensive intraoperative search for iatrogenic breaks is crucial for the prevention of postoperative retinal detachments in macular surgery...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the consistency <b>of</b> trend <b>break</b> point estimators {{when the number}} <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> is underspecified. The consistency <b>of</b> <b>break</b> point estimators in a simple location model with level shifts {{has been well documented}} by researchers under various settings, including extensions such as allowing a time trend in the model. Despite the consistency <b>of</b> <b>break</b> point estimators <b>of</b> level shifts, there are few papers on the consistency <b>of</b> trend shift <b>break</b> point estimators in the presence <b>of</b> an underspecified <b>break</b> number. The simulation study and asymptotic analysis in this paper show that the trend shift break point estimator does not converge to the true break points when the break number is underspecified. In the case of two trend shifts, the inconsistency problem worsens if the magnitudes <b>of</b> the <b>breaks</b> are similar and the breaks are either both positive or both negative. The limiting distribution for the trend break point estimator is developed and closely approximates the finite sample performance...|$|R

Goals of the reaserch: Main goal of this essay is to discover how the effectivness <b>of</b> the fast <b>breaks</b> influence the outcome of the top class handball matches during the most important tournaments (ME, MS). Second goal is to discover if there is a link between effectivness <b>of</b> the fast <b>break</b> (or portion <b>of</b> the fast <b>breaks</b> from the total <b>of</b> <b>breaks)</b> and final place scored on the previously mentioned tournaments. Methods: Statistic analysis, ratio <b>of</b> fast <b>breaks,</b> comparism <b>of</b> the ratios Results: It was discovered, the teams with greater efficiency <b>of</b> the fast <b>breaks</b> took better places, in the sample of the reaserched tournaments, than the teams with lesser efficiency <b>of</b> the fast <b>breaks.</b> Teams that won the match used more fast breaks and with greater efficiency than teams that lost.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that a series can contain an unknown number <b>of</b> smooth <b>breaks</b> raises two distinct problems. First, even if the breaks are sharp, the number <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> and the break dates themselves are generally unknown {{and need to be}} estimated along with the other parameters of the model. Second, even if the number <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> is known, the possibility <b>of</b> a smooth <b>break</b> means that the functional form <b>of</b> the <b>break</b> is unknown to the researcher. A misspecification of the functional form <b>of</b> the <b>breaks</b> may be as problematic as ignoring the breaks altogether. Moreover, ever if a series contains no breaks, it may be subject to other nonlinearities or parameter instabilities. We summarize a number of papers that use a variant of Gallant’s (1981) Flexible Fourier Form to control for the unknown number and form <b>of</b> the <b>breaks.</b> The paper details and illustrates several unit root tests, stationarity tests, and tests for parameter instability that are based on a Fourier approximation...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} non-normality {{typically}} observed in daily stock-market returns could arise {{because of the}} joint existence <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> and GARCH effects.

The findings suggest that a substantial element of the observed deviations from normality might indeed {{be due to the}} co-existence <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> and GARCH effects. However, the presence of structural changes is found to be the primary reason for the non-normality and not the GARCH effects. Also, there is still some remaining excess kurtosis that is unlikely to be linked to the specification of the conditional volatility or the presence <b>of</b> <b>breaks.</b> Finally, an interesting sideline result implies that GARCH models have limited capacity in forecasting stock-market volatility. stock returns, OECD countries, non-normality, breaks, GARCH,...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} the problem <b>of</b> detecting <b>break</b> points for a nonstationary time series. Specifically, the time series {{is assumed to}} follow a parametric nonlinear time-series model in which the parameters may change values at fixed times. In this formulation, the number and locations <b>of</b> the <b>break</b> points are assumed unknown. The minimum description length (MDL) {{is used as a}} criterion for estimating the number <b>of</b> <b>break</b> points, the locations <b>of</b> <b>break</b> points and the parametric model in each segment. The best segmentation found by minimizing MDL is obtained using a genetic algorithm. The implementation of this approach is illustrated using generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (GARCH) models, stochastic volatility models and generalized state-space models as the parametric model for the segments. Empirical results show good performance of the estimates of the number <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> and their locations for these various models. Copyright 2008 The Authors.

The 125 I atom was located in the C 5 position of a single cytosine residue of an oligonucleotide designed to form a triple helix with the target sequence duplex. The majority <b>of</b> the <b>breaks</b> (90 %) are located within 10 bp around the decay site. The addition of the free radical scavenger DMSO produces an insignificant effect on the yield and distribution <b>of</b> the <b>breaks.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} majority <b>of</b> these <b>breaks</b> are produced by the direct action of radiation and are not mediated by diffusible free radicals. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> in the purine strand was two times higher that in the pyrimidine strand. This asymmetry in the yield <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> correlates with the geometry of this type of triplex; the C 5 of the cytosine in the third strand is closer to the sugar-phosphate backbone of the purine strand. Moreover, study of molecular models shows that the yield <b>of</b> <b>breaks</b> at individual bases correlates with distance from the 125 I decay site.
