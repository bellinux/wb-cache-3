40|$|The {{majority}} of analysis of hydraulically rough <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows</b> {{has been founded}} on the temporally-averaged momentum equations (RANS).   However, the structure of shallow <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows</b> over hydraulically rough beds, together with the near-bed region of deeper <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows</b> with rough beds awaits clarification.   The purpose of this project was to conduct an extensive programme of laboratory-based experiments to gauge {{the applicability of the}} double-averaged momentum equations for shallow <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows</b> over simple rough beds (transverse square bars with varying centre-to-centre pitch).   Proper assessment of the double-averaged equations requires comprehensive measurement of fluid velocities.   Therefore, detailed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements have been obtained of the streamwise and bed-normal velocity components, including their variation in both temporal and spatial domains. The results show that double-averaging is a powerful tool for the analysis of hydraulically rough flows.   For a range of isolated flow types, the vertical distribution of the double-averaged streamwise velocity follows a linear trend between bars.   Quadrant analysis has been applied to the spatial, rather than temporal, fluctuations of velocity components for the first time, and double-averaging analysis has revealed areas of intense local momentum transfer despite negligible global momentum exchange over the averaging window.   This thesis also reports the discovery of an instability at the transition between wake interference and isolated roughness flows at which the overall properties of the flow are dramatically altered.

Turbulence measurements in fluids have been made with varying degrees of success, but only recently have measurements of turbulence in water been made with any degree of reliability. This recent improvement is due to the development of hot-film anemometry, which has given the researcher a tool for studying the structure of turbulence in <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows.</b> The fine spatial resolution (due to the small size of the sensor) and the good frequency response of the hot-film anemometer system are unmatched by any other system now available for making turbulence measurements in <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows.</b> This report describes the statistical turbulence characteristics that best define the structure of the flow field and the relation between the characteristics and the equations of motion and energy. A detailed description of instrumentation, sensor selection, and theory of operation is presented along with a discussion of calibration characteristics, heat-transfer relations, hot-film and hot-wire measurements, and possible sources of errors in turbulence measurements. The report explains in detail a procedure to circumvent contamination problems so that measurements can be made in natural rivers and streams; it also presents a mathematical and experimental justification for the procedure. Aspects of analog and digital data reduction are discussed along with some guidelines to insure meaningful measurement of turbulence characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{in the ocean}} are driven by suspended sediment. Yet results from surveys of the modern sea floor and turbidite outcrops indicate that {{they are capable of}} transporting as bedload and depositing particles as coarse as cobble sizes. While bedload cannot drive turbidity currents, it can strongly influence the nature of the deposits they emplace. This paper reports on the first set of experiments which focus on bedload transport of granular material by density underflows. These underflows include saline density flows, hybrid saline/turbidity currents and a pure turbidity current. The use of dissolved salt is a surrogate for suspended mud which is so fine that it does not settle out readily. Thus, all the currents can be considered to be model turbidity currents. The data cover four bed conditions: plane bed, dunes, upstream-migrating antidunes and downstream-migrating antidunes. The bedload transport relation obtained from the data is very similar to those obtained for <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows</b> and, in fact, is fitted well by an existing relation determined for <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows.</b> In the case of dunes and downstream-migrating antidunes, for which flow separation on the lee sides was observed, form drag falls in a range that is similar to that due to dunes in sand-bed rivers. This form drag can be removed from the total bed shear stress using an existing relation developed for rivers. Once this form drag is subtracted, the bedload data for these cases collapse to follow the same relation as for plane beds and upstream-migrating antidunes, for which no flow separation was observed. A relation for flow resistance developed for <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows</b> agrees well with the data when adapted to density underflows. Comparison of the data with a regime diagram for field-scale sand-bed rivers at bankfull flow and field-scale measurements of turbidity currents at Monterey Submarine Canyon, together with Shields number and densimetric Froude number similarity analyses, provide strong evidence that the experimental relations apply at field scale as well...|$|R

Clear signatures of this intriguing phenomenon are observed {{for a range}} of stabilities. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of intermittency are found to be strongly stability dependent. In general, the bursting events are much more frequent near the bottom wall than in the upper-channel region. A steady coexistence of laminar and turbulent flows is detected at various horizontal planes in very stable cases. This spatially intermittent pattern is found to propagate downstream and strongly correlate with the temporal evolution of intermittency. Lastly, a long standing hypothesis by Blackadar (1979), i. e., the strong connection between local stability and intermittent turbulence, is corroborated by this modeling study...|$|R

40|$|In 1946, Vedernikov {{developed}} a stability criterion for uniform flow in open channels. A global parameter proposed by Vedernikov {{has been widely}} accepted {{as a measure of}} flow stability. Recognizing the significance {{of the role of the}} parameter playing in the stability of <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows,</b> hydraulicians have thenceforth called it the Vedernikov number. Alternatively, the Vedernikov number may be considered as an extended form of the Froude number because it equals the Froude number mUltiplied by an exponent of the hydraulic radius in the uniform-flow formula and a shape factor of channel section. A stability criterion can thus be formulated using the Vedernikov number as follows: When the Vedernikov number exceeds unity, disturbances created in the flow will amplify, but when it is less than unity, some (not all) disturbances will attenuate. The specific state of flow with Vedernikov 2 ̆ 7 s number equal to unity thus represents a limiting case of neutral stability. The Froude number corresponds to this neutral stability may be referred to as the stability limit for the Froude number (or often called the critical Froude number). Therefore, if the Froude number instead of the Vedernikov number is used in the stability criterion, the stability limit for the Froude number that has yet to be determined from the expression of the Vedernikov number replaces Vedernikov 2 ̆ 7 s unity. There are numerous ways to derive the stability criterion using either the Vedernikov number or the Froude number. In either case, the stability criterion can vary with the absolute velocity of disturbance waves, which in turn depends on the velocity distribution of flow in channels. This paper is aimed to compare the existing methods in the formulation of the stability criterion, thereby assessing the importance of the role that the velocity distribution plays in the stability of <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

40|$|The self-aeration of high {{velocity}} <b>open-channel</b> <b>flows</b> {{is attributed to}} {{the interaction between the}} turbulent flow and the liquid free surface. In addition to self-aeration, drops are ejected out of the bulk liquid. It is often proposed that the drops are separated from the bulk by transverse velocity fluctuations. Drops falling back into the liquid later have been suggested to provide a possible mechanism of air entrainment. These ideas have led to the formulation of critical conditions for the inception of self-aeration. It will be shown that the conventional concepts of drop formation are inadequate to explain the ejection of drops to the heights that were observed in experiments. Furthermore, the energy of ejected drops is not sufficiently high for air entrainment. Critical conditions of self-entrainment that were previously derived are, therefore, invalid...|$|R
