5|$|The range {{along the}} western curtain wall dates from about 1480, when the fourth earl remodelled the bailey. The great hall was the social hub of the castle, where the {{household}} gathered to eat. The now-ruined 15th-century building replaced an earlier hall on the same site, dating from about 1200, {{although some of the}} stone dates from the mid 12thcentury. The earl would have entered from the south from his connecting private chambers, and people of lower status through the Lion Tower. Internally, it was split into two aisles of differing width. Both halls were heated by open hearths, two of which survive from the earlier hall. <b>Opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the hall were for <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the social scale within the castle. The high end (next to the withdrawing chamber) was for the earl and his family, and the low end (next to the kitchen and other service rooms) {{for the rest of the}} household. In the medieval period, the great hall was richly decorated with tapestries.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} {{competing}} in the Scottish First Division {{at the time of}} the final and despite being ranked at <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the league table, St Johnstone in third and Dunfermline in ninth, both teams were in relatively bad form. St Johnstone had drawn seven games from thirteen and were nine points behind second placed Dundee; whilst Dunfermline had won only three games in thirteen and were two points off the bottom of the table. The match was the first time the clubs had met in the Challenge Cup, however, they had already played each other twice in the season in the First Division; both matches ended in 0–0 draws.|$|E

5|$|On {{their return}} to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace (the former Baryatinsky mansion) at 46 Sergievskaya Street (today Tchaikovsky Street), Saint Petersburg. The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms at <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was given}} {{command of the}} Right Wing of the Army of the Potomac (the I Corps and his own IX Corps) {{at the start of}} the Maryland Campaign for the Battle of South Mountain, but McClellan {{separated}} the two corps at the Battle of Antietam, placing them on <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the Union battle line and returning Burnside to command of just the IX Corps. Burnside implicitly refused to give up his authority, and acted as though the corps commander was first Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno (killed at South Mountain) and then Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox, funneling orders through them to the corps. This cumbersome arrangement contributed to his slowness in attacking and crossing what is now called Burnside's Bridge on the southern flank of the Union line.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was in discussions with the Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage. Most saliently, the requirement that trains be able to split within the tunnel and each part of the train be driven out to <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> has been removed. However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was not passed. Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could have entered the market at the timetable change in December 2012. This, however, did not happen.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Parma's artillery pounded at {{the walls}} for 3hours with iron cannonballs weighing 30–50 pounds; in total, his artillery fired more than 2700rounds. The Spanish made several attempts to storm the city, each repelled by Cloedt's 1600soldiers. The ninth assault breached the outer wall. The Spanish and Italian forces entered the town from <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> and met in the middle. Cloedt, gravely injured (his leg was reportedly almost ripped off and he had five other serious wounds), had been carried into the town. Parma's troops discovered Cloedt, being nursed by {{his wife and his}} sister. Although Parma was inclined to honor the garrison commander with a soldier's death by sword, Ernst demanded his immediate execution. The dying man was hanged from the window, with several other officers in his force.|$|E
5|$|While the river, its valley, and {{the rail}} line proceed south from North Cohocton, NY21 {{turns to the}} northeast, {{ascending}} out of the valley and finally crossing the county line, at this point bordering Ontario County. The route meanders across another area of hilly, undeveloped terrain {{to the village of}} Naples, home to the north end of NY53 and the south end of NY245. NY21 meets the two routes at <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the community, with NY53 terminating south of the village center and NY245 beginning to its north. Naples also serves as NY21's entrance to the Finger Lakes region; the village itself is located in the southernmost part of the Canandaigua Lake valley.|$|E

Stanlistening to the action from her houseleaves the place by car, following which she and her boyfriend are presented sitting at <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of a bed. The singer is eventually left by the male alone in the room, with him being shown entering a supermarket while Stan lays on the ground near a piano. Later, he gets back to her house again, but Stan closes the door in his face. Subsequently, she is portrayed traveling with a red car previously shown in the beginning, arriving at an old vehicle and holding a bird on her arm. Over {{the rest of the}} music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and playing the piano in her room.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh {{used their}} {{personal}} wealth to fund expeditions each summer, then spent the winter publishing their discoveries. Small armies of fossil hunters in mule-drawn wagons or on trains were soon sending literally tons of fossils back east. The paleontological digs lasted fifteen years, from 1877 to 1892. The workers for both Cope and Marsh suffered hardships {{related to the}} weather, as well as sabotage and obstruction by the other scientist's workers. Reed was locked out of the Como train station by Carlin, {{and was forced to}} haul the bones down the bluff and crate the specimens on the train platform in the bitter cold. Cope directed Carlin to set up his own quarry in Como Bluff, while Marsh sent Reed to spy on his former friend. As Reed's Quarry #4 dried up, Marsh ordered Reed to clear out the bone fragments from the other quarries. Reed reported he had destroyed all the remaining bones to keep them away from Cope. Concerned that strangers were encroaching on Reed's quarries, Marsh sent Lakes to Como to assist in excavations, and in June 1879 visited Como himself. Cope likewise toured his own quarries in August. Although Marsh's men continued to open new quarries and discover more fossils, relations between Lakes and Reed soured, with each offering his resignation in August. Marsh attempted to placate the two by sending each to <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the quarries, but after being forced to abandon one bone quarry in a freezing blizzard, Lakes submitted his resignation and returned to teaching in 1880. The departure of Lakes did not ease tensions among Marsh's men; Lake's replacement, a railroad man named Kennedy, felt {{he did not have to}} report to Reed, and the fighting between the two caused Marsh's other workers to quit. Marsh tried separating Kennedy and Reed, and sent Williston's brother Frank to Como in an effort to keep the peace. Frank Williston ended up leaving Marsh's employ and taking up residence with Carlin. Cope's own digging in Como began faltering, and Carlin's replacements soon quit work altogether.|$|E
5|$|Members are {{arranged}} in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are {{taken up by the}} Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the spectrum do still face each other. With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited {{in the same manner as}} the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.|$|E
