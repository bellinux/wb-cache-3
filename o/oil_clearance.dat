40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the influence of (i) protein type, (ii) protein content, and (iii) viscosity of o/w emulsions on the deposition and clearance of oral oil coatings and after-feel perception. Oil fraction (moil/cm 2 tongue) and after-feel perception differed considerably between emulsions which do not flocculate under in mouth conditions (Na-caseinate) and emulsions which flocculate under in mouth conditions (lysozyme). The irreversible flocculation of lysozyme stabilized emulsions caused slower <b>oil</b> <b>clearance</b> from the tongue surface compared to emulsions stabilized with Na-caseinate. Protein content had a negative relation with oil fraction for lysozyme stabilized emulsions and no relation for Na-caseinate stabilized emulsions immediately after expectoration. Viscosity differences did not affect oil fraction, although the presence of thickener decreased deposition of oil on tongue. We conclude that after-feel perception of o/w emulsions is complex and depends on the deposited oil fraction, the behavior of proteins in mouth, and thickeners...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{coatings}} are residues of {{food and}} beverages that coat the oral mucosa after consumption. Several studies have reported on the lubrication properties in mouth, and the after-feel and after-taste impact of oral coatings. Further, oral coatings have been suggested to influence subsequent taste perception. Although {{it is well known}} that oral coatings can influence sensory perception, there was little information available on the chemical composition and physical properties of oral coatings. As such, the aim of this thesis was to understand which factors influence the composition of oral coatings and their sensory perception. This study started with the development of an appropriate calibration method for an already described methodology to quantify oil oral coatings: in vivo fluorescence. Further, the samples studied were shifted from pure oil (used on previous studies) to a more realistic food beverage: o/w emulsions. Pig´s tongues are known to be a good model of human tongue. As such, Chapter 2 used pig´s tongues on the calibration of the method, to mimic the fluorescence in mouth of oil coatings. On chapter 2, Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy images showed that stable o/w emulsions (1 - 20 % (w/w)) stabilised by Na-caseinate created individual oil droplets on the surface of the pigs tongue, as such a new descriptor for oil coatings was developed. Oil fraction, i. e. mass of oil per surface area of the tongue, was shown to be higher on the back compared to the front anterior part of the tongue. This is thought to be due to the morphology of the tongue and abrasion of the oil coating owed to the rubbing with the palate. Further, in vivo measurements showed that oil fraction deposited on the tongue increased linearly with oil content of o/w emulsions. Coating clearance from the tongue was a fast process with around 60 % of the oil being removed on the first 45 s. After-feel perception (Fatty Film and Flavour Intensity) was shown to be semi-logarithmic related to oil fraction on the tongue. Chapter 3, further investigated different properties of 10 % (w/w) o/w emulsions that influence the oil fraction deposited on the tongue, its clearance and after-feel perception. Three different properties were studied: protein type, protein content and viscosity of the o/w emulsions. To study the influence of protein type, two different proteins which behave differently in-mouth were studied: Na-caseinate - creates emulsions which do not flocculate under in mouth conditions, and lysozyme – creates emulsions which flocculate under in mouth conditions. To study the influence of protein content, three concentrations of Na-caseinate and lysozyme were used (0. 2, 3, 5. 8 % (w/w) all in excess to stabilize the water/oil interface). To study the influence of viscosity of o/w emulsions, three o/w emulsions stabilized with 3 % (w/w) Na-caseinate were thickened with varying concentrations of xanthan gum (0 - 0. 5 %) (w/w). Generally, the irreversible flocculation of lysozyme stabilized emulsions with saliva did not create a significant difference on oil deposition compared to emulsions stabilized with Na-caseinate, immediately after expectoration of the emulsions. Nevertheless, lysozyme stabilised emulsions caused slower <b>oil</b> <b>clearance</b> from the tongue surface compared to emulsions stabilized with Na-caseinate. Protein content had a negative relation with oil fraction on the tongue for lysozyme stabilized emulsions and no relation for Na-caseinate stabilized emulsions. The presence of thickener decreased deposition of oil on tongue, although viscosity differences (i. e., thickener content) did not affect oil fraction. After-feel perception of creaminess and fatty-film was strongly influenced by the presence of thickener likely due to lubrication in-mouth, i. e., the higher the concentration of thickener in the emulsions the stronger was the perception. Oral coatings perception was further influenced by the protein used in the emulsions, with Na-caseinate stabilised emulsions creating coatings with higher perception on creaminess and fatty-film. Chapter 2 and chapter 3 provided knowledge on the deposition and clearance of oil coatings, but little was known on the formation of oil coatings. Chapter 4 focused on the formation of oil coatings formed by Na-caseinate stabilised o/w emulsions (1 - 20 % (w/w)). The formation of oil coatings was a rapid process, where the maximum oil deposition was achieved at normal drinking behaviour (~ 3 s). Further, in Chapter 4 we investigated the hypothesis often referred on literature, in which oil coatings form a physical barrier which prevents tastants to reach the taste buds, and thus create a reduction on taste perception. It was concluded that oil coatings formed by emulsions within one sip did not affect subsequent sweetness perception of sucrose solutions. We suggested that the oil droplets deposited on the tongue (as seen on chapter 2) did not form a hydrophobic barrier that is sufficient to reduce the accessibility of sucrose to the taste buds and consequently does not suppress taste perception. Previous chapters focused on oral coatings formed by liquid o/w emulsions, however studies describing oral coatings formed by semi-solids and solids are scarce. As such, chapter 5 focused on the formation, clearance and sensory perception of fat coatings from emulsion-filled gels. Four emulsion-filled gelatin gels varying in fat content and type of emulsifier (whey protein isolate - created fat droplets bound to matrix; tween 20 - created fat droplets unbound to matrix) were studied. As in for oil coatings formed by liquid o/w emulsions, fat coatings formed by emulsion-filled gels reach their maximum deposition in the first seconds of mastication. This suggests that the first bites are the most relevant for the formation of fat coatings on the tongue. Further, fat fraction deposited on tongue increased when oral processing time of the gels increased. This trend was clearer for gels with higher fat content (15 %) compared to gels with lower fat content (5 %). Fatty perception increased with increasing mastication time, and decreased after expectoration with increasing clearance time. Fat fraction deposited on tongue and fatty perception are higher in gels with unbound droplets compared to bound droplets, as well as in gels with 15 % fat compared to 5 % fat. To elucidate the role of protein on oral coatings, Chapter 6 focused on the development of a method to quantify protein in the oral coatings. Further, Chapter 6 studied the influence of protein content, in-mouth protein behaviour (lysozyme - protein which creates flocs with saliva vs. Na-Caseinate - protein which does not create flocs with saliva) and presence of thickener on the formation of protein oral coatings and sensory perception of protein coatings. Protein coatings were collected from the front and middle part of the anterior tongue using cotton swabs after subjects orally processed protein solutions for different time periods. Protein concentration of the coating (mass protein/mass coating) was quantified with the Lowry method. Similarly to oil/fat coatings, results show protein coatings are formed rapidly, reaching maximum deposition on the first seconds of the samples´ oral processing. Further, different protein in mouth-behaviour (Na-caseinate vs. lysozyme) did not create differences on protein deposition on the tongue. Presence of xanthan-gum in the processed samples decreased protein deposition on the tongue, compared to when samples without xanthan-gum were processed. The perception of protein coatings was strongly influenced by the viscosity and protein used in the samples. Higher viscosity of the samples lead to higher intensity on creaminess and thickness. Lysozyme samples created coatings with high sweetness and astringent intensity, which is related to the molecular structure of the protein. Changes in the viscosity of beverages can cause changes in thickness perception. The changes in thickness perception can be accompanied by differences in other sensory properties, such as sweetness and creaminess which might be undesirable when reformulating beverages or developing new products. Knowledge on the differences by which viscosity of beverages can be modified to create a difference in sensory perception is currently lacking. Chapter 7 focus on the determination of the Just Noticeable Difference (the minimal difference that can be detected between two stimuli) for thickness perception of beverages. Oral thickness sensitivity (K= 0. 26) was found to be comparable to literature values for kinesthetic food firmness and spreadability, creaminess, sourness and bitterness perception. The aim of this thesis was to determine and characterize factors influencing oral coatings and their sensory perception. For this purpose, reliable methods to quantify oil and protein deposited on the tongue had to be developed to later study the macronutrients deposition. Further, the influence of stimulus properties on the formation and clearance dynamics of oral coatings and their impact on sensory perception were investigated.  ...|$|E

40|$|LectureAnnular {{clearance}} spaces, such as impeller wearing rings, inter 0 stage {{bushes and}} balance drums in centrifugal pumps, or the fluid-filled clearance around the armature of the submerged motor, at a first glance present {{the appearance of}} very weak journal bearings. The fluid has very low viscosity compared with lubricating <b>oils,</b> and <b>clearances</b> are much larger than in proper journal bearings. Two factors invalidate this deceptive view. Firstly, the Reynold numbers of flows in these spaces are very high, rendering flows turbulent. This greatly increases effective viscosities. Secondly, fluid inertia effects not normally encountered in journal bearings and become basic determining factors of the bearing forces raised by internal clearances of the type indicated. In clearance spaces of centrifugal pumps, the high pressure differences across the clearance spaces bring about a sudden pressure drop owing to acceleration into the space. This converts the clearance space into a powerful hydrostatic bearing. As the journal rotates and vibrates, damping and crossing coupling forces are developed as well as radial stiffness. Here, fluid inertia is significant only in the entry loss effect which controls hydrostatic stiffness. In the submerged motor, where the fine clearance surrounds a large length of shaft, fluid inertia effects in the clearance space itself become dominant. Both types of clearance space alter the synchronous response and stability limits of the rotor (beyond recognition), {{as compared with the}} performance in air. In centrifugal pumps, generally, the internal clearances both raise and damp critical speeds and improve stability margins. There are, however, special circumstances where these clearances become destabilizing elements. In submerged motors, critical speeds are substantially reduced and damped, and the type of destabilization normally associated with circular journal bearings may be encountered. The paper explains these phenomena and illustrates them with simple calculations...|$|R
40|$|Fluid flow in {{bearings}} and seals, {{set in motion}} by shaft rotation, generates dynamic forces which may result in a well recognized instability known as whirl and whip. These are lateral, forward precessional, self excited, subsynchronous vibrations in which the amplitude may vary from very small to nearly the limit of the bearing or seal <b>clearances.</b> <b>Oil</b> whirl in lubricated bearings, in particular, typically occurs at somewhat less than half rotative speed. As the rotative speed increases, the frequency relationship remains constant until the whirl frequency approaches the first balance resonance. Now the whirl is smoothly replaced by whip at a nearly constant frequency asymptotically approaching first balance resonance, independent of increasing rotative speed. Changes in bearing/seal radial loading can permit, prevent, or eliminate this instability. The oil whirl/whip rig demonstrates the effects of fluid dynamic forces generated by the rotating shaft. At low rotative speeds, this produces changes of the journal static equilibrium position within the bearing. The demonstrator shows the relationship between any load direction and the average journal equilibrium position. At higher rotative speeds, the instability threshold is observed as a function of unidirectional radial load, unbalance, and rotor configuration...|$|R

The paper attempts to remove the difficulty of selecting the weighting factor in multiobjective journal bearing optimization problems.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{assess whether}} fish oil-induced {{alterations}} in low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) composition have distinct and important effects on LDL metabolism, we evaluated LDL kinetic behavior in cynomolgus macaques fed an atherogenic diet supplemented with either fish oil (1. 6 g n- 3 fatty acids; n = 10) or olive oil (n = 9) for 6 mo. LDL from monkeys supplemented with fish oil or olive oil was isolated, labeled with either 1251 or and simultaneously reinjected {{so that each}} monkey received its own (autologous injection) and donor (homologous injection) LDL. For LDL injected autologously (monkeys that received their own LDL), the LDL fractional clearance rate (FCR) was reduced in fish oil-supplemented monkeys compared with the olive oilsupplemented controls (0. 42 ± 0. 03 compared with 0. 56 ± 0. 05 pools/d, P = 0. 04). The cholesteryl ester content of fish oil LDL increased compared with olive oil LDL (43 ± 2 % and 36 ± 3 %, respectively, P = 0. 03), and the LDL cholesteryl ester content was strongly correlated with autologous LDL clearance (r =- 0. 76, P = 0. 0001). Compared with olive oil LDL, fish oil LDL had a reduced dissociation constant (KD) for binding to the LDL receptor in vitro (KD for fish oil LDL compared with olive oil LDL: 13. 9 ± 1. 8 and 7. 4 ± 1. 0 mg LDL proteinlL, P = 0. 03). When both fish oil LDL and olive oil LDL were simultaneously injected into fish oil-supplemented monkeys, the FCR of fish oil LDL was decreased compared with olive oil LDL (0. 42 ± 0. 03 and 0. 52 ± 0. 04 pools/d, P = 0. 006). These data suggest that dietary supplementation with fish <b>oil</b> decreases LDL <b>clearance,</b> and that this effect is mediated, at least in part, by altering LDL structure and reducing the affinity of LDL for its receptor.

40|$|The piston-cylinder liner {{interface}} comprises {{more than}} half of the total engine rubbing friction. With current demand being for internal combustion engines with better fuel economy, lower exhaust emissions and higher performance, reducing this form of friction is the subject of much study. The research reported in this thesis is concerned with the development of an existing floating liner rig to measure the friction in this region. The performance features of the modified setup have also been assessed. Parametric studies have been undertaken with the modified setup to identify the potential means of friction reduction. Modifications undertaken in the sealing method and driveline assembly has facilitated friction measurement at higher gas loading of up to 80 barg. The modified sealing assembly with a sealing ring overcame the problem of arbitrary force interruption through irregular liner and seal contacts. Addition of five times higher inertia flywheel aided the motor to support the rig with adequate torque during high gas loading operations. Calibrations have been performed at each different build of piston-liner combination to reduce build to build variability in measurement. Experimental studies have been undertaken to assess the friction characteristics for different factors such as operating pressure, temperature and speed, lubricant <b>oil</b> formulation, piston-liner <b>clearance,</b> piston material etc. Tests have been undertaken at a range of operating conditions; peak pressure of 0 to 80 barg, speed of 1000 to 2000 rpm and average mid-liner temperature of 40 to 90 ˚C. Peak cylinder pressure has been observed to be dominating the friction followed by temperature and speed. Friction spikes were observed near the top dead centre for pressurised operations; where normal load on the rings are highest in a cycle. Higher speed generally results in a higher total frictional loss. However at higher temperature and peak pressure, contrasting effect of speed on total friction has been reported. The study further identified that piston motion play important roles in determining mixed/boundary friction along with the local gas pressure, velocity and oil film temperature. Friction reductions have been obtained by using a lower viscosity oil and higher piston-liner clearance. Maximum friction reduction of 18...|$|R
40|$|Rotary engines offer {{higher power}} density, fewer parts and lower {{vibrations}} than conventional reciprocating piston engines. However, rotary engines {{are more difficult}} to seal because of the rotor shape which leads to higher gas leakage and oil consumption resulting in lower efficiency and higher emissions. In order to address this problem, this thesis presents a set of multiscale models to assess rotary engine performances by estimating gas leakage, oil consumption, wear and friction. An oil seal multiscale model is developed to estimate internal oil consumption guided by oil transport visualization experiments carried using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. A finite element beam model is used to predict the <b>clearance</b> between the <b>oil</b> seals and the side housing for each crank angle in the cycle. From seal-housing <b>clearance,</b> <b>oil</b> transport through the oil seals is calculated using a control volume approach. The main mechanism leading to internal oil consumption is outward scraping of the oil seals due to a lack in conformability of the seals to the distorted side housing, especially next to the intake and exhaust ports. A set of multiscale models are developed for the performance of the apex and side seals. The models are formulated to couple gas flow to the dynamics and deformation of the seals while accurately describing the interfaces between the seals and their profile and groove. The models are used to predict apex and side seal behavior and understand the mechanisms leading to gas leakage. The main leakage mechanisms identified are leakage through (1) the corner seal clearance, (2) the spark plug holes, (3) the flanks of the seals at high speed, and (4) the side piece corner for the apex seals and at the ends of the side seals. The apex seal model shows good agreement with experiments, especially for the pressure in the apex seal groove. It is the first time such comprehensive models are developed for rotary engines and they will be valuable tools to help design more efficient and environment-friendly rotary engines. by Mathieu Picard.

Previously, we reported that free fatty acid (FFA) -treated HCV cell culture induces hepatocellular steatosis and impairs the expression of interferon alpha receptor- 1 (IFNAR 1), which is why the antiviral activity of IFN-α against HCV is impaired. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which IFNAR 1 expression is impaired in HCV cell culture with or without free fatty acid-treatment. HCV-infected Huh 7. 5 cells were cultured with or without a mixture of saturated (palmitate) and unsaturated (oleate) long-chain free fatty acids (FFA).

Activation of Jak-Stat signaling in the FFA-treated HCV culture by IFN-α alone and IFN-λ alone was examined by Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy. Lysosomal degradation of IFNAR 1 by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in the FFA-treated HCV cell culture model was investigated. FFA treatment induced dose-dependent hepatocellular steatosis and lipid droplet accumulation in HCV-infected Huh- 7. 5 cells. FFA treatment of infected culture increased HCV replication in a concentration-dependent manner. Intracellular lipid accumulation led to reduced Stat phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, causing an impaired IFN-α antiviral response and HCV clearance. Type III IFN (IFN-λ), which binds to a separate receptor, induces Stat phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation as well as antiviral clearance in FFA-treated HCV cell culture. We show here that the HCV-induced autophagy response is increased in FFA-treated cell culture. Pharmacological inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, such as ammonium chloride and bafilomycin, prevented IFNAR 1 degradation in FFA-treated HCV cell culture. Activators of chaperone-mediated autophagy, including 6 -aminonicotinamide and nutrient starvation, decreased IFNAR 1 levels in Huh- 7. 5 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation, colocalization and siRNA knockdown experiments revealed that IFNAR 1 but not IFNLR 1 interacts with HSC 70 and LAMP 2 A, which are core components of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Our study presents evidence indicating that chaperone-mediated autophagy targets IFNAR 1 degradation in the lysosome in FFA-treated HCV cell culture.
