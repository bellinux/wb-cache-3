40|$|Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) {{are often}} used for storing {{pressurant}} gases onboard spacecraft. Kevlar (DuPont), glass, carbon and other more recent fibers have all been used as <b>overwraps.</b> Due {{to the fact that}} <b>overwraps</b> are subjected to sustained loads for an extended period during a mission, stress rupture failure is a major concern. It is therefore important to ascertain the reliability of these vessels by analysis, since the testing of each flight design cannot be completed on a practical time scale. The present paper examines specifically a Weibull statistics based stress rupture model and considers the various uncertainties associated with the model parameters. The paper also examines several reliability estimate measures that would be of use for the purpose of recertification and for qualifying flight worthiness of these vessels. Specifically, deterministic values for a point estimate, mean estimate and 90 / 95 percent confidence estimates of the reliability are all examined for a typical flight quality vessel under constant stress. The mean and the 90 / 95 percent confidence estimates are computed using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques by assuming distribution statistics of model parameters based also on simulation and on the available data, especially the sample sizes represented in the data. The data for the stress rupture model are obtained from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL) stress rupture testing program, carried out for the past 35 years. Deterministic as well as probabilistic sensitivities are examined...|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} for {{the oil and gas}} {{industry}} is the repair of corroded steel piping. As a replacement of affected sections usually results in high expenses for the operator, rehabilitation methods which can be implemented on an operating pipeline are favoured by the industry. The application of <b>overwraps</b> made of Fibre-Reinforced Polymer systems offers such a promising method. In this work it is assumed that an overwrap is already installed, however, ongoing internal corrosion leads to a through-wall defect in the pipe. Hence, the fluid pressurises the repair and a detachment of the overwrap from the steel substrate can occur. This can even result in external leakage. In order to avoid this case of damage an analytical assessment approach is developed by means of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics and Finite Element Analysis. Subsequently, this approach is compared to the one given in the Code ISO/TS 24817 which is currently the mainly used code for the qualification and design of composite repairs for pipework...|$|E

A number of hypervelocity impact tests were performed on ISS handrails, and found that mm-sized projectiles were capable of inducing crater lip heights two orders of magnitude above the minimum value for glove abrasion concerns. Two techniques were evaluated for mitigating the cut glove hazard of MMOD impacts on ISS handrails: flexible <b>overwraps</b> which act to limit contact between crewmember gloves and impact sites, and; alternate materials which form less hazardous impact crater profiles.

In this paper, we described a simple and reliable HPLC method for analysis of an aqueous extract of laminated aluminum foil overwrap used for packaging LDPE vials filled with aqueous pharmaceutical formulations. By means of combined HPLC-UV, GC/MS, LC/MS/MS, and NMR spectroscopy, the two major compounds detected in the aqueous extracts of the representative commercial <b>overwraps</b> were identified as cyclic oligomers with molecular weights of 452 and 472 and are possibly formed from poly-condensation of the adhesive components, namely, isophthalic acid, adipic acid, and diethylene glycol.

40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} use of Modal Acoustic Emission to monitor damage progression to carbon fiber/epoxy tows. There is a risk for catastrophic failure of composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) due to burst-before-leak (BBL) stress rupture (SR) failure of carbon-epoxy (C/Ep) COPVs. A lack of quantitative nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is causing problems in current and future spacecraft designs. It is therefore important to develop and demonstrate critical NDE that can be implemented during stages of the design process since the observed rupture can occur with little of no advanced warning. Therefore a program was required to develop quantitative acoustic emission (AE) procedures specific to C/Ep <b>overwraps,</b> but which also have utility for monitoring damage accumulation in composite structure in general, and {{to lay the groundwork}} for establishing critical thresholds for accumulated damage in composite structures, such as COPVs, so that precautionary or preemptive engineering steps can be implemented to minimize of obviate the risk of catastrophic failure.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} trend to repair corroded or eroded pipelines, conveying oil, gas or water, by using fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. This relatively new repair technique involves wrapping the corroded part of the pipeline with a so-called FRP overwrap. FRP materials are lightweight, have high relative strength and do not corrode, making them an effective repair solution. The viability of this repair technique has been proved by the numerous research programs which have been performed. However, most of the literature regarding the design of FRP <b>overwraps</b> does only consider a static internal pressure. In this thesis, the behaviour of steel pipelines, repaired with FRP <b>overwraps,</b> subjected to water hammer conditions, has been investigated. Water hammer is the occurrence of pressure waves in the conveyed liquid, due to abrupt changes to steady flow conditions, for example the rapid closure of a valve. An approximate dynamic model, describing the radial vibration of steel pipes with a FRP overwrap, due to water hammer conditions, has been derived. The model is based on the theory of thin-walled cylinders, and the laminate stiffness matrix for a FRP laminate. In order to take the steel pipe into account, the laminate stiffness matrix was modified. Basic water hammer theory was used to find the magnitude and velocity of the water hammer-induced pressure wave. These properties defined the exciting load in the dynamic analysis of the repaired pipe wall. The derived governing equation was solved analytically by applying boundary conditions and utilising the properties of Fourier series. This resulted in series expressions for the radial deflection and the pipe wall stresses, as functions of the distance from the valve, and time since valve closure. The model was also implemented on representative examples, with two different FRP materials; E-Glass/Epoxy and T 300 / 5208 Carbon/Epoxy, and the influence of the thickness of the FRP overwrap was investigated. For both these materials, the model predicted the maximum radial deflection, due to the water hammer, to decrease if the overwrap was thin, and increase if the overwrap was thick. The reason was found to be that the natural frequency of the pipe is significantly altered when a thick FRP overwrap is applied, because of its low density, compared to the steel pipe. As the FRP overwrap gets thicker, the water hammer-induced vibration approaches a state of resonance, increasing the amplitude of the vibration. The rate, at which the amplitude increases, with respect to the thickness of the overwrap, will depend on the density and stiffness of the FRP material. The increased amplitude nevertheless causes an increased maximum radial deflection, and thereby increased stresses. During the design of a FRP overwrap for a pipe which is susceptible to water hammer conditions, it will therefore be important to ensure that the changed natural frequency does not lead to unacceptable stresses...|$|E
40|$|Composite <b>Overwrapped</b> Pressure Vessels (COPVs) {{are used}} to store gases under high {{pressure}} onboard spacecraft. These are used {{for a variety of}} purposes such as propelling liquid fuel etc, Kevlar, glass, Carbon and other more recent fibers have all been in use to <b>overwrap</b> the vessels. COPVs usually have a thin metallic liner with the primary purpose of containing the gases and prevent any leakage. The liner is <b>overwrapped</b> with filament wound composite such as Kevlar, Carbon or Glass fiber. Although the liner is required to perform in the leak before break mode making the failure a relatively benign mode, the <b>overwrap</b> can fail catastrophically under sustained load due to stress rupture. It is this failure mode that is of major concern as the stored energy of such vessels is often great enough ta cause loss of crew and vehicle. The present paper addresses some of the reliability concerns associated specifically with Kevlar Composite <b>Overwrapped</b> Pressure Vessels.

The gages will be produced utilizing Meandering Winding Magnetometer (MWM) and/or MWM array eddy current technology. The ultimate goal is to utilize this technology for the health monitoring of Composite <b>Overwrapped</b> Pressure Vessels for all future flight programs. The first full-scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in June 2012. The goals of this test were to determine adaptations of the magnetic stress gauge instrumentation that would be necessary to allow multiple sensors to monitor the vessel's condition simultaneously and to determine how the sensor response changes with sensor selection and orientation. The second full scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in August 2012. The goals of this test were to monitor the vessel's condition with multiple sensors simultaneously, to determine the viability of the multiplexing units (MUX) for the application, and to determine if the sensor responses in different orientations are repeatable. For both sets of tests the vessel was pressured up to 6, 000 psi to simulate maximum operating pressure. Acoustic events were observed during the first pressurization cycle. This suggested that the extended storage period prior to use of this bottle led to a relaxation of the residual stresses imparted during auto-frettage. The pressurization tests successfully demonstrated the use of multiplexers with multiple MWM arrays to monitor a vessel. It was discovered that depending upon the sensor orientation, the frequencies, and the sense element, the MWM arrays can provide a variety of complementary information about the composite <b>overwrapped</b> pressure vessel load conditions. For example, low frequency measurements can be used to monitor the <b>overwrap</b> thickness and changes associated with pressure level.
