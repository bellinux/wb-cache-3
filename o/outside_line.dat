5|$|Sutil {{was given}} a 20-second time penalty by the {{stewards}} as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth, and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting. This ruling meant Hülkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam Michael said that his team had accepted the stewards' judgement. The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi. Kobayashi admitted {{that he was at}} fault for his retirement and Senna believed the marshals were late reacting to Kobayashi's accident and felt his own accident was unavoidable.|$|E
5|$|The two drivers {{pulled away}} {{from the rest of the}} field. Giovinazzi was unable to use his DRS because it was {{affected}} by a malfunction. He made attempts to overtake Gasly in the closing stages of the event. On the final lap, Giovinazzi drove on the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> on the start/finish straight and moved to the inside heading into the first corner. Gasly ran wide by missing his braking point while defending, which allowed Giovinazzi to take over the lead. He maintained the position for the remainder of the race to clinch his second consecutive victory. Gasly finished second, with Sirotkin in third. King took fourth, ahead of Markelov in fifth. Canamasas, Jeffri, and Pic rounded out the top-eight points-scoring finishers, Lynn, Kirchhöfer, Marciello, Ghiotto, Latifi, de Jong and Rowland were the last of the classified finishers. Givoinazzi's victories meant he became the first driver since Davide Valsecchi in the first 2012 Bahrain round to win both races in a GP2 Series race weekend, and the seventh driver in the history of the series to achieve this feat.|$|E
5|$|Johnson went up {{the track}} on lap 52, but regained control of his car. Six laps later, after the leaders ran single file, Kenseth {{received}} help from Johnson while running on the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> {{to prepare for a}} race winning slingshot. Kenseth slid underneath teammate Biffle as they started the final lap, as Biffle attempted to block Kenseth. Kenseth maintained the lead and crossed the finish line on lap 60 to win the race, with Smith in second and Johnson third. Sadler and Biffle rounded out the top five finishers. Blaney and Nemechek earned the second pair of transfer spots to qualify for the Daytona 500. Bayne, Tony Raines and David Stremme secured qualification for the Daytona 500 based on their lap times in the qualifier, with Terry Labonte using a champion's provisional to qualify. The following six drivers failed to qualify for the Daytona 500 because they did not finish high enough in their respective Duels or turn a fast-enough qualifying lap: Waltrip, Richardson, Bill Elliott, Mike Wallace, Kenny Wallace and J.J. Yeley. The second race had a total of five lead changes among four different drivers and no cautions were shown. Biffle's total of 40 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Kenseth led two times for a total of ten laps.|$|E

5|$|Montoya {{began to}} {{gradually}} {{pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Fisichella to take 14th place on lap two. Barrichello overtook Häkkinen at the Ostkurve corner to move into third one lap later. Further down the field, Button lost 13th position when he was passed by Panis on the same lap. On lap five, Panis made up a further position as he overtook Zonta for twelfth, while Bernoldi passed Button to take 14th. Barrichello moved into second position after he overtook Michael Schumacher at the Senna chicane on lap six. On the same lap, Zonta went into the rear of Verstappen's car, causing Zonta to lose his front wing. Verstappen fell behind Panis after the collision. Zonta made a pit stop for repairs, but retired after driving one exploratory lap. Verstappen made his pit stop and rejoined {{at the back of}} the field. Alesi passed Burti to move into 15th position on lap nine, and Panis overtook teammate Villeneuve for tenth place one lap later. On the tenth lap, Panis attempted to overtake Trulli for ninth by taking the inside line, but was unable to complete the manoveure. Panis again tried to pass Trulli but by taking the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> on the next lap, although he could not execute the pass because of a lack of straightline speed. During the twelfth lap, Panis made his third attempt at passing Trulli and managed to get ahead of the Italian. Trulli pulled into the slipstream of Panis, and attempted to reclaim the position but spun at the Ostkurve corner, and fell to 17th.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{made the}} worst {{start in the}} field because of an {{incorrect}} power setting, moving from ninth to 14th {{by the end of}} the first lap, while Heidfeld made four positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap Piquet led from teammate Turvey, who was followed in turn, by Bird, Buemi, López, Heidfeld, Rosenqvist, Duval, Vergne, Abt, Engel, Félix da Costa, Evans, Prost, Sarrazin, Carroll, di Grassi, d'Ambrosio, Frijns and Ma. Piquet pulled away from the rest of the field as Buemi started to close the gap to Bird and Turvey. López fell down to eighth on the second lap after he was overtaken by Mahindra drivers Heidfeld and Rosenqvist along with Duval. Both di Grassi and Abt were shown a black flag with an orange circle, requiring the pair to make pit stops for repairs to their cars. Ma switched to a second car but became the race's first retirement shortly afterwards because of an battery issue. Bird placed Turvey under pressure which allowed Piquet to open up a two-second advantage by lap four. Di Grassi moved to the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> heading into the chicane on the fifth lap and overtook Sarrazin and López leaving the turn and moved in front of Carroll heading into the second corner. Bird overtook Turvey for the second position on lap six, and Buemi overtook Turvey by taking the inside lane in turn one on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|Tréluyer {{was delayed}} by slower traffic, {{allowing}} Conway to overtake him for fourth position before the Audi driver ran wide at the Bus Stop chicane. Van der Garde's car's sustained a damaged mirror and was ordered by race control {{to have it}} repaired at his scheduled pit stop. Buemi closed the gap to Lucas di Grassi in Audi's No. 8 entry and attempted to pass him driving into Eau Rouge and Raidillon but di Grassi was able to pull away on the Kemmel Straight. Buemi moved to the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> at Blanchimont and moved in front of di Grassi, who went through grass, at the Bus Stop chicane for second place. Marino Franchitti's No. 67 Ford made contact with Aguas's car at Les Combes but both drivers were able to continue, although Augas lost the LMGTE Am lead. Conway locked his tyres and collided heavily with Victor Shaytar's delayed No. 37 SMP Racing car going into the Bus Stop chicane while attempting {{to close the gap}} to di Grassi. Conway immediately drove into the pit lane for repairs to his car's front-end. Both Porsche cars made pit stops after 49 minutes which saw Jani taking over Lieb's driving duties while Hartley switched positions with Bernhard.|$|E

5|$|Di Grassi {{took over}} the lead with d'Ambrosio second; both drivers were half a lap ahead of the battling drivers, who had more {{available}} electrical energy. Félix da Costa and his teammate Frijns joined the leading group of drivers after being under the minimum pit stop time by three seconds. The safety was deployed for the third (and final) time when Duval stopped on track after leaving the chicane with a battery issue, prematurely ending his race. This allowed the field to close up to di Grassi and d'Ambrosio. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap 30 and di Grassi held the lead at the restart. Vergne immediately pushed hard and attempted to pass López for third but the two drivers made contact at the turn three chicane. He attempted the same manoeuvre one lap later but López cut the chicane to avoid hitting Vergne and the latter demanded on his radio that López cede the position. Both Andretti cars were investigated because their pit stop times were faster the minimum permitted time of one minute because the team believed it was 57 seconds. López drew near to d'Ambrosio and Vergne remained close behind López. The battle allowed di Grassi {{to pull away from}} the field. Félix da Costa slowed and stopped his car on the 33rd lap with a broken driveshaft, causing him to retire. His teammate Frijns was issued with a drive-through penalty for being below the minimum pit stop time. Two laps later, López pushed hard and steered onto the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> in an attempt to pass d'Ambrosio but spun under braking for the first corner, sliding off into the turn's run-off area. Buemi activated FanBoost and lined up an overtake on Rosenqvist (who locked his front tyres) but spun under braking for turn one, and narrowly avoided striking López's stranded car. Both drivers fell down the order. The electrical power in Engel's car depleted slowly after exiting turns five and six, ending his race. Buemi recorded the race's fastest lap on lap 40, completing a circuit at one minute and 3.102 seconds. This earned him one championship point. D'Ambrosio continued to hold back Vergne and the remaining seven cars behind him had more electrical energy available. D'Ambrosio locked his tyres under braking for the first corner, allowing Vergne to pass him for second place. Vergne then started to draw closer to di Grassi.|$|E

25|$|As {{the safety}} car was exiting turn 11, an {{approaching}} Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 drastically reduced its speed {{in response to}} the unusually slow safety car. However, a BMW a few seconds behind came around the blind turn at speed, colliding with the Gallardo and safety car. The collision destroyed the Gallardo and sent the BMW into a number of rolls. The safety car was sent off the track into the Armco at great speed. In the chaos, a Marcos LM600 coming around turn 11 locked up its brakes and spun into the wet grass {{on the inside of the}} track. Sliding back onto the track, it was hit from the side by a BMW Z3. Furthermore, two E46 BMW M3 GTRs were damaged: one on the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> hit the rear of the Marcos, and the other, on the inside line, slightly damaged its front right. The second M3 continued around the track, while the first slid into the grass before turn 12. The race was stopped, and there were no serious injuries to any of the drivers.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} lap, di Grassi led Sarrazin, Rosenqvist, Evans, Vergne, Prost, Carroll, Turvey, Duval, Dillmann, Heidfeld, Abt, Félix da Costa, Frijns, Engel, Buemi, López, d'Ambrosio, Bird and Piquet. Di Grassi began to pull away from the rest of the field. Sarrazin was put under {{pressure}} by Rosenqvist but defended his position from him. Attention then switched to Buemi who was beginning his move up the field. He adopted the positioning of his left hand on his steering wheel against his bent steering arm. Heidfeld and Abt were able to enter the top-ten places and both battled for position. Abt passed Heidfeld for ninth place on the ninth lap. After ten laps Buemi had passed four drivers to run in 12th place. After Buemi had overtaken Duval for tenth position on the 14th lap, Heidfeld attempted to overtake Duval on the <b>outside</b> <b>line,</b> but Duval defended his position, leaving Heidfeld without any space on the dirty part of the track and the two made contact at turn six. Duval resumed but Heidfeld's front-right suspension was bent and drove to the side of the track at turn 12 to retire. Heidfeld's stricken car prompted the activation of the full course yellow procedure to enable marshals to remove it from the circuit and most drivers elected to make pit stops for the mandatory change into their second cars.|$|E
25|$|Auer {{was aware}} Rosenqvist {{would be a}} problem, and despite Rosenqvist having flat-spotted his front-left tyre during the battle with Verstappen, he slipstreamed {{onto the back of}} his {{teammate}} and then steered onto the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> going through the first corner and overtook Auer for the lead. Further down the field, Cassidy got ahead of Merhi to move into fifth. Blomqvist resisted an overtaking manoevure from Ocon to keep third position, while Latifi retook seventh from King and Coletti lost ninth to Serrallés. Rosenqvist quickly built up a one and a half second lead over teammate Auer who was able to reduce the gap to nine-tenths of a second, but Rosenqvist maintained the lead {{for the rest of the}} qualifying race to win and claim the pole position for the Grand Prix itself. Blomqvist fended off further attacks from Ocon to clinch third with Cassidy fifth and Merhi sixth. Behind the trio, Latifi followed in seventh with King eighth and Serrallés ninth. Coletti rounded out the top ten finishers. Outside the top ten, Fuoco took eleventh ahead of Ferrucci, with the Japanese duo of Kanamaru, Yamashita in the next two places. Menezes, Calderón, Cao, Goddard, Pommer, Takaboshi, Chang and Wells rounded out the classified finishers. Buller finished but was not classified as he was two laps behind the winner.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{began to}} pull away from Rosberg, leading his {{teammate}} by 4.3 seconds by the start of lap 36. Bottas moved to the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> heading into the Rettifilo chicane on the following lap and Magnussen responded by steering towards the inside line, causing Bottas to mount the kerbing to avoid a collision but passed the McLaren car. Shortly afterwards, Magnussen was handed a five-second stop-and-go penalty by the stewards for his role in forcing Bottas off the track in the latter's earlier overtaking attempt. Button passed Pérez around the inside driving into the Rettifilo chicane for seventh on lap 39, but Pérez responded by going alongside Button through the Curva Grande corner and the Variante della Roggia chicane. Pérez was forced wide onto the Variante della Roggia chicane kerbing but took the inside line and regained seventh place from Button at the Curva di Lesmo turns. On the following lap, Bottas passed Vettel to move into fourth at the Rettifilo chicane and his teammate Ricciardo overtook Button for seventh at the same turn. Ricciardo drew close to Pérez and pressured latter into locking his brakes entering the Rettifilo chicane. He achieved a good rhythm through the Curva Grande corner, and moved lanes, passing Pérez around the outside to take over seventh at the Variante della Roggia chicane on lap 41.|$|E

25|$|On lap four, Günther {{attempted}} to pass another car by {{moving out of}} its slipstream but sustained a right-rear puncture. His suspension broke while attempting {{to return to the}} pit lane, prematurely ending his race. Félix da Costa was able to reduce the time deficit to Sette Camara to be 0.7 seconds behind at the end of lap four until the safety car was deployed following a crash by Mazepin at Faraway corner; the accident was caused by Mazepin overshooting the turn. At the lap-seven restart, Sette Cãmara reacted late to the safety car driving into the pit lane, and Félix da Costa ran near his teammate, drafted him heading into Mandarin corner, and turned right onto the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> to gain the lead before the braking point going into Lisboa corner. Félix da Costa began to pull away from Sette Cãmara, leading the driver by 1.7 seconds by the start of lap 10 which saw the second deployment of the safety car when Cassidy (who started from 28th after changing his engine) impacted the Paiol corner barrier. The race restarted three laps later with Félix da Costa leading Sette Cãmara. The Brazilian driver drew alongside his Carlin teammate driving towards Lisboa corner but Félix da Costa held the lead by moving to the inside line.|$|E
25|$|Giovnazzi spun at the Melco hairpin but recovered. The safety car's {{deployment}} was necessitated {{to allow}} the track to be cleaned. At {{the end of the}} first lap, Lynn led from Derani, Félix da Costa, Marciello, Sims, Coletti, Buller, King, Sainz and Latifi. At the restart, Lynn held on to the lead and Derani was passed by Félix da Costa on the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> at Lisboa corner. Sims lined up an manoevure on Marciello but realised the move could not be completed and eased off. King fell to ninth when Sainz overtook him. Lynn increased his lead to two laps in the following laps, Marciello attempted to force his way through Derani but the Italian resisted his attempts at being overtaken. Sainz moved in front of both Coletti and Buller but the two drivers retook their lost positions. Marciello made it past Derani's who made his car wide at Lisboa corner to take over third place. On lap seven, Coletti and Buller collided which caused the latter's retirement but the latter was able to restart racing although he lost positions as a consequence of being forced to spin onto the escape road. King benefited from the incident and was now up to seventh and both he and Carlin teammate Jaafar passed Sainz after a battle for sixth position ended. Sun spun off at Fisherman's Bend and prompted the brief waving of localised yellow flags.|$|E
25|$|Rosenqvist {{attempted}} to replicate his earlier overtaking manoeuvre on Sette Cãmara {{but was not}} successful. Yamashita and Ilott made {{contact with each other}} but the Japanese driver was able to move into fourth place after passing Ilott. Sette Cãmara slid sideways at Fisherman's Bend corner, allowing Rosenqvist to get into the slipstream of the Brazilian driver. Rosenqvist went to the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> and passed Sette Cãmara driving into Lisboa corner to move into second place. Piquet collided with Ticktum, ending the Double R Racing driver's race while MacLeod went wide off the track in order to avoid a multi-car accident. Rosenqvist began catching Félix da Costa by setting the race's fastest lap on lap 14, completing a circuit of two minutes and 11.080 seconds, but was unable to get close to the Portuguese driver, though yellow flags were waved for Maini who drove straight at Lisboa corner. Félix da Costa controlled the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race to clinch the victory. It was the second Macau Grand Prix win of Félix da Costa's career. Rosenqvist finished in second place, 1.603 seconds behind, with Sette Cãmara in third, Yamashita fourth and Ilott fifth. Hughes, Russell, Juncadella, Piquet and Sims completed the top ten finishers. The race had two yellow flag periods and two lead changes among two different drivers. Félix da Costa led once for a total of nine laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E

25|$|The {{first three}} runners were {{separated}} by less than two seconds with six laps left in the race. Palmer and Leal received frequent reminders to preserve their tyres, while Trummer was informed over the radio that to have any hopes of winning the race he had to attack. Quaife-Hobbs slowed because his tyres had degraded enough to enable Nasr to close up to him. Their battle allowed Pic, Richelmi, Evans and Binder to close up causing jostling and minor contact between all six cars. Nasr initially passed Quaife-Hobbs at the final corner on the 30th lap but Quaife-Hobbs reclaimed fourth place driving into the first turn. Nasr finally got ahead of Quaife-Hobbs by slipstreaming him driving on the <b>outside</b> <b>line</b> heading into turn four. On the final lap, Richelmi overtook Pic at turn eight for fifth place while Pic and Markelov lost positions to Evans and Binder. Trummer was unable to overhaul Palmer who kept the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race to clinch the victory. Trummer finished eight-tenths of a second adrift in second and took his first podium finish since the 2009 International Formula Master. Leal was a further six-tenths of a second in arrears in third, with Nasr fourth and RIchelmi fifth. Quaife-Hobbs, Evans and Binder rounded out the top-eight points scoring positions. Pic, Markelov, de Jong, Izawa, Abt, Cecotto and Lancaster followed in the next seven places with Haryanto, Berthon, Negrão, Sato and Regalia completing the top twenty. Jefferies, Vandoorne, Coletti, Marciello and Rossi were the last of the classified finishers. The victory was Palmer's fourth in the GP2 Series.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnitude}} of the fighting and its proximity to Nui Dat shocked the Australians, and later there was speculation Jackson had either suspected a Viet Cong regiment was nearby or that after being presented with SIGINT suggesting its presence he refused to accept it. Yet while several indicators of the coming action were evident after the fact, no one had forecasted it. Despite detecting a transmitter from the 275th Regiment moving west towards Nui Dat, such intercepts were unable to predict Viet Cong intentions with certainty, while patrols through the area also failed to find it. Regardless, Jackson had responded by maintaining patrols at company strength when <b>outside</b> <b>Line</b> Alpha, while ensuring a level of base security. However, Townsend had not been given access to this intelligence and some officers were later critical of the restrictions placed on it. Although {{it would not have}} altered the requirement for a company-sized patrol it might have changed the way the battle was fought, and afterwards both battalion commanders were regularly briefed on such intercepts. The value of patrolling in depth and in sufficient strength to prevent the Viet Cong concentrating their forces had also been reinforced, and while there was no change to the pattern of Australian operations, when a significant engagement was possible patrols would be a minimum of a company and would operate close enough to rapidly support each other to stop them becoming isolated. Lastly, the command relationship between the infantry and APCs had been problematic during the battle and changes to standard operating procedures were implemented to provide clearer direction in such circumstances.|$|E
500|$|The second event {{started at}} 14:15 local time on 19 April. Sirotkin was {{required}} to start from the pit lane after stalling his car {{at the beginning of}} the formation lap. When the race started, pole position starter Leal maintained his advantage heading into the first corner by driving aggressively in front of the field of cars. Haryanto made a good start, moving from seventh to third by running on the <b>outside</b> <b>line,</b> while Berthon made a slow getaway and dropped to seventh. King lost the most positions, moving from fifth to 13th, which he attributed to driving conservatively on the formation lap, and having no grip while moving off his starting position. Leal pulled out to the lead over the rest of the field by pushing hard. After completing two laps, Binder retired from the race, having made contact with another car, which damaged one of his front left suspension arms. Evans was overtaken by Haryanto for second place in the first turn on lap four, while Negrão lost position when he was passed by Visoiu, Matsushita, Vandoorne, and Rossi.|$|E
