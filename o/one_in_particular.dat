5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|When the war ended, Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1919 {{to attend the}} first Pan-African Congress and to interview African-American soldiers for a planned book on their experiences in World War I. He was trailed by U.S. agents who were searching for evidence of treasonous activities. Du Bois discovered {{that the vast majority}} of black American soldiers were relegated to menial labor as stevedores and laborers. Some units were armed, and <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> the 92nd Division (the Buffalo soldiers), engaged in combat. Du Bois discovered widespread racism in the Army, and concluded that the Army command discouraged African Americans from joining the Army, discredited the accomplishments of black soldiers, and promoted bigotry.|$|E

25|$|In 1906, Flyer had an {{extensive}} overhaul and conversion to oil fuel {{to allow her}} to compete with the newer steel steamers that the Puget Sound Navigation Company had purchased in the Great Lakes and brought round South America. <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> Indianapolis, was being placed on the Seattle-Tacoma run in direct opposition to the Flyer. Passenger traffic on Puget Sound was then very high. In 1907, so many people wanted to travel to Tacoma on the Flyer that they were regularly turned away at the dock.|$|E
25|$|The partitive–indefinite pro-clitic re is {{used when}} the NP {{refers to a}} new, {{non-specific}} instance of a notion. In order to understand this concept, compare the English sentences 'I ate a banana ' with 'I want to eat a banana '. Besides being indefinite in both cases, in the first sentence a banana is specific, because it refers to a specific banana; in the second sentence a banana is non-specific, because it can refer to any banana, not <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular.</b> Although this semantic difference is not grammaticalized in English, it is in Araki, using re as a marker for non-specific indefinite reference.|$|E

25|$|Kitchener's great fame, the suddenness of his death, and its {{apparently}} convenient timing for {{a number}} of parties gave almost immediate rise to a number of conspiracy theories about his death. <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> was posited by Lord Alfred Douglas (of Oscar Wilde fame), positing a connection between Kitchener's death, the recent naval Battle of Jutland, Winston Churchill, and a Jewish conspiracy. Churchill successfully sued Douglas in what proved to be the last successful case of criminal libel in British legal history, and the latter spent six months in prison. Another claimed that the Hampshire did not strike a mine at all, but was sunk by explosives secreted in the vessel by Irish Republicans.|$|E
25|$|In round 13, Franklin {{effectively}} dragged Hawthorn {{over the}} line for a win against their arch-rival in Essendon. He kicked five goals for the match, but his last two were the standouts - the final <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> a goal from the boundary line on a tight angle after having run from half-back, which was later chosen as Goal of the Year. Franklin kicked five goals in Round 17 against St Kilda after returning from an ankle injury; despite his performance, the Saints forced a draw during the final seconds of the match. In round 22, Franklin kicked six goals against Collingwood, helping the Hawks clinch a three-point come-from-behind victory against the eventual premiers. It {{was the first time}} that he had kicked more than five goals since 2008. Frankin was named as centre half-forward in the 2010 All-Australian team, his second selection.|$|E
25|$|The next {{headmaster}} {{was appointed}} in 1312 as Hugh of Northampton as {{recorded in the}} Bishop's register for that year.

25|$|The two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to {{face charges}} {{that they had}} plagiarized Sunset Boulevard. Former Paramount {{accountant}} Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> Past Performance, served {{as the basis for}} the Sunset script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in general damages, $250,000 in punitive damages, $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.|$|E
25|$|Many United Order {{communities}} {{were set up}} amongst Mormon towns beginning in 1874. <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> was the United Order of Kanab, which was a communal experiment initiated by Brigham Young. Kanab was established in 1870. That year, John R. Young and the local bishop, Levi Stewart, began colonization of this area and twelve families followed to begin this endeavor. However, there was confusion as to who {{was the leader of}} this society. LDS Church authorities appointed the bishop and only they could revoke his status. But many wanted to elect John R. Young as president because he was related to LDS Church president Brigham Young. This conflict of power lasted until January 5, 1875, when Levi Stewart became the president. Eventually, Stewart resigned from his position and L. John Nuttall of Provo took his place.|$|E
25|$|Milton {{attended}} {{church at}} All Hallows and {{was influenced by}} the minister Richard Stock, a Puritan who was anti-Catholic and emphasised the need to read the Bible. In addition to his time at church, {{he spent most of his}} early life near St. Paul's Cathedral and was privately tutored. From the ages of 5 and 7, Milton was taught how to read and write in English and Latin, along with arithmetic. Milton was provided with several tutors between the ages of 7 and 12, but <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> Thomas Young, would prove influential. Young was a Scottish Presbyterian who had moved south, was highly educated and respected by his peers. Young's religious views affected Milton, and he adopted both Puritan appearances and ideas during his tutoring. Young was not the only major figure in Milton's early education; Milton acknowledged his father's care in teaching him many languages, including French, Italian, and Hebrew.|$|E

25|$|However, other clubs {{also began}} to make their {{presence}} felt in the locality. <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> the Great Northern Railway Association Club, otherwise known as the Dundalk GNR, founded in September 1903, spawned the modern-day Dundalk Football Club. The Dundalk GNR were located at the Athletic Grounds and competed in the Dundalk and District League from 1905 until 1914, although media coverage remained patchy. Sports coverage was re-instated in the local media in 1919, with the Dundalk and District League re-established in time to start a competition during the 1919–20 season. Included among the teams was a selection representing the Dundalk GNR. The club were also partaking in the Newry League at the time, but political change at a national level was to affect this. Following {{the formation of the}} Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS; later to become the Football Association of Ireland or FAI) in Dublin to govern football in the Irish Free State the control of footballing matters in Northern Ireland was left to the Irish Football Association (IFA).|$|E
25|$|From 1920 to 1950, Mexico was {{the third}} largest {{producer}} of handcrafts, behind Japan and China, with the support described above. However, this support {{did not lead to}} major museum collections or higher valuations on the work being produced. Some crafts did not benefit from being associated with the new myth of Mexican identity. <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> is waxcrafting, as it is mostly associated with Catholic religious items and motifs. Today, {{only a handful of people}} still work with wax and for all intents and purposes, the craft is dead in Mexico. The glorification of crafts and national icons, archetypes and prototypes in the first half of the 20th century had some negative effects. Certain images such as the China Poblana, rural scenes, charros etc.,began to appear almost ubiquitously on products artisans were making. The promotion of Mexican artesanía was accepted earlier by foreigners than by Mexicans themselves. Very few examples of crafts from the early 20th century survive and most of the best collections of it are in North American or European hands.|$|E
