40|$|Memory, as {{measured}} by changes in an animal's behavior some time after learning, {{is a reflection of}} many processes. Here, using a trace paradigm, in mice we show that de novo protein synthesis is required for acquisition, consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of classically conditioned eyelid responses. Two critical periods of protein synthesis have been found: the first, during training, the blocking <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>impaired</b> acquisition; and the second, lasting the first 4 h after training, the blocking <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>impaired</b> consolidation. The process of reconsolidation was sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition if anisomycin was injected before or just after the reactivation session. Furthermore, extinction was also dependent on protein synthesis, following the same temporal course as that followed during acquisition and consolidation. This last fact reinforces the idea that extinction is an active learning process rather than a passive event of forgetting. Together, these findings demonstrate that all of the different stages of memory formation involved in the classical conditioning of eyelid responses are dependent on protein synthesis.

40|$|A modular endoprosthetic {{system that}} can be {{extended}} noninvasively has been applied {{for the first time}} in a,stowing child who underwent a tumor resection in his leg. The main goal of the study was to test the extendable mechanism that noninvasively corrects leg length differences caused by growth disturbances of the affected leg. The use of this endoprosthetic system resulted in good restoration of function. Six extensions were performed resulting in 19. 5 mm of prosthetic growth. Unfortunately, an ingrown toenail caused infection of the endoprosthesis, and the infection necessitated extirpation of the prosthesis 15 months postoperatively. Two months later the patient died of acute leukemia.

However, {{only part of the}} populations become emergent and provide this important facilitation. Since it has been hypothesised that its buoyancy depends on the rates of underwater photosynthesis, we investigated the role of dissolved CO 2 availability and PAR on photosynthesis, biomass production and buoyancy in a controlled greenhouse experiment. Photosynthesis and growth were strongly influenced by both PAR and CO 2 availability. At low PAR, plants formed less biomass and produced no emergent leaves, even when CO 2 was abundant. At low CO 2 levels, S. aloides switched to HCO 3 - use, resulting in a lower photosynthetic O 2 production, decreased emergent leaf formation and increased CaCO 3 precipitation on its leaves, all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>impaired</b> buoyancy. At high PAR, low CO 2 availability resulted in slower colonisation of the water layer, whereas CO 2 availability did not influence PAR-limited plants. Our study shows that site conditions, rather than the sole abundance of potentially facilitating species, may strongly determine whether or not they form the structure necessary to act as a facilitator for biodiversity in aquatic environments...|$|E

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus affects 6 % of western populations and represents a {{major risk factor}} {{for the development of}} skin complications, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>impaired</b> wound healing, manifested in e. g. "diabetic foot ulcer", is most prominent. Impaired angiogenesis is considered a major contributing factor to these non-healing wounds. At present it is still unclear whether diabetes-associated wound healing and skin vascular dysfunction are direct consequences of impaired insulin/IGF- 1 signaling, or secondary due to e. g. hyperglycemia. To directly test the role of vascular endothelial insulin signaling in the development of diabetes-associated skin complications and vascular function, we inactivated the insulin receptor and its highly related receptor, the IGF- 1 receptor, specifically in the endothelial compartment of postnatal mice, using the inducible Tie- 2 CreERT (DKO(IVE)) deleter. Impaired endothelial insulin/IGF- 1 signaling did not {{have a significant impact on}} endothelial homeostasis in the skin, as judged by number of vessels, vessel basement membrane staining intensity and barrier function. In contrast, challenging the skin through wounding strongly reduced neo-angiogenesis in DKO(IVE) mice, accompanied by reduced granulation tissue formation reduced. These results show that endothelial insulin/IGF signaling is essential for neo-angiogenesis upon wounding, and imply that reduced endothelial insulin/IGF signaling directly contributes to diabetes-associated impaired healing...|$|E
40|$|Accidents by Thalassophryne nattereri fish venom are characterised by severe local {{symptoms}} and signs including pain of fast onset, oedema and necrosis with impaired muscle regeneration. These effects have {{been related to}} alterations in hemostatic mechanisms and cytolytic effects rather than to conventional inflammatory pathways. In this work we evaluated the effects induced by the venom on microcirculatory vessels, platelets and blood coagulation. Effects evoked by topical application of venom on cremaster muscle were visualised through intravital microscopy. Stasis was observed, concomitantly {{with the presence of}} thrombi in venules and focal transient constrictions in arterioles, all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>impaired</b> the blood flow. Significant alterations on vessel walls took place few minutes after venom application, characterised by increment in thickness, probably by deposition of fibrin. Increase in vascular permeability was also observed in venules. Additionally, the action of the venom was locally restricted since no alteration on systemic blood coagulation was observed. Venom lacked a direct pro-coagulant activity, but exerted a strong cytolytic effect on platelets and endothelial cells in vitro. These data suggest that venom action on endothelium may contribute to blood stasis and to the formation of platelet and fibrin thrombi, with the consequent ischemia, contributing to the local effects of the venom.

40|$|Leishmania parasites lack a purine biosynthetic pathway and {{depend on}} surface {{nucleoside}} and nucleobase transporters {{to provide them}} with host purines. Leishmania donovani possess two closely related genes that encode high affinity adenosine-pyrimidine nucleoside transporters LdNT 1. 1 and LdNT 1. 2 and that transport the toxic adenosine analog tubercidin in addition to the natural substrates. In this study, we have characterized a drug-resistant clonal mutant of L. donovani (TUBA 5) that is deficient in LdNT 1 transport and consequently resistant to tubercidin. In TUBA 5 cells, the LdNT 1. 2 genes had the same sequence as wild-type cells. However, because LdNT 1. 2 mRNA is not detectable in either wild-type or TUBA 5 promastigotes, LdNT 1. 2 does not contribute to nucleoside transport in this stage of the life cycle. In contrast, the TUBA 5 cells were compound heterozygotes at the LdNT 1. 1 locus containing two mutant alleles that encompassed distinct point mutations, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>impaired</b> transport function. One of the mutant LdNT 1. 1 alleles encoded a G 183 D substitution in predicted TM 5, and the other allele contained a C 337 Y change in predicted TM 7. Whereas G 183 D and C 337 Y mutants had only slightly elevated adenosine Km values, the severe impairment in transport resulted from drastically (≈ 20 -fold) reduced Vmax values. Because these transporters were correctly targeted to the plasma membrane, the reduction in Vmax apparently resulted from a defect in translocation. Strikingly, G 183 was essential for pyrimidine nucleoside but not adenosine transport. A mutant transporter with a G 183 A substitution had an altered substrate specificity, exhibiting robust adenosine transport but undetectable uridine uptake. These results suggest that TM 5 is likely to form part of the nucleoside translocation pathway in LdNT 1. ...|$|E

PKPs localize to the cytoplasmic plaque of intercellular junctions and participate in linking the intermediate filament (IF) -binding protein desmoplakin (DP) to desmosomal cadherins. In response to cell–cell contact, PKP 2 associates with DP in plaque precursors that form in the cytoplasm and translocate to nascent desmosomes. Here, we provide evidence that PKP 2 governs DP assembly dynamics by scaffolding a DP–PKP 2 –protein kinase Cα (PKCα) complex, which is disrupted by PKP 2 knockdown. The behavior of a phosphorylation-deficient DP mutant that associates more tightly with IF is mimicked by PKP 2 and PKCα knockdown and PKC pharmacological inhibition, all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>impair</b> junction assembly.

Little is known about the mechanisms of action and uptake of MIL in either parasites or tumor cell lines. We have cloned a putative MIL transporter (LdMT) by functional rescue, using a Leishmania donovani-resistant line defective in the inward-directed translocation of both MIL and glycerophospholipids. LdMT is a novel P-type ATPase belonging to the partially characterized aminophospholipid translocase subfamily. Resistant parasites transfected with LdMT regain their sensitivity to MIL and edelfosine and the ability to normally take up [14 C]MIL and fluorescent-labeled glycerophospholipids. Moreover, LdMT localizes to the plasma membrane, and its overexpression in Leishmania tarentolae, a species non-sensitive to MIL, significantly increases the uptake of [14 C]MIL, strongly suggesting that this protein behaves as a true translocase. Finally, both LdMT-resistant alleles encompass single but distinct point mutations, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>impairs</b> transport function, explaining the resistant phenotype.
