5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, the Revolutionary War {{intensified}} in Kentucky. British {{lieutenant governor}} Henry Hamilton armed his Indian allies from his headquarters at Fort Detroit, {{encouraging them to}} wage war on the Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground. The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion in the northwest <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defense of Kentucky, which was left entirely to the local population. Clark spent several months defending settlements against the Indian raiders {{as a leader in}} the Kentucky County militia, while developing his plan for a long-distance strike against the British. His strategy involved seizing British outposts north of the Ohio River to destroy British influence among their Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{plans for}} an {{underground}} garage at Union Square were given to Pflueger for political reasons. George Applegarth's 1935 design was actively opposed from several directions and Pflueger's social contacts and his friendship with mayor Angelo Joseph Rossi were {{needed to get the}} project started. Union Square garage opened in 1943 with Pflueger's touch making it a full-service valet garage complete with a waiting room and rest rooms for shoppers and the option of having shopping packages sent directly from a nearby store to the garage <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> car to be delivered to the store. The concept of an underground garage below a city park was influential: New York builder Robert Moses requested copies of Pflueger's plans (little changed from Applegarth's) and Pershing Square in Los Angeles was excavated and rebuilt in 1952 along the same lines.|$|E

He entered the match with Jamaica already 2–0 down, replacing Darren Mattocks after 62 minutes, but was unable to affect the score. Donaldson started against Haiti, and scored the only goal of the match after 62 minutes with a header from a corner.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E
