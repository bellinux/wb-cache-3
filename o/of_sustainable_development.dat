5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. Sustainability science is the study <b>of</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> and environmental science.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Castro embraced environmentalism, campaigning against {{global warming and}} the waste of natural resources, and accusing the U.S. of being the world's primary polluter. In 1994 a {{ministry}} dedicated to the environment was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use of natural resources. By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which met the United Nations Development Programme's definition <b>of</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>development,</b> with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8. Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro maintained his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, he was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. Mandela praised Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally. He later attended Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994. In 2001 he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of racial stereotypes through U.S. film.|$|E

Starting with building and moving towards sustainable neighbourhood and then towards the sustainable urban and regional areas is a good attempt to get an overall approach to the <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> rather than thinking about the different links and missing out the final goal and objectives <b>of</b> the <b>sustainable</b> <b>development.</b> Readers will find this article to get the overall picture that emerges after the continued efforts at different levels, international, national level, regional, neighbourhood and building level in such a lucid manner that any non-technical person can easily understand the concept <b>of</b> the <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> and various prevalent <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> strategies and approaches...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{seeks to}} define and build the {{formation}} mechanism for airport <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> capacity.

Findings: The most influencing factors are: airport own investment, Gross Domestic Product and power consumption of unit income. Originality/value: Firstly, {{a new concept to}} evaluate the dynamic work on <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> is proposed, which is defined as airport <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> capacity.   Secondly, the formation mechanism <b>of</b> airport <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> capacity is studied through Structure Equation Model and System Dynamics model.
