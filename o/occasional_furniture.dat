5000|$|Lee's first {{significant}} musical project {{was the new}} wave band Furniture (best known for their Top 30 UK chart hit [...] "Brilliant Mind") for which he, Whelan and Irvin were founder members and contributing songwriters. Lee played drums, percussion and <b>occasional</b> keyboards for <b>Furniture</b> throughout the band's existence between 1979 and 1991 (playing on {{all four of the}} band's albums and all of their singles), and helped to bring in relatively unusual instrumentation such as tongue-drum. During the latter half of Furniture's existence, Lee was also a member (alongside Whelan) of the Ealing-based post-punk/psychedelic band The Transmitters, for which he played drums and sampler between 1987 and 1989.|$|R
6000|$|Chayter honoured Nick with a regard which approached, {{though not}} {{improperly}} competing with it, the affection his master had {{placed on the}} same young head, and Chayter knew a good many things. Among them he knew his place; but it was wonderful how little that knowledge had rendered him inaccessible to other kinds. He took upon himself to send for Nick without speaking to Mrs. Lendon, whose influence was now a good deal like that of some large <b>occasional</b> piece of <b>furniture</b> introduced on a contingency. She {{was one of the}} solid conveniences that a comfortable house would have, but you couldn't talk with a mahogany sofa or a folding screen. Chayter knew how much she had [...] "had" [...] from her brother, and how much her two daughters had each received on marriage; and he was of the opinion that it was quite enough, especially considering the society in which they--you could scarcely call it--moved. He knew beyond this that they would all have more, and that was why he hesitated little about communicating with Nick. If Mrs. Lendon should be ruffled at the intrusion of a young man who neither was the child of a cousin nor had been formally adopted, Chayter was parliamentary enough to see that the forms of debate were observed. He had indeed a slightly compassionate sense that Mrs. Lendon was not easily ruffled. She was always down an extraordinary time before breakfast--Chayter refused to take it as in the least admonitory--but usually went straight into the garden as if to see that none of the plants had been stolen in the night, and had in the end to be looked for by the footman in some out-of-the-way spot behind the shrubbery, where, plumped upon the ground, she was mostly doing something [...] "rum" [...] to a flower.|$|R

50|$|Nimura and Sato was an American {{furniture}} manufacturer {{best known}} for its Japanese inspired <b>occasional</b> <b>furniture.</b> It was located at 707 Fulton Street in downtown Brooklyn, New York. Since Nimura and Sato also imported furniture from Asia, confusion sometimes arises as to whether a piece bearing the Nimura and Sato label was manufactured by the partnership or merely imported and retailed by them.|$|E
50|$|Gradually, after 1966, Green’s firm {{expanded}} into {{other parts of}} the building as they became vacant until, by 1973, the firm owned the entire freehold and was established as a pioneer of huge furniture and carpet showrooms with hundreds of rolls of broadloom carpet and vinyl, dozens of three piece suites, scores of beds, range after range of bedroom and dining room furniture and many pieces of <b>occasional</b> <b>furniture.</b> Later a special shop for curtains and dress fabrics was opened in the High Street.|$|E

When Wanek moved to Arcadia to open his own factory he took with him Eugene Vogel's son, Chuck. The two began doing production work for Ashley Furniture.

At first the two companies maintained their separate identities, with Arcadia focusing on production and Ashley on sales.|$|E
