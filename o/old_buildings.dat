5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising <b>old</b> <b>buildings,</b> with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss of}} <b>old</b> <b>buildings.</b> Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s most <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> {{had been}} {{demolished}} or were in institutional use as traffic noise had driven away residents {{but a few}} residential properties remained. Albert, Duke of York lived at No.145 {{at the time of}} his accession as King George VI in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Cut stone {{originally}} {{facing the}} buildings {{was taken to}} build the new buildings of Santa Cruz del Quiché; the ruins were still being mined for construction material through the late 19th century, doing extensive damage to {{the remains of the}} <b>old</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|E
5|$|From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship. With {{no need for}} elaborate buildings divided up by ritual there was widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration. There was a need to adapt <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> and build new churches suitable for reformed services, particularly by putting the pulpit and preaching at the centre of worship.|$|E
50|$|The school's <b>old</b> <b>building,</b> at the {{junction}} of College Street and Vertia Street, about four blocks away from the current building, was constructed in 1921. It was designed in Classical Revival style by architect C.C. Muse. A new classroom building was built across College Street in 1937, after which the <b>old</b> <b>building</b> was used less and less. The <b>old</b> <b>building</b> {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 2002.|$|R
50|$|In Heist-Goor there's an <b>old</b> <b>building</b> called 'The Mollehoef', it {{was built}} in 1728, and {{therefore}} it is the <b>oldest</b> <b>building</b> of the hamlet. The street in which it is built was later called 'Mollehoefweg' (Mollehoef road).|$|R

5|$|The Industrial Revolution brought {{large-scale}} {{steel making}} to Sheffield in the 18th century. Much {{of the medieval}} town was gradually replaced by a mix of Georgian and Victorian buildings. Large areas of Sheffield's city centre have been rebuilt in recent years, but among the modern buildings, some <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> have been retained.|$|E
5|$|The {{high street}} {{contains}} many <b>old</b> <b>buildings.</b> The Beeches {{was built in}} 1762, with walls, railings, gates and piers of the same date, although the side wings were added later. Acacia House and Igbetti House, which was formerly known as Myrtle House, are from the same period, while Barle House, Holly House, The Sycamores and Portugal House are slightly more recent.|$|E
5|$|Troy's {{downtown}} began reviving. In 1993, Martin Scorsese {{used the}} Second Street area, particularly the Paine Mansion, {{and some of}} the Russell Sage buildings as locations for his adaptation of Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence, since they replicated the appearance of 1870s Manhattan. River Street became home to many antique stores. Developers began buying the <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> and adapting them to contemporary uses.|$|E

5|$|Bramantyo {{attempted}} to make his film as historically accurate as possible. However, as no documentation of Dahlan's life {{before he went to}} Mecca exists, the scenes showing Dahlan's youth were fictionalized. The script underwent 12 revisions before the film was completed. Much of the film's budget of Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) was spent on costumes and sets to ensure accuracy. The crew restored several <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> for their shots and custom-ordered 19th-century style traditional garments for their scenes.|$|E
5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> or utility poles.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, {{the monastery}} {{frequently}} lost and regained its ownership rights. On the funds of the monastery's new hegumen Afanasiy (a protégé of prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski), the monastery's <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> were demolished, and new ones {{were built in}} their place. In 1604, the Gate Church of Ss. Peter and Paul was constructed, in 1609 - the Mykilska Refectory, and the Transfiguration Cathedral in 1609-1611. Under his rule, the monastery was considered as the second lavra (cave monastery) in Ukraine.|$|E
50|$|The town’s main church (Saint Peter) {{was erected}} in 1755 {{on the site}} of a much <b>older</b> <b>building</b> and {{perpendicular}} to it, with funds from the abbey of Forest. Traces of the <b>older</b> <b>building</b> can still be seen on the left of the current church.|$|R

5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Like many <b>old</b> <b>buildings,</b> Ordsall Hall has {{stories of}} hauntings. The White Lady who {{is said to}} appear in the Great Hall or Star Chamber is popularly {{believed}} to be Margaret Radclyffe, who died of a broken heart in 1599 following the death at sea of her twin, Alexander. There are webcams overseeing the areas that are said to be the most haunted. An episode of the television programme Most Haunted was filmed in the hall in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{redevelopment}} and anti-Victorianism {{resulted in}} the loss of dozens of Victorian buildings like New Street station and the old Central Library, often replaced by brutalist architecture. Sir Herbert Manzoni, City Engineer and Surveyor of Birmingham from 1935 until 1963, believed conservation of <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> was sentimental and that the city did not have any of worth anyway. In inner-city areas too, much Victorian housing was demolished and redeveloped. Existing communities were relocated to tower block estates like Castle Vale.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, the {{completion}} of the school did not mean an end to the usage of the <b>old</b> <b>building's</b> facilities. When the school was completed, it lacked athletic fields, which were still under construction. For at least the first year, sporting events were held at the <b>old</b> <b>building.</b>|$|R

5|$|Sale's built {{environment}} is varied, {{with a mixture}} of modern and <b>old</b> <b>buildings.</b> Some terraces, semi-detached houses and villas, survive from the Victorian period, although many of the larger houses have been converted into flats. Many semi-detached houses survive from the 1930s, when there was a need for new housing in the town {{as a result of a}} growing population and an increasingly wealthy middle class. Interspersed with these older structures are newer housing developments, such as the estates built in Ashton upon Mersey and the east of Sale during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{banks of}} the Someșul Mic also feature {{a wide variety of}} such <b>old</b> <b>{{building}}s.</b> The end of the 19th century brought a building ensemble that fastens the corners of the oldest bridge over the river, {{at the north end of}} the Regele Ferdinand Avenue. The Berde, Babos, Elian, Urania, and Széki palaces consist of a mixture of Baroque, Renaissance and Gothic styles, following the Art Nouveau/Secession and Revival specifics.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{settlements}} on Portland, the largest being Fortuneswell in Underhill and Easton on Tophill. Castletown and Chiswell {{are the other}} villages in Underhill, and Weston, Southwell, Wakeham and the Grove are on the Tophill plateau. Many <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> are built out of Portland Stone; Several parts have been designated Conservation Areas to preserve the unique character the older settlements which date back hundreds of years. The architecture; the natural and man-made environment and the proximity to the sea give Portland overall character which is quite distinct.|$|E
