5|$|Italy was MGM's top {{choice for}} hosting the {{production}}. However, {{a number of}} countries—including France, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom—were also considered. Cinecittà Studios, a very large motion picture production facility constructed in 1937 {{on the outskirts of}} Rome, was identified early on as the primary shooting location. Zimbalist hired Wyler's long-term production supervisor, Henry Henigson, to oversee the film, and art directors William A. Horning and Edward Carfagno created the overall look of the film, relying on the more than five years of research which had already been completed for the production.

5|$|Level-5 {{collaborated with}} Studio Ghibli {{to produce the}} game's {{animated}} sequences, and the game features graphics and visuals replicating the traditional animation style <b>of</b> <b>Studio</b> Ghibli films. The collaboration began when musician Naoya Fujimaki, who had previously worked with both companies, introduced Level-5 president Akihiro Hino to Studio Ghibli president Toshio Suzuki. At the time, Studio Ghibli had completed work on Ponyo (2008), and the animation team had no ongoing projects, which influenced Suzuki's decision to collaborate with Level-5. Another influencing factor of the collaboration was witnessing Hino's passion for the project. Studio Ghibli approached the production process {{in the same way}} that they would create an animated film. Work on the animation began in July 2008, and took much longer than the predicted three months.|$|E

5|$|Miyazaki's manga {{version of}} Nausicaä was written {{over a period}} of 12 years, with breaks taken to work on Studio Ghibli films. Serialized in Tokuma Shoten's Animage magazine, the first chapter was {{published}} in February 1982 and the last chapter in March 1994. Miyazaki adapted and altered the work for the film because only sixteen chapters of the manga were written {{at the time of the}} film's production. The manga would continue to be produced until the seventh and final book was released on 15 January 1995. The English localization was initially done by Toren Smith and Dana Lewis <b>of</b> <b>Studio</b> Proteus.
