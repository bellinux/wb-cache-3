5|$|Much of {{southern}} Massachusetts, from its border with New York toward Worcester {{and to the}} ocean, experienced flooding. Most streams in western Massachusetts overflowed their banks, and in southeastern Massachusetts, which is largely flat terrain, streams flooded large areas along their channels; these streams moved slowly, while other areas in New England sustained damage due to the fast-moving nature of the floods. Record flooding was reported along 24stream gauges in the state, including ones that surpassed the peak set by the 1938 New England hurricane. Both the Charles and Neponset rivers were among those that flooded. About 40% {{of the city of}} Worcester was flooded during Diane, and in Russell, the state police forced many residents to evacuate. In Weymouth, the floods were considered at least a 1 in 50 year event. The Little River in Buffumville, Massachusetts had a peak discharge of 8,340ft³/s (236m³/s), which was 6.2times greater than the previous peak and 28.5times the average annual flooding. Flooded rivers breached run-of-the-river dams and covered nearby roadways, although dams with reservoirs resulted in less flooding. Nearly all dams along the French River were severely damaged or destroyed. One failed dam in West Auburn washed out a portion of U.S. Route 20, and the same route was washed out near Charlton. An overflown brook also damaged the Massachusetts Turnpike. A train on the Boston and Albany Railroad line plunged into a washed <b>out</b> <b>portion</b> along the Westfield River. Along the same river, floods destroyed roads and tobacco farms. In the state, 97houses were destroyed. Damage in Massachusetts was second worst of the affected states, totaling $110million; the damage was largely due to flooded basements. There were 12deaths in the state.|$|E

[...] However, unlike typical variable-sweep wing aircraft which sweeps at different angles at different speed, the outer portion of the main wing of the Mad Worrior at supersonic speed folds upward to a ninety degree position perpendicular to the inner portion of the main wing.

One of such {{difference is that the}} canards of Mad Warrior are swept wings instead of delta wings used on X-36, but the canards of Mad Warrior UAV would be completely retracted into the fuselage at supersonic speed to reduce drag.

This he contrasts with a version that includes the ruled out phrase: [...] "In the Hebrew version of his book, however, four Hebrew words have been added making it read, 'We do not want and do not need to expel Arabs and take their place'". Simons suggests that the ruled-out version should not be used because: [...] "... these same additional four words (together with the previous two and a half lines) are in fact crossed out in Ben-Gurion’s handwritten letter! In the published edition of this letter, the Editor (and, according to Shabtai Teveth, with the consent of Ben-Gurion) completely omitted this sentence!" [...] He then describes the conflicting interpretations of Morris and Karsh, plus Teveth's critique of Morris' opinion. Simons also criticised Karsh's view that [...] "Ben-Gurion had constantly and completely opposed the transfer of Arabs". He sides with Morris' view who he writes [...] "gives a number of examples of how Ben-Gurion supported the transfer of Arabs from Palestine, and he wrote: 'But at no point during the 1930s and 1940s did Ben-Gurion ever go on record against the idea or policy of transfer. On the contrary, Ben-Gurion left a paper trail a mile long as to his actual thinking, and no amount of ignoring, twisting and turning, manipulation, contortion, and distortion can blow it away."

Symptoms of stem rot were rotted patches on rhizome and pseudo stem, gradual wilting of leaves from lower area to upper part of plant canopy, stunted growth, abnormal leaves and bunches, toppling of crown and fruiting body adhere on pseudo stem. A banana field at Thirunelvely, recorded disease incidence as high as 44. 44 %. The disease severity was 96. 3 % in left <b>out</b> <b>portion</b> of pseudostem, which yielded bunch already, 62. 63 % in mature plants and 23. 02 % in suckers. An antagonistic fungus, Trichoderma spp. showed suppressive effect on Marasmiellus sp. grown on PDA by using dual culture technique. Trichoderma harzianum and T. viride inhibited 80. 6 % and 92 % mycelia growth of Marasmiellus sp, respectively. Poison food method revealed that maximum inhibition was with Azadirachta indica (79. 19 %) and Ocimum sanctum (59. 96 %) than Lantana camara, Zingeber officinale and Curcuma longa under in-vitro conditions. This information will help to create awareness among extension workers and growers about Marasmiellus sp. causing stem rot disease on banana in Jaffna peninsula and also helpful to restrict its spread in newer areas through infected suckers and other means.
