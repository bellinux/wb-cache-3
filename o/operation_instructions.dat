[...] The Central Command <b>Operation</b> <b>Instructions</b> were more specific: [...] "carry out destruction and maximum killings." [...] One hundred and thirty IDF soldiers, of whom a third came from Unit 101, carried out the operation. They carried 70kg of explosives, blew up 45 houses, and killed 69 people. The international criticism over the killed civilians led to a change of tactics. It was the last large-scale IDF attack on civilian buildings. In the future, targets were to be the Arab Legion, the Frontier Police, and the Egyptian or Syrian Armies. Dayan merged Unit 101 with the Paratroopers Brigade and assigned its command to the commander of 101 who had led the Qibya attack, Ariel Sharon.|$|E

A designated battalion signal officer prepares the battalion SOI in conformance with the SOI of higher headquarters. [...] Units maintained 2 copies of the SOI: a training version and a [...] "go-to-war" [...] version. During operations, SOI are changed daily. Since the fielding of the SINCGARS system, however, the paper SOI has generally faded from Army use. Electronic SOI are now generated, distributed and loaded along with cryptographic keys.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince {{the intakes}} outflow {{variations}} {{have an impact}} on network performance, it is necessary to evaluate the behavior of different types of intake structures in unsteady flow condition. In the present study, a computer model has been developed in which unsteady Saint–Venant flow equations have been discretized using finite difference and Crank–Nicolson method. Water surface elevation at junctions is calculated implicitly using matrix properties and influence line technique. After model verification, main channel of Miandarband irrigation network and its five branches were simulated. The result showed that without any <b>operation</b> <b>instruction,</b> a 10 % decrease in the upstream flow discharge will reduce the slid gate, Neyrpic single orifice Module and double orifice Module intakes outflows for about 17. 6 %, 3. 04 % and 2. 56 %, respectively.

5000|$|The {{primary focus}} of this article is {{asynchronous}} control in digital electronic systems. [...] In a synchronous system, <b>operations</b> (<b>instructions,</b> calculations, logic, etc.) are coordinated by one, or more, centralized clock signals. An asynchronous digital system, in contrast, has no global clock. Asynchronous systems do not depend on strict arrival times of signals or messages for reliable operation. Coordination is achieved via events such as: packet arrival, changes (transitions) of signals, handshake protocols, and other methods.|$|R
