5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book <b>of</b> {{criticism}} <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> plays, {{written by}} {{early nineteenth century}} English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed {{in reaction to the}} neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to cover all <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|R
500|$|Judith Quiney (baptised 2 February 1585– 9 February 1662), née Shakespeare, was {{the younger}} {{daughter}} <b>of</b> William <b>Shakespeare</b> and Anne Hathaway and the fraternal twin <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> only son Hamnet Shakespeare. She married Thomas Quiney, a vintner of Stratford-upon-Avon. The {{circumstances of the}} marriage, including Quiney's misconduct, may have prompted the rewriting <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> will. Thomas was struck out, while Judith's inheritance was attached with provisions to safeguard it from her husband. [...] The bulk <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare's</b> estate was left, in an elaborate fee tail, to his elder daughter Susanna and her male heirs.|$|R
5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that {{can be attributed to}} the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare.</b> (They include a portrait of the priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has a striking resemblance to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare</b> to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
5|$|In response, Jacob Tonson and his associates, who {{controlled}} the copyright {{of the current}} edition <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare,</b> threatened to sue Johnson and Cave in a letter written on 11 April 1745.

5|$|The sleepwalking {{scene is}} one of the more celebrated scenes from Macbeth, and, indeed, in all <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare.</b> It has no {{counterpart}} in Holinshed's Chronicles, Shakespeare's source material for the play, but is solely the bard's invention.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare</b> was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|In another work <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare,</b> Othello (1603), it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that he has made another reference. In act 5, scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its constant stream of tears (Myrrha's tears). The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses, just like his previously written poem, Venus and Adonis, did.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th and 20th century, Romeo and Juliet {{has often}} been the choice <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare</b> plays to open a {{classical}} theatre company, beginning with Edwin Booth's inaugural production of that play in his theatre in 1869, the newly re-formed company of the Old Vic in 1929 with John Gielgud, Martita Hunt, and Margaret Webster, {{as well as the}} Riverside Shakespeare Company in its founding production in New York City in 1977, which used the 1968 film of Franco Zeffirelli's production as its inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{began work}} on Macbeth to provide a sample of what he thought could be {{achieved}} in a new edition <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare.</b> He got much of his information while working on the Harleian Catalogue, a catalogue of the collection of works and pamphlets owned by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. He published this work, along with a commentary on Sir Thomas Hanmer, 4th Baronet's edition of Shakespeare's plays, as Miscellaneous Observations or Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth on 6 April 1745 by Edward Cave.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{seeing a}} {{production}} of Hamlet starring Sir Frank Benson, Richardson decided to become an actor and made his stage debut, playing a gendarme in The Bishop's Candlesticks in December 1920. After touring and appearing in rep, he made his London debut in July 1926 as the stranger in Oedipus at Colonus. In 1930 he joined the Old Vic where he first met Gielgud, staying with the company until the following year. After service during the Second World War with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, he returned to acting, preferring {{the works of the}} more modern authors Luigi Pirandello, Joe Orton, Harold Pinter, George Bernard Shaw and J. B. Priestley to the classic plays <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare.</b> A radio career ran in parallel to that on the stage, and Richardson was first broadcast in The City in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Having already famously played Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice on the Yiddish {{stage at}} the People's Theater, he played the role again in a 1903 Broadway production, {{directed}} by Arthur Hopkins. In this production, Adler spoke his lines in Yiddish {{while the rest of}} the cast spoke in English. The New York Times review of Adler's performance was not favorable: in particular his naturalistic acting style was not what audiences of the period expected in a production <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare.</b> Some other reviews (such as that in Theater magazine) were friendlier; in any event the same production was revived two years later.|$|E
5|$|His early {{major works}} for the voice {{included}} The Masque at Kenilworth (1864); an oratorio, The Prodigal Son (1869); and a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea (1871). He composed a ballet, L'Île Enchantée (1864) and incidental music for a number <b>of</b> <b>Shakespeare</b> plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.|$|E
