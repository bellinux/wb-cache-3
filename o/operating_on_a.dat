5|$|Gasol {{canceled}} {{his original}} plans {{to observe a}} surgery when he came down with a low-grade fever {{the day before the}} operation, not wishing to risk infecting anyone at the hospital. He was able to reschedule his observation for June 2010, witnessing Skaggs lead a team <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 13-year-old girl from Colorado with scoliosis.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Kraft {{began his}} studies at Virginia Tech {{and became a}} member of the Corps of Cadets. During his {{freshman}} year, he attempted to enlist in the military as a U.S. Navy cadet but was rejected because of a burned right hand that he had suffered at age three. Because of wartime demands, Virginia Tech was <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> twelve-month schedule, and Kraft finished his degree in only two years. He graduated in December 1944 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering.|$|E
5|$|Much of the system's core, {{including}} the LWKT subsystem, the IPI messaging subsystem {{and the new}} kernel memory allocator, are lockless, meaning that they work without using mutexes, with each process <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single CPU. Critical sections are used to protect against local interrupts, individually for each CPU, guaranteeing that a thread currently being executed will not be preempted.|$|E

5|$|Sri Lanka's {{electricity}} demand is currently met by nine thermal power stations, fifteen large hydroelectric power stations, and fifteen wind farms, {{with a smaller}} share from small hydro facilities and other renewables such as solar. Most hydroelectric and thermal/fossil fuel–based power stations {{in the country are}} owned and/or operated by the government via the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), while the renewable energy sector consists mostly of privately run plants <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> power purchase agreement with the CEB.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no medical}} {{facilities}} on Herm and no resident doctor. A small team of first aiders and community first responders is maintained amongst the resident population, and receives regular training from the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service, {{a private company}} <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> charitable basis {{under the umbrella of}} the Venerable Order of Saint John. Medical evacuation to hospital in Guernsey, where necessary, is achieved by means of the ambulance launch 'Flying Christine III' operated by the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the show was <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> strict budget, shots of the Chinese {{freighter}} were almost entirely created by digital technology or other special effects. For the opening scene of the ship at sea, a matte painting of a boat based on a toy model was superimposed onto a film strip of an empty ocean. Several scenes featuring the boat in port were created by filming an empty harbor and then superimposing a ship via digital technology. Special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich created a latex appliance that enabled the veterinarian to have his throat bitten out.|$|E

5|$|On 13 August 2012, Fuller {{signed for}} League Two side Barnet on a free transfer, along with Gillingham team-mate Curtis Weston. He made his debut for the Bees in a 1–1 draw with Bristol Rovers on 21 August 2012. He {{would go on}} to make 39 league appearances, {{cementing}} his place as the club's first choice right-back. Barnet started the 2012–13 season poorly, failing to win any of their first 12 league matches and were ultimately relegated to the Conference on goal difference after finishing in 23rd place. Barnet's relegation required manager Edgar Davids to release a number of players as an austerity measure to accommodate the fact that the club would be <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> smaller wage budget in the 2013–14 season, and it was announced on 22 May 2013 that Fuller would be released along with 12 other players.|$|E

25|$|The SeaBus {{is capable}} of <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 12-minute {{turnaround}} (down to 10 minutes with simultaneous loading and unloading). However, at the higher speeds, the wake created disturbs other users of the Burrard Inlet. During overloads they do sometimes operate at the higher speeds.|$|E

It is a direct feed of Ten Melbourne with local advertising. Darwin Digital Television opened transmission on 28 April 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Human Torch also {{returns from}} his own apparent demise, casting doubt on the Vision's identity. The Vision and the Scarlet Witch's children are then revealed to be fragments of {{the soul of the}} demon Mephisto, who had been broken apart by Franklin Richards shortly before the birth of the twins. The twins are absorbed back into Mephisto, which temporarily drives Wanda insane. Although she recovers, Wanda and the Vision separate, each <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> different Avengers team.|$|E

25|$|Previously a three tier system, Belgian law {{enforcement}} now {{consists of two}} police forces <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> federal and local level. While the two services remain independent, they integrate for purposes of recruitment and common training. This structural reform occurred in 2001 following a national parliamentary report {{into a series of}} paedophile murders which proved police negligence and severely diminished public confidence. Currently, approximately 33,000 local police and 900 civilians work across 196 regional police forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{museum was}} opened to {{visitors}} on its current {{site for the}} first time in 1972, with the first translocated buildings (the railway station and colliery winding engine) being erected the following year. The first trams began <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> short demonstration line in 1973. The Town station was formally opened in 1976, the same year the reconstruction of the colliery winding engine house was completed, and the miner's cottages were relocated. Opening of the drift mine as an exhibit followed in 1979.|$|E
25|$|From all accounts, H220 was {{a success}} even though it spent its life hauling {{services}} and <b>operating</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line it was not specifically designed for. Although one-off locomotives are often consigned to a short operating life or underutilised due to non-standardisation of parts and maintenance requirements, H220 remained in service until finally being superseded by diesel electric locomotives in the late 1950s. In a service life of 15 years 3 months, it clocked up a total of 821,860 miles (1,322,660km), averaging over 4,800 miles per month.|$|E
