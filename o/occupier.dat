5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the <b>occupier</b> takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an <b>occupier</b> of land can also be liable {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 {{the site}} was bought by {{property}} developers Regalian Properties. A competition to develop {{the site was}} won by architect Terry Farrell, with an urban village as Farrell's original proposal. A scheme of office blocks was subsequently developed for the site, with a government agency as their <b>occupier.</b> The building had been sold for £130million in 1989, with construction planned to take three years, built by John Laing. SIS ultimately became the occupiers of the building. Farrell's design for the SIS building was influenced by 1930s industrial modernist architecture such as Bankside and Battersea Power Stations and Mayan and Aztec religious temples.|$|E
5|$|Nonnebakken, a {{hill in the}} Odense area, is {{the site}} of one of Denmark's six former Viking ring castles, built during the reign of Sweyn Forkbeard, who had forced his father Harold Bluetooth to leave the country and seek refuge by the Jomsvikings in Wollin (modern Poland) in around 975. The fort {{provided}} its <b>occupier</b> the command of the Odense River passing next to the hill. The archaeological remains of the fort were heavily damaged when a building for the Odd Fellow lodge was constructed on the site during the late nineteenth century.|$|E
40|$|The {{extent and}} nature of low-income owner {{occupation}} (Section 1) • There are an estimated 145, 000 households in Scotland who own their houses (either outright or with a mortgage) and have incomes below £ 6, 000 per annum. • 45 % of all households with incomes below £ 6, 000 are owner <b>occupiers.</b> • Scotland has proportionately fewer low-income householders who are owner <b>occupiers</b> {{than the rest of}} the UK. • The majority (two thirds) of low-income owner <b>occupiers</b> own their houses outright i. e. have no mortgage. • The geographical distribution of low-income owner <b>occupiers</b> mirrors that of all owner <b>occupiers</b> apart from a higher than average proportion (9 %) living in remote rural areas. • A third of low-income owner <b>occupiers</b> live in a flat or maisonette. • Just over half of low-income owner <b>occupiers</b> had lived in their current homes for more than 15 years, compared with a third of all owner <b>occupiers.</b> • One in three low-income owner <b>occupiers</b> who had moved within the previous year were “new ” entrants to this sector.

50|$|Compared {{to other}} cities where the Occupy {{movement}} has taken root, Occupy Buffalo's {{relations with the}} city were relatively amicable. The <b>Occupiers</b> and the city had a contract that allowed the <b>Occupiers</b> to encamp in Niagara Square, which expired January 31, 2012. During December 2011, the city allowed the installation of a 20-foot geodesic dome on the southwest portion of Niagara Square. A separate splinter group of <b>Occupiers</b> attempted to encamp in Lafayette Square without the city's permission; the four <b>Occupiers</b> were evicted from that location on December 22, 2011 with one arrest.|$|R
50|$|On 22 March 2011, the University {{made the}} {{decision}} to ask the <b>occupiers</b> to voluntarily leave. When the <b>occupiers</b> refused and informed supporters, crowds started to gather outside Hetherington House and Strathclyde Police were called by University security to assist. When students were forcibly removed from the premises, the remaining <b>occupiers</b> agreed to leave. In response to the eviction, a subsequent protest on the same day occupied the Senate and management suite of the University. After negotiations, the University offered <b>occupiers</b> the option of returning to Hetherington House, an offer which they accepted.|$|R
5|$|The tomb of {{the lord}} of the goats: it is the largest in the necropolis; it {{includes}} two depositional chambers and is reached through a vertical shaft. The <b>occupier</b> of the tomb is not known with certainty, he is called {{the lord of the}} goats by archaeologists due to the existence of a throne decorated with bronze goat heads in the tomb. A silver cup that has the name of king Immeya inscribed was found in the tomb making that king the most likely owner of the burial.|$|E
5|$|When {{a person}} dies in a house, the death must be {{notified}} {{to the authorities}} within 24 hours by the <b>occupier</b> {{of the house in}} which to his or her knowledge the death took place, the relatives of the deceased present at his or her death or in attendance during the last illness of the deceased, or each person present at the death. If those persons fail to do so, another inmate of the house or the person causing the body of the deceased person to be buried.|$|E
5|$|In March 1940, {{two months}} before the start of World War II in Belgium, Bob, his second child, was born. When the first tribulations of the war were over, Vandersteen could restart his work at L'Innovation. From November 1940 until August 1942, he created his first {{published}} comic, Kitty Inno, for the company, consisting of short, simple gags. When the German <b>occupier</b> forbade the publication of American and British comics in the Belgian newspapers and magazines, opportunies arose for local people. On 19 March 1941, the first comic strip of Tor de holbewoner (Tor the troglodyte) appeared in the newspaper De Dag. It continued until January 1942. Already on 26 March 1941 it was joined by De lollige avonturen van Pudifar (The funny adventures of Pudifar), a weekly comic strip about a cat. This was in May of the same year replaced by Barabitje, another comic about a cat, which ended in October 1941.|$|E

5|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' liability. The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} <b>occupier,</b> as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the liability for visitors. The Act introduced an element of liability for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E
5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the <b>occupier</b> {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E
5|$|The house {{seems to}} have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the <b>occupier</b> of it, and, there being a large garden {{belonging}} to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a Ridotto al Fresco, a term which {{the people of this country}} had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) from the {{perspective}} of property <b>occupiers.</b> The issues that property <b>occupiers</b> should consider when analysing the potential benefits that a BID could deliver are identified and reasoned. The differing approaches to BIDs in the UK and North America are contrasted, and <b>occupiers</b> are alerted to the need to think differently in these locations — especially in respect of ‘voting power’. The ‘property cost paradox’ is also explored. This leads on to the relative merits of involving property owners — in addition to <b>occupiers</b> — in the strategy and funding of a BID in the UK...|$|R

5000|$|The Declaration was not {{intended}} to be a policy statement or political platform, though it does explain the purpose of the Occupation. It consists of an introduction, {{in the form of a}} Preamble, a list of formal Grievances, and a Call to Action, requesting the reader to judge for themselves whether the <b>Occupiers</b> are justified in their actions. Three choices of response are offered; to join, to support or to fight the <b>Occupiers.</b> An appeal concludes, suggesting that the reader should come and help the <b>Occupiers</b> by reasoning together to discover of solutions for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The <b>Occupiers</b> then declare a challenge, declaring that they will remain in the Square [...] "until the 99% awaken".|$|R

5000|$|A {{trend has}} {{developed}} in the global movement for some <b>occupiers</b> to take significant actions autonomously without waiting for approval from an assembly. Professor Grace Davie reports that at an Occupy Wall Street meeting to discuss general assemblies, held in late December 2011, several participants expressed dissatisfaction with them. Yet other <b>occupiers</b> were advocating for even greater use.One of the more enthusiastic <b>occupiers</b> predicts a [...] "coming age of General Assemblies" [...] which he thinks may be [...] "Humankind’s best hope".On 4 January 2012, The Future of Occupy Collective, an organisation set up by <b>occupiers,</b> published their first newsletter {{on the future of}} assemblies, where they said: [...] "Continuing to hold General Assemblies, in one way or another, seems more important than ever".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Occupiers</b> {{packed up}} the camp on 10 December 2011, stating {{that they wanted}} to focus on the Bath People's Assembly and on direct action in the area, stating [...] "This is only the beginning". They claimed that up to 50 people had been camping in Queen Square {{at the height of the}} Occupation. Despite {{previous}} warnings from B&NES council, the <b>Occupiers</b> were not forced to move. B&NES council said that they planned to send in teams to clean up Queen Square once the <b>Occupiers</b> have left.|$|R

25|$|For {{this reason}} {{the scope of}} implied {{licenses}} is strictly limited in New Zealand. The Supreme Court has said an implied license is unlikely to exist if {{the purpose of the}} entry was not to make a reasonable inquiry or if it cannot be assumed that the <b>occupier</b> would have consented to the police entering had they known the particular purpose for the entry. An implied license can extend to allow entry into a private premises in certain circumstances but this will be in the minority of cases and there will generally be no right of access even where, for example, the door to the premises is open. An implied license can be revoked by the <b>occupier</b> through a clear unequivocal revocation, further, the existence of gates or signs may amount to a physical revocation.|$|E

40|$|Non-domestic {{rates are}} a tax that is {{formally}} levied on the <b>occupiers</b> of nondomestic {{property in the}} United Kingdom. This {{does not imply that}} it is only the <b>occupiers</b> of business and other non-domestic property who are made worse off by the imposition of ‘business rates’. Some or all of the effective burden of nondomestic rates may be shifted backwards from the <b>occupiers</b> of business property to the owners of business property. This occurs if the rents that property owners can charge their tenants are reduced by the imposition of business rates. In this case, the total cost of occupying a business property (i. e. rent plus rates) is increased by less than the full amount of the non-domestic rates paid by <b>occupiers,</b> and part of the burden of business rates is borne by property owners in the form of lower rental income than they would otherwise have received. The effective incidence of non-domestic rates is then said to fall partly on property owners, and only partly on <b>occupiers.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Where the two {{properties}} {{are in the}} same occupation but are not within the same curtilage nor contiguous to one another, each of them must as a general rule be treated as a separate hereditament for rating purposes: and this is the case even though they are used by the <b>occupier</b> for the purposes of his one whole business.|$|E
25|$|Beneficial {{occupation}} – of some {{benefit to}} the <b>occupier.</b> It {{is not necessary to}} consider financial profit, as the test here is whether someone will pay rent for the property.
