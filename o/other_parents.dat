5|$|An autopsy reveals Wells' {{death was}} the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious {{district}} attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, and has never been accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his son to the daycare, but <b>other</b> <b>parents</b> protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the fence around the daycare.|$|E
5|$|Following the British {{declaration}} of war with Germany on 4 August 1914, Speyer resigned as a partner of the Frankfurt branch of the bank. After a Royal Proclamation on 11 September 1914 requiring British subjects to have no links with companies doing business with Germany, Speyer resigned as a partner of the American bank. Nonetheless, suspicions regarding Speyer's German parentage led to a hate campaign against him. Crowds gathered outside his home and jeered visitors. Accusations of his disloyalty and treachery appeared in the Press, and {{he was accused of}} signalling to German submarines from his Norfolk house. Lady Speyer was ostracised from societies and associations of which she had formerly been a member. Speyer was asked to resign from the board of the Poplar Hospital due to threats of substantial reductions in donations if he remained. The couple was asked to remove their children from school as <b>other</b> <b>parents</b> were threatening to remove theirs.|$|E
50|$|Although not the {{intention}} of most parents, putting children {{in the middle of}} conflict is particularly detrimental. Examples of this are asking children to carry messages between parents, grilling children about the <b>other</b> <b>parent's</b> activities, and putting the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> {{down in front of the}} children. Children involved in high-conflict divorce or custody cases can experience varying forms of parental alienation, which courts often consider to be a form of child abuse. Specific examples of parental alienation include brainwashing the child to cease their relationship with the <b>other</b> <b>parent,</b> telling the child that the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> does not love them, teaching the child to call another adult by a parental name in effort to replace the <b>other</b> <b>parent,</b> limiting communication between the child and the <b>other</b> <b>parent,</b> and limiting quality time between the child and the <b>other</b> <b>parent.</b> If evidence reveals that a parent is actively alienating the child from their <b>other</b> <b>parent,</b> their case for custody can be severely damaged.|$|R

25|$|The Markov {{blanket of}} a node is {{the set of}} nodes {{consisting}} of its parents, its children, and any <b>other</b> <b>parents</b> of its children.

5000|$|Parental {{alienation}} lacks {{a single}} definition and its existence, cause, characteristics, {{and in particular}} the concept of parental alienation syndrome {{have been the subject of}} debate. Some formulations of the concept have emphasized the role of an alienating parent, termed variously the [...] "programming" [...] parent or [...] "embittered-chaotic parent".Recent descriptions, influenced by the research of Kelly and Johnston, have proposed a more complex analysis, in which all family members may play a role. This [...] "systems-based" [...] view acknowledges that a child may be alienated from one parent with no alienation programming from the <b>other</b> <b>parent.</b> The results of an empirical study also suggest that alienating behaviors by both parents are the norm in high-conflict divorces. Rejected parents, tend to lose a sense of warmth and empathy with the child. Instead, the rejected parent is often passive, depressed, anxious, and withdrawn - characteristics which may encourage further rejection. The parent that the child aligns with (the aligned parent) may engage in alienating behaviors, including undermining the <b>other</b> <b>parent.</b> These behaviors may be conscious and deliberate or may reflect a lack of awareness on the effect of the actions on the children. Direct alienating behaviors occur when one parent actively undermines the <b>other</b> <b>parent,</b> such as making derogatory remarks about the <b>other</b> <b>parent,</b> telling the child that the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> is responsible for the separation, or telling the child that the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> is the cause of financial difficulties. Indirect alienation behaviors occur when one parent fails to support access or contact with the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> or tacitly accepts the child's negative behaviour and comments towards the <b>other</b> <b>parent.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Family law {{proceedings}} {{that involve}} issues of residence and contact often generate the most acrimonious disputes. In extreme cases, one parent may accuse {{the other of}} trying to [...] "turn" [...] the child(ren) against him or her, allege some form of emotional, physical, or even sexual abuse by the <b>other</b> <b>parent,</b> the [...] "residential" [...] parent may disrupt the <b>other</b> <b>parent's</b> contact or communication with the child(ren), or a parent may remove the child from the jurisdiction in violation of court orders, so as to frustrate the <b>other</b> <b>parent's</b> contact with the children.|$|R
50|$|One common {{dysfunctional}} parental {{behavior is}} one parent's manipulation {{of a child}} {{in order to achieve}} some outcome adverse to the <b>other</b> <b>parent's</b> rights or interests. Examples include verbal manipulation such as spreading gossip about the <b>other</b> <b>parent,</b> communicating with the parent through the child (and in the process exposing the child to the risks of the <b>other</b> <b>parent's</b> displeasure with that communication) rather than doing so directly, trying to obtain information through the child (spying), or causing the child to dislike the <b>other</b> <b>parent,</b> with insufficient or no concern for the damaging effects of the parent's behavior on the child. While many instances of such manipulation occur in shared custody situations that have resulted from separation or divorce, it can also take place in intact families, where it is known as triangulation.|$|R

Parents of students at the school complained and the superintendent of schools warned Bachmann that the school was in violation of state law. Six months after the school's founding Bachmann resigned and the Christian orientation {{was removed from the}} curriculum, allowing the school to keep its charter.

25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. <b>Other</b> <b>parents</b> are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and {{want to know about the}} risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E
25|$|Korean {{courts have}} ruled {{that it may}} violate the {{constitution}} {{for the government to}} limit the amount of money hagwon can charge. In early 2008, the Seoul government was working on changes to the regulations to allow hagwons to set their own hours, citing individual choice as trumping regulation. However, the government reversed its position five days later. The regulations were criticized as ineffective because the city council possessed limited resources to monitor and enforce them. Along with these restrictions, hagwon also had to disclose their tuition amounts to the government so people could complain if the schools attempted to raise the tuition. The licenses of hagwon caught running false advertisements will be revoked. Hagwon are required to issue cash receipts. In July 2009, to help catch violators of these new regulations, the government started a program to reward people who reported them. The regulations were intended to reduce the cost of private education. However, some hagwon added weekend classes to compensate for shorter weekday classes. <b>Other</b> <b>parents</b> have sought out private tutors {{to make up for lost}} study time. Other hagwon simply ignored the regulations. It was reported in April 2009 that 67percent of hagwon sampled were found to have overcharged for tuition. Forty percent were found to have charged parents over two times the registered tuition amount.|$|E
5000|$|A {{parent who}} {{experienced}} {{feelings of inadequacy}} or abandonment in their childhood can have those feelings re-triggered by a divorce or breakup.

500|$|Many Northern cities {{also had}} de facto {{segregation}} policies, {{which resulted in}} a vast gulf in educational resources between black and white communities. In Harlem, New York, for example, not a single new school had been built {{since the turn of the}} century, nor did a single nursery school exist, even as the Second Great Migration caused overcrowding of existing schools. Existing schools tended to be dilapidated and staffed with inexperienced teachers. Northern officials were in denial of the segregation, but Brown helped stimulate activism among African-American parents like Mae Mallory who, with support of the NAACP, initiated a successful lawsuit against the city and State of New York on Browns principles. Mallory and thousands of <b>other</b> <b>parents</b> bolstered the pressure of the lawsuit with a school boycott in 1959. During the boycott, some of the first freedom schools of the period were established. The city responded to the campaign by permitting more open transfers to high-quality, historically-white schools.

500|$|Total {{incubation}} time is around 39â€“45 days. From above ground level, {{the first evidence}} that hatching has taken place is the arrival of an adult with a beak-load of fish.

Initially, one or <b>other</b> <b>parents</b> brood it, but as its appetite increases it is left alone for longer periods. Observations of a nest chamber have been made from an underground hide with peephole. It was found that the chick sleeps much of the time between its parents' visits and also involves itself in bouts of exercise. It rearranges its nesting material, picks up and drops small stones, flaps its immature wings, pulls at protruding root ends and pushes and strains against the unyielding wall of the burrow. It makes its way towards the entrance or along a side tunnel to defecate. The growing chick seems to anticipate the arrival of an adult, advancing along the burrow just before it arrives but not emerging into the open air. It retreats to the nest chamber as the adult bird brings in its load of fish.|$|E
