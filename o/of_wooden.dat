Other crops grown in the island are root crops (such as cassava, sweet potatoes), fruits and vegetables. The locals also engage in livestock raising for local consumption, and small-scale shipbuilding <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> boats and launches.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, Rommel took {{command of}} the German Army Group B in {{occupied}} France. He also {{took control of the}} Atlantic Wall defenses on the French coasts facing the United Kingdom and during a tour of anti-invasion fortifications Rommel concluded that the defenses would have to be improved, and quickly. He ordered millions <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> tree trunks and logs to be set against airborne forces. Barbed wire and tripwires were to be strung between the poles. On plans that Rommel sent to his subordinates, the complete system <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> poles and interconnecting wires was called Luftlandehindernis.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1845, fire {{destroyed}} much of London, {{which was}} at the time largely constructed <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> buildings. One of the first casualties was the town's only fire engine. This fire burned nearly 30 acres of land destroying 150 buildings before burning itself out later the same day. One-fifth of London was destroyed and this was the province's first million dollar fire.|$|E

5|$|Some of Marquis' {{photographs}} {{appeared in}} his books, but most remained unpublished. Marquis' daughters gave the negatives (about five hundred of them) to John Woodenlegs.

He was an educator, tribal president from 1955 to 1968, and founder of Chief Dull Knife College.|$|E
5|$|The first fleet battle, and {{the first}} ocean battle, {{involving}} ironclad warships was the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Waged between the Austrian and Italian navies, the battle pitted combined fleets <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> frigates and corvettes and ironclad warships on {{both sides in the}} largest naval battle between the battles of Navarino and Tsushima.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{transition}} from timber to stone keeps are unclear, and the process was slow and uneven, taking many years to take effect across the various regions. Traditionally {{it was believed that}} stone keeps had been adopted because of the cruder nature <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> buildings, the limited lifespan <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> fortifications and their vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as sophisticated as their stone equivalents. Some wooden keeps were not converted into stone for many years and were instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen. Nonetheless, stone became increasingly popular as a building material for keeps for both military and symbolic reasons.|$|E

5|$|A more {{substantial}} Bronze Age settlement {{is known to}} have existed; the remains of what may have been a causeway were discovered in 1934, in the form <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> piles unearthed by a farmer between Little Thetford and nearby Barway. A Bronze Age ring and a late Bronze Age sherd were excavated nearby. There {{have been a number of}} Bronze Age finds in the area, including a pre–701BC palstave at nearby Fordey farm, Barway, and at Little Thetford, a middle Bronze Age (1600–1001BC) rapier in 1953, and a late Bronze Age flesh-hook in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Adults have {{extremely}} variable lifespans, from {{weeks to}} years, {{depending on the}} species. Some wood-boring beetles can have extremely long life-cycles. It is believed that when furniture or house timbers are infested by beetle larvae, the timber already contained the larvae {{when it was first}} sawn up. A birch bookcase 40 years old released adult Eburia quadrigeminata (Cerambycidae), while Buprestis aurulenta and other Buprestidae have been documented as emerging as much as 51 years after manufacture <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> items.|$|E

5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. The ticket hall originally had a pair <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Jerusalem, Umar {{was led by}} Sophronius to various holy sites, {{including}} the Temple Mount. Seeing the poor state of where the Temple once stood, Umar ordered the area cleared of refuse and debris before having a wooden mosque built on the site. The earliest account of such a structure is given by the Gallic bishop Arculf, who visited Jerusalem between 679 and 682, and describes a very primitive house of prayer able to accommodate up to 3,000 worshippers, constructed <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> beams and boards over pre-existing ruins.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century onwards the Normans {{began to build}} new castles in stone and convert {{existing}} timber designs. This was initially a slow process, picking up speed towards {{the second half of}} the century. Traditionally this transition was believed to have been driven by the more crude nature <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> fortifications, the limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents. Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.|$|E

5|$|Fu: Fu were Chinese tally sticks made of bamboo, wood, metal (gold, silver, bronze) or jade {{and used}} as a proof of authorization. Most commonly, fu were made of wood or bamboo in sizes <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> slips or bamboo chopsticks. Although fu {{have been made in}} various shapes (such as tiger, dragon, turtle, snake, fish or human), most of them come {{in the shape of a}} tiger. Classical {{description}} of tallies is found in the Zhou li, which refers to the tallies of jade and horn, and mentions the shapes of tiger, human, dragon, seal, and banner.|$|E
5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite the lifting of the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 2nd century in North Africa, a {{distinctive}} type of nozzle tube shape was developed in the tradition of the terracotta tube dome at the Hellenistic era baths of Morgantina, an idea that had been preserved in the use of interlocking terracotta pots for kiln roofs. This tube could be mass-produced on potter's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent centering for concrete domes, avoiding the use <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> centering altogether. This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|Roller {{coasters}} are amusement rides {{developed for}} amusement parks and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first roller coasters, where {{the train was}} attached to a wooden track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s.

5|$|Some of {{the graves}} {{are marked by}} plain {{triangular}} stones set at one end.

This is unusual {{in the north of}} England, though comparable examples have been found in Kent in the south-east.|$|E
