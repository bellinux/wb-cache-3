40|$|Innovation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources of competitive advantage. It helps a company to fuel the growth of new products and services, sustain incumbents, create new markets, transform industries, and promote the global competitiveness of nations. Because of its importance, companies need to manage innovation. It is very important for a company to be able to measure its innovativeness because one cannot effectively manage without measurement. A good measurement model will help a company to understand its current capability and identify areas that need improvement. In this research a systematic approach was developed for a company to measure its innovativeness. The measurement of innovativeness is based on <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> <b>Output</b> <b>indicators</b> are used because they cannot be manipulated. A hierarchical decision model (HDM) was constructed from <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> The hierarchy consisted of three levels: innovativeness index, <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> and sub-factors. Experts 2 ̆ 7 opinions were collected and quantified. A new concept developed by Dr. Dundar Kocaoglu and referred to as 2 ̆ 2 desirability functions 2 ̆ 2 was implemented in this research. Inconsistency of individual experts, disagreement among experts, intraclass correlation coefficients and statistical F-tests were calculated to test the reliability of the experts 2 ̆ 7 judgments. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the sensitivity of the <b>output</b> <b>indicators,</b> which indicated the allowable range of the changes in the <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> in order to maintain the priority of the sub-factors. The outcome of this research is a decision model/framework that provides an innovativeness index based on readily measurable company <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> The model was applied to product innovation in the technology-driven semiconductor industry. Five hypothetical companies were developed to simulate the application of the model/framework. The profiles of the hypothetical companies were varied considerably to provide a deeper understanding of the model/framework. Actual data from two major corporations in the semiconductor industry were then used to demonstrate the application of the model. According to the experts, the top three sub-factors to measure the innovativeness of a company are revenue from new products (28...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to findings in other countries, and surprisingly {{in view of}} the literature, innovation in the Netherlands is not spread geographically according either to relevant labour market characteristics or to localized agglomeration economies. Instead, statistical analysis shows that the Netherlands is an urban field, and that the regional knowledge infrastructure - universities of technology in particular - is the only variable that can offer an explanation of innovative activity throughout the country. By analysing similar relationships for younger firms, we are able to make a quite strong case about causation. We estimate these regional spillovers using the Literature Based Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>indicator</b> by screening two successive volumes of 43 specialist trade journals for product announcements. <b>Output</b> <b>indicators</b> for innovativeness - except for patents, which have well-known disadvantages as an indicator - are not often used in the relevant literature, partly because they are not readily available.

40|$|This report {{presents}} an update of the ICT Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> {{based on the}} latest available data, and provides {{a measure of the}} performance of the European Union (EU) and its Member States in ICT innovation. The ICT Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> is the contribution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to the Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> elaborated by the European Commission in 2013. The contribution of ICT has been computed for each underlying component of the Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> for all EU Member States. Depending on the indicator component analysed and data availability, the ICT contribution to innovation can refer either to innovation in the ICT sector as defined by the classification of economic activities, or to ICT use as a general purpose technology {{in the rest of the}} economy. The up-to-date ICT contributions for the EU aggregate are: 1. 	 28 % in technological innovation as measured by patents; 2. 	 19 % in absorption of skills as measured by employment in knowledge intensive activities; 3. 	 27 % in competitiveness of knowledge goods as measured by exports of medium-high tech goods; 4. 	 20 % in competitiveness of knowledge services as measured by exports of knowledge intensive services; 5. 	 23 % in innovative firms’ dynamics as measured by employment of innovative fast-growing firms. All data refer to 2013 with the exception of data on patents which refer to 2011. The methodology to compute the ICT Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> follows the one presented in "How much does ICT contribute to innovation output? An analysis of the ICT component in the innovation output indicator" (Pesole, 2015). The reader is referred to this report for more detail on the methodology. The 2013 EU aggregate ICT contributions are very similar to those in 2012 reported by Pesole (2015). The technological innovation component (i. e. ICT PCT patent) increased by two percentage points in 2011 (from 26 % to 28 %). Similarly, competitiveness of knowledge goods increased from 25 % to 27 % in 2013. The other contributions remain unchanged. The ICT Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> delivers a measure of output-oriented ICT innovation that captures both the technological and non-technological aspects of innovation in ICT and ranks Member States' performance. The three top performing countries remain the same as in Pesole 2015 : Finland, Ireland and Sweden. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|R

40|$|The article’s aim is {{to conduct}} a {{comparative}} cross-section analysis of the innovative behaviour of the German manufacturing industry. The peculiarities of the food industry are tested in a combined analysis based on both input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Linear and logistic regressions are used to investigate {{the differences between the}} food industry and other branches of the manufacturing industry. In comparison to other branches, the food industry has lower research & development (R&D) expenditures whereas the import of research from more technology intensive sectors is high. Most of the released new products are improvements and imitations. Market novelties are rare. The development time for new products is relatively short compared to other industries, on average 8. 5 months. A major part of innovations are imitated rapidly by competing firms, therefore the first mover advantages are low. Due to the low newness of innovations, marketing activities (e. g. advertising, labelling) are more important for new product introductions than in other industries. The regression analysis for the input indicators measured by the innovation intensity shows that the innovative behaviour of food companies significantly deviates from other manufacturing sectors. However, the logistic regression analysis of the <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> doesn’t confirm these results. The dummy variable of the food companies has no significant impact on the <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Firms in the food industry might embark on imitation and product modification strategies. Therefore, they realize an average innovation output without spending {{the same amount of money}} as the other industries. In addition, it can be confirmed that small enterprises of the German manufacturing industry have a higher innovation activity in terms of both innovation input and output. The impact of business expectations on input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> is significantly positive. An international orientation measured by the ratio of exports to firm sales leads to a higher probability of introducing new products and novelties.

40|$|Patent {{citation}} analysis {{is considered a}} useful tool for identifying emerging technologies. However, the outcomes of previous methods are likely to reveal no more than current key technologies, since they can only be performed at later stages of technology development due to the time required for patents to be cited (or fail to be cited). This study proposes a machine learning approach to identifying emerging technologies at early stages using multiple patent indicators that can be defined immediately after the relevant patents are issued. For this, first, a total of 18 input and 3 <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> are extracted from the United States Patent and Trademark Office database. Second, a feed-forward multilayer neural network is employed to capture the complex nonlinear relationships between input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> in a time period of interest. Finally, two quantitative indicators are developed to identify trends of a technology's emergingness over time. Based on this, we also provide the practical guidelines for implementation of the proposed approach.
