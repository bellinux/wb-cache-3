5|$|In late 2013, a {{plan was}} {{proposed}} for salvage logging approximately 30,000 acres (120km2) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rim</b> Fire. The snag forest habitat of forest-killed trees {{is home to}} a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are management indicator species. Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from salvage logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer. Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly harmed by salvage logging. However, some environmental groups endorsed the salvage logging plan.|$|E
25|$|Paraboloidal reflectors {{that have}} their centres of mass {{coincident}} with their focal points are useful. They {{can be easily}} turned to follow the sun's motions in the sky, rotating about any axis that passes through the focus. Two perpendicular axes can be used, intersecting at the focus, to allow the paraboloid to follow both the sun's daily motion and its seasonal one. The cooking pot stays stationary at the focus. If the paraboloidal reflector is axially symmetrical and is made of material of uniform thickness, its centre of mass coincides with its focus if {{the depth of the}} reflector, measured along its axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> is 1.8478 times its focal length. The radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the reflector is 2.7187 times the focal length. The angular radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> as seen from the focal point, is 72.68 degrees.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the largest}} modern Ferris wheels have cars mounted on the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> with {{electric}} motors to independently rotate each car to keep it upright.

25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> and teeth in the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|E

25|$|The {{central zone}} of Lofn (100120km in diameter) {{corresponds}} to the crater floor, which lies about 0.6km below the surrounding cratered plains. Lofn is a shallow crater as compared to other craters of similar size. This {{is the main reason}} why it is called a flat-floored or anomalous dome crater. Other examples of such craters are Doh and Bran. The hummocky terrain (rim) surrounding the floor consists of randomly distributed massifs as large as 50km and has mottled appearance at some places.

25|$|Utah {{defeated}} Missouri in {{the opening}} round, 45–35, and then defeated Iowa State, 40–31, in the Final Four (back then, only eight teams qualified for the tournament). In the NCAA Championship game, Utah and Dartmouth played one another evenly. The game went into overtime, and Utah prevailed 42–40 for the school's first (and still only) men's national basketball championship. Wilkinson scored seven points in the game, including the game's winning basket in the extra period with five seconds remaining.

Steve Nash fed off his mistakes and scored 10 straight points including the game-tying three-pointer with 3 seconds left to go.

25|$|Evidence of Neolithic {{settlement}} can {{be found}} throughout the county. There are great burial mounds including the portal tombs and dolmens at Owning, Kilmogue-Harristown and Borrismore. There are passage graves at Clomantagh Hill and Knockroe. There were non-megalith single-grave burial tombs, Linkardstown-type Cists, excavated at Jerpoint West. These are late Neolithic and before the single-grave rite of the Bronze Age. A Neolithic house was identified in Granny near Waterford, making it the oldest house in County Kilkenny. The square house consisted of slot-trenches, internal floor surfaces, a hearth and wooden posts at each corner, one of the post-holes was radiocarbon-dated to 3997-3728 BC. A new form of early Neolithic pottery with a lip around the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> were found. This Granny pottery is similar to pottery found in the south-east of England.|$|E

25|$|Coarsely lineated ejecta {{blankets}} from Beethoven and Raphael basins {{dominate the}} southern part of the map area. The crater wall of Beethoven is buried by its ejecta blanket and by plains materials. Although the ejecta blankets from both basins are extensive, they are highly asymmetrical and deeply embayed in places by intercrater plains and younger plains units. These embayment relations, together with the discontinuous and subdued appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> crests and interior walls of the basins, suggest that they are relatively old impact structures. Morphologic appearances may be misleading on Mercury, however, because of the planet’s high temperature and gravity field compared with, for example, those of the Moon. Both of these conditions may promote, particularly on large structures, more rapid isostatic adjustments that would be expressed by subdued topography and the premature “aging” of once-large topographic features. Crater counts, on the other hand, tend to support observed stratigraphic relations.|$|E
25|$|Thornton junior {{season of}} 2013–14 was a {{historic}} one for both {{himself and the}} team.

Thornton's potential game-winning jump shot rattled off the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> as time expired. He was the tournament's high scorer with 59 points in three games and was named to the All-CAA Tournament Team along with teammate Brandon Britt. His 599 total points for the season rank fifth-most in school history and Thornton became just the second W player to be named NABC All-District 10 First Team in back to back seasons. He also became the third W player to be named First Team All-CAA. Thornton ended the season with 1,519 career points, the most in school history for a player through his first three seasons.|$|E
25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim.</b> Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|E
