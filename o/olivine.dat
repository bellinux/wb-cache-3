5|$|This {{classification}} {{is important}} in geochemistry. Minerals such as <b>olivine,</b> (Mg,Fe)SiO4 are classed as ultramafic; <b>olivine</b> is a compound of a very basic oxide, MgO, with an acidic oxide, silica, SiO2.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of <b>olivine</b> within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, <b>olivine</b> has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this <b>olivine</b> is currently uncertain.|$|E
5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} {{quiescence}} followed after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence {{was followed by a}} mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago, but renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali <b>olivine</b> basalts of the mafic capping stage were derived from the fractionation of a clinopyroxene, <b>olivine</b> and oxide assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali <b>olivine</b> basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E
40|$|The bulk {{composition}} and relict minerals of meteoroid ablation spheres from deep sea sediments {{can be related}} to the parental material, and bulk compositions and elemental ratios favor a CI/CM affinity for most spheres. Although largely melted, some deep sea spheres (DSS) have retained rare grains apparently unmodified chemically by ablation heating or seawater alteration. Minor elements in relict <b>olivines</b> for comparison with compositions of <b>olivines</b> in known meteorites were analyzed. All relict <b>olivines</b> are very Mg rich. No terrestrial <b>olivines</b> match the chemical features which reinforces other evidence for an extraterrestrial origin. There is no match with achondritic <b>olivines.</b> Mg rich <b>olivines</b> occur in all types of carbonaceous meteorites, but the minor elements of most DSS <b>olivines</b> do not match with those for Allende (C 3) <b>olivines,</b> and fit poorly with those of Murchison (C 2) <b>olivines.</b> There is a good fit for Fe and Cr with those of the <b>olivines</b> in the unusual Belgica 7904 (C 2) meteorite (3). It seems likely that the relict <b>olivines</b> of at least many deep sea spheres are chemically related to <b>olivines</b> in at least one C 2 meteorite...|$|R
30|$|The {{sizes of}} <b>olivines</b> {{at the left}} edge of this clast are larger {{than those in the}} pure anorthosites (< 0.1  mm across; PA 1 to PA 5). The amoeboid {{aggregate}} of <b>olivines</b> with rounded shapes suggests that this clast may be a coarse-grained granulitic breccia. The textures of granulitic <b>olivines</b> and the mineral mode in this clast are very close to the description of the magnesian anorthosite (MA 1) in Dhofar 489 (Takeda et al. 2006). The mineral compositions of granulitic <b>olivines</b> (Fo 85) are slightly more magnesian than those in MA 1 (Fo 79) are.|$|R
40|$|Summary. :For the {{estimation}} of the properties of calcium-iron <b>olivines</b> in iron-ore sinters, synthetic mixtures of CaO, FeO, and SiO 2 were prepared and melle. 't; the obtained <b>olivines</b> were then examined microscopically and by X-ray powder method. The investigations allowed to state, that {{with the increase of}} the basicity of sinters, the relation of Fe: Ca in <b>olivines</b> decreases, which causes the change of their physical, optical, and rSntgenometric properties. T HE chemical composition and melting temperatures of calcium- iron <b>olivines</b> are presented in the diagrams (CaO-FeO-Si 02 and Fe 2 SiO 4 -CasSi 04) ofN. L. Bowen, J. F. Schairer, and E. Posnjak (1932, 1933). From these diagrams it is apparent hat calcium-iron <b>olivines</b> form solid solutions with limited solubility. The extreme member fayalite Fe 2 SiO 4 has a melting temperature 1205 ~ and the extreme member with the highest amount of calcium contains 42 ~o Fe 2 Si 04 and 59 % CazSiO 4 by weight. Calcium-iron <b>olivines</b> are the chief component of the silicate phase in iron-ore sinters, strongly influencing the reduci-bility and strength of self-fluxing sinters...|$|R

Silicate material was also detected at 16 and 30 AU from the star, with a lack of dust between 6.4 and 16 AU providing evidence that a massive planet may be orbiting in this region. Magnesium-rich <b>olivine</b> has also been detected, strikingly similar to that found in the Solar System comets and different from the <b>olivine</b> found in Solar System asteroids.|$|E

The most common group (P III) shows intimate compositional relations between bulk composition of chondrules and <b>olivines</b> in them. The <b>olivines</b> in magnesian chondrules show wide compositional zoning from magnesian core to ferrous rim, whereas the <b>olivines</b> in ferrous chondrules are relatively homogeneous {{and have the}} same composition of ferrous rim <b>olivines</b> in the magnesian chondrules.

40|$|<b>Olivines</b> {{are a large}} {{isomorphic}} {{series of}} minerals, belonging to silicates group. Regardless of their chemical composition, any of these minerals can be formed both in natural and industrial processes.

The <b>olivines</b> whose formation is tied to rock masses (natural process) and the <b>olivines</b> genetically tied to industrial processes of black metallurgy slags (process metallurgy-Ironmaking) are shown in this paper.

5|$|Spectroscopic {{studies of}} the Junonian surface permit the {{conclusion}} that Juno could be the progenitor of chondrites, a common type of stony meteorite composed of iron-bearing silicates such as <b>olivine</b> and pyroxene.

5|$|The {{composition}} of some lava flows in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is unusual because they include small, angular to rounded fragments of rock called nodules and crystals {{that come from}} the mantle. These green nodules are known as peridotites because they are mostly made of a magnesium iron silicate mineral called <b>olivine.</b> These lava flows also comprise large crystals of <b>olivine,</b> plagioclase, and pyroxene that crystallized deep within the Earth's crust and mantle. The lavas and nodules they contain {{are similar to those}} erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon.

40|$|Lithium {{elemental}} and isotopic compositions of <b>olivines</b> in peridotite xenoliths from Hebi in the North China Craton provide {{direct evidence}} for the highly variable δ(7) Li in Archean lithospheric mantle. The δ(7) Li in the cores of <b>olivines</b> from the Hebi high-Mg# peridotites (Fo > 91) show extreme variation from - 27 to + 21, in marked deviation from the δ(7) Li range of fresh MORB (+ 1. 6 to + 5. 6) although the Li abundances of the <b>olivines</b> are {{within the range of}} normal mantle (1 - 2  ppm). The Li abundances and δ(7) Li characteristics of the Hebi <b>olivines</b> could not have been produced by recent diffusive-driven isotopic fractionation of Li and therefore the δ(7) Li in the cores of these <b>olivines</b> record the isotopic signature of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. Our data demonstrate that abnormal δ(7) Li may be preserved in the ancient lithospheric mantle as observed in our study from the central North China Craton, which suggest that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle has experienced modification of fluid/melt derived from recycled oceanic crust.

40|$|International audienceElastic recoil {{detection}} analysis (ERDA) {{was used}} tomeasure the H contents of 18 synthetic Fo 90 <b>olivines</b> {{that had been}} hydrated to varying degrees in high pressure hydrothermal experiments. The infrared spectra of the <b>olivines</b> have been previously measured in the OH stretching region by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and 16 O 1 H secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements have been made on the same samples. Mapping by ERDA, Rutherford backscattering and particle induced X-ray emission spectroscopies show that the synthetic <b>olivines</b> are homogeneous with respect to major element and H concentrations. Concentrations of H measured by ERDA vary between 270 and 2120 ppm H 2 O. Measurements of OH/Si ratios by secondary ion mass spectroscopy and of total integrated area of OH stretching bands in principal absorption spectra by FTIR show excellent linear relationships to H concentrations determined by ERDA. The ERDA measurements are used to determine an infrared integral molar absorption coefficient of 45, 200 l mol− 1 cm− 2 {{that can be used}} to determine H contents of <b>olivines</b> from high pressure experiments.

5|$|Crystallization of this {{magma ocean}} {{would have created}} a mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and sinking of the minerals <b>olivine,</b> clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.|$|E
40|$|The {{achondrite}} LEW 87051 is a porphyritic basalt {{consisting of}} large subhedral to euhedral zoned <b>olivines</b> in a finer-grained groundmass. The texture of this groundmass looks remarkably like a quenched melt. However, although the rock is clearly igneous, its exact origins and history are under dispute. From petrographic observations, Prinz {{felt that the}} large <b>olivines</b> were xenocrysts and that the zoning reflected interaction with an unrelated, CAI-enriched melt. McKay et al. was able to model the <b>olivines</b> as phenocrysts, whose zoning {{was the result of}} a parent melt that changed in composition as material crystallized, e. g., fractional crystallization in a closed system, and calculated a parent melt composition. Jurewicz and McKay compared the calculated parent melt composition with actual partial melts from CV and CM chondrites. They showed that the calculated melt was substantially different from equilibrium melts of these chondrites; however, the LEW 87051 groundmass composition was similar to some of the low temperature partial melts, although slightly enriched in AN (or depleted in OL) components. This study presents the results of an independent petrologic look at other <b>olivines</b> in LEW 87051 and the preliminary results of a quantitative model for the major zoning in these <b>olivines</b> as diffusive-exchange with an olivine-saturated, low temperature angritic melt...|$|R

5000|$|The tuffs {{are highly}} calcitic, {{vesicular}} and contain numerous microxenoliths. The petrologically similar lavas show {{evidence of a}} differentiation by flow and gravity and have trachytic textures. Lavas have a carbonatitic composition. <b>Olivines</b> with diopside cores are found at the Igwisi Hills. Garnet and orthopyroxene {{is associated with the}} diopside. <b>Olivines</b> are surrounded by chromite. <b>Olivines</b> characterize the texture of the Igwisi rocks, where they form spherical inclusions. The <b>olivines</b> are primarily forsteritic in composition. Inclusions in the kimberlite include skeletal apatite, stellate aragonite and calcite. High concentrations of [...] are found in the rock, which may have resulted in the depolymerization of the melt, increasing its fluidity and resulting in effusive activity. Peridotite xenoliths originate from 180 km of depth. Spinels in the groundmass suggest that crustal contamination was extensive. The geochemistry suggests an origin at high pressures (depths of 150 - 200 km) and equilibrium temperatures of 1000 C. Rainfall has subsequently modified the pyroclastics and formed secondary calcite, while the less permeable lava flows were less modified.|$|R

The model considers Fe-Mg interdiffusion between chondrule and matrix <b>olivines.</b> Zoning profiles comparable to those observed in chondrule <b>olivines</b> from partially equilibrated members of the series are reproduced successfully. Metamorphism of CO 3 chondrites on a parent body is therefore a viable model for the observed equilibration. Results indicate that peak metamorphic temperatures experienced by the CO 3 chondrites were around 500 C, and that the range of peak temperatures between unequilibrated and equilibrated subtypes was relatively narrow, around 100 C...|$|R

The spectra provide a fairly good match to fine grained <b>olivines</b> (0 to 5 micrometer size range). The smoothness of the spectrum beyond 18 micrometers {{is an indication of}} particles smaller than 50 micrometers. While the abrupt rise in emissivity near 8 micrometers matches many silicates, the distinct emissivity minimum centered near 12. 8 micrometers is consistant with iron-poor <b>olivines,</b> but not with phyllosilicates.

Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to compositional data. Holocene eruptions have near-identical composition.

5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing <b>olivine,</b> pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green <b>olivine,</b> black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E

40|$|All {{types of}} {{coarse-grained}} components in CM chondrites {{are surrounded by}} fine-grained dust coatings, but the origin of these rims is not yet clear. Although a strictly nebular origin seems likely for rims in the relatively unaltered type 3 chondrites, the rims in CM chondrites are dominated by secondary alteration phases. It {{has been argued that}} either the coarse-grained cores accreted altered rim materials while still in the nebula or that alteration of primary rim phases occurred on the CM parent body. To constrain the origin of alteration phases in rim material, we have analyzed the textures and mineral associations from 10 CM chondritic falls by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Our results indicate that the secondary phases in CM chondritic rims were produced by parent body fluid-rock interactions which redefined some primary rim textures and may have produced, in some cases, both coarse-grained components and the rims that surround them. Textural features demonstrate the interactive exchange of alteration fluids between rims, matrix, and chondrules on the CM parent body. For example, most matrix-rim contacts are gradational, suggesting the synchronous alteration of both components. Several observations suggest the possibility of in situ rim production. For example, tochilinite and phyllosilicates commonly form rims around matrix carbonates, which are generally believed to have precipitated from alteration fluids on the CM parent body. This suggests that the rims surrounding matrix carbonates may also have been produced by alteration processes. Partially replaced chondrule <b>olivines</b> bear a striking resemblance to many rimmed <b>olivines</b> in the matrix which suggests, by analogy, that site-specific precipitation of S-bearing phases may also be responsible for the occurrence of many tochilinite-rich rims around isolated matrix <b>olivines.</b> Non-silicate rims precipitate around <b>olivines</b> of any composition, but the process is most effective for fayalitic <b>olivines.</b> Most of the remaining <b>olivines</b> in CM chondrites are relatively Mg-rich, which suggests that the precipitation of S-bearing rims on <b>olivines</b> may not have been an important process in the aqueous alteration of CM chondrites. We conclude that: (1) precursor rim materials in CM chondrites were subjected to pervasive aqueous alteration on the CM parent body; and (2) textures and mineral associations observed in CM chondrites also suggest the possibility of in situ rim production...|$|R
