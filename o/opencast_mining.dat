5|$|In the 1770s and 1780s the {{discovery}} of copper at Parys Mountain in Anglesey which could be cheaply extracted by <b>opencast</b> <b>mining</b> led to a crash in the copper price, and expensive deep mining began to become unviable. As the copper boom came to an end, the mines began to close. In 1788 mining ceased at Dolcoath itself, although some bal maidens continued to be employed picking through the large quantities of ore which had already {{been brought to the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|Llanelli, Ammanford and {{the upper}} parts of the Gwendraeth Valley are {{situated}} on the South Wales Coalfield. The <b>opencast</b> <b>mining</b> activities in this region have now ceased but the old mining settlements with terraced housing remain, often centred on their nonconformist chapels. Kidwelly had a tin-plating industry in the eighteenth century, with Llanelli following not long after, {{so that by the}} end of the nineteenth century, Llanelli was the world-centre of the industry. There is little trace of these industrial activities today. Llanelli and Burry Port served at one time for the export of coal, but trade declined, as it did from the ports of Kidwelly and Carmarthen as their estuaries silted up. Country towns in the more agricultural part of the county still hold regular markets where livestock is traded.|$|E

Reserve {{inspection}} is {{of great}} significance for rational mining and environmental protection of <b>opencast</b> <b>mine.</b> This paper proposes a method for rapid reserve inspection of <b>opencast</b> <b>mine.</b> The method uses ordinary digital camera which is calibrated rigorously to acquire images of <b>opencast</b> <b>mine,</b> and carries {{out a series of}} image processing steps including distortion correction, relative orientation, absolute orientation and stereo matching, thus generating the point cloud and reconstructing the three-dimensional mine model. According to the earlier topographic and design data, the variations of mine surface, volume and reserve are thereby calculated. The practical application of the method proposed has achieved great improvement in efficiency and accuracy for <b>opencast</b> <b>mine</b> reserve inspection...|$|R
40|$|The {{designed}} {{tracking and}} monitoring system for <b>opencast</b> <b>mines</b> allows continuous tracking and monitoring vehicles and movable equipment in many <b>opencast</b> <b>mines</b> using Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver[1, 2, 3], General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) [4] unit, microcontroller along with ZigBee (programmable {{to operate as}} routers,end devices, and coordinators by hardware specific embedded software) [5] shapes a dynamic remote system among them and other static and portable ZigBee gadgets set at key areas. Utilization of the framework would help in keeping up computerized record and investigating the execution of unreasonable scoops and dumpers sent in <b>opencast</b> <b>mines.</b> This would help in advancing the position of dumpers with every scoop relying upon the adjustment in living up to expectations and dumping spots. This would likewise help in keeping up automated participation of dumper administrators and other work force working in an <b>opencast</b> <b>mine.</b> This would further help in giving cautioning to the sign man and dumper administrator, while dumper drawing nearer close vicinity to the sign man. This would help in building two-way message correspondence among the work force occupied with an <b>opencast</b> <b>mine.</b> This would at last help in enhancing generation, efficiency and well-being in <b>opencast</b> <b>mine...</b>|$|R
25|$|Such methods {{could be}} very {{effective}} in <b>opencast</b> <b>mining,</b> but fire-setting was very dangerous when used in underground workings. They were made redundant {{with the introduction of}} explosives, although hydraulic mining is still used on alluvial tin ores. They were also used to produce a controlled supply to wash the crushed ore. It is highly likely that they also developed water-powered stamp mills to crush hard ore, which could be washed to collect the heavy gold dust.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{restoring}} the canal was first developed in 1975, {{as a result}} of legislation requiring planning authorities to produce county structure plans. The West Midlands structure plan included the concept of the restored canal as a linear park, and included a bypass to avoid the section destroyed by <b>opencast</b> <b>mining.</b> Further threats to the route from the proposed Birmingham Northern Relief Road {{led to the formation of}} the Ogley and Hatherton Restoration Society in 1989, after the Inland Waterways Association held a rally at Pelsall to highlight the plight of the canal. The Society later became the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust, while the relief road became the M6 Toll motorway.|$|E
25|$|Most coal seams are {{too deep}} {{underground}} for <b>opencast</b> <b>mining</b> and require underground mining, {{a method that}} currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production. In deep mining, the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines {{have been developed to}} a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or retreat mining, is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.|$|E

50|$|In 1900, when Bengal Nagpur Railway was {{building}} a bridge across the Ib River, coal was accidentally discovered. The first coalmine in the Ib Valley Coalfield was established by Himgir Rampur Coal Company in 1909. Other underground collieries were opened by private operators till nationalization of the coal industry in 1973, when it was placed under Western Coalfields Limited. In 1986, it came under South Eastern Coalfields Limited and in 1992 under Mahanadi Coalfields Limited. With nationalization came the age of open cast mines. Ib Valley Coalfield operates three major open cast <b>mines</b> - Lajkura <b>Opencast</b> <b>Mine,</b> Samleswari <b>Opencast</b> <b>Mine</b> and Lilari <b>Opencast</b> <b>Mine.</b> Production of the field has risen sharply from 0.55 million tonnes in 1972-73 to 15.51 million tonnes in 2002-2003.|$|R

25|$|The Cannock Extension was a late addition, being {{authorised}} by an Act of Parliament in 1854, for {{the construction}} of a branch between Pelsall and the coal mining area of Hednesford, near Cannock. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal built a flight of 13 locks to connect the new branch to their Hatherton Branch at Churchbridge, which were opened in 1860, and the Cannock branch reached Hednesford basin by 1863. Heavy coal traffic used the branch for its entire life, although the mines affected the canal. In July 1960, subsidence caused by mining resulted in the canal bed dropping by 21ft (6.4m), and although the banks were rebuilt, the canal to the north of the A5 road was abandoned three years later. The Churchbridge connection had been abandoned in 1955, as traffic had ceased on the Hatherton Branch in 1949, again following subsidence. Most of the route north of the A5 has since been destroyed, some of it as a result of <b>opencast</b> <b>mining.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although {{coal mining}} {{was one of}} the main reasons for the success of the navigation, it has also brought problems, caused by subsidence. In March 1988, the bank near Lemonroyd lock {{collapsed}} into St Aidan's opencast mine, which then flooded. A significant factor was the presence of excavations below the opencast workings where lower coal seams had previously been mined. The failure resulted in some [...] of material, including the banks of the river and the canal, slipping into the workings, which then flooded to a depth of , creating a lake which covered [...] An act of Parliament was obtained to allow [...] of new waterway to be constructed.

There is a mix of privately owned and local authority housing and a blend of social groups. Nowadays the local coal mines have closed, and after extensive <b>opencast</b> <b>mining</b> in recent years the land has reverted to its former agricultural state.

2500|$|Roman {{techniques}} were {{not limited to}} surface mining. They followed the ore veins underground once <b>opencast</b> <b>mining</b> was no longer feasible. At Dolaucothi they stoped out the veins and drove adits through bare rock to drain the stopes. The same adits were also used to ventilate the workings, especially important when fire-setting was used. At {{other parts of the}} site, they penetrated the water table and dewatered the mines using several kinds of machines, especially reverse overshot water-wheels. These were used extensively in the copper mines at Rio Tinto in Spain, where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs, and lifting water about [...] They were worked as treadmills with miners standing on the top slats.
