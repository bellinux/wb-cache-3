5|$|Cyclone Dovi {{developed}} <b>on</b> <b>February</b> 5 {{from an area}} {{of circulation}} within the SPCZ near the northern Cook Islands. Dovi therefore saw favourable conditions throughout much of its existence. Due to a mid–level ridge to the east, the cyclone progressed on a southward track. Dovi eventually steered to the southwest, and continued to intensify steadily after fluctuating due to diurnal temperature variations, becoming a Category1 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale <b>on</b> <b>February</b> 8. An anticyclone positioned {{to the west of}} the system moved closer to Dovi, providing an improved environment. After developing an eye later that day, Dovi attained its maximum wind speeds of 205km/h (125mph) sustained over 10minutes. The cyclone then again steered towards the south, encountering high wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. As a result, Dovi quickly weakened as its convection was displaced. While its outflow in its western and southern quadrants remained favorable, elsewhere outflow was deteriorating. <b>On</b> <b>February</b> 10, Dovi's minimum barometric pressure was 980mbar (28.94inHg) as it moved south-southeast at 11km/h (7mph). The weakening Dovi became an extratropical cyclone <b>on</b> <b>February</b> 11. The remnants continued drifting southwest; the Meteorological Service of New Zealand in Wellington stopped issuing information on it <b>on</b> <b>February</b> 13.|$|E
