25|$|In 2002, the British artist Rod Dickinson created The Milgram Re-enactment, {{an exact}} {{reconstruction}} {{of parts of}} the original experiment, including the uniforms, lighting, and rooms used.

[...] Separate room: [...] {{the most}} strict {{separation}} has {{women in a}} separate room from the men, able to view through <b>one-way</b> <b>glass,</b> an open <b>window</b> from a balcony, or not view at all. [...] Examples of this are the Yeshiva of Ohr Someach {{in the neighborhood of}} Maalot Dafna in Jerusalem, where the men sit in a first floor room with a two story ceiling, and the women are on the second floor with a window overlooking the men's prayer hall. [...] A similar design (men first floor, women second floor) is in 770 Eastern Parkway, the main synagogue for the Chabad Lubavitch movement in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and the Main Belzer Shul in Jerusalem.|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} three decades, Lynne Cohen has photographed unpeopled, semi-public {{institutional}} and corporate interiors. These haunting, foreboding pictures are frequently discussed for their subject matter: the rooms and what they contain are seen as anthropomorphic, with chairs conversing and plants crouching sedately in their plastic pots. The <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> of the <b>windows</b> in laboratories is exposed for its surveillance purposes, while the dummies and targets in factories and police ranges are named as surrogates {{for the people that}} are not to be found in these photographs. The works are measured against art movements of the past: Dada, Surrealism, Modernism, Pop and Minimal art. The shifts in the types of places that Cohen photographs have been noted, from living rooms up to military installations. What has been infrequently discussed is how the photographs have changed stylistically. In this thesis, Cohen's images are discussed in terms of their scale, the way that the objects and surfaces change within the prints, her unique framing, and her use of colour film within the past decade...|$|R
5000|$|The synagogue {{building}} is modeled after a Polish Hasidic shtiebel. The front doors are {{replicas of the}} doors fronting the Rema synagogue in Kraków. A huge mural depicting the Warsaw Ghetto appears inside the entrance. Israeli artist Ofra Friedland was commissioned to produce [...] "murals, ceramics, paintings, bronze sculpture, stained <b>glass</b> <b>windows,</b> woodwork and stone artwork" [...] throughout the synagogue. In the main sanctuary, the 6 ft high mechitza separating the men's and women's sections contains <b>one-way</b> <b>glass</b> so that women can observe the proceedings.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} about the {{developing}} parameters and relationships for selecting a proper <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> applied with film as building envelopes for buildings located in a hot climate based on its thermal performances. Thermal comfort of the occupants sitting near the <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> is the thermal performance {{that needed to be}} considered besides the heat transmission in selecting a proper type of glass to use as a <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> for the building. The predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) is chosen as a thermal comfort index. 45 types of film and 1280 <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> with film are investigated in this study. It can be shown that the thermal comfort index is dependent on the optical properties (total transmittance and total absorptance) and the overall heat transfer coefficient of <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> with film. <b>Glass</b> <b>window</b> with film which has high transmittance shall have more discomfort due to solar radiation effect. <b>Glass</b> <b>window</b> with film which has high absorptance shall have more discomfort due to surface temperature effect. The discomfort from the surface temperature effect for double pane <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> with film is also dependent on the glass thickness other than the absorptance and the change in overall heat transfer coefficient. Expressions for predicting the performance of the <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> with film in terms of thermal comfort are developed...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> in {{terrorist}} bombing attacks and accidental explosion incidents {{has been cited}} {{as one of the}} major causes to the vast casualties. Many studies have been carried out to investigate the response and vulnerability of <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> against blast loadings. These include laboratory and field tests that have been carried out to experimentally study <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> performance under explosion scenarios and development of analytical and numerical models to analyze and predict <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> responses. This article reviews literatures on the studies of the response of <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> systems to blast loadings. Over 100 papers and documents that are available in the open literature are reviewed. The background and history of the studies on the topic are also briefed. Understandings about the dynamic material properties of glass and available material models are summarized. Popularly used analysis methods and design standards for monolithic and laminated <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> are outlined, and their accuracies are discussed. Recent studies including analytical solution, numerical simulation, and experimental investigations on <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> systems are summarized. Mitigation measures for blast-resistant windows are also briefly discussed...|$|R

25|$|A {{revival of}} the art and craft of stained <b>glass</b> <b>window</b> {{manufacture}} took place in early 19th-century Britain, beginning with an armorial window created by Thomas Willement in 1811–12.
