500|$|Clark {{met with}} a group of wealthy New York Democrats {{including}} Alan Patricof to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of Al Gore in 2000, {{met with a}}ll the Democratic candidates but supported Clark in 2004. Clark said that he voted for Al Gore and Ronald Reagan, held equal esteem for Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman, and was a registered independent voter throughout his military career. Clark stated that he decided he was a Democrat because [...] "I was pro-affirmative action, I was pro-choice, I was pro-education... I'm pro-health care... I realized I was either going to be the loneliest Republican in America <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be a happy Democrat." [...] Clark said he liked the Democratic party, which he saw as standing for [...] "internationalism", [...] "ordinary men and women", and [...] "fair play." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 28 April 1789, Bounty lay about [...] south of the island of Tofua. After a largely sleepless night, Christian had decided to act. He {{understood}} from his discussions with Young and Stewart which crewmen were his most likely supporters and, after approaching Quintal and Isaac Martin, he learned the names of several more. With the help of these men, Christian rapidly gained control of the upper deck; those who questioned his actions were ordered to keep quiet. At about 05:15, Christian went below, dismissed Hallett (who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship's muskets), and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh's cabin. Three men took hold of the captain and tied his hands, threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm; Bligh [...] "called as loudly as [...] could in hopes of assistance". The commotion woke Fryer, who saw, from his cabin opposite, the mutineers frogmarching Bligh away. The mutineers ordered Fryer to [...] "lay down again, and hold my tongue <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a dead man".|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E

Their final appearance was in October 1976 (by this time Trace and Gillespie had already left, reducing Ruby Flipper to five members), with the senior management insisting on a replacement all-female grouping. Flick Colby recalled of this time [...] "Bill Cotton called me in and said the British public didn’t want to see black men dancing with white women...I argued, but he told me to form another all-girl group <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wainwright became {{addicted}} to crystal meth {{in the early}} 2000s and temporarily lost his vision. His addiction reached its peak in 2002, during {{what he described as}} [...] "the most surreal week of my life." [...] During that week, he played a cameo role in the UK comedy television program Absolutely Fabulous, spent several nights partying with George W. Bush's daughter Barbara, enjoyed a [...] "debauched evening" [...] with his mother and Marianne Faithfull, sang with Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons for Zaldy's spring 2003 collection, and experienced recurring hallucinations of his father throughout. He decided after that he [...] "was either going to rehab <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to live with my father. I knew I needed an asshole to yell at me, and I felt he fit the bill." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hall {{was offered}} the {{starring}} role in the 1987 film Full Metal Jacket {{in a conversation with}} Stanley Kubrick, but after an eight-month negotiation, a financial agreement could not be reached. [...] "It was a difficult decision, because in that eight-month period, I read everything I could about the guy, and I was really fascinated by him," [...] Hall said when asked about the film. [...] "I {{wanted to be a part}} of that film, but it didn't work out. But all sorts of stories circulated, like I got on set and I was fired, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> pissed at him for shooting too long. It's all not true." [...] He was replaced with Matthew Modine. His next film would be 1988's Johnny Be Good, in which he worked with Uma Thurman and fellow Saturday Night Live cast member Robert Downey, Jr. The film was a critical failure, and some critics panned Hall's performance as a high school football star, claiming that he, the movies' reigning geek, was miscast for the role. A review for The Washington Post claimed that the film was [...] "crass, vulgar, and relentlessly brain-dead." ...|$|E

60|$|All that golden {{summer on}} the {{threshold}} of my manhood was filled by Mary. I loved her with the love of a boy and a man.

60|$|After {{the long}} march by General Sheridan's cavalry over winter roads, it was {{necessary}} to rest and refit at White House.

On the 24th of March, General Sheridan moved from White House, crossed the James River at Jones's Landing, and formed a junction with the Army of the Potomac in front of Petersburg on the 27th. During this move, General Ord sent forces to cover the crossings of the Chickahominy.|$|E
