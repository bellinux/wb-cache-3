Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public.

Mason died from the condition on 9 October, and another 13 men were too ill to leave their bunks. When Rio was finally sighted on 13 October the crew were too sick to bring the ship to port. She drifted helplessly in the outer harbor until Rio's harbourmaster sighted her the following morning and had additional seamen rowed out to assist. Twelve of Prince of Wales sickest crew members were hospitalised in Rio while the remainder recovered on board.|$|E

25|$|Fish was {{of great}} {{importance}} to most of Scandinavia, and particularly so was the herring fishing in the Limfjord and Oresund. The great shoals of herring migrating from the Atlantic into the Baltic to feed were funnelled through certain narrow points and were caught in huge numbers. The amount of fish caught {{was more than enough}} to feed the local population and allowed for huge exports of smoked, and especially salted, fish. Great herring markets were organized in southern Scandinavia, most notably at Skanör in Scania, which was in the Middle Ages part of Denmark. From this market alone, merchant vessels of the Hanseatic League, the powerful medieval confederation of northern German cities, exported upwards of over 100,000 barrels <b>of</b> <b>salted</b> herring during many decades of the Late Middle Ages. Of equal, or even greater importance was cod, often fished on the North Sea and Atlantic, dried to make stockfish, and imported as an important staple, particularly during fast and Lent. Many freshwater fish were also of great dietary or economic importance, such as salmon, eel, pike and bream.|$|E

Though some measurements <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations are available near roads, the link between road maintenance salting activities and observed concentrations <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> in ambient air is yet to be quantified.

The model is capable of reproducing many <b>of</b> the <b>salt</b> emission episodes, both in time and intensity, but also fails on other occasions. The observed mean concentration <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> in PM 10, over all ten datasets, is 4. 2  μg/m 3 and the modelled mean is 2. 8  μg/m 3, giving a fractional bias of − 0. 38.
